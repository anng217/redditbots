&amp;nbsp;

Turns out, this conventional assumption was based on a faulty scientific study which is debunked in this article:

&amp;nbsp;

When Are Women Most Likely to Be Promiscuous?

&amp;nbsp;

Contrary to popular belief, it is unlikely that women are hardwired for Monogamy. In fact, in most primate species the females are opportunistic and will mate with many males to secure additional resources and purposefully confuse paternity.

&amp;nbsp;

Since the females are not naturally monogamous, the males must constantly physically mate guard the females to prohibit them from having sex with rival males. The females are as monogamous as the males can force them to be.

&amp;nbsp;

This is important to remember because:

&amp;nbsp;

**All Males are Hardwired to Mate - Guard.**

&amp;nbsp;

In a few primate species, such as Chimpanzees, the males have resorted to abusive tactics such as rape and assault to intimidate the females into remaining monogamous.

&amp;nbsp;

This is very similar to humans.

&amp;nbsp;

Pervasive Patriarchy &amp; Misogyny lessens the burden of male mate competition. Why? Because it’s easier to bully a woman into submission and cripple her ability to be independent of men in society than it is to fight off competing males.

&amp;nbsp;

**Enforcing Monogamy and dependence in females lessens infighting between males and increases infighting between females.**

&amp;nbsp;

Instead of males competing for access to females, the females must compete to secure resources from a singular valuable male. In actuality, it would be more advantageous for women to secure many resources from the many available males. This role reversal allows Men to have the advantage and energy to pursue other females while still maintaining ownership of single female.

&amp;nbsp;

It is also why the concept of “gold diggers” and “hoes” is so demonized in society. It thwarts male control over the natural opportunistic female mating patterns.

&amp;nbsp;

Even so, hoes and goldiggers are often successful in securing their desired partners. This is because hoes and gold diggers are great at seizing opportunities and triggering the male mate guarding instinct.

&amp;nbsp;

How can women use this to their advantage in the dating?

&amp;nbsp;

**You must, at all times, trigger the male mate-guarding instinct.**

1. **Keep your options open, always.** Instead of women desperately pursuing a relationship with a single male, you maintain several which are beneficial to you in different ways. Although, at this stage, you shouldn’t allow sexual access.

2. **Go on dates where you’re likely to encounter a lot of male mate competion.** Sporting events are at the top of the list, but this can be any event or activity where men are likely to be “peacocking” for females and posturing for other men.

3. **Sexual Access is reserved for the male or males who have demonstrated good character and significant investment.** There is no need to abide by an artificial 90 day timeline. You withhold sexual access until you can safely assure the encounter will be to your tangible benefit.

4. **Monogamy is for marriage.** Unless a man expresses an explicit desire for marriage, with a timeline in mind, you should not be monogamous. Again, monogamy benefits men, not women.

&amp;nbsp;

You’ll know you’re successfully triggering the mate-guarding instinct if the man or men begin to demonstrate “sequestering” behavior. They will physically try to block out other males from talking to you, continuously try to pull you off to the side, or be constantly communicating to maintain your interest.",3806,"GIRL GAME PT. 1: Males, Monogamy, and Mate-Guarding.",0,2019-09-12 05:48:30,,

Ladies, please, can someone explain this logic to me: guys who don't offer to pay for the date is a red flag?

(I'm trying to encourage food for thought, please do not feel attacked by  my essay below, thanks)

Let me try and explain my position on this issue, and maybe this will shed light on why no self-respecting man should ever pay for his date on the first date.

So, I date women. And weirdly enough, a LOT of women also use this attitude on me, even though I'm also a woman! But here is why a woman asking me to pay for her meal is ACTUALLY a red flag.

1) I don't know you.

It's the first date, and I probably either met you via work, online, friend of a friend. Chances are, you are new to me so I would not have had time to vet you as a person before the date. In fact, I am using the date, and any subsequent ones, to get to know you.

So, if I'm on a date with a girl who is a stranger... why am I paying for her? How do I know she is serious about me?

Better yet, how can I differentiate, on the first date, between a girl who is serious about me, and one who is using me for free food? Especially if she's asking me to pay?

2) I don't owe you anything because I don't know you.

If a girl asks me to pay for her meal, I legitimately lose all interest. And please ladies, I'm not saying this to be a dick. I've had girls ask me to buy them cars, dresses, food, drinks, free shit all the time. It makes me feel like a cash cow.

If you have no interest in me beyond what I can give you, why would I invest in you? What do I get for the exchange?

By this I mean, if I pay for the first date... what do I get in return? Her company? What if her company sucks? Sex? What if the sex sucks? How will I know this, on the first date?

3) If you offer to pay for your meal or your drinks, you immediately are more attractive to me than the girl who asks me to pay for everything.

Why? Because the first girl will not be a liability to me. Let me explain. It's human nature to want more. So first date, she expects me to pay for the date. Second date she expects me to pay for something else, and it will continually escalate until a woman expects me to fund her entire lifestyle. I wish i was joking, I've literally had girls ask me to buy them a car.

But a girl who offers to pay her own way is saying, ""Okay I am reasonable in my expectations on you, especially on the first date. I don't expect you to fund a stranger"".

I hope that explanation makes sense, I don't think I wrote it properly.

4) Girls who ask me to buy everything usually have not much to offer me.

Why? Well let's reverse the roles. Ladies, would you be interested in a man that expects/needs you to buy him everything? No? Then why would a guy be interested in a woman who needs him to pay for everything? What does she have to offer me, if I'm the one paying for everything? 

If she has nothing to offer.... why would I pay for her on the first date? Or any date for that matter?

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this post sheds light on the issue as to why men should NOT pay for a woman on a date, but there is a middle way... Pay for your own way, and when he trusts you... see if he's willing to pay for you. If not, then fine, feel free to dump him. But not offering to pay for you, is not a red flag in and of itself, for the reasons I mentioned above.",3676,The Free Food Dilemma,0,2019-09-11 18:34:29,,

2. Women do not orgasms at the rate and frequency of men. The rewards of sex for women are usually a lot lower than for men, who orgasm most times they have sex.

3. Social consequences are higher for women due to sexism. It’s not fair - but it’s true. If things go south - You’ll be looked At badly and take most of the blame.

This sub is in unanimous agreement that as women, we should never EVER have to pay on a date, and we should let the man take on that role. I've been dating for 4-5 years now pretty consistently, and I've had plenty of free meals and drinks since then. 

# Choose the Right Target

I'm a Becky (6-7) in my early-20s and I can get guys my age (25-28) who are my looksmatch to buy me free drinks and meals pretty consistently on dates at mid-high-end places. If I want to experience fine dining (a bill that costs like $200+), I date older men (30+) because they can afford it. I can pretty much get free meals every day if I wanted to and if I schedule correctly. 

You need to choose men who have a good white collar jobs or they have their own business. I typically date men in the tech or finance field. They have the income to spend money on a date compared to a man who doesn't make much. 

# Be High Value

A key part to making this work is to look as good as you can. I wear a dress to all of my dates, heels, and I put on makeup. I rarely wear pants unless we do a physical activity. You need to emphasize the difference between you and your date: that you are a woman and he is a man. Wear earrings and put on a sexy perfume! 

Be a good listener and a good conversationalist. Be interested in them as a person, ask questions, speak softly and in a girly voice, laugh softly, and don't interrupt them. You need to be fun to be around with so that they think that they won't ever think of making you pay the bill because they had a bad time. Even if you feel like the connection isn't there, still be nice to them and treat them well. 

# What If He Still Asks You to Pay?

The question remains though: how do you avoid paying if the man you're going out with asks you to split the bill? If you ever hear this from a man, I don't care how many dates you've been on, if it's the first or fifth date, simply tell him that  you'll take care of the bill the next time you go out since you prefer taking turns since that's more romantic. Don't appear bitter. Smile as you say this and act feminine! Be sweet, confident, and show him that you desire him nonverbally. 99% of men won't insist that you pay the bill during that time. 

Of course, there won't be another date. Delete him from the dating app and block his number. You don't need to say anything more to them. Don't feel guilty about blocking a cheap man. Just remember that men don't feel guilty about using women and playing with their emotions. It's only fair that we reserve the right to block cheap men who won't add value to our lives. 

# Don't Be Deceived by His Looks. He Should Still Pay.

It's easy to be confident in making a man who's below your league to pay for the bill every time you go out. But if you encounter a man who you find sexy and hot, you might be tempted to split the bill because you don't want to lose him or because you think that you're privileged to date such a hot guy. Stop. You might just have low self-esteem and you think that the guy is above your league when he IS in your league and you're attractive too. (This is the case with me since I grew up as a plain Jane.) AND even if he's above your league, you still don't pay, comprende? You follow the advice I've give to you. He's a man and it's his role to be a provider. You have no business dating a man who dares to ask you to split the bill -- I don't care how hot he is or how good he makes you feel. Women need to date men who add something to their lives.

Empowering sexual choices are not all about dancing for the male gaze. 

&amp;nbsp;

Non-performative sexual empowerment:

&amp;nbsp;

1. This is how I wanted to be pleased
2. This is how I got it
3. This is the manner in which my choice and my body was honored and respected 
4. This is how I evaluated potential partners and rejected anything subpar
5. This is how I turned down sexual activities that I was not interested in
6. This is how I nurture my body for my own health and benefit
7. This is how I created and took ownership of my own sexual narrative 
8. This is how I created and/or demanded a safe and comfortable environment for myself to freely and fully express my sexuality 
9. This is how I set and enforced sexual boundaries with others
10. This is how I pursued and received justice against anyone who did not honor my sexual boundaries. 
11. This is how I found and maintained relationships to my personal sexual benefit

“This is how men could be treating you, be grateful it’s only as bad as it is now.”

And that’s actually an attribute of abusers, I believe I read somewhere. To compare you to someone being treated worse and tell you you should be grateful you have it so good. It convinces the victim they should be silent in the face of their abuse.

It’s literally an abuse tactic. 

Every time someone says something like, “You […] have never experienced oppression, and pray you never do, because this is what it looks like.” What they are saying is, “shut up, we could treat you worse if we wanted to.”",2842,"Every time someone, usually a guy, complains about feminists not experiencing oppression, I can’t help but see what they are really trying to say.",0,2019-09-06 13:53:55,,

The idea is dating sucks mostly because people aren’t honest with themselves or others and have inflated egos. So I sought out to fix this. I wanted an app meant primarily for those actually serious about relation. Here’s the concept

The app has two sections, one for hookups, the other for relationships. If you are in the hookup section, there shall be no talks about not knowing what you want or looking for a friend, or you’ll be banned for 3 months to permanently from the section. I’m looking at you girls. When your in the relationship section, there shall be no overly explicit talk of hookups, I’m looking at you men. 

Each season is the equivalent of a full calendar year or 7 episodes. An episode is the equivalent of 30-50 days depending on if and when you get eliminated. You have to pick one section per episode (50 days). 

You get 5 matches at the start of an episode. You eliminate one match every Wednesday, try to set up dates for the weekend, and review your matches and dates before moving on towards the next elimination round. Your match can also eliminate you from their pool of people so theoretically it forces people to try harder because there’s competition and because your limited in choice you don’t feel overwhelmed. The selling point is, if you commit fully to the app, you should have a real relationship or at least genuine connection with someone by episode 3. You save time, you get quality people. That’s the gist. 



This is the long version.

This will probably be removed by the moderators as I am a male and that is fine; no ill will! I just had a recent interaction that could be interpreted as flirtatious and wanted some of your opinions on it after reading a few posts.

I made a deposit to the bank for my company today. Walked in, there was an attractive woman in a loan office behind a glass partition. We made eye contact and she stepped around the partition to ask me how I was doing today, despite me just walking through to another department. I smiled, returned her greeting and went about my way completing the deposit. I was walking out and passed her, smiled, made eye contact and told her to have a good day. My intention was to show interest, but not linger or impose on her for anything. Just did it for, well... fun. What are some of your thoughts on this?

Thank You!",2488,Interested in your opinion on a recent interaction,0,2019-09-05 00:26:31,,

If you’re not feeling it, stop the encounter,, excuse yourself to the bathroom, put your clothes on and put him out. If he doesn’t want to leave, then put your phone on and start recording while repeating he needs to go. If he refuses, call the police.

You're the problem because you're the one thats acting like a teenager that doesn't know how relationships work. 'All' the men that you attract are that way because you won't attract the sane ones, because they will take one quick look at you and realize they don't want to mess with that, and then that leaves you with the ones that are incapable of understanding shit, but that's a perfect fit because so are you.

Use this as help in actually changing for the better and not being toxic in your next relationships, not all men are entitled, not all of them are out to just ruin your fucking lives because a sane person doesn't do that. Stop attracting idiots, go out be social and normal, when a relationship matures you start changing to help out your partner, express your emotions and concerns, work out your problems together, and not just butt heads in a futile attempt at getting a relationship that is as toxic as hydrogen sulfide. Use your head, use your emotional intelligence, that's the one intelligence you can actually work on and improve.

My boyfriend can only climax when he has sex (or so I’ve been told; We haven’t had sex yet). I have never been able to make him finish by hand jobs nor oral. He gets soft extremely quickly, and seems to be only able to hold an erection for 20-30 second stints. I’ll start going down on him, and he’ll say we need to make out for a few minutes and then try again because as soon as I start, he’s already getting soft. 

He has told me this has been a problem in all his past relationships and he’ll just jack off. We can’t have sex until I get on birth control in a couple months and I’m starting to feel horrible about the fact that I can’t make him cum. I don’t know if it’s because he’s not attracted to me or has ED or only likes sex. How do I bring this up or ask about it? I’m honestly not sure how much longer this can go on because it honestly just makes me feel like shit.

A while back I wrote a book report on ""The Sociopath Next Door"" by Martha Stout and it's applications for FDS. Due to the recent influx of newbies, I thought this message was worth repeating, because I am seeing a lot of advice-seeking posts that could be solved by this information.

I highly recommend reading the book in its entirety, but for the sake of this post I'll include the key takeaways:

**1. ""If you find yourself often pitying someone who consistently hurts you or other people, and who actively campaigns for your sympathy, the chances are close to 100 percent that you are dealing with a sociopath.""**


**2. Sociopaths have no regard whatsoever for the social contract, but they do know how to use it to their advantage. And all in all, I am sure that if the devil existed, he would want us to feel very sorry for him.""**


**3. ""If all you had ever felt toward another person were the cold wish to “win,” how would you understand the meaning of love, of friendship, of caring? You would not understand. You would simply go on dominating, and denying, and feeling superior. Perhaps you would experience a little emptiness sometimes, a remote sense of dissatisfaction, but that is all.""**


**4. ""A part of a healthy conscience is being able to confront consciencelessness. When you teach your daughter, explicitly or by passive rejection, that she must ignore her outrage, that she must be kind and accepting to the point of not defending herself or other people, that she must not rock the boat for any reason, you are NOT strengthening her prosocial sense, you are damaging it--and the first person she will stop protecting is herself.""**


**5. ""We raise our children, especially girls, to ignore their spontaneious reactions-we teach them not to rock the societal boat...By the time she is thirty, the valient little girl's ""Ick!""-her tendency to respond, to rock the boat, when someone's actions are really mean, may have been excised from her behavior, and perhaps from her very mind.""**

**6. ""In northwest Alaska, ""kunlangeta"" might be applied to a man who, for example, repeatedly lies and cheats and steals things and does not go hunting, and, when the other men are out of the village, takes sexual advantage of many women."" The Inuits tacitly assume that kunlangeta is irremediable. And so, according to Murphy, the traditional Inuit approach to such a man was to insist he go hunting, and then, in the absence of witnesses, push him off the edge of the ice.""**

So, how does this apply to FDS?

Let's say you're talking to a fuckboy who is constantly trying to paint himself as a poor, innocent victim. Probably a sociopath. 

Incels who whine that women deserve to be sexually enslaved because their crush rejected him in middle school? Sociopaths.

Married men who attempt to justify cheating on their pregnant wife because she got fat and he has neeeeeds and life is soooo hard? Fucking sociopaths.

#So, what is a sociopath?

Sociopaths are incapable of feeling empathy. They do not have a conscience or any desire or ability to ""do the right thing"". But, they WILL manipulate and abuse other people's ability to feel empathy. They are irredeemable, dangerous, and do not deserve your sympathy.

In fact, sociopaths specifically seek out conscientious people. People who have honor, and follow through on their promises no matter what, and always try to be fair to ""both sides"", and try to empathize with the other person's perspective, are PRIME TARGETS for sociopaths.

Male sociopaths are especially empowered by patriarchy. Men and boys are generally permitted to be more selfish, and are punished far less than women for ruthlessly pursuing their own interests.

In contrast, women and girls are raised to be especially conscientious. From the moment we leave the womb we are declawed. We are conditioned to have no boundaries, to prioritize their needs above our own, to venerate men, to always give them the benefit of the doubt, to be mindful of sheltering their fragile egoes, and to perform endless emotional labor for men. Worse still, we are often shamed, blamed, and punished if we take any measures to protect ourselves from predatory men.

In other words, male sociopaths have been gifted an entire population of women who have been trained from birth to be prime targets. Male sociopaths have  virtually limitless power to exploit, control, dominate, and abuse women.

And no, this is not limited to the ""Chads"" or ""alphas"" of the world. This book also explores a different kind of sociopath, one who knows he doesn't have the talent or intellect to achieve the vast amounts of power he fantasizes about. Even ""beta"" males can be sociopaths, but instead of becoming a billionaire or CEO or politician, he coasts through life relying on other people's (mostly women's) empathy and conscientiousness, and because he himself feels no empathy, his conscience does not make him feel bad for being a freeloader. 

**Low value men who start families are basically given the right to rule over a micronation like a king.**

Up to 5% of the population are sociopaths, most of which are men. On top of that 5%, a large portion of men show sociopathic or narcissistic traits, but do not meet the clinical definition. Be wary of these, too.

Now, of course some women can be sociopaths (blah blah blah, this one's for the male lurkers with their magnifying glass trying to find even the tiniest flaw to justify completely disregarding this whole post). The difference here is that female sociopaths exist in a world that does not empower them to maximize the full potential of their lack of conscience. Men have not been trained to be as empathetic, self-sacrificial, and submissive as women, so in general men are more challenging to exploit. The only male weakness that she can exploit is his horniness, and the most powerful weapon in her inventory is her sexuality, so you end up with female serial killers like Aileen Wuornos. Even in Wuornos' case, she was still a prostitute, one of the most powerless and exploited demographics in the world. Female sociopaths seldom reach the highest echelons of power in politics and business, and therefore rarely achieve anywhere near the same scale of destructiveness as the likes of Hitler, Stalin, Trump, or Rupert Murdoch. In fact, anytime any woman (even non-sociopathic women) achieves even the tiniest modicum of power, men are quick to demonize her.

In conclusion:

1. When dealing with a guy who hurts people but still attempts to elicit your sympathy, BLOCK AND DELETE. Avoid men like this at all costs, there is almost a 100% chance he is a sociopath. 

2. Eliminate your conscience when dealing with men, especially those who are attempting to dominate, exploit, or control you. Even supposedly ""good"" men, until they have passed a thorough vetting process, are still potentially harmful at worst, and even at best still benefit from the existence of sociopathic men.

3. Beware of your own weaknesses caused by female socialization, and beware of the power granted to men caused by male socialization: men have NO COMPUNCTIONS when it comes to using your own empathy as a weapon against you.

4. Accept that some men are irredeemable. STOP writing paragraphs and trying to ""make the relationship work"" with men like this! There is no point trying to change him, he simply cannot feel empathy, there is nothing you can do about it, and you are only going to get hurt by continuing to interact with him. BLOCK. AND. DELETE.",96973,"If a man is trying to elicit your sympathy, he is probably a sociopath. PITY, not wrath, is the #1 early red flag for sociopaths. Avoid such people at all costs. They are irredeemable, so don't bother trying to ""make it work"" with them. Just block and delete.",0,,,

At one time they had the potential to become bright, shiny suns, however, something happened to them and they collapsed. The collapsing event may have been childhood abuse, another woman who broke his heart, or porn addition. Doesn't matter. This is outside your control. Something you cannot and should not try and fix. Don’t feed the blackhole!

What does a blackhole do? A blackhole sucks up energy. A blackhole’s natural state is to take and take from the universe. This is the nature of a LVM. He will drain you of your energy. Nothing will ever satisfy him until you are an empty shell. Even then, it isn’t in the nature of a blackhole to release an energy source-oh no! He will let you hang on in his gravitational pull until you make the effort get away. He will string you along in orbit in the form of situationships, FWB, a causal relationship, a broken marriage or as a forever girlfriend. Even worse, the blackhole wants as many energy sources as it can get. Cheating, ethically non monogamous, porn, an ex-girlfriend he can’t cut loose, a friend he uses to make you feel insecure with. He takes and sucks energy from you all. 

How can you get away? Cut all contact and block forever. Break away from his orbit like your life depends on it. This hurts the blackhole. He will shift his attention to you temporarily. He must direct all his energy to keep feeding off you. This isn’t real love. The blackhole hasn’t changed. Has a blackhole ever reversed and become a sun? No, this is against the laws of thermodynamics. This is a false posturing to keep you and suck you back into his orbit. You must resist until he gets bored and moves on to another energy source. 

Back to the main point. You can’t change a blackhole. You can’t fix or heal him. His change has to come from himself. As much as he begs and pleads, he won’t change. A huge majority of LVM don’t possess the introspection you do. He is going to need a huge shock to bring him rock bottom to even begin the process of change, if it ever comes.

They are ones I had before that I can now identify in others. Something clicked for me with FDS and I was able to shift mentally into a way better headspace. I see a lot of women who are right there and about to jump over to the correct side but still doing some things that I believe are part of a pick me mindset. 

1. Caring about a LVM. Whether it is caring about why he is constantly hurting you, why he is hot/cold, about him as a person, about his texts, or about his opinion of you, this is placing value on the LVM. He doesn’t matter. What he thinks doesn’t matter. Nothing related to him or the situation with him matters. He is not going to be in your future thoughts, heart, life as a high value woman. Holding onto him is like holding onto a false idea that has been proven wrong a million times but you want it to be right. Accept it already and stop giving him any value in your mind. 

2. Caring about texting times and text frequency. I used to love texting. I would get so excited every time a man I liked texted me. It’s really just a text and no big deal. Getting overly excited and having your brain release feel good chemicals from random texts or deep chats with a man is a pick me trait in my opinion. You do not want to constantly have feelings good chemicals released in your brain from him. That is you getting addicted to him. What’s worse is those feel good chemicals only sometimes because he doesn’t text often and now you are on a high / low cycle with him. Do not even get on the rollercoaster. Texting is not important. Pick me ladies live for the highs. HVW do not think texting is that important at all and because of that don’t even have to worry about how often he texts and if her texts / texting times are okay. 

3. Wanting him to commit. I get it. But no. Just no. Unless he is begging for you to commit you shouldn’t even be considering it. Don’t even consider it until he brings it up. Then you can start considering it. It benefits you to stay single. We all know men have zero issues with cheating. Him committing does not mean he will be faithful to you, that you will get to see him more, or that he will treat you better. All it means is that now YOU are stuck only seeing him. A man who wants to commit to you will be committed regardless of the title. He should be begging you for YOUR commitment. Don’t worry about locking him down in a relationship because a boyfriend / girlfriend title will not prevent him from seeing other women or leaving you for someone else. The bf / gf title pretty much only traps you so he better be worth it. 

4 a. Giving a man chances. A HVM doesn’t need chances. A HVM is not going to make you cry or feel crazy when you aren’t with him. He will not need a second chance to prove he is a HVM.

4 b. Hoping a man who isn’t treating you like a queen will see your worth and start treating you like a queen if you act like xyz, set boundaries, tell him your worth, or text him a specific way. It’s possible the HVM just doesn’t like you... what is way more likely is he is a LVM. A LVM is not going to change into a HVM permanently. Even if he were to change... you would be looking at YEARS and YEARS of him learning a new behavior pattern. He would have to be so dedicated and even then it would take years. Acting a certain way and seeing him improve his behavior does not make him a HVM. It makes him a LVM dating a HVW and behaving properly. He is still a LVM if he was before. 

4 c. Giving a man online the benefit of the doubt. No. Just no. He says he wants to meet midway? Don’t respond. He says he wants you to come over and watch a movie? Don’t respond. He wants nude pics? Don’t respond. Anything that you feel is below you or not how he should be acting, don’t respond. Do not correct him. He can correct himself. You are not his mother. Silence is your best friend. 

5 a. Assuming a man is high value when you have known him less than 6 months. YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY KNOW. Even worse, less than 3 months. Even worse, 3 dates. Even worse, 1 date and he never set up a decent second date but you think he is HV. I’m blown away by my past self and see this everyday on posts here. Ladies wake up!!!! Here is some cold water for your face 💕 splash splash. You can’t know in less than 6 months. 

5 b. Assuming a man is HV based on surface level things. This could be going based off of his OLD profile. Just because he says looking for a relationship it does not mean he is HV lol. Just because he has a good job, seems normal, and is attractive does not mean he is HV. LVM seem to either be awful in person or very charming. If he is charming, don’t assume he is a HVM! He most likely is a charming LVM is about to destroy your life, consume your mind about why he doesn’t like you for the next year, and make you depressed. Assume LVM always until he shows you for 6 months consistently he might be a HVM. 

6. Going with his flow and thinking everything is great. You need to see what happens if you disagree with him, state a preference, ask him a hard question to see his character (like what do you think about the porn industry), and see how he reacts to stress. You need to judge his character. You can’t do that when everything is in his control and you are doing everything he wants. If you go with his flow, you might not know he is LVM or abusive until after marriage. I’m not saying you need to argue with him. You just need to see him in a variety of situations, assess his character accurately based on his morals/values/actions, and see if he respects you as an equal. You need to be in control as the queen. 

7. I could keep going but I’m going to stop now. I hope this helps someone 💕",96941,Pick me qualities I’m seeing in this group,0,,,

These days, going out for drinks is usually the go-to first dates for millennial women who enjoy social drinking. It’s a low pressure way of getting to know someone and you can relax at the same time with your glass of Riesling. If you don’t like him, you can easily make an excuse and leave after your first drink. This was my main reason for having done a lot of drink dates throughout my dating life. That and the fact that I was afraid that if we do a dinner date, he might ask me to split the check. At least with drinks, if he wanted to split the check, it won’t be as expensive. 

My outlook has changed since then. 

**Be girlfriend material. Make it expensive to take you out to filter out low effort men.** 

Accepting drink dates will not yield you men who are looking for relationships and it will place you in the category of a “fun girl” instead of a girlfriend/wife. If you’ve met a man socially and he asked you out on a date, requiring that he take you out to dinner will call for more financial investment on his part, which is one of the ways you can tell if a man is serious about you. Plenty of men offer drink dates because it’s a low financial investment on his part and it allows him to see as many women as possible. A man who only wants to do drink dates after you’ve stated that you only do dinner dates is a red flag and I would personally pass on that man. Remember that a lot of men do drink dates because they know that alcohol smoothes the way for sexual encounters. 

What if you meet someone on a dating app? Now, should you still expect a dinner date from someone you’ve never met before? My answer is still yes. Online dating is notorious for attracting men who are only looking for something casual, so it’s even more imperative to only do dinner dates if they want to take *you* out in order to filter out low effort men. Before embarking on a date, do a pre-date phone call first to test for conversational compatibility and to make your expectations clear beforehand. (I’ll write a post on this soon.) 

**You need a sound mind to filter men.**

Don’t drink during the first few dates with a man. Why? This will allow you to have a sound mind when it comes to filtering a man — does he pass your standards, does he have dealbreakers, does he seem like a good person? You need to be able to judge a man’s character with an alert mind. Being under the influence of alcohol makes you focus more on the “fun parts” of the date like how attractive he is and how much you like kissing him, instead of analyzing if he’s the right fit for you and if he’s boyfriend material. Abstaining from alcohol also helps you determine quickly if you two have real chemistry. Alcohol will make you think that you have more chemistry than what you actually have. Plus, why would you want to go out with a man who’s only fun when the two of you are drinking? Many women don’t successfully enter relationships because they date the wrong men, and this is because they’re under the influence of alcohol during the early stages of dating. 

**So what should you do instead?**

For first dates, I recommend dinner dates. You can do one in 90 minutes to an hour to see if you'd like to see him again. Do a pre-date phone call beforehand to see if you're on the right page, to communicate your expectations, and to make sure it's worth it to get all dressed up for him.",10879,Drink Dates: Don’t Do Them if You’re Looking for a Relationship,0,2019-10-01 19:09:14,,

These past few weeks have been a little weird romantically. I broke up with my boyfriend and it opened it the flood gate from orbiters and new proposals. One in partially is a college aged guy, to put in perspective, I’m 17. We only talked casually about basic things until he learned I was single again.

I think he thought he was being smooth or sexy, or maybe he thought he was “taking charge” but he started demanding things out of me. If I didn’t text him or snapchat him he’d make passive aggressive “jokes” and eventually he’d just start demanding that I snapchat him. Of course I didn’t listen to this stuff and snap-chatted him on my own time, because I do enjoy his conversational skills. He began asking me about my sexual history and making inferences from my post history on reddit. He made this grand proposal that when I turn 18 he’d ‘bless my life’ by ‘allowing me to have sex with him’. When I told him it was an absolute no in every way, and that my sexuality doesn’t even work like that, he completely glossed over it and began sending me a barrage of pictures and said “next time you get horny, think of me”. I made it very clear that I HAD to laugh.

I didn’t talk to him for three days after that. Than one night he reappeared with usual “snap me rn” (which I always ignore) and when I read it and didn’t respond, he called me through snapchat’s call feature. I could tell he was trying to put on a sexy, just woke up voice. It sounded like a needed a glass of water. He started going on about how I should talk to him instead and he can show me some fun and at this point almost every girl on earth knows what this means, regardless as to if they’ve talked to any boys at all. I responded by asking him if he knew who Chris Hansen was and quickly screenshotted and circled the wiki article that stated that Chris Hansen does work on catching predators, and I told him that if he doesn’t stop you’ll end up taking a seat with him. He got pissed, hung up and started texting me saying how I was acting like a teenager and how I was rude for saying it. Sir, I’m acting like a teenager because I LITERALLY am a teenager. The next day I told him that I wasn’t a fan of our convo and even though i’m young the mind games he attempts to play on me are gross and made for babies. I promptly blocked him.

The second guy has been a heavy orbiter ever since he confessed his crush on me, though I will admit he has very high SMV but RMV is on the oppositeness of the spectrum. Constantly comments heart eyes on my posts on instagram and anything I put on instagram. I don’t let it get to my head, he’s not the kind of guy I want a relationship with. Whenever we do hold conversation, he instantly steers it to how he wishes I would “give him a chance” and that i’m stupid for not wanting to try it all within the same breath with a sing songy voice and cutesy pout. Anyways, I posted kind of a psa about not being on your phone at all while driving. He slid up and made a joke, relating it to mario kart. Of course, after I told him it was funny he started complaining again that I should say yes to his date instead of posting random stuff on snapchat.

Even the broke, ugly, dusty ones have the audacity to behave like they’re a prize to be won. And a lot of times they’re the loudest and most aggressive.

&amp;nbsp;

For a long time it used to confuse the hell out of me until I learned something very important about masculinity:

&amp;nbsp;

***Men speak what they want into existence - no matter what they have in life!***

&amp;nbsp;

Men survive on their ability to lie and obfuscate. And Lie they do. OMG the lies they tell.

&amp;nbsp;

Then they find some woman they can scare, intimidate, and bully into accepting it. The more desperate they are, the more intense the lie and intimidation.

&amp;nbsp;

That’s it. That’s the game. Lie like Pinocchio until someone believes in you.

&amp;nbsp;

It’s not magic. It’s not superior cunning. It’s sheer stubbornness, self importance, narcissism, stupidity, and physical intimidation. ***All men have in life is the Audacity.***

&amp;nbsp;

It doesn’t matter if any of the shit he says is true or not or even if he really believes it - they just have to get a woman -or a few - to believe in their bullshit to make it real.

&amp;nbsp;

And when or if it doesn’t work? They cut and run to find another target or they pick a hill to die on.

&amp;nbsp;

***Their entire self identity is crafted from nothing but belief in their own desire and sense of will.***

&amp;nbsp;

This is why repeated failure makes men homicidal and/or suicidal

&amp;nbsp;. 

This is why that crazy guy on the street cursed you out when you turned him down for a date.

&amp;nbsp;

This is why that guy you thought you were vibing with suddenly disappeared.

&amp;nbsp;

This is why your ex is on Instagram pretending he’s pulling women left and right when he’s really at the club begging girls for pictures.

&amp;nbsp;

You threatened their already fragile self identity in some fundamental way.

&amp;nbsp;

***When your identity is based on nothing, it feels like you’re constantly being threatened.***

&amp;nbsp;

Why do they do this? They’re males, sis. This is what males are at their core, and this is what they do.

&amp;nbsp;

They Beat their chests and act like they’re something they’re not and bigger than they actually are. Just look at our primate cousins for proof:

https://youtu.be/yHzugoaktbk

They ought to call this “Males Capping in The Wild.”

&amp;nbsp;

Men are expert manifesters in this respect.

&amp;nbsp;

They’ll talk all about how they only date 10s all day while going home each night to sit in their basement eating Cheetos.

&amp;nbsp;

Then they eventually stumble upon a woman with weak enough self identity to believe it. He convinces her how lucky she is that he’s considering dating her, since he only dates 10s usually (*wink*wink), knowing damn well he hasn’t seen a single woman naked in years.

&amp;nbsp;

A woman who does not have a narrative for her life mapped out will be easily disrupted by the plethora of males with a more vivid narrative than hers, who are more practiced at maintaining it in varying situations.

&amp;nbsp;

This is what people mean when they say you need to work on yourself or “you teach people how to treat you”

&amp;nbsp;

A woman with strong boundaries has created a narrative for her own life so vivid and secure that it is impenetrable to bullshit. She may not know if what he’s claiming is true or not, all she knows is he does not fit her vision for her life, and that is enough. She won’t manifest his lie into reality.

&amp;nbsp;

***You’re the one who gets to choose to make him real or not. You can leave Pinocchio as a puppet or turn him into a real boy.***

I’m disgusted by the hatred that i see on this subreddit and genuinely, it’s the same kind of extremism that you see incels spouting off about. I feel like we have all become so blinded by the differences that we have that we forget how alike we all truly are. I’m waiting for the day that humanity can realize that we’re all one and the same: people. Just as the late and great Dr. Reverend King said, “Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.” I wish that you all can take these words with you and relinquish your anger, set yourself free from the burden of hatred.

Always, always (always, always, always) require your partner to wear a condom. No questions. No condom? No sex.

Guess what! Your hookup/dating partner/random dude at the bar is gonna *fucking hate that*! And that's not your problem! Only one or two guys I've ever hooked up with didn't whine, bitch, or try and get me to *not* expect that they use a condom. Women are [biologically way more susceptible to STDs](https://www.fhi360.org/sites/default/files/webpages/Modules/STD/s1pg22.htm). Any guy that pressures you is not going to be a good father, or sit at the abortion clinic with you if something goes wrong. Even if you really like this guy, just think about the guys you've \*really liked\* in the past who turned out to be shady or shitty. I'm not saying assume the worst of every guy, but I'm definitely saying be realistic about how a good portion of men operate. They'll say they got tested and are clean (even if they haven't). They'll say they never have unprotected sex with random people (except ***you*** for some reason?!). Don't buy it.

I made a handy guide for how to handle the inevitable excuses and guilt trips you will go through:

* **If he says, ""it reduces sensitivity, it doesn't feel as good!""** You say, *""Not my fucking problem"".* 
* **If he says, ""I can't stay hard with a condom.""** You say, *""Not my fucking problem.""*
* **If he says, ""I didn't bring/don't have any condoms.""** You say, *""Guess this isn't happening, buddy.""*
* **If he says, ""I just got tested/I'm clean/don't worry.""** You say, *""Congrats! Get a condom anyway.""*

Never, ever, ever put yourself at risk for some guy's bad lay. This is coming from a former weak ass bitch who would let herself get talked into having sex without condoms because I wanted him to *feel good* or *like me* because I didn't like or respect myself enough to say ""fuck off"" to any guy that would put me at risk for his own temporary pleasure.

In my experience, there is no discernible different between sex with and without a condom for women (other than having to listen to men complain about it) and men know that, so they try to guilt and shame and cajole us to avoid using condoms. But no. We need to stand firm and protect ourselves. I've seen too many women catch STDs or deal with unplanned pregnancies because the guy stealthed them, complained about condoms, or otherwise just didn't take precautions. 

Always remember: every guy is 20 swipes away from being replaced. You do not need to ever put yourself at risk, and you are worth vastly more than that.",9148,PSA: Condoms. Always.,0,2019-09-29 13:04:50,,

\-I look forward to finally be able to wear my cute outfits on a date with a man who will take me out and not have me pay half(; (when I am ready of course)

\-wrote out my goals and i am applying to internships

Like us, men have their personal plans in life and also like us, we can only truly perceive what the other gender is  intending to do with us and if we will spend our lives together.

Based on my past relationship, I was trying to treat and make him God-like because I thought that he would treat me like a Goddess as well. But coming to think of what goddess really do in mythology, it is most of the time that they are there to basically mother their own God husbands and mother and sort out humans and my mortal self just couldn't keep up with the act as well.

All of us have our own timelapse of what phase we need to go next in our lives and growth will never happen unless something extrinsic happen that trigger an intrinsic need to change. Most of the time, it's pressure from extrinsic factors that come about intrinsic needs to change.

But what if we just actively figure out our purpose individually and find out about ourselves, by ourselves? This powerful need of knowing ourselves and loving ourselves for the sole purpose of ""being"" will create immense growth within ourselves as individuals that would immensely impact the community as a whole.

There's an old saying that ""Boys will always be boys.""

Yes, they will always be boys. Let's keep them occupied with their own lala land in their playground as we evolve ourselves from girls to women and meet the grown men capable of being a real life partner with many wisdoms and learnings.

I love this sub for making me question so many things that were previously just accepted as standard. It's given me some serious thinking material.    
In my past I have been pretty driven by my urges. I often wouldn't mind any of the toxic man behaviours I was submitted to as long as I was getting what I wanted, ie sex. I have thankfully grown past this stage by exploring the subject through and through. The other night I surprised myself. This former sex buddy invited me over, after about 2 years not seeing each other (I've lived abroad, had a boyfriend, he takes care of his kid). He offered to cook dinner and we chatted quite naturally so I thought what the heck, and accepted, ready to be surprised and frankly curious. We ate and put a movie on, started cuddling, which wasn't awkward at all. I'm currently on a full no-alcohol regimen so I felt even more challenged in not having this social lubricant to fend off awkwardness. But it wasn't even necessary, things flowed very well. :)    
When it came down to being naked, and I realized none of us had a condom, I said stop. He apparently would've been ready to go ahead anyway, which is a bit disappointing, but he didn't not insist one bit or even try to negociate. We spent the night cuddling like crazy and had a nice breakfast in the morning. I'm really proud of myself for having grown some boundaries and sticking to them! It's amazing to realize there's a world where people pull each other upwards... Thank you for reading my little adventure!

He has shown lots of interest, consistency, and he treats me very well. So far, there has been no red flags .. Until last night. 

I went over to his house last night for the first time for dinner. He cooked up a really nice meal and things were going well. Great conversation as always I was very impressed with his cooking skills!! After we ate dinner, he gave me a house tour before I left to go home. While we were in his room, I was investigating his bookshelf to see what books he reads and I saw THREE books on HOW TO LIE on his bookshelf!! One was titled “using statistics to lie” ... what on earth! 

There was a moment where I found myself trying to justify why he has those books. I remember thinking “oh he’s in real estate, maybe that’s why he needs to learn how to lie/manipulate?” 

Luckily I snapped out of it and I definitely wont be seeing him again considering that giant red flag. This morning I woke up very happy thinking about the bullet I just dodged! He showed many HVM qualities but I cant ignore those 3 books.. I mean seriously?! Just my luck hahahah.

A lot of great stuff is happening in my life - new job at a high-level institution, getting recognition in my field, developing my own creative projects, and juggling my thesis at the same time. It is super exciting.  
However, I was raised in a culture where you are looked down upon if you are proud of your achievements and success - you're  not supposed to talk about that type of stuff. Furthermore, my boyfriend has been dealing with a lot of stress on his job and some family issues. So whenever I was talking about good things that happened during the day, or sharing good news, I'd be quite apologetic: ""Sorry for the rant"", ""sorry for rambling about my day"", etc. I didn't even think about it. I guess I subconsciously did not want him to feel bad or seem like I was bragging.  
But yesterday, when I once again said it in passing, he called me out on it: ""I've noticed you use these types of words when you are telling me about your day, and I am not sure why you do it. I love hearing about your day and seeing you so happy. I think about our conversations before going to sleep and it makes me happy and proud of you.""

You obviously don't need a man to tell you that you should never downplay your hard work, ambition and success, but it was a good reminder from someone who is not threatened by their partner's success. I will cut that type of insecurity out of my vocabulary from now on.",96692,My boyfriend called me out yesterday.,0,,,

How are you guys? I was wondering if we could add to the handbook or make a post about HV behaviors within a long term relationship.

I've been in a relationship with a HVM for a few years (I'm quite young and not ready for any further commitments yet, so not a forever GF). I've learned to be HV myself, but as always, sometimes it's easy to slip into my old pickmeisha ways. I've slipped up a bit a few times, found myself fighting to see him or losing emotional control such that he saw some emotional dependence on him. Like I said, he's a HVM so I'm not really fighting him to take me on dates, respect me, have fun, etc. It's more like I'm trying set rules for myself so I don't start acting LV or losing sight of myself.

A lot of FDS advice is rightfully directed at dating, but it's hard to apply in relationships. It would help to have a post of guiding principles, advices, or boundaries that one can never forget, even in a relationship. I know the guiding principles: put yourself first, strong boundaries, let him chase etc. but what does that *specifically* look like in a relationship? What questions should I ask myself when I'm at the precipice of a LV decision? I really want these boundaries to come from a place of self-love, rather than a negative view of my partner.

I can start us off, but I want to hear everyone's thoughts below :)

* Dates still require a plan, a time, and a place. I don't go 50/50...lol.
* Only see each other 1-3 times per week. At least once a week, turn him down in favor of your friends/self (be busy).
* School comes first.
* No sitting around fantasizing about the future.

Thoughts?

I'm pretty young so I'd love to hear from older, experienced FDSers &lt;3 Thank you\~\~",96616,HV Behavior in Long Term Relationships,0,,,

First of all, I just want to point out that the above scenario is actually quite rare. The vast majority of women get *nothing* after a divorce especially if both parties are low income. Best case scenario, she gets some court ordered child support (and many women don't even get that).

Divorces in which the ""woman takes half"" only ever happen when the man is extremely wealthy and the woman is comparatively quite poor. (Or, when the marital assets are shared!)

So, the solution to this issue is really quite simple.

Don't want to lose half of your assets to ""scheming gold diggers""?

Then stop going after women who have way less money than you.

There are *plenty* of wealthy single women AND as a bonus, most are in the same age bracket as these rich old geezers!

It's a win-win situation!

Oh, what's that? You *don't* want to date someone who is your financial equal? 

Hmmm, I wonder why that might be...

Ohhhh, I get it. It's because rich old men specifically target much younger and poorer women because they are easier to control. Why bother having an actual partner when you'd rather have a sex object that you can financially abuse instead?

Riiiight.

And this is why whenever I see a story like ""24 y/o woman divorces 57 y/o , receives millions in divorce settlement"" my response is ""YES GIRL, snatch them coins!""

Because the story is rarely that of a scheming woman plotting to steal the riches of a poor innocent old man. More often than not, it is a dynamic in which a creepy, wealthy, powerful old man is looking to control, exploit, and abuse a much younger and less powerful woman.

If a man ""loses everything in the divorce"" he is getting what he deserves.",96617,"Men who ""lost everything in the divorce"" usually deserve it. Rich men often target poorer women because they are easier to control and financially abuse. It's the same reason men go after much younger women: they seek to have more power in the relationship.",0,,,

One way to make your dating experience more seamless is to determine what your standards are and to stick to them. How do you want to be treated by your future boyfriend? What non-negotiable qualities should he have and what are your dealbreakers? 

* What kind of first dates do you want? Do you prefer a drink date or do you want a man to take you out to a nice restaurant? What caliber of restaurant do you want them to take you to?
* Do you want them to provide for you, to pay for dinners, movie tickets, Uber rides, etc.? What kind of restaurants do you want to be taken to? 
* How long would you keep seeing a man who hasn’t asked you for exclusivity yet? (Mine is 2 months at most. After that, they’re cut off.) 
* Are you okay with a man who only wants to see you once a week or do you require a man wanting to see you more than that for you to know that he’s serious? 
* How long would you wait for him to introduce you to his friends? 
* When are you going to have sex with him? 

https://i.redd.it/dg65nkcyc1p31.jpg

Really think about the kind of dating experience that you want. Your answer shouldn’t be colored by your previous bad experiences or what they world tells you to want. Just think about how you want your future boyfriend to treat you in an ideal world. 

https://i.redd.it/uaj6hh53d1p31.jpg

**What if I told you that how you want to be treated is very much possible?** I know the world always tells us to lower our standards and to be realistic. People try to invalidate your real needs and they tell you to settle for someone who can’t give you what you want. It’s how they try to excuse men’s subpar behavior. Instead of a man changing his behavior, apparently we should be the ones who should accept less than exemplary behavior and reward them with our youth and feminine presence.

**Say no to that.** 

As an empowered woman, you have to OWN up to your desires and to never accept something that doesn’t align with what you truly desire. Love yourself enough to honor your desires. When you accept nothing less than what you want, it allows you to cut through the bullshit. You don’t have to think, *“Oh, is him doing X acceptable? Should I be okay with it? What should I do to make him change his mind?”* 

When you honor your standards, you instead communicate to a man frankly what kind of behavior or quality you expect from a man. Examples from my personal life:

If a man wants to take me to a restaurant that I don’t find date-appropriate, I tell him frankly that I’m accustomed to nicer places. He can either find a restaurant that would please me or he can find another date.

Another example: I meet a man in a group setting, we go out and are affectionate with each other. But when we meet again in a group setting, he doesn’t act like how he’d act when we’re on a date. I ignore him at the end of the night, and when he asks me what’s wrong, I tell him that I prefer guys who treat me in public like how they treat me privately when we go out on dates. I don’t say it in a needy way. I just tell him what my expectations are and it’s up to him to step up and change if he wants to keep me. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/rovdjltbd1p31.jpg

Recently, I’ve learned how valuable honesty is. The more honest you are about your real desires and your standards, the more men will respect you and treat you like girlfriend material. I’ve done the two examples I’ve provided recently with a man and the man in question DID find a nicer restaurant and he DID change his behavior and was so regretful that he treated me that way. He said that he didn’t mean to do that and was just respectful of my space, and that it was the last time he’ll mess up like that again. I’ve made it clear to him how I expect to be treated and he changed his behavior because he wants to keep me. Since then, he has shown to me in a group setting that we’re an item and he has also asked for my exclusivity. That’s how you know a man values you.

https://i.redd.it/658bsgfld1p31.jpg

When a man has found his dream girl, he will ditch his old ways and become the man that she expects to have. The woman who becomes a man’s dream girl is a woman that has standards. All of the strategies we’ve talked about and will talk about in the future, the core of it is having standards and loving yourself enough to not accept any less. If you do this, your actions will subconsciously affect how a man perceives you and things are more likely to go your way. 

**So ladies, do not waver. Keep your frame. He can either take it or leave it. The right man will find you when you put in the time and effort to be a high quality woman. When you say no to things that are less than what you truly want, you make space in your life to welcome the things that you truly DO want.**",8184,Know What Your Standards Are and Stick to Them: Don't Settle for Less,0,2019-09-28 01:13:02,,

I (22F) met my guy best friend (also 22) in the middle of junior year. Cut to montage of us becoming super tight, sneaking out to smoke weed, two summers of just hanging out completely platonically. Then we hooked up about three weeks post graduation. Then we just kept hooking up for like a year while going about being best friends. We tried dating but I basically ruined it with all the toxic validation-seeking behavior this sub warns against. He went off to college, I dated someone else for over a year. Now I’m single again and we’ve recently picked back up sleeping together (he’s in his senior year now). How in the fuck do I approach getting serious with him again? When we’re together it’s like old times, just being with someone I feel completely at ease with. He takes care of me, like no dude I’ve ever been with, but the minute we’re not in bed it’s like the love goggles come off and we’re just chill platonic friends again.  

All this has got me, frankly, trippin. I’ve been fully dickmatized by my skinny white boi best friend(I’ll save my thoughts on interracial dating in a predominantly white town).

I need to be back in reality again and not in la la land imagining a future with someone that could just be appreciating a HECK out of a FWB situation. And I don’t wanna ruin it if that’s all it is! I genuinely just like this guy and wanna do whatever keeps this going. But if there’s a possibility it could go further than this...is there an appropriate time to pursue it?

I tried to have a civilized discussion with him about why I feel that way and how of course I don’t mean ALL men. What I mean is, historically men have taken advantage of not only women, but any group of minorities for their own gain and not cared about who got in their way or how they got there. He couldn’t hear past me saying men are trash. We would fight and fight for hours over this and I couldn’t ever get him to see my side of things. He said something about how it makes him feel like he is garbage and I would say well that’s your own ego then. It’s not my fault you can’t see how even if you don’t actively abuse women, you are still contributing to their marginalization. I probably should’ve broken up with him at that point or even when he started to say he didn’t like Lizzo because he thinks she’s promoting obesity. *insert eye roll* I’ve found it’s very hard to find any men who are willing and able to take their share of the blame or even just acknowledge how they could be contributing to this systemic problem. I now know that this is something I can’t compromise on either. During our first date I sat there and rationalized with him how Trump winning the election wasn’t really that bad because it wouldn’t directly affect me, and trying to hold back about topics like feminism because I didn’t want to scare him off. Turns out, I should’ve because it would’ve saved me a year of my life! But I also wouldn’t have learned that this is something I need in a partner so, everything happens for a reason, right?

They normally never become a majority, unless something is deeply wrong with society. For example, fascism in many countries only came to power after the Great Depression, when people became poor and vulnerable.

Also - huge difference - even the most extreme women groups don't advocate abuse and illegal activities for the sake of bedding some man, like many of the misogynistic cults on reddit do. We also don't go and troll in their forums like they do here.

At the moment, the only huge popularity I see on the internet is extreme men's groups. They are loud, ugly to the point where they even disgust other men, and they are EVERYWHERE, particularly in crazy popular meme sites that are frequented by impressionable children and teens. I haven't seen any misandristic memes and posts there. Hm, I wonder why that is...

Apparently these men are victims because they can't get laid by the photoshoped images they see on the internet and that drives them crazy. They keep telling us that women are **obligated** to give every Tom, Dick and Harry a chance in bed, no matter how lame of a loser he is. But what they actually mean is, they want to fuck Instahoes, who don't even exist in reality, not regular women. 

Trick question: Ask Sam from IT if he remembers Sally from accounting. If she isn't conventionally attractive, he won't know who she is, even if he sees her and talks to her every day. But if Sally dares to have preferences in men, she is instantly a bitch. 

They also keep bitching about divorce laws, when they have actually never been more fair in the history of humanity. Courts which apparently ""favored"" women was an extremely short lived thing, in the past men *always* got the children and everything. You got shafted during the divorce not because of laws and evil women, **but because you thought with your dick when you got married.**",6487,This type of sub is needed to balance out the TORRENT of male hatred on the internet,0,2019-09-25 06:34:04,,

* If you've initiated dates with a man (but he never initiates one with you), don't ask for advice on how to get him to initiate a date with you. Cut him off. 
* If you've been the one predominantly initiating texts with him and he rarely texts you first, cut him off.
* If he's been leaving you on read and takes a day to get back to you, cut him off. 
* If he doesn't make you feel special, cut him off. 
* If he makes you feel frustrated because he can't plan a date well and offers a low value proposal, cut him off. 
* If it's been 6 weeks of seeing each other continuously and he still hasn't shown that he wants to be in a relationship with you, cut him off. If he says he doesn't want a relationship with you, cut him off. He doesn't want one with you. 

In short, if he hasn't been treating you like someone he values and someone he considers girlfriend material, cut him off. The established pattern will not change. If he comes running back promising he will change, don't believe him. He'll change for a bit before reverting back to how he once was. 

It's easier to teach a new man how you'd like to be treated than to change a man who has learned that treating you like you're not special still gets him results. Start over with a new man instead of trying to change one. 

Dating is a numbers game. Your time is better spent meeting a lot of new men, going on dates with them, cutting them off the moment they've shown they're not crazy for you THAN spending more time going out with someone who doesn't think you're special and who's just wasting his time with you because he's bored.",6078,Cutting Men Off: An Underrated Strategy,0,2019-09-23 22:57:39,,

When I was 8, I was friends with the kids on my street (one girl who was 12 and boys who were 13-16). They would harass me, hit me with me things, and make fun of me. I remember one night when we were playing outside, the boys pulled up a video on their phone. They started laughing and one suggested I watch it. I was confused. They showed me a video from PornHub and it made me feel disgusted even though I didn’t understand what I was seeing. I never told anyone because I was embarrassed but I began to watch more and more of it. This made me even more embarrassed and I had a lot of self hatred. 

I remember when I was 11, my older (13) friend introduced me to Omegle. Often times men would tell us to get naked or something sexual or would start masturbating. She had a 23 year old boyfriend at the time. I knew it was weird but I just didn’t say anything.
When my mom found out about her boyfriend, she blamed her and called her “fast”.

When I started going through puberty, I noticed a difference in the way older men treated me. Male family members started looking at me differently. It was this look that they all gave me. From teachers, men with children in public... it was this very specific look and I knew exactly what it meant. My step dad openly commenting on the fact that my butt was “sexy”. One time I wore leggings and was told that was no longer appropriate to wear in front of him. I ordered leggings that had this sheer pattern on the calves. He told me I looked like a whore, a stripper, a slut. Etc. I became scared of him, I hated how my body looked. I wear only baggy clothes around male family members now.

I’m high school it astonished me that the boys would talk openly about sharing girls nudes and “collecting” them. They joked about a girl in my class who was r*ped. I was disgusted. Recently I found a male friend of mine has been sexually harassing women at parties and being a giant creep. The rest of my male friends said “Wow that’s weird” and kept hanging out with him. “But he’s my friend”.

This keeps you emotionally detached from him and allows you to asses the situation more objectively. You can even write something like “Loser” for those who’ve proven themselves LVM and don’t deserve your attention.

I want to offer a few more tips to avoid texting him first. The radical one is - delete his number! It especially works if you’re not connected to him on any other social media except WhatsApp. You will simply be unable to text him unless he gets in touch with you himself! 

Another trick is archiving/deleting your chats. It’s way easier to resist the temptation to text him if you don’t see your conversation every time you open the app. It will also be psychologically more difficult to have to unarchive your conversation to write him, or if it’s deleted, to dig his number out and write the first message. On WhatsApp, once he writes you, the chat is automatically unarchived and you receive a notification.

The most important trick is of course, to live your life so that you are simply too busy to reply to his messages straight away or to think whether to write him first! 

These tricks have been helping me a lot, I hope they can help someone else, too!",96498,Tips to stop yourself from texting him first,0,,,

He was raised to believe he had incredible value just because he was a man. His parents treated him better than his sisters. Compared to his sisters, he was treated with much more respect and shall I say worship. His mother constantly told him, ""You're the best."" 
Meanwhile, growing up, my parents never said anything nice to me. I was never given encouragement, told I was amazing, or anything good like that. I grew up not knowing my own worth. 
As I grew older, I grew into a beautiful woman. I blossomed, and as I had since young, I carried with me qualities of love, joy, empathy, and compassion. I added value to people's life. 
This guy, on the other hand, lived his life using people, cheating on people, and bringing people so much pain. But in his mind, he was the best. He was amazing. He was incredible. During our relationship, he made me believe that HE was the prize. I found myself trying to please him, fawning over him, and caring about him more than I cared about my own well-being. I was devastated when things ended between us. Only after some time did I realize, he was nothing. He was literally nothing. He had nothing good to offer me and did not contribute positively to my life at all. All of a sudden, the pedestal he had placed himself on toppled over. Despite what he was brainwashed to believe, he was really nothing.  
The veil lifted from my eyes, and I saw reality. He was balding, skinny as a stick, boring as hell, could not make proper conversations, and a heartbreaker. He was a literal heartbreaker who ran around leaving pain in every life he came across. 
This man's mother and general upbringing didn't do him any favors. He was fed the delusion that he was really great and better than others. He was taught that women are not worthy of respect like men. Whereas women like me were never taught just how valuable we are. Do you see the contrast? 
We have men out here, thinking they're the shit when they're not. Then we have beautiful, loving, intelligent, awesome women who don't even know their own worth. Something is wrong with that. Things have got to change.",96477,What a stark difference.,0,,,

He said, “I’ve got stuff to do, so expect a reply maybe Friday.” Today’s Tuesday, and he sent me a reply at 1:00 AM last night (Monday).That’s three days, of him not replying to me. Three days! Take note, that we were replying every-day before then. Communication was strong. His excuse was that he was tired on Friday, and he fell asleep. And then, as for the Weekend, he spends the three days re-arranging his office, which is apparently some justifiable excuse as to why he couldn’t shoot me an email through phone. A little “Hey, I’ll be delayed because…” Just as well, it’s the fucking weekend! What excuse does he have? He did reply, as mentioned. His email sounded guilty as hell. As if he were kissing my ass, and more reciprocal than usual. He kept peppering it with ‘sorry’, but my women’s intuition felt as if he was hoping to sweep it under the carpet. I gave him my number last email; he texts me to say he wants to talk through phone that night. I tell him I’ve got better shit to do that night (hell yeah I do), and I give it to him straight:
“I assumed with your lack of reply, that you weren’t interested. So, I deleted you. I prefer a man who is consistent in his replies. It shows that he’s trustworthy, and serious.” He then places the blame on me in a “sorry you feel that way” sort of way, and he tells me that I’m being unreasonable. That all the people he knows, wouldn’t crucify him for replying late. He said that we don’t even know each-other, and that justifies why he can dick around and that I was punishing him for “slacking off a bit”. How the hell does us not knowing one another well enough, warrant a worthy excuse to be shitty with your communication? It’s like, dude. You just shot yourself in the foot. Us not knowing each-other requires us to have constant communication! Especially with OLD, and the first stages. You get comfortable when you KNOW each-other. There is no compromise. As a man, you’re meant to be pursuing a woman with the utmost interest with no lapse in reply. If there’s a delay, you let her fucking know! So what did I do? I shot back an argument, which consisted of the above—that he failed in courtship, therefore he should fuck right off. I told him that I prefer a man who is honest and upfront like myself, thus implying that he wasn’t at all. When I was delayed in reply, I had the decency to let him know. He ended the reply with him saying “sorry” and wished me luck in finding someone else, and that he didn’t even know that I felt that way. Ultimately, he said he enjoyed our conversation.

Yes, my ‘conversation’, but not me as a person. What a creep.

What do you sisters make of this? Who’s right here? I'm in recovery from being a Pickmeisha, so I would appreciate some feedback. I'm still going through some cognitive dissonance. That old part of me felt bad about what happened.",99306,"Men's excuses, and projecting them onto you.",0,,,

I cut my losses, and I unfriended him. I ended up moving across the country, but he has a few contacts in the new city Im in. (It's truly a small world) They have come to me to tell me that he wants to know more about me, but he's also told them very nasty (and innaccurate) things about me.

Ladies, don't ever tolerate a man who acts like paying for your meal is an expensive burden. He doesn't even have to be particularly rich, all he needs is a generous and loving spirit.

However, they are slowly starting to lose their minds because I'm 26 and single. Someone wanted to set me up with a guy who is a solid 2/10. I declined because I have zero physical attraction, to the point where even if he is HV, I still wouldn't be able to see the guy as more than a friend.

My parents think it's unacceptable for me to decline to meet someone based on physical appearance if they check all the other boxes. In this case it means having a good, high-paying job and being of the same religious and cultural background as us. They said a lot of hurtful things and really hit below the belt in berating me/trying to convince me to go on a date with the guy.

Some highlights: ""You are going to end up alone just like \[insert names of acquaintances' daughters who are still single in their 30s and 40s\]""

""Maybe he won't even like you, you're not that gorgeous""

""You're going to regret this when you hit 30 and no one wants you, you'll wish you had this guy then""

""It didn't work out with \[ex's name, other ex's name, or other ex's name\], obviously you have no luck in dating, so you're in no position to decline. Just take what you can get.""

Also making me feel like a bad person for saying that he is unattractive. I would never comment on someone's physical appearance unless I'm forced to. I actually feel bad for even having this conversation.

Thankfully because of FDS I'm not as stressed out about being single as I was prior to FDS. I even enjoy being single most of the time, though I obviously want to meet my HVM one day.

I've levelled up in almost every way, I'm in great shape, my hair/nails/clothes are always on point, I have a great group of friends and a promising career ahead of me. I know that I'm a great catch objectively speaking. Obviously not everyone is going to love me, but that's just life. Sue me, I like a nice face, a full head of hair, and a fit body. I have all those things, so why shouldn't my partner?

Sorry for this rant, this situation has just got me feeling out of sorts. It doesn't help that I've suffered a lot of disappointment in dating the past couple of years and can't seem to catch a break in that department. Part of me is wondering if they're right and I'm living in a lala land holding out for a partner I'm actually attracted to.  I know my parents only want the best for me, so I'm having some trouble reconciling their words with my feelings. Idk what to do.",99162,Parents berating me,0,,,

Although it is not my personal situation I feel that its something that I can learn to pick up on in the future

So anyways she (lets call her Jill) is upset her partner(lets go with Jack) for allowing a women (Patty I guess lol) of his friend group get too close to him. From what I understand it happened at a party, Patty was drunk, and was rubbing his back(? maybe arm?) and saying he's such a great man. He ofc didn't think much of it (why would he? She's fueling his ego). Apparently aside from that it seemed that same event he was being a bit distant from Jill (I.E. she'd get close and he would wander away, kinda sketch).

After that night Jill expressed to him how she is uncomfortable with Patty being alone with him and would prefer for him to avoid that. He says ok and life goes on. Well jump to yesterday us girls go out of town for a photo shoot and our way back from our trip she gets the update that he is actually at Patty's house with all their friends. Something that wasn't even mentioned at all to Jill, which I believe is a red flag. Because I believe he chose not to tell Jill.

Supposedly he had sent Jill a list of chores he would be doing that day she was out, since he had the weekend free of his son, but apparently none of that all got completed as he had made the decision to hang out and drink with friends at Patty's place since 11am - literally when we returned home at 9pm. Poor Jill was asking if her frustration was valid, like girl!

Jill &amp; Jack were texting back and forth but he just kept missing the fact that she was upset at the disrespect yet he chose to keep defending Patty and saying ""she didn't mean it like that"" ""she feels bad"" ""She didn't realize what she was doing"" etc. Again the issue is with Jack not Patty. Overall he just kept trying to defuse the situation and keep the peace but he didn't seem to understand Jill's frustration. He and his friends were even encouraging her to go over and hangout after she gets back, like Jill needs an audience for this issue (which I'm sure all his friends are right with him behind the phone trying to help).

The entire ordeal gave me a headache, I wanted to tell her to just leave and go home but they actually share a place together and have actually bought a home..

The man is already divorced and didn't even have much time being single as the next girl was Jill and now seems to be locking her in with his son. Apparently this is the best relationship she's had so I'm happy to hear that but also I feel bad that it seems that she has to deal with these minor issues.

Like maybe he's not a bad guy but I feel like he can do better at making her feel validated and actually put an effort toward correcting these issues",99147,[VENT] Man fails to understand why his GF is upset,0,,,

A lot of women have issues when they think a man has been acting like they are in a relationship and then they get blindsided by men telling them they just see them as friends. That’s because a lot of women have such small standards for what constitutes a relationship that we don’t see that we aren’t in one nor getting what we deserve.   
  
Even when in my old pickme days I could feel inside of me that my “relationships” were not actual relationships because the men didn’t treat me right. They weren’t HVM and there were red flags along the way but I didn’t want to not call it a relationship because I wanted to say I had had one already.   
  
A heathy relationship is something that you can only get with a man who is ready for it and will put in as much effort as you’d like. He will also do it without you asking.

He never texted me stuff like I can’t wait to see you. Was much more reserved as most men are. So after he a little bit lost it with me and said he was “scared” of me, I thought, hell no, I am not wasting my time with this guy. No time guys who are “scared” of a perfectly good woman. I take care of myself, I’m attractive, fit, intelligent, compassionate, I volunteer, I’m a great mother to two lovely teenagers, I just thought, I AM THE PRIZE. This isn’t about what HE wants, it’s about what *I* want.

So he backs off. I do the same. No texts for two days then he texts me tonight and says something along the lines of, “I assume you were working on your amazing art and that’s why I haven’t heard from you”. Actually, no. I just don’t chase men. YOU chase me. I just said I’ve been busy. He engaged me in conversation that I know took everything he had, was clearly trying to impress and amuse me. Finally I told him to had to go to sleep.

I don’t normally date younger men, but his profile said he was older and I didn’t find out his true age until later. He seemed a little immature but I decided to give him a chance because he seemed really captivated by me, seemed to truly value me. I thought “this guy isn’t my usual type or preference but he likes me so much, it’s worth giving him a shot.” Basically, I lowered my standards for him. This was my first mistake.

I noticed that when I was with him he always talked about other girls he’d dated. Pretty much every other story he told was about a girl he’d dated or slept with. Furthermore, he always only talked about himself and never asked me anything about me or my life. He didn’t care to get to know me. Ignoring these red flags for too long was another huge mistake.

Something he shared with me was that he likes to be exclusive with the girls he’s very interested in and would cut things off if a girl he was seeing was dating other guys. He then claimed he himself had not been using his dating apps since he’d been talking to me. I decided to reciprocate and put all my profiles on snooze. Another blunder on my part.

A few weeks later I saw that he’d updated his Tinder profile, and got fed up. I decided to break things off, but he begged for another chance, insisting that he wasn’t actually using online dating apps. I normally wouldn’t even have cared this early on, but since he made such a big deal about it, and didn’t want me using the apps either, I was annoyed. Anyway, I don’t like being begged or guilted, so I gave him another shot. I was basically digging my own grave here. 

Not even a full two days after he begged for another chance, he asked if we could just be friends. I asked if he’d just decided he didn’t like me, to which he said no, that he still does but didn’t think we were compatible. I told him I wasn’t interested in staying friends, and he got upset. He said it didn’t have to end that way. He said “we could still hang out and have fun.” I said no. Then he said “Come on you’re so hot and I have sexual needs!” I was disgusted. I told him “I can’t believe you’d ask me that. That’s horrible.” He replied “It’s really not. Maybe to you it is.” He proceeded to tell me how childish it was that I didn’t want to stay friends. 

I blocked his number, removed and blocked him on Snapchat, and unmatched his profile on Tinder and Bumble. This guy was basically asking me to provide all the benefits of a girlfriend to him without me actually being his girlfriend. He wanted ME to tend to HIS needs without expecting anything in return. It felt so shitty. It made me feel like worthless garbage. 

I unfortunately can’t block numbers on my laptop, which I need for work and so I’m still able to see the texts he sends me. The first was a “🥺” the last was a “Fuck you.” 

I hate men. They’re so fucking awful! But please learn from my mistakes, ladies, and don’t let men think they can walk all over you! If a guy isn’t acting right, leave ASAP!

The title almost explains everything.

My boyfriend (29 M) and I (26 F) have been together for almost 5 years. I'm a very loving and caring person. Everyday, I like my partner to feel loved and appreciated. I usually do any favor that he asks me: bring him a beer, make his food, anything. I like to act like this but... he doesn't usually do the same for me. I'll explain it better: rarely he do my a favor even if I ask. 

Usually, he only do favors for me and acts affectionate when I was angry. When I act upset too. *It seems like he only appreciates me when he thinks he will lose me.* 

As the tittle says, when I act distant, I receive a lot of love from him. Nice and lovely words, favors... 

The same thing happens when I was with my others partners (all males).

I can't believe I was so naive as to buy into his lies. Thanks to him he convinced me that he loved me – my partner was probably one of the best liars I'd ever met. 

He swept me off my feet - quite an accomplishment since I'm so cautious by nature. Imagine my surprise when a mutual friend broke the news to me that not only was he a world class liar, he was already MARRIED WITH SMALL CHILDREN. How dare he put me in such a compromising position? How dare he disrespect his wife like this and make me feel so used, guilty, ashamed and worthless in the process? And when I confronted him, he gave me such a lame excuse; that he didn't tell me because he loved me so much and knew I'd leave him if I found out the truth. 

He was a dirtbag. I was so angry at myself for falling for his lies. And then, the worst part, he begged me not to tell his wife because it would destroy his family. Well guess what? I did tell her. She had a right to know what an asshole she lived with. In fact, we had a long conversation and even compared notes. She's a lovely woman and certainly is wasted on the likes of him. I felt so horrible being the unwitting party to the treachery. I apologized profusely and we both cried. I was hurt to the core but I was more hurt for her. 

She was exceptionally gracious about it all and was grateful that I filled her in on what he was really all about. We ‘dated’ for 9 months, his wife was pregnant for 8 of those months. There are not words enough to describe how low he is. She and I deserved far better than him. 

Once she divorces him, she is going to clean him out. He’d better be prepared to live in that car he was so damn fond of. Asshole. Oh, and as for the roses he sent, what a jerk.

Insecure men are time-wasters and life ruiners. You can’t save him, sis. You can try.. and lose yourself completely. You can try to be his “peace” or take care of him, or show him you’re 1000% down for him and literally become a shell of who you used to be. Or you can block him.

I'm speaking from excruciating experience. At first, you'll think it's cute that he gets sad about small things you do. That he sends you ""📷:/"" and seems jealous. That he asks ""why me?"" It's not fucking cute. You're in for a world of hurt. You can't fix him and he WILL break you.

Hey ladies!  Long post but TL;DR : seeking advice if I (21) should pursue this guy(24) who liked me or forget about him in the romantic sense. 

Over the summer I had a job and met a fellow student. We really hit it off, he was very outgoing and funny. Little did I know he kept coming to talk to me because he liked me and ‘wanted to see where things would go’. He would also constantly touch me like when he was telling a joke and also always mentioned his ex (which like I don’t give a shit, he was clrealy trying to make me jealous). Well one day he asked me if I wanted to hang out after work but never mentioned the word “date”. All he said was “you know what the implications are, right?” and I said “what implications?” And he just said nevermind. 
Listen, I ’m down to be asked out on a date but if you don’t even have the courage to utter the word then I’m sorry that’s kind of a turn off. Because to me that means that a man can’t even take control. 
Also when we were heading to the bus together after work he told me I made him nervous. Like wtf I didn’t know how to react to that. 
Anyways, I really liked this guy but as a friend. I didn’t really feel a romantic pull towards him and that’s what I told him: after hanging out after work we started talking about relationships and stuff and I said I wasn’t looking for anything at the moment. He was quite upset and said since I laughed at all his jokes and talked to him that he thought I was interested. I then realized that this guy really thinks that if any girl approaches him then she wants him, he told me this about a few coworkers. 

I still maintained a really good friendship with him throughout the duration of my internship and while it was awkward the day after I rejected him, everything went back to normal. We would get coffee and lunch together as usual. 

So near the end of the summer I started to get feelings for him. After all he was the only person I hung out with and I felt that despite his “nice guy” personality we were pretty compatible. 

I was thinkinng of getting back in touch with him during the winter holidays, do you think that’s a good idea? Sure he probably will have moved on but if not, how should I proceed?

I suddenly asked myself, Is there a way to verify the basics about a guy before I waste my time on a potentially boring shitty date with someone who might turn out to be a weirdo?

&amp;nbsp;

Enter, The Pre-Interview.

&amp;nbsp;

I've used pre-interviews to screen candidates at work, and also to get jobs myself. They are excellent tools for quickly screening unworthy candidates.

&amp;nbsp;

For those of you who have never interviewed or been interviewed using a prescreen, typically myself and another manager would take turns talking to the candidate on the phone or videochat. Usually no more than 10 - 15 minutes. We would ask basic questions and then reconvene after the interview to rank them against other candidates. We would talk about strengths/weaknesses and come up with a few questions we would ask the candidate if we were to invite them in for a face-to-face interview.

&amp;nbsp;

Overtime, I have learned that pre-interviews are absolutely crucial to hiring the right candidate, and it has to do with fallibility of human nature. 

&amp;nbsp;

Doing a phone or skype interview creates enough emotional distance for you to be objective in your evaluation. This becomes harder with face-to-face interviews. 

&amp;nbsp;

Believe it or not, even very seasoned managers sometimes truly struggle with objectivity when it comes to hiring in face-to-face interviews. I've actually had managers hire people based on emotion only for that person to be a terrible employee that gives them absolute hell everyday.

&amp;nbsp;

You would also not believe the kinds of things people reveal in face-to-face interviews. Sometimes it's as morbid as Sick family members, kids, etc. Things that would really tug on the heartstrings and make everyone but a robot want to root for a candidate to win. On the other hand, Some people have sparkling and fun personalities that make it easy to gloss over all their flaws.

&amp;nbsp;

Problem was, no matter how much you like or want to help someone, it was obvious in the interview they were totally unqualified for the job as written. Sometimes they couldn't answer basic technical specifications of the job or displayed troubling lack of awareness about the appropriateness of certain topics that would later be a problem.

&amp;nbsp;

It's harder to reject candidates after you've heard their life story, hopes, and dreams. It just is.

&amp;nbsp;

The value of the pre-interview is cutting to the facts without all the other things to distract you. 

&amp;nbsp;

The Pre-Interview:

&amp;nbsp;

The components of a pre-interview are as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

**1. Skype or Facetime before going on a formal date**

Everyone hates to show up to a date only to see a person who looks nothing like their pictures or gives you a weird creepy vibe and having to make an excuse to leave. Skype and Facetime sets this process to easy mode. You look at each other, hear each others' voice, etc and you'll be able to tell within a few minutes if this is a man you would be interested in seeing further based on physical attraction.

(Of course, if you out here catfishing knowing full well you don't look like your pictures then skip this part because you're going to want to keep the element of surprise going, but I wouldn't recommend it in general.) 


**2. Limit the conversation to 20 minutes or less.**

This conversation should be to verify the basics - where he lives, what he does, where he works, confirm that he's single, etc, and ask what he's looking for.

If he attempts to take over the conversation, steer it back to where you want it to go. If he continues to be evasive or pushy, then you know to throw that fish back in the water, he's playing games, doesn't respect boundaries, or doesn't have his shit together.

Talk long enough to get a general vibe for him, but not long enough to get too deep.

Love bombers know that time spent = emotional investment which is why they usually try to monopolize you upfront. Don't allow them to do this.

You do not want to talk long enough to give yourself time to emotionally invest before he takes you on a formal date.

Be aware of these Red flags/Full stops:
Answers every question with a question
Attempts to neg or tease you right off the bat
Steers the conversation to be overly sexual
Evasive in answering basic questions
Pushy or aggressive in any way when you set a boundary
If he starts any conversation with some general negativity about women or sarcasm
Any of the behaviors above should be an immediate drop. If he can't keep it together for a 20 minute interview then he's totally fugazi, sis.

If there's anything you want to know further make a mental or physical note to ask him on your full date. Give yourself time to think him over properly and thoroughly consider if you actually want a second date.

**3. Dictate very clearly the parameters in which you are willing to leave your house to see him**

The general principle here is

Never leave your house for free for man who’s not your boyfriend

This is your time to set the standard to which you expect to be treated. Do not leave your house for any of the following:

NO NETFLIX &amp; CHILL
NO CAR DATES
NO COFFEE DATES
NO HOUSE DATES

There is no such thing as ""let's just have a lowkey date and see where it goes"". You must set the standard early. You cannot go back and attempt to raise the standard later on.

To help him out, tell him the kinds of things you like, where you want to go, anything you saw that caught your interest, etc.

It's his job to make that happen for you if you want to show up. Why should you waste your time on a boring ass date? Find something you genuinely want to do and make these dudes pay for it. Even if the date doesn't go well, at least you got to try something you wanted to.

If he scoffs at any of your suggestions, drop him. He's cheap, a time waster, just here for easy pussy, etc. This is supposed to be his time to impress you with his creativity, thoughtfulness, class, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

**So to recap:

Doing pre-interviews allows you to talk to 3-4 guys in an hour to verify their attractiveness, screen for red flags, and set the parameters and expectations as to which you're willing to meet them while maintaining enough emotional distance to be objective. It's also much safer!**",4194,GIRL GAME PT 2: The Value Of the Pre-Interview,0,2019-09-14 03:50:52,,

I dumped him 3 weeks later and I met my current BF 29M and have been dating seriously for a few months. Things are getting serious. Ex-fiance added this new guy on social media and now both men are acting different, in ways that benefit me. In short: Date like you don't give a fuck AND MEAN IT. Once you do this, they will start treating you better and giving a shit about you :( :( :(. 

&amp;#x200B;

VENT/RANT INCOMING. Warning: LONG

&amp;#x200B;

I (26F) dated my ex (36M) for 2.5 years. It was obvious when I met him that he had commitment issues and I figured that was the reason he was still single at that age. He was tall, very very very handsome, and shredded physically. No children. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I feel for him and fell HARD.  I put my priorities in my OLD profiles and specifically told folks to swipe LEFT if they couldn't see themselves being married or having kids in their futures. Not going to belabor this point but basically I asked my ex where the relationship was going at the 1 year mark because marriage and kids are something I want in my life objectively one day and I wanted us to be moving in that direction. I previously dated a different ex (26M) for 10 years who I was engaged to for 6 years. It was a complete waste of time and that one ended badly and I didn't want my relationship with this ex to turn out the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

So after ""the talk"" at 1 year - he admitted that marriage and kids weren't for him. I felt stupid and wanted to ""change his mind"" (*NEVER EVER EVER TRY TO CHANGE THEIR MIND!!!! Believe them and leave them the first time!!!!*). At the 1.8 year mark, I revisited ""the talk"" and told him I wanted a ring or I wanted out. He took 1 month to give me a ring, but not without a HUGE fight and me basically packing my shit and leaving it in boxes and looking at other places to live. We set a wedding date for 6 months later, a date he picked himself. Well that date approaches quickly and it was obvious that he didn't want to be married. No plans for the wedding, no plans for the honeymoon. No social media updates. Nothing. I opted ""to go to a court house and sign the papers and have a ceremony later"" when I figured he was nervous. Well the day came and passed. He didn't give a fuck. Acted cold and distant. Like nothing important was supposed to happen that day.

&amp;#x200B;

IT BROKE ME. I WAS SHATTERED. I promised myself either marry this asshole or leave him since marriage and kids are important to me. Well it was hard. At noon on the supposed ""wedding date"", I died on the inside and decided I didn't want to be around him anymore while he pretended like nothing was going to happen and nothing important was being planned.

&amp;#x200B;

 I went to the mall, alone,  to walk around and ""think"". After I cried in a Victoria's Secret dressing room for 45 minutes, I called my sister and she told me that I had to l eave, because this is a pattern. This is literally what happened with my first ex who strung me along for 10 years. So for the next 2 weeks, I told him I was going to stay at my parents place, ""to think about this relationship"". He literally said ""ok"" and didn't give a fuck. Didn't put in any effort to text or call me. I felt so hurt. NOT ONE PEEP from his end about the wedding date HE PICKED. I was pissed at how little he seemed to care about me or this relationship or his own wedding date that was supposed to happen. The longer I stayed with my parents, the angrier and more pissed off I felt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I decided I wanted out. As soon as I came back to the house, I waited for him to go to work, packed all of my shit, and left. I was gone for 2 days and not one message from this asshole. He didn't give a shit. Then I get a text saying the locks were changed, and then nothing. A week later, I updated my Facebook status to ""single"". I figured he didn't care so neither did I.... but apparently that triggered him. He began messaging and messaging. Begging for me back. I left them all unread and turned off my notifications for FB. I had time since I took a bunch of annual leave from work ""to get married / honeymoon"". I updated my status to single, set up online dating app profiles and started going on dates. The men I was dating would post stuff to social media, and this made my ex even more needy and crazy about me. He continued bombarding me with messages that were left unread while I dated around. I learned to date like IDGAF and just wanted to have fun. I went out with maybe 2 guys and both of them were very VERY into me. One of them told me they wanted to be exclusive after the second date (my now boyfriend). It was unlike him since he was initially ""ghosty"" and  I was in a ""this isn't serious"" mentality and then he literally told me he loved me like 2 weeks after being ""official"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been dating this guy for about 1.5 months now and we've been all over each other's social medias. 2 weeks ago, I noticed that he started responding quicker, he started doing more, and wanted to hang out more often and do more elaborate, more romantic stuff.  Last night, I noticed that I couldn't see my BF's ""friends"" list anymore. Then I noticed that he and my ex-fiance were friends. Why would he do that?? Escalate the level of attention he gives me and then add my ex??? I plan on talking to him about it this week because IDK what my ex is telling this guy, and I really do love him.",4115,My (26F) ex-fiance (36M) added my current BF (29M) on Facebook,0,2019-09-13 18:57:54,,

He does this fucked up thing where he gas lights me and then I do this thing where I sugar coat everything that comes out of my mouth... it’s a disastrous combination.

He was dismissive of me the other day and then proceeded to gas light me after I subtly spoke back to him. So, I decided not to take it that time. I knew we would be stuck in the same place if I didn’t learn to respect myself and just SPEAK UP. So, I finally did it... I outright called him a “fucking dick” (pardon my French). Maybe it wasn’t the best language but at least I finally spoke up and I bet he respects me more now... yikes. I hate that I’m seeing this as a step lol.

Ladies, I do want him back (whether I should or not). Do you think I did the right thing OR should I have held my tongue? I feel like I took it too far but I also think he needed a slap in the face so he could finally know that his behavior isn’t okay &amp; hopefully not repeat it again.

One of the mistakes that many people make on first dates is expecting too much. It is much better to hope that the date works out, but remain realistic. Not every date has to lead to a great romance. Go into the date with the expectation of fun. Adopt the attitude that meeting new people is a pleasure and not something to fear.

### Be Yourself

Many people make the mistake of trying to impress their dating partner, and are not as truthful as they should be. Don't get into a situation with no exit strategy. After all, if the relationship progresses, your date will eventually find out that you are not on the fast track to the Supreme Court, and that you actually live with your mother and her three cats. There is never a good reason to lie during a date, especially if it is to impress the other person. A date will be a lot more fun if you are able to relax and be yourself. When you pretend to be someone that you aren't, you are only adding to your own stress. A first date is hard enough.

### Breaking the Ice

Chances are, he's feeling just as nervous as you are. A good way to break the ice on a first date is to be up-front and acknowledge the awkwardness. It might even provide your date with a chance to breathe a much-appreciated sigh of relief.

### Conversation

Men appreciate a good listener, so let him talk. Ask open-ended questions that prompt him to talk about himself. For instance, don't simply ask if your date enjoyed the art exhibit: The only answer you will get is yes or no. Instead, ask him what he liked about it. Which piece was his favorite, and why? Asking questions is a way to get the conversation rolling. Ask where he grew up, where he went to school, what kind of music or movies he enjoys.

### Be Mysterious

Neediness is the kiss of death. As much as you might want to see him again, it is best if you let him suggest the next meeting. If he is interested, he will make sure to call you again or even set up the next date before the first one is finished. This strategy may seem a little retro, but men (actually, most people) tend to want things that seem a little out of reach. They want a woman who challenges them. Don't be so available, and let him wonder.

&amp;#x200B;

Go get a spell

for you to get whoever you want, and you know that you share everything in common with the person, it is never a bad idea to use a spell on him or her, i mean white magic spell that will never harm any parties.  
First, you need to request for a pyschic reading to know if you people are actually compatible, after that ask your spiritual leader the best spell to use on him that will make him look to your direction and get your attention.  
Dont be a losser go get a spell and get whatever things you want any how any way that won't harm you. you can get good and real spell here  [REAL AND LEGITIMATE SPELL CASTER](https://realspellcaster247.com)  any kind of spell work to improve your life and protect your self from evil is available there.

I look forward to see you succeed.

I just turned 30 and I have more than 1x my income saved, but I grew up not well off, and have a lot of money based anxiety. I also live somewhere where rent is much higher than average, so I feel weird about spending over half my income on rent, even though I make a good amount. 

I have lived with different friend groups over the past 5 years. Both times I stopped living with them because they got married, so it was the natural break. 
The roommates I live with now are long time friends as well. However, now that I'm coming into my own, I realize ways that they aren't emotionally mature, which comes out as drama. I don't engage with it the best I can, and it's not often, but last week they ended up both being passive aggressive about an issue. We eventually came to a resolution after I emotionally walked them through it and set boundaries. I'm very """"""chill"""""" so I really didn't mind but it occurred to me that... I don't need to be people's parents anymore. They also have talked about maybe moving back with their parents after our lease is up (not for a long time) so I wouldn't have to worry about them feeling abandoned, since they already have potential plans. 

It slowly dawned on me that I could be the one to decide it was time to leave, and live alone next year. Yes, I will not be able to save as much, but I would also be able to get a pet and play my instruments, have a ton of plants, decorate how I want, without worrying about judgement, or inconveniencing anyone. I realized that the thought of getting to nest made me Happy. 

I would also just feel more ""adult."" 

I felt before like I'd never be able to afford to live alone without a partner, but now I'm realizing there's no sense in waiting if living alone is going to make me happy it's worth the extra money. 

It feels a little silly to be an adult and be like ""wow it just occurred to me, I'm allowed to do this thing?!""

I felt the same way when I traveled abroad alone. Like.... Is anyone going to try and stop me? No? Ok.

I know this post is going to be very ""duh, obviously"" to most of you but it feels so liberating when I can -feel- how stupid they all are.

Here's an incomplete list of ""duh"" insecurities that are the result of a patriarchal country and household:

- I'm not weird for disliking the attention of scrotes.
- I don't need to have the ideal body in the eyes of society to be beautiful.
- I don't HAVE to be grateful for compliments.
- Compliments aren't always good and they're often shallow and manipulative, especially when coming from men.
- I'm not a bitch, I just have boundaries.
- My standards are not too high.
- I don't need to settle for a decent life if I want to pursue something more.
- I'm not a loser or lack romantic experience because I haven't gone on a lot of dates.
- It's perfectly fine to ignore and block men I don't want to talk to.
- Men are not supposed to cheat.
- Porn is disgusting and abnormal.
- Pickmes aren't cool.
- I don't need to engage in ONS to be good in bed.
- ""communicate!!"" doesn't work a lot of the time.
- Men aren't oblivious.
- ""Alpha"" men is complete bullshit and usually translates to ""not respecting the wishes of women"", and they are NOT cool. LVMs just love to mark HVMs as betas behind their back because they're insecure.
- ""men will be men"" is something I should never accept.

And the list goes on. 

I grew up as the silent suffering type. I attempted to be open with my family about my high standards and dare I say innate FDS attitude at first, but then I was called a troubled teenager and immature. FDS and the handbook are things I will always live by, not even my family could indoctrinate me out of it BUT they did cause massive insecurities within me.

 My father, especially, tried to constantly convince me that men are losers unless they sleep with a lot of women and are betas if they respect the wish of a woman. My values have been critiqued forever and undermined with ""you'll grow out of it"", so I closed myself off completely.

Now he wonders why I never tell him anything about my romantic life and considers it a mistake to do so. I won't take any bullshit from anyone because FDS is living proof that I'm right and I don't HAVE to lead a pickme life.

Nothing from this handbook should have been news to me and I shouldn't have had to be alone before this sub. All of this should be normal, basic knowledge.

Half rant half level up, I wanted to get this off my chest officially as if writing a declaration.",95399,After having found FDS and a HVM I can finally see how many insecurities I have due to growing up in a non-feminist household and society.,0,,,

I've been working hard on inculcating a resting bitch/at least unapproachable face. With my stature and usually approachable expression, I carry a giant waving sixty foot high flag for every weirdo in the state to gravitate to, otherwise. I've even posted here about this before. 

Because of an unrelated topic, I've been maintaining a very curt, icily polite demeanor at home as well, because my Pickmeisha of a flatmate was trampling all over my boundaries. I grew tired of her incessant negativity, griping, and open jealousy and competition, and emotionally cut her off. Communication is restricted to the basics, and that's it. 

But that has kinda taken a toll on me, because I'm an ex-pickme myself, not to mention a recovering pushover and hopeless doormat till recently. After a few weeks of being cold to her (which honestly isn't even 25% of what she deserves, but I'm stuck here), something I saw about kindness last night unsettled my stance a little. And I was wondering today whether, in my search to be a harder, less vulnerable person, I'm compromising being kind, or losing my softness completely.       

Yeah, no. Less than half an hour after thinking that maybe I need to nicer in general after all, I was interrupted outside the post office by an annoying old scrote.  At least in his late seventies, barging in onto my bench and starting off with ''Young lady, where are you from?'' and proceeding to drone on for the next fifteen minutes easily, asking stupidly personal questions. At first I was polite because I thought that he was a neighbor, but nope. He did not shut up. And not only did he yammer on, he had the dangfuckingnabbed AUDACITY to first recommend that I go to a restaurant for 'a taste of home for me', then asking me to come with him to the restaurant. I stared him down and laughed very rudely at that, at which he mock-dramatically rolled his eyes and went, ''oh, you're laughing at me! I'm telling you, come! It'll be fun! In fact we could even take a trip to Spain!!''

 I smiled but with that disgusted, oh look there's something stuck on my shoe expression, and just picked up my things to leave. At which he got up and insisted that I take his card. I just said goodbye and walked away quickly, kicking myself mentally for having allowed him to talk to me at all. Not nice enough be damned, the Universe sent me a sign in my first moment of self doubt that the only way to get some peace outside is to be fucking unapproachable and fierce all the time. Scrotes never stop overstepping their bounds at the slightest hint of someone relenting. Neither do pickmes. The only option is to be ruthless, ruthless, ruthless. And it really showed me how much I've been slipping, too. What we learn growing up in the name of morality and politeness is nothing but being trained to ACCOMMODATE these buttwipes' advances and coddle their egos. They never learn, not when they're 17, not when they're 70. The only recourse is to a, not allow them the slightest foothold, and b, flick them out like a fly in the soup at the first sign that they're trash. Gah, I wish I would learn this faster, too.",95393,Resting Bitch Face is work worth the respite!,0,,,

Men get more pleasure from casual sex than we ever would, even with strict boundaries and expectations are conveyed, they rarely give a shit about getting us off if they are a LVM. 

When you start leveling up, there are going to be points where you are feeling frisky and want some type of sexual release or body loving. That's totally human and normal! What is not healthy, is allowing those feelings to dickmatize you into entertaining LVM or having them swindle you with sweet nothings and BS words to get into your pants then have you realize the mistake you had made because you are craving that feeling. 

Knowledge is power. So I want to encourage ALL OF YOU to spend at least a full month (30 days) of pure self-pleasure on your own accord. No other parties. Just you. Even if you are in a relationship, it's okay to love on yourself! **After 30 days consistent of this shit, you will be less inclined typically to entertain LVM because you will start increasing your sex game on your own and really see how worthless most men are once you get that inner confidence with your own body**! 

If you are ""hard to get off"" try it a bunch of different ways and get creative! Each day try something new. You will find out more about yourself and your body! It's very empowering. If you are going on a date and are fearful of making a learning moment of allowing a man to try anything beyond a kiss, take some time before your date to work on you (self-pleasure amirite) so you won't touch the forbidden fruit of a LVM. **We often want what we can't have as an unconscious self-sabotage attempt when we want instant results and are feeling low, but you deserve to have an amazing dream love with a HVM (or a happy live on your own as a vibrant Queen! whatever makes you fulfilled!) so don't settle for 5 mins of a pump-n-dump situation...that's not you anymore!** 

Any man who tries to shame you or make you feel bad about caring for your pleasure and enjoying that is complete trash. If they are threatened by a sex toy, they are trash...they should worry less about the equipment and more about why they are so fucking lazy and selfish in bed. 

I also want to share some sex toy resources that I found AMAZING. It helped me abstain from sex with LVM once I started committing to FDS fully and I hope it gives you similar success or confidence to keep being selective and never taking shit from LVM/NVM. 

I promise that once you get the hang of self-pleasure and leveling up with your past triggers, finding support, and affirming your worth--you will unleash a new realm of sexuality within yourself! I hope you all find that because you all deserve it.

*   [https://myplusone.com/product/plusone-personal-massager-6703/](https://myplusone.com/product/plusone-personal-massager-6703/)  Plus One vibe massage. This can be found in most drugstores and chains like Target/Walmart on a whim and I recommend fully! It's waterproof and rechargeable without a cord. It's usually under $30 USD most places too!

*  [https://hitachimagic.com/hitachi-magic-wand/magic-wand/](https://hitachimagic.com/hitachi-magic-wand/magic-wand/)  This is an OG for a reason and there are other options that are cordless. It comes with attachments. I just use the OG one and it's been a game changer as it was the first time I needed to fully change sheets right afterwards on my own. 10/10 would recommend. 
*  [https://myplusone.com/product/plusone-dual-vibrating-massager-6704/](https://myplusone.com/product/plusone-dual-vibrating-massager-6704/)  This is a Plus One dual massage and it will rock your world.

I was ok with it until I found out that he not only uses vapes but does smoke cigarettes. Both are damaging for your health but at the very least one smells like fruits. I established early on in our relationship that I’d like him to overcome his addiction and stop or I’d move on. 

He called me the other night to admit he feels not worthy of me and wants to be better for both himself and I. He’s starting his road to quitting immediately so he’ll be done with hitting any sort of vape by the time I return from a trip to my parent’s house. I told him he should wait until the weekend because he still has work and it’s finals week at our university. Nicotine withdrawals put him in an unpleasant mood from what he has said and I don’t think it’s smart of him to have withdrawals under the stress. He refused because he wants to be done with nicotine when I get back and if he waits a few more days he could still be suffering from them. 

I’ve spent my entire dating life always changing and trying to be worthy of some abusive LVM and I’ve lost my teenage years at the feet of them. To finally have a guy work hard to meet my expectations, no matter how challenging it will be, is so unbelievably amazing. 

He’s been improving himself since we started going out but this is the first serious lifestyle change that he’s doing. I know addiction is difficult and not easy to overcome. Being able to make a difference in his life without actively doing anything is wonderful.",95345,Finally having a man strive to reach your standards is much better than striving to meet the standards of a LVM,0,,,

I know very well that this person is manipulative and uses guilt tripping many times but not sure whether what he did today is gaslighting.

Lately it feels like this person is really bored and uninterested in our relationship so i sent a text asking about that. He said you’ve been doing the same thing.

I started to explain why i’ve been feeling this way. The reason is that he doesn’t make any effort to communicate with me in a healthier way. He just asks what i’m doing or how i am and disappears.

I mentioned that i find it weird when he has nothing to talk about all day long. He ignored everything else and kept blaming me because this one time i told him i have nothing to say after he kept replying with ‘yeah’ and the conversation was going nowhere.

After blaming me, he sent me a screenshot of something that didn’t have anything to do with the argument. He disappeared constantly from the argument which lead to unresolved issues.

I kept telling him what i’ve been feeling and i sent him a screenshot of something he posted because that was disrespectful to me. Once again, he completely ignored what i said and replied with ‘the post was just a joke’.

When i mentioned that he was ignoring what i’m saying he said ‘if you think throwing accusations at me will make things better i’m not sure about that’. He even said that i’m trying to make him feel guilty which wasn’t my intention at all.

He asked what the point of this fight is when i made it clear from the beginning. Instead of asking me about it, he blamed it on me.

I’ve been feeling really bad because of this. I’ve told him to be more communicative but nothing has changed so far. That’s why i felt the need to bring it up again. I don’t believe i attacked him or said something that i shouldn’t have said. I keep thinking that maybe i’m doing this the wrong way but am i though?",95334,Is this gaslighting?,0,,,

One of the best things about FDS is that we have a truly diverse group of women participating in this sub. We are very lucky that to have women from all walks of life providing their input; the added perspective really helps validate the commonality of the female experience worldwide.  

While our diversity is overall a great thing, it has presented a bit of a challenge when users want to discuss any issues specific to their social group. 

Often when users try to discuss topics pertaining to their culture, people who are not part of that culture will interject opinions that are often not helpful and/or based on ignorance of some of the nuances of that specific group. 

For example, when we have had conservative or muslim users discuss culturally specific issues, we get a lot of smack talk from our liberal and nonreligous users telling them to renounce their politics/religion, etc.  [As we've explained before, we don't have any loyalty to one particular ideology because we like to focus on strategy first and foremost.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/hhs6il/psa_this_is_not_a_sub_for_binary_political_or/)

We're a dating sub y'all--we're not going to be able to fight the entire geopolitical power structure in this space. Everyone starts their Level Up journey from a different place, and FDS will try its best to meet them wherever they are. 

With this in mind, we've created the ""Social Group Strategy"" flair. Use this flair if you would like to discuss aspects of your culture that you believe deserves special scrutiny.  

We would consider the following categories examples of social groups that would fall under this flair:

&amp;#x200B;

* Race
* Ethnicity
* Nationality
* Political Affiliation
* Religion
* Interest Groups
* Professions

Etc - 

If you are not part of that group, please do not participate in the thread unless specifically solicited by the author of the post. This is for members to discuss difficulties and create strategies specific to their particular in-group without outsiders ganging up on them to input their opinion. We will remove any comments that begin with ""Well I'm not part of X group, but..."" etc

If you are part of the in-group, please refrain from posting anything that would be too much of a blanket statement against men in that group such that if an outsider said it, it would be xenophobic or racist. As moderators, we would like to find a balance between allowing users to give legitimate cultural critique of their in-group politics but not letting it veer into racist territory. It's FDS vs LVM and no single group has a monopoly on Scrotes. They are \*all\* aggravating as fuck.

This is of course not an exact science, so mods reserve to the right to remove any threads we think are too inflammatory or don't serve a specific enough purpose. 

&amp;#x200B;

He cheated and humiliated her after 20yrs of marriage but somehow she’s has yet to find love and he barely facedany consequences or got any major karma. You can find this over and over again if you look around you. Why is that? Don’t you ladies feel like life is unnecessary harder for women just overall in almost every imaginable possible way. Even biologically we have it hard. Like imagine if men had to give birth, the world population would be in the 1000s and not in the billions. Or how we always have to wait for them to propose. Like they decide and only then do we decide or some bs! It just this and so much more billion other things. Sometimes just make you wonder like... does God not like us as much or something?

It had a lot to do with covid. Long story. 

We *do* have an agreement that there will be an engagement within two years of dating, which is mid-June of 2021.  We have the exact date circled on the calendar and he knows that I will leave if he hasn’t proposed by this date. 

Things are going ok, my primary issue with him is that he “doesn’t believe in marriage” which bothers me. Knowing that when he does propose it’ll only be to keep me and not because he genuinely wants to be my husband seriously bothers me. But I’ve made it clear that I do believe in marriage and that it’s a requirement to continue being with me.

The other issue I’m having is that he’s wanting to buy a house (now before we’re married) with his own money. The issue isn’t that I would have worry of putting money into a house that isn’t mine because I simply won’t do that and he knows this. I can’t afford the houses he’s looking at anyway.

Here’s my issue: I feel like he keeps thinking if he leapfrogs marriage and does all the other culturally agreed upon shit that comes with it, i.e., living together, homeownership, etc that that’ll be good enough and it’s allowing him to avoid the big scary “M word” in the room that terrifies him.

My other issue is that I’m not sure if I should allow my name to be on the mortgage (even though as I’ve said I will not financially support the purchase of the house), because what if I refuse to do this and we do marry? Will our home then not be my home as well but technically his alone since it was bought prior to marriage and is only in his name. OR should I refuse to allow my name on the mortgage because it’s silly to share a mortgage with someone you’re unmarried to and hope that we can refinance the home after marriage? OR should I put my foot down and insist that we buy a home together as husband and wife after marriage. I know this is probably the most logical conclusion but god I hate where we live now.

This maybe a question best suited for legal/real estate experts. I’m not sure.",96338,Engagement closing in (hopefully) advise on how to handle home ownership,0,,,

My ex-LVM broke up with me cause he “he loves me dearly but feels like he’s better single”. I was crushed and honestly exhibited a goddamn stupid amount of pickmeisha behavior because this was my first major breakup and just was devastated how a man could claim to love me so much, then just walk away. I figured I made a stupid amount of mistakes with him and so I needed to prove to him I was worth keeping around(I know fkin yikes).

So I helped him move, I had sex with him, I gave him every opportunity to spend time with me and support him emotionally. Eventually, though, I had enough being toyed around with and buckled up and blocked him on fb messenger(the only way we’ve communicated through our entire relationship). I thought that got the message across that I’m fkin done being his piece of meat that he can just use whenever is convenient for him. It hurt like hell to let him go but I did and instantly felt so much more respect for myself, and I felt FREE. 

Well of fkin course within 12 hours of me blocking him on messenger, he texted me with my cell number(he had my number, and I figured he’d never use it to contact me so I left it unblocked cause idk I just don’t like fully blocking people. Idiot move I know). Anyway, he contacted me saying things like “why did you block me? I didnt want that. I know I’ve not been the best to you lately but I’m just in a bad space and I don’t wanna be talking or hanging out with anyone lately. What can I do to make it up to you? I’m so sorry, I love and care about you. You’ve been so wonderful to me. I’m just so confused about how to treat you”. 

I ignored him for a while but my pickmeisha behavior kicked in and eventually I responded. He asked yesterday if we could get coffee today. I told him this morning, against my better judgment, that coffee would work. Well, then he responded shortly thereafter “I don’t think that’ll work today. I had a late start and have a few things going on.”

and of fucking course he said that. Of fucking course he just wanted to make sure I’d still be his little lap dog that would come running to him at the sound of his call. He didn’t want coffee, he just wanted to make sure I’d still be waiting for him. His plans are probably just to hang with his fkin friends and jerk off, like a normal day in his life. And he had a late start cause he was probably drinking all night and slept through a hangover. 

He could make an hour to respect me today if he really wanted to. But he won’t. All he’ll do is just try to stop my goddamn healing from him, just enough to keep me attached. 

Thank you FDS. I know I’ve been a fkin pickmeisha and I was willing to do so because I miss him. But I don’t miss him, I miss having a person to call my own and I miss the void he left. But FUCK THAT. 

I deserve better and I am blocking his ass in every possible way. He’s missing out on a fkin amazing woman and he knows it, but he will never put in the effort to treat me with respect cause I’ve taught him that he doesn’t need to for me to still be waiting for him to serve his needs at his request. 

Block their asses and move the fuck on, ladies. I’ve learned my lesson.",96304,Why to never let a LVM back into your life,0,,,

Coming to think of it now, I agree with what he said. I am not a Goddess, no matter how hard I tried to be one back then, reality had always reminded me about my mortality. 

When I looked at him, he did not act like a God either, more of being a King. In that sense, I realized that I am a Queen, not a servant to a master and not cow to a breeder who should not applogize on who I am.

I am a Queen because I just use it not to control men in my Kingdom, that is more of a Goddess mentality. I am a Queen because I want to preserve my honor, my dignity and my right to be seen as a human being. I have faults and I have made mistakes, but it doesn't mean that I should be treated like a cattle, who gets lashed when it is not following a crowd. 

I will stay a Queen to protect myself against: savages, con artists, mindless brutes, barbarians, and unforgiving Gods until I find a King who would open himself and just admits that he is also a commoner like me deep inside and who would prefer that I am is common wife while projecting Queen and Kingship to outsiders so that we protect our Kingdom, which is our bond and relationship.

Last night I read a Reddit post of a young boy overhearing his younger brother talking to his friend about raping a girl he liked in school and tying her up in his basement. His older brother was shocked and talked about how happy and innocent he was a year ago.  His brother started to change and angerily label himself as an incel once he reached puberty and wasn't getting the attention of girls he liked.

However, my whole life I've heard men and women say,

"" I'm so scared of having a daughter! ""

And yesterday I thought about why? Why would people be scared of having a daughter over a son? Statistically, a son you produce is more likely to murder, rape and have extreme anti-social personality traits over a daughter. 

Than I realized that most parents don't want a daughter because they don't want to deal with the consequences that will come from their daughter's interaction with  sociopathic men.

The don't want their daughters to be raped. They don't want they daughters to be abused or killed. They don't want their daughters to be degraded. They don't want their daughters to be dishonored. At who's hands though? 

Why aren't parents more worried about giving birth to sociopathic sons? Sons that will do the raping, killing, abusing, and degrading of others women, childern and men??

I'm deeply concerned about how boys are growing up in our modern world. With easy access to the  internet, young boys are already exposed to violent and degrading porn; forums that contain communities of angry men; access to a range of extreme ideologies; violent and sexualized images and videos and much more.

How can young boys minds be protected from all this? How can daughters be protected from this new generation of angry, violent and porn-addicted boys? How will dating look like for the next generation of kids? 

I am much more terrified of bringing a son into this world than a daughter. I can teach my daughter to protect herself and have self-worth. I can try my best with my son but the world (especially the internet) is a huge challenge that will come in the way.

What do you guys think? How will dating look like for  the next generation that lived their whole with the internet?",96281,The thought of having a son terrifies me. Dating in the future will be dreadful for the new generation.,0,,,

So there's a not-so-secret conspiracy from all the more mainstream feminist and female oriented subs to ice out FDS under the premise that we're ""extreme"" and ""not real feminists"".

First of all, many of these female subs are modded by men, who clearly have a vested interest in policing women's thoughts and behaviors to their benefit. And since men stay perched on all the female subs ready to stomp on our clits all day every day for expressing opinions, pro-female comments and posts are disproportionately reported and removed.

Secondly, I'd like to point out that FDS is not even a specifically feminist theory sub, we’re a dating sub. We don’t pretend to represent any group other than ourselves, although many users would consider themselves feminist.

But apparently to the Reddit feminists at [r/twoxchromosomes](https://www.reddit.com/r/twoxchromosomes/) and [r/feminism](https://www.reddit.com/r/feminism/), and [r/askfeminists](https://www.reddit.com/r/askfeminists/) there is only one way to be a “true” feminist and it’s settled despite the fact there has always been disagreements on several issues that are open for debate. You can’t even talk about varying schools of thought on feminism on the feminist subs without being banned. You know why? Because most of them don't know shit about feminism beyond a fake media crafted brand made to palatable to men to push capitalist and political agendas. They don’t want to talk about real feminist theory; challenge their narrative with actual feminist theory (even liberal feminism!) and expect a ban.

They also exclude a large portion of women from their brand of feminism and yet they still think they're entitled to speak for ALL feminists while pointing fingers at us that because we're not ""inclusive"" enough and are ""judgmental"" of women's choices.

They accuse us of being exclusive and judgmental to women for being ""pickmeishas"" but let any woman disagree with promoting the idea of sex work as empowering or criticize pornography and suddenly we're SWERFs who hate women and can't be feminists anymore. If we are skeptical of misogyny disguised as kink culture, we're sex negative and don't think women can make decisions. If we think men should pay on dates, we're setting women's equality back. If we think reproductive labor is work then we're reducing women to our vaginas. If working class women and women of color think your shitty ""sex pozzy"" values are creating more problems for them than they solve and disproportionately effecting them negatively such that they are ill advised values to push, we're slut shaming. If we suggest self responsibility and actionable empowerment as a solution instead of perpetual victimhood politics and pointless ineffectual thinkpieces, we hate women and blame them for all the problems in the world.

So surprise, surprise, turns out the ""inclusive"" Reddit feminist police DO IN FACT have women they exclude as they \*think\* they are counterproductive to the goal of female equality. They even have cute little slurs and names to call us when we disagree! How judgmental and non-inclusive of them!

The cognitive dissonance in pretending to be inclusive while actively stomping out dissent for your personal narrative is astounding. Sounds like they’re just mad we exclude Pickmeishas instead of going on SWERF and TERF hunts like them and wallowing in victim politics. We don't exclude the women they exclude and therefore we're the ""wrong"" kind of feminists.

FDS advocates being who the fuck you want, doing what the fuck you want, and letting men know if they want to be a part of that they better add substantially to the experience or get bent. We're not just picking random men to hang out with forever; we're picking men we intend to father children with. That is a whole different level of investment in a person, so we demand a much higher investment back. And yes that mean's men paying for dates, contributing financially and otherwise demonstrating they're fit enough to have their offspring make it to the next generation. Why? Because we're the deciders, and we get to decide the decisions, and nature didn't make sexual and reproductive labor fair, and therefore we aren't either.

If you don't f feel confident your pussy is worth a $30 dollar dinner date and it makes you ""uncomfortable"" when men pay that's on you sis. Feel real sorry for ya. These same feminists will Promote sex work as an avenue of female empowerment but discourage women from expecting men to financially invest in relationships and it makes absolutely no sense. So let me get this straight, if I get paid to put on a school girl costume and call men daddy while being slapped in the face and then sell the video on the internet for strange scrotes to fap to, I’m more feminist than if I refuse to pay on dates and only date men who can carry more financial load? This is some Clown logic.

We're not here trying to find new objects to stick up our vaginas on our onlyfans livestream so we can make rent this month and instead letting men know they can pay that shit and then some and they \*maybe\* might get to continue to enjoy our presence. Dudes are out here paying hundreds of dollars to sniff strangers' panties but for some reason FDSers are the outrageous ones. I would think the absolute indignity of making yourself into a sex object specifically tailored for male consumption would be the more problematic and less effective road to travel to equality but apparently that's SWERF logic and setting women back. K' cool sis let us know how it works out.

If we want to go see the effects of stupid liberal feminist ""equality"" logic when it comes to sexual relationships all we have to do is wander over to [r/breakingmom](https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/). Apparently, they've placed us on a ban bot because they got tired of us trying to help them get a clue.

You know why y'all broke down broke ass moms are over on that sub crying right now? Because you failed to vet the loser you let seed you up because you thought all his couch creature behavior was adorbs when you were a childless couple but now your actual children demand attention you're finding out you've actually been single this whole time. Well sis, did you make sure he was capable of taking initiative? You've been up all night with the baby for the third night in a row and meanwhile your man's moping around the house crying about MUH PENIS and in our DMs on Tinder pretending to have an open relationship.

Honest to god some of y'all sound like you went and dusted off some dude passed out on a park bench and made him your baby's fav-ah.

You all may not like our methods, but the popularity of our sub should suggest that clearly there is a large population of women who are underserved by libfem culture and ideology. Mostly, because its ideologically incongruous, male pandering, and engaging in full on sex difference denialism at this point.

If your feminism isn't pissing men off at times then it's not real empowerment, sis. You know what power feels like?

12443,TheOGJammies,Ruthless Strategist,2020-09-16 08:56:47,2020-09-16 08:56:58,self.FemaleDatingStrategy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/itrxok/dear_reddit_libfems_were_not_fake_feminists/,itrxok,False,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/itrxok/dear_reddit_libfems_were_not_fake_feminists/,False,False,4,FemaleDatingStrategy,t5_xaiot,1,"So there's a not-so-secret conspiracy from all the more mainstream feminist and female oriented subs to ice out FDS under the premise that we're ""extreme"" and ""not real feminists"".

First of all, many of these female subs are modded by men, who clearly have a vested interest in policing women's thoughts and behaviors to their benefit.  And since men stay perched on all the female subs ready to stomp on our clits all day every day for expressing opinions, pro-female comments and posts are disproportionately reported and removed. 

Secondly, I'd like to point out that FDS is not even a specifically feminist theory sub, we’re a dating sub. We don’t pretend to represent any group other than ourselves, although many users would consider themselves feminist. 

But apparently to the Reddit feminists at r/twoxchromosomes and r/feminism, and r/askfeminists  there is only one way to be a “true” feminist and it’s settled despite the fact there has always been disagreements on several issues that are open for debate. You can’t even talk about varying schools of thought on feminism on the feminist subs without being banned. You know why? Because most of them don't know shit about feminism beyond a fake media crafted brand made to palatable to men to push capitalist and political agendas.  They don’t want to talk about real feminist theory; challenge their narrative with actual feminist theory (even liberal feminism!) and expect a ban. 

 They also exclude a large portion of women from their brand of feminism and yet they still think they're entitled to speak for ALL feminists while pointing fingers at us that because we're not ""inclusive"" enough and are ""judgmental"" of women's choices.

They accuse us of being exclusive and judgmental to women for being ""pickmeishas"" but let any woman disagree with promoting the idea of sex work as empowering or criticize pornography and suddenly we're SWERFs who hate women and can't be feminists anymore. If we are skeptical of misogyny disguised as kink culture, we're sex negative and don't think women can make decisions.  If  we think men should pay on dates, we're setting women's equality back. If we think reproductive labor is work then we're reducing women to our vaginas. If working class women and women of color think your shitty ""sex pozzy"" values are creating more problems for them than they solve and disproportionately effecting them negatively such that they are ill advised values to push, we're slut shaming. If we suggest self responsibility and actionable empowerment as a solution instead of perpetual victimhood politics and pointless ineffectual thinkpieces, we hate women and blame them for all the problems in the world.

So surprise, surprise, turns out the ""inclusive"" Reddit feminist police DO IN FACT have women they exclude as they \*think\* they are counterproductive to the goal of female equality.  They even have cute little slurs and names to call us when we disagree!  How judgmental and non-inclusive of them! 

The cognitive dissonance in pretending to be inclusive while actively stomping out dissent for your personal narrative is astounding. Sounds like they’re just mad we exclude Pickmeishas instead of going on SWERF and TERF hunts like them and wallowing in victim politics. We don't exclude the women they exclude and therefore we're  the ""wrong"" kind of feminists.  

FDS advocates being who the fuck you want, doing what the fuck you want, and letting men know if they want to be a part of that they better add substantially to the experience or get bent. We're not just picking random men to hang out with forever; we're picking men we intend to father children with.   That is a whole different level of investment in a person, so we demand a much higher investment back. And yes that mean's men paying for dates, contributing financially and otherwise demonstrating they're fit enough to have their offspring make it to the next generation.  Why? Because we're the deciders, and we get to decide the decisions, and nature didn't make sexual and reproductive labor fair, and therefore we aren't either.  

 If you don't f feel confident your pussy is  worth a $30 dollar dinner date and it makes you ""uncomfortable"" when men pay that's on you sis. Feel real sorry for ya.  These same feminists will Promote sex work as an avenue of female empowerment but discourage women from expecting men to financially invest in relationships and it makes absolutely no sense.  So let me get this straight, if I get paid to put on a school girl costume and call men daddy while being slapped in the face and then sell the video on the internet for strange scrotes to fap to,  I’m more feminist than if I refuse to pay on dates and only date men who can carry more financial load?  This is some Clown logic.  

We're not here trying to find new objects to stick up our vaginas on our onlyfans livestream so we can make rent this month and instead letting men know they can pay that shit and then some and they \*maybe\* might get to continue to enjoy our presence. Dudes are out here paying hundreds of dollars to sniff strangers' panties but for some reason FDSers are the outrageous ones. I would think the absolute indignity of making yourself into a sex object specifically tailored for male consumption would be the more problematic and less effective road to travel to equality but apparently that's SWERF logic and setting women back. K' cool sis let us know how it works out. 

If we want to go see the effects of stupid liberal feminist ""equality"" logic when it comes to sexual relationships all we have to do is wander over to r/breakingmom. Apparently, they've placed us on a ban bot because they got tired of us trying to help them get a clue.   

You know why y'all broke down broke ass moms are over on that sub crying right now? Because you failed to vet the loser you let seed you up because you thought all his couch creature behavior was adorbs when you were a childless couple but now your actual children demand attention you're finding out you've actually been single this whole time.  Well sis, did you make sure he was capable of taking initiative? You've been up all night with the baby for the third night in a row and meanwhile your man's moping around the house crying about MUH PENIS and in our DMs on Tinder pretending to have an open relationship. 

Honest to god some of y'all sound like you went and dusted off some dude passed out on a park bench and made him your baby's fav-ah.

You all may not like our methods, but the popularity of our sub should suggest that clearly there is a large population of women who are underserved by libfem culture and ideology. Mostly, because its ideologically incongruous, male pandering, and engaging in full on sex difference denialism at this point.

If your feminism isn't pissing men off at times then it's not real empowerment, sis. You know what power feels like?

When you've stumbled upon some real power, you will know because the scrotes will be frothing mad. This is what empowerment looks like. You want power? Then demand it and be consistent about it.

The vast majority of women are, either through conditioning or poor personal choice or a combination thereof, lacking in self-respect and willing to date men who are dangerous to them and to their children. The majority of *people* aren't fit to be truly good parents, to raise moral and principled children. They lack moral clarity, logic, and common sense / compassion. Most people pass their traumas onto their children, including women, which is why it's so hard to break generational cycles, and why breaking them is the exception rather than the rule.

But here's the difference. Bad men are orders of magnitude more destructive than ""bad"" women. When we say 99% of men aren't fit for marriage, we mean that in terms of abuse, rape, sexually driven cheating, and violence. When I say most women aren't fit for marriage either, the bar for even ""unfit"" women is much higher, because even the *absolute worst* women aren't committing rape and murder. 

Women who lack moral clarity and self-respect are everywhere. They're one of the reasons why men get away with horrific crimes, why daughters are coaxed into marrying men unworthy of them. But even the worst women can't compete with moderately bad men. There is no comparison. 99% of men are unfit for relationships because they have strong potential to be downright dangerous. The 99% of unfit women, however, are much less destructive of their own volition. Their destruction lies in complicity to male violence rather than active perpetration of violence.

What I'm getting at is that most *people* lack moral clarity, but this in no way negates the specificity of male violence. Women lacking moral clarity doesn't even come close to men lacking it.",98065,"99% of men aren't relationship material, but also...",0,,,

Not that it would impede my progress, I just want to be completely content and grown before I make decision to be with someone that seriously.

Actually, the majority of men do it and it is something so deeply rooted in our culture that most of the time, women don’t even notice they’re being gaslighted.

Here’s the thing:

Women are socially conditioned to collaborate and empathize. When our partner communicates his needs (at least, in a normal way) we simply look for ways to accommodate those. Most men on the other hand, with their fragile masculinity, are taught to always prove their masculinity by showing how different they are from women. Aka avoiding talking about or showing emotions altogether or avoiding the ‘soft stuff’ their female partners expect from them.

**The epitome of emasculation would be to be controlled by a woman, being ‘a doormat’. So this idea frightens most men. Which leaves them with the dilemma: control them, or be controlled.**

That’s why, whenever you’re trying to communicate your needs with a man or asking him to stop certain hurtful behaviour, chances are he will hop right into defense mode. He’ll blame you for nagging too much, being too emotional, being controlling, irrational, crazy, oversensitive etc. The persistence of this gender stereotype that women are these irrational, overdramatic beings definitely strengthens him in that.

Notice how 75 percent of the time when you’re trying to put something on the table with a man, the focus immediately is redirected to your personal flaws? And notice how, when and IF they eventually give in, they don’t see it as a problem that’s been fixed but as a battle they just lost? As instances where they had to sacrifice self respect? And rest assured, they WILL keep track of those lost battles and they WILL retaliate.

**Every dispute turns into a battle they have to win. Because if they don’t, they’re ‘weak’, ‘inferior’, or worse… Unmanly.**

The intensity of extent of the gaslighting may vary, but it usually occurs in situations where the woman is asking for communication, time together, helping her with something, to stop doing something that’s hurting here, emotional closeness, etc. You’re trying to communicate about these things that are completely normal and they will make you feel crazy for it.

**And eventually, it starts messing with your head and you actually feel crazy… By design.**

I actually feel sane and it's probably the first time in my life I felt sane for so long. In my relationships I felt like I was crazy all. the. time. Recently I tried dating someone and when I called him out for doing something super inconsiderate, he did that thing where he tried to redirect the spotlight to the way in which I called him out. That’s when I remembered how it felt, and when I realized that I haven’t felt crazy for 10 months (the current duration of my singlehood).

**This is why you need a truth commission, like Oprah does. Talk about the fights you have and ask them if you are indeed out of line. I bet 99% of the time, you're not.**

Also, never trust a man who says his exes are crazy. Because even if it’s true, he probably gaslighted them into insanity.

**You’re not too emotional. You’re not nagging. Stay woke, sis.**

I also have been single this whole time. I fully support myself plus a little extra on the side and it feels amazing! 

I live in a mountain town, with a VERY small population of year-round residents (think the size of your high school.) I also am in the service industry. I am constantly turning down my male coworkers advances, and I deal with constant sexual comments despite the fact I am the hardest working server at my restaurant. I have learned so much already, but I missed out on a lot of girl talk because my mother is a narcissist and was unable to be open with me growing up. Despite this, I have well developed social skills and networking so far has been very successful. 

I was wondering if you lovely ladies had any tips for dealing with social anxiety in public, tips for social advancement, or tips for dealing with being mostly alone in a new city.

I am wary of any guy who shells out compliments so casually and quickly. It sounds practiced and rehearsed lol! It means nothing, you are just a number!

If you get complimented on anything, just be like “thanks.” And do not compliment them back, or make it a big deal, act like you already know lol!

See r/seduction and r/redpill, probably more subs related to PUA.

I went to the mall today and got hit on by a “PUA in training”. Some short, awkward guy practicing a “set”.

“Hey I was watching you for a while and I think you are cute under that mask (he wore no mask) do you think I’m cute?” He was not lol!

I felt insulted lol. I just told him “have a nice day” and walked away lol.

I’m like “why the fuck was I the target? How can I not be?”

PUAs target SLOW WALKERS. 

In public, walk fast and with purpose ladies!

PUAs practice in high traffic public places not just clubs. It is not gonna be a “meet cute” 99% of the time.

I would be iffy about any rando who tries to talk to you in public, especially if you’re in a city.",99044,"PUAs still alive in 2020, compliments mean nothing.",0,,,

A LVM will bring out your worst traits. Your anxiety, your insecurity, your temper, your laziness, your passivity, your harmful coping mechanisms. 

A HVM will bring out your best traits. Your confidence, your wit, your backbone, your discipline, your kindness, your intelligence, your inner drive. He'll encourage those things in you and love those things about you. 

**This is because a HVM will meet you at your level. A LVM wants to drag you down to his.**

The importance of keeping yourself safe comes up all the time, but how many of us have been in situations when you look back and say “this could have really ended badly?”

* Lock your car door immediately upon entering your car. I’m from Cali, where car jacking are the norm, but I’ve also seen first hand women opening the car door so other women get pulled out and beat up; and men forcefully entering a car under the premise of wanting a phone number or not wanting the conversation to end. (The latter happened to me when I was 15 or so, I was riding with my friend and a 25 year old that she knew (but I didn’t) opened the door and tried to drag me out for my phone number.) I also don’t roll down the window when someone wishes to speak to me, I can hear them just fine. Same with my door. Living in NYC has taught me to never open the door, you can hear each other just fine. I’ve had plenty of conversations through a closed door lol. 

* walk with speed and purpose when going home late at night. I don’t speak to anyone, I can’t give you directions, I actually will walk around you, I will turn around if I need to. 

* make sure your windows and doors are safe. My mom, being from New York, Hayes the locks on my house growing up and replace locks with deadbolts (which was unheard of in my small town) and bought mini locks for the sliding doors and windows. We had the sliding doors that if you jimmied then (slightly lifted up and moved) they would open. The little locks, or even a broomstick handle, prevented the jimmy. 

* do not allow adults to speak to your children without telling you who they are. Do not allow tour children to wave at their fathers friends, and you don’t know who they are. One day, my daughter waved at a man. I didn’t see who it was because it happened quickly so I asked her who was he. She said “Daddy’s friend.” I told her not to wave at a man again, tf? Same with women, my exhusband has women🙄 sometimes approaching my daughter and I’m like “I don’t know you, don’t speak to my child.” They are always taken apart at my vicious nature lol but who speaks to a child knowing their parent is there and you’ve never met her? Issa no. 

* Try to wear proper footwear or at least bring it along. Walking alone at 3 in the morning with flip flops won’t help you if you get mugged or followed. 

* if your ex wants to meet up, try to do it in a public place and don’t get in the car with him. I always laughed this off until one day I got into the car with an ex and he went crazy. Driving recklessly, screaming, punching his phone, etc. I’ve even read stories on Reddit about women letting their ex in for “closure” and they get their ass beat. One woman’s story,(I’ll never forget it) she said he ex beat her for an hour straight and never spoke while doing it. 

We get comfortable in our surroundings, even me, I’m not from nyc but have lived here for over 20 years. But I remember that this city is high crime and when I visit home in California m, it is also high crime. Just different types of crimes. Does anyone have any stories/rules to add?

One was up for three days getting high on something other than life.

I (33F) have spent the last few years working on myself (to better my OWN life). I was never a full blown, classic Pickmeisha BUT I believed marriage was an end goal, believed I needed a man to be happy, and dated a lot of mediocre men. Seven years ago, I made a conscious vow to change my mindset. While the points I am writing out are certainly not any new profound research… I wrote this to share my specific experience in hopes it may help some of you. Here I go:

**BUILD YOUR OWN SELF-IDENTIFY**  
Take some time to evaluate all the types of relationships in your life and ask yourself *“What value is this relationship bringing in my life?”* For me, this wasn't a LVM, but a group of friends who were my identify. When they no longer brought me any value, I cut off 10-15 year friendships. It was painful, lonely, and the best thing I did for myself. It was the first step in building my own self-identity.  
   
**SURROUND YOURSELF WITH LIKE-MINDED WOMEN**  
I believe healthy female friendships are essential. As an adult, I made a conscious effort to make new female friends. I joined women’s only social groups on Meetup (met some of my now closest friends and fellow HVW this way). This was not easy for me (typically introverted and hated talking to strangers, but I knew it was important to do). My advice is put yourself out of you comfort zone... Join Meetup or Bumble BFF if those are popular in your city, find a wine club, a book club, join a female only sports league… whatever it is that interests you.

**GET IN TUNE WITH YOUR EMOTIONAL SIDE**   
If you’re someone who constantly has settled for LVM and/or believes you need to a man to be happy, it’s important to understand **“WHY”.** Uncovering this *“why”* is a part of the healing process especially if you've come out of a long-term relationship with a LVM or trying to break the constant ""I need a man"" thoughts. Dive deep. For me, it was a lot of reading and taking a few therapy sessions. The thing that benefited me the most was seeing a Shaman. Different things will work for different people and this will always be a work in progress.  
   
**EMPOWER YOURSELF AND TRAVEL ALONE**   
I strongly dislike when I hear someone say *“Oh I can’t do that. I have no one (a partner) to do it with”.* Change that attitude and do whatever the hell you want. My (old) dream was to go to Paris and I always thought I had to do it with a man. You know what I did as soon as I cut out toxic friends? I took my damn self to Paris. Alone. Now I’ve been back twice (and to many other countries around the world solo). This has done incredible things for my confidence and happiness. I am such an advocate for female solo travel. (Yes, it is perfectly safe assuming you have normal street smarts). So please, go on that trip YOU have been dreaming about (ok, maybe wait after COVID, but don’t wait for a man to take you!).

**UNDERSTAND SIMPLE STRATEGIES TO AVOID CONFUSION WITH MEN**   
Now, let me be clear, I don’t mean sit there and dissect their every move. But some healthy reading can avoid a lot of *“why didn’t he call me?”* thoughts. The FDS Recommend Reading Books lists some amazing reads. There are two books in particular that resonated with me. The first, “He’s Just Not That Into You”… I read this in my 20s, and while the concept seems so simple now, when I first read it, my mind was blown. I used to have pathetic thoughts like *“Why did he not ask me to be his girlfriend?”* and the answer was exactly what the book title is…simple. Stop looking for more elaborate answers.   
   
Another important FDS approved book that changed my life is “Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment”. Understanding your own attachment style is important in getting in tune with your emotional side, BUT it is also important for recognizing early signs of LVM. If you look at my post history, in a moment of weakness a month ago, I have a lengthy post asking for advice on another sub about a man who asked me on a date but then seemingly got cold feet. Clearly a LVM but in that moment of weakness, I was overwhelmed with feelings of confusion. I smacked myself out of it and identified his attachment style (a fearful avoidant which if you know about attachment styles is a “hell no”). My confusion disappeared and I moved the hell on. 

**HVM ARE NOT FICTION**  
They exist. I am currently single but my last relationship was with an amazing HVM. He came into my life when I finally built my own self-identity, got better in tune with my emotional side, and found new amazing female friendships. I did not do any of that stuff in hopes that a HWM would come… I did it all to be happier for ME. The man was the sprinkles to my large caramel, vanilla sundae with a cherry already on top. (Because let’s be real… no one NEEDS sprinkles on their ice cream). My point in saying this is don’t let anyone tell you that *“you will never find a man like that”*. And also if you're someone who believes *""all men are a-holes"",* that is also not a good mindset. Incredible HVM exist. BUT they are not the end goal. They will simply add to your already fulfilled life.  
   
Just some of my journey and learnings from the last few years! Like I said, I am a work in progress. I am by no means perfect and I’m going to have more moments of weakness to come, but I’ve come a long damn way and I hope this piece helps out you queens in some way. Sending lots of good energy all of your ways.",98987,How I became a HVW...(a work in progress),0,,,

When I used to do it, it was a non-productive tool for obsession (fuck food journals). But I got introduced to a new style and holy shit, I already feel so much better. 

The technique comes from Dr. Sarno and specially Nichole Sachs from the Cure for Chronic Pain (not a shill, just citing where I got it from) and it is essentially free writing from the voice of trapped feelings. Rage, anguish, sadness, injustice etc. I thought it would just make me feel worse but I feel so much lighter. 

You make three lists of bullet points - childhood/daily life/personality of anything relevant or comes up when you think about those things. Then pick a bullet point. Write about it for 20 minutes. Find the voice of the moment. Not your adult, educated, evolved lady voice but the five year old, the teenager, whatever. Rage on the page. Repeat yourself swear, whatever. 

And when you’re done. You never have to look at it again. Delete it. X it out. It doesn’t matter. It’s not something you need to reference. Or find the truth in. It’s all about liberating feelings and beliefs that you’re carrying around anyway and can come out as chronic pain, patterns, whatever. 

[Here](https://www.thecureforchronicpain.com/community/2017/1/23/healing-yourself-part-4-the-work) is the webpage that explains it more and her podcast “the cure for chronic pain” talks about it a lot. 

I never thought writing “fuck you” so many times would leave me spending the rest of my day floating on air.

He even told me that all my actions are microagressions towards skinnier girls apparently. Which is even more hilarious when you throw in the fact that I myself am a size 2. 

I know so many LVM who think feminism is the death of society ( except for their beloved sex positive lib fem). I find it extremely difficult to have conversations that get through to them about these things. They’re like a block wall to get through too and live their myth of assuming they know everything about the female experience and won’t listen when an actual female weighs in.

I recently had to defend myself multiple times in a reddit conversation of this guy claiming jealous women always cockblock other women. I told him the fact that 9/10 the women they are trying to pursue doesn’t want them and has clued her friend into getting her away without fear of triggering a man with rejection. Men just simply do not believe that women do this. If a woman wants to pursue you trust me when I say her friend isn’t going to stop her even if she was jealous. It’s just not realistic. Yet another explain of men refusing to believe our experience and then just tell us that know those are our “emotions” and not “facts”. Their world view is always me centred too, every political argument is why should I have to change why am I being forced to be a respectful human being, why should I have to control myself. It’s just a whole bunch of fragility and refusal to take any accountability for their action. I really wish I was more articulate so I could communicate better about what I’m getting at. 

It can be really disheartening to live in world where I am consistently told my experiences and emotions aren’t valid because of perceived fact. This is any ugly side of misogyny besides the horrors of male dominated rape and abuse. Just genuinely seeing how they perceive woman is baffling they infantilize us and refuse to view us as an individual who has an identity outside of their gaze.

I work in a predominantly male career. Throughout my short tenure, I have ALREADY seen other females in my profession make a mockery of the rest of us by acting like lovesick puppies/desperados. I'm not writing this to bash them, though, because I get it. Attention is nice (most of the time).

But it's attention from LVM!

I'm going to be real honest real quick, there are times when I would (and still sometimes do 🥴) think, ""Why am I not getting that kind of attention from guys? Am I not pretty enough?""

But then I come to realize... ""I am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as the sun."" (Jk, but thank you: Hunger Games, Katniss, and Collins 😉). 

And do I really (REALLY) want that kind of attention? Most of the time, these guys are scumbags. And I realized the girls they were giving their attention to.. were LVW, easy, no work, low self-esteem, no personality, pickmeishas (😅😂) etc. 

Thanks to this subreddit, and my subconscious (at least, I'd like to think), I figured out that something, SOMETHING, in these guys is telling them that I wouldn't put up with their bs, wouldn't react to them well, and/or wouldn't be interested in taking them up on their pitiful offers (and would probably tell their wives/girlfriends).

And I am. A-okay. With. That. 

I came to a pivotal point when some colleagues of mine and I were training one day, and one of our former colleagues was also helping train the new people who were at the center that day. We'll call the former colleague X, and my friend B. B and I walked up the sidewalk close to X and X turned his body away from us, paused a second, and walked back in to continue training. B and I looked at each other shrugged and started talking, and B suddenly says to me, ""If there are any pretty girls in there, X is probably going to flirt with them.""
And I looked at B and said, ""I don't understand why he never flirted with me.""
B didn't give me an answer, and we changed the subject after that.
(In all fairness to B, his ex-girlfriend cheated on him with X...X by the way, is married with a baby 🙄).

I would like to propose that maybe our grandmothers weren't wrong when they chose to wait until marriage to have sex. I've been reading on this site for a little while and have noticed the emphasis on the rigorous vetting process. However members will also frequently say that ""there's still no way to tell, even after months, years, after marriage, etc."". This can be little discouraging because deep down, we all want to find the partner who will love us forever and furthermore for us not to waste weeks/months/years of our lives. But I think there IS a solid way to tell, and that is waiting until marriage to have sex.

I understand that this method may seem a little extreme to most, and I'm not saying that it's 100% guaranteed. I am saying however that nothing will weed out LVM faster than seeing if they're actually willing to wait. If you find a man who is willing to wait and who shows consistent, unwavering love to you until then, then you'll KNOW that he actually chose you for you, and that he actually values you for who you are.

What do we gain from having sex with men without a true commitment anyway? It has been mentioned in the Handbook and on various posts that we as women actually have a lot more to risk when we get into sexual relationships. We're more susceptible to STD's, pregnancy, complications with abortion, being stigmatized for being single moms, and on top of it all we are naturally more emotional and more easily attached than the males are. It's also no secret that being on IUD/birth control SUCKS and wreaks a lot of havoc on our bodies. Do men have to subject THEIR bodies to any of these unnatural things? NO!

And I'm sure I'm not the only one who is sickened by the idea of having giving their body and ABSOLUTE BEST to a man, only to realize that he was LVM/NVM after the fact... 🤢

I believe that the ONLY real way to tell if a man truly loves you and is truly committed to you is to see that ring on your finger. I will admit that my main motivation for wanting to do this is my faith as a Christian. But I do think that this method may have its place here on FDS for those who are willing to try something different, even if they don't share the same beliefs that I have. 

I realize now that I have absolutely nothing to lose, because singleness is awesome, and I have FDS partly to thank for that. I've decided from now on that I'm going to wait. Who's with me? 😁",100604,Let's talk about waiting.,0,,,

There was one song that stood out in a unique way: [Young Hearts Run Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIbiG04X3ws) covered by Kim Myzelle.  It had such a festive upbeat vibe but the lyrics made me do a double take:

*What's the sense in sharing*  
*This one and only life?*  
*Endin' up just another lost and lonely wife*  
*You'll count up the years*  
*And they will be filled with tears*  
This just completely flipped the romantic narrative that I'd been conditioned to believe since birth.  Women warning other women of the harsh realities of ""love"".  These realities don't get depicted enough leaving so many women to fall into a trap: 

*You'll get the babies, but you won't have your man*  
*While he is busy loving every woman that he can, uh-huh*

and the best lines of all: 

***Don't be no fool when love really don't love you***  
*Don't love you*

*It's high time now, just one crack at life*  
*Who wants to live in, in trouble and strife*  
***My mind must be free***  
***To learn all I can about me****, uh-huh…* 

The message in this song always stuck with me even though it was drowned out by the sea of infatuation pick-me codependent love songs that fill the airwaves.  I'm glad I found a community spreading the message and protecting women and future generations!",100596,This song was my primer for FDS :: Young Hearts Run Free :: Submission request for FDS Spotify playlist?,0,,,

If it's something simple I just say ""thank you"" or ""this is nice, I appreciate it, thank you"" 

But if it's something a bit more major how would I express my thanks in a more in depth way but not go overboard? Is it necessary to even do so? Or is ""thank you"" pretty much always sufficient?

In the past I used to over praise the NVM ex demon and gush and big his head up, for the most no effort shite. He'd throw it in my face and say ""but what about me being awesome and the best?"" because I'd always say that.

So, if a man purchases a first edition hardcover book that I love and nonchalantly gifts it to me because he knows I like it. That's a very big gesture. I would want to say a bit more thank ""oh wow, thanks"" Maybe something along the lines of ""you remembered this! That's amazing, this really means a lot."" Just slightly more in depth.

[this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/parenting/parental-burnout-pandemic.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=fb-nytimes) exposes the harsh reality that many women face while trying to balance their family and their careers -  **Men pursue their careers as planned. The amount of work they do (or not) around the house and help with the kids varies widely, forcing women to take up any essential, uncompleted tasks and sometimes sacrificing their careers.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are a few excerpts which really stood out to me:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The tacit agreement: Women could enter the workplace, but only if they fulfilled every other societal expectation. They could be ambitious, but still had to be nice; powerful, but still hot; hardworking, but still a good cook; multitasking, but still a conscientious housekeeper; a leader, but still feminine; a workaholic, but still a devoted parent. Men participate in and reinforce these ideals, but the primary arbitrators of success or failure are other women.
2. And yet, women who can, try. It’s the millennial way: If the system is rigged against you, just try harder. Which helps explain one of the most curious stats of the last thirty 40 years: Women with jobs spend just as much time parenting as stay-at-home mothers did in the 1970s. The metaphor of the second shift isn’t a metaphor at all — they are doing two full-time jobs. And in order to make time for both of those jobs, they are sleeping less, and spending far, far less time on themselves or their own leisure.
3. “Time studies find that a mother, especially one who works outside of the home for pay, is among the most time-poor humans on the planet,” Brigid Schulte writes in “Overwhelmed,” “especially single mothers, weighed down not only by role overload but also what sociologists call ‘task density’ — the intense responsibility she bears and the multitude of jobs she performs in each of these those roles.”
4. This is parenting burnout, pandemic style: You’re still managing the [mental load](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/) of the household, while also making sure the masks are laundered, the Zoom schedules are followed, and trying to figure out how much kid screen time is too much and how much screen time is necessary to just get through your day. And instead of giving ourselves some slack, whether it comes to productivity levels or parenting standards, many of us feel like we’re failing at, well, everything — even though every article we read, every friend we talk to, tells us otherwise.

**I feel like reading this completely reaffirmed my stance on FDS, and how IMPERATIVE it is to only marry and reproduce with HVM (with extensive vetting), who will also pick up the slack financially and be primary breadwinners for their families, while also pulling their weight as involved fathers. This libfem ideology of ""50/50"" gets women absolutely no where, and leads to shorter life spans and poorer quality of health for us and for what ladies??**",100567,"How Burnout Became the Norm for American Parents, Especially Millennial Mothers.",0,,,

We've experienced a HUGE amount growth and increased activity in these last few weeks! I want to say thank you to all of you lovely ladies who have made this sub an absolute joy to be a part of!! The mod team spent a few hours convening this afternoon about how to continue managing our sub as we continue to rapidly expand. We came up with a few new changes to improve efficiency while maintaining everyone's favorite pro-woman space...

We had probably about 1,500 messages in the Modmail to get through from women requesting flair or asking to be added to the website. (We're also up to almost 10,000 unread ban appeals from men who clearly don't understand what ""no"" means but, gosh, we're just so forgetful and never remember to open that folder. Whoopsie daisy! 🤷🏻‍♀️)

First - While this had been the unofficial process for a while now, we will officially no longer automatically assign flair to new users after 48 hours. We will no longer assign flair by request, either. All automatic notifications telling users to message the mods asking for flair should now be removed. We were getting hundreds of requests for flair every day and it was too much to keep up with, even with all the extra hands. **You do not need  to have flair before you can post here. This has always been the case. The only difference between a flaired and unflaired user is that an unflaired one has their comments/posts reviewed before anyone on the sub is able to see them.** Moving forward, all FDS participants without flair will have to have a history of high-quality contributions in order to receive flair. You may still receive messages saying your comment/post was removed when you try to post. This is fine. Someone will manually approve your comments and, once appropriate, assign you flair. Please be patient with us. 

**Please do not message the mod team asking for flair, you will not receive a response.**

Second, we've added about half a dozen new mods to the team! They'll be helping us stay on the lookout for quality comments and posts from unflaired users and making sure your comments and posts get approved more efficiently. They're all long-time FDS users you know and love, so make sure to welcome them to the team!

We did a ton of other stuff on the technical side as well, but that's all pretty boring and shouldn't affect your experience here.",94173,"Process Changes to the Sub, Flair, and other Announcements",0,,,

When a man treats us badly, it’s very easy to beat ourselves up and take the blame. Society actively encourages women to take responsibility for being treated badly, and victim-blaming is rife. However, this is complete *bullshit*. LVM are practiced at being low/negative value. Many of them have exhibited low value  behaviour for decades. No man just wakes up one morning and decides: “today’s the day where I’m going to treat ________ badly.” They’ve mistreated women before you they’ll mistreat women after you, because their attitudes towards women, love and relationships is fundamentally dysfunctional. Show me a low value man and I’ll show you a string of women he has damaged, used and abused.",95332,Try not to take low value behaviour personally.

Their mutual friends have asked him if he’s interested, and apparently he has given only vague responses.

Trust me, this boy isn’t a Chad or anything, just a shy, skinny kid. My daughter, on the other hand, is highly intelligent, sweet natured, tall &amp; gorgeous, athletic, super ambitious, and fun to be around. A queen in the making!

I’ve told her that if he isn’t moving heaven and earth to get in touch with her (he has her phone number and snap chat) then he’s probably gay. I can tell she doesn’t believe me, though. I know boys his age aren’t great communicators, but he should still put in some effort to make contact with her, right?

Meanwhile, her best friend jokingly told her to “Be more flirty! Send him a booty pic!” Then my husband says she should show initiative and make the first move. I told her privately that she should do neither. 

I told her that under no circumstance should she offer her body this way to any boy/man who’s too lazy to even spend time with her and get to know her, even when she’s an adult. I told her the best advice I had for her was this: If he wanted to, he would.

It’s simple. If he wanted to text you, he would. If he wanted to be a better communicator, he would. If he wanted to be a faithful partner, he would. If he wanted to propose marriage to you, he would. If he hasn’t done any of those things, it’s simply because he doesn’t want to, for whatever reason.

(I later questioned my husband about his advice to make the first move. He said he thought it would be more feminist. I asked “How is it more ‘feminist’ for women to do even more work than they already do for the relationship??” He admitted he was probably wrong, but didn’t know what else to tell her.)

I can’t stand it that this world tells my beautiful daughter to blame herself for not being flirty enough, or for not sending enough nudes. It’s disgusting that girls think they have to turn themselves into *literal child pornography* just to get a boy to speak to her. Fuck that shit.

My daughter has never shown much interest in boys, because she says they’re all just awful and disgusting. I think deep down she knows not to prostrate herself for male approval, she just wants to date a boy who’s as sweet natured and caring as she is.

I've been having issues with my fiance regarding comments and gaslighting (I think). 

By nature I am a night owl and if I don't monitor my sleeping patterns I tend to become nearly completely nocturnal (usually waking up at 2pm-3pm but going to sleep at like 6am-8am). This seems to bother my fiance sometimes because on top of the different sleeping patterns we also have a three hour time difference. The problem is that he makes comments about my sleeping pattern which upsets me deeply as I had lots of issues regarding sleeping in while I lived with my parents. 

I have explained multiple times that it bothers me when he makes comments because it makes me feel like a child, and it reminds me of living with them (no pleasant memories whatsoever). 

We literally just had a fight about this, it is currently 4am where I am, he woke up for work and texted me, I answered and we ended up calling. This lead to him commenting on my sleeping yet again, then gaslighting me when I told him it hurt me. 

I am unsure if it is gaslighting, what basically happened was; I explained that when he says stuff like that it makes me want to ignore his messages for fear of being hurt or feeling put down because of something so small like a sleeping pattern and he said ( in an annoyed almost snarky tone) to ""not message him then.""

This hurt even more because it felt like he literally did not register anything I actually said and just focused on the one thing that would directly affect him. Again, I am unsure if this is a type of gaslighting but it did make me really upset with him, which I expressed in a slightly raised tone. He hung up on me because he said he ""couldn't handle being yelled at this morning"". Which is true, he does have problems when yelling, so we usually keep our voices controlled, the problem with that is I unconsciously raise my voice when I talk (especially when emotions are involved) and this was one of those instances where I slightly raised it to express my emotions. 

I try my absolute best to control the volume of my voice but sometimes I feel like there isn't another way to get my thoughts across because he isn't listening. He has told me that he would listen if I spoke in a normal tone but my normal tone didn't get the message across the first few hundred times. 

I don't know how to feel about this, I'm extremely overwhelmed and I was hoping to get some insight from the women in this group. I don't know what to do anymore, it seems like he doesn't understand how much this affects me and anything I say goes in one ear and out the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just a side note, he knows I'm posting this, and he might read the comments.",95278,Problems with fiance making comments and gaslighting,0,,,

I never bought coins untill my female subs went under attack a few months ago, and there's a reason. I had just found them, I found a home! I never felt more at ease, able to speak my thoughts without judgement or criticism, or without the anxiety that maybe I didn't spell something right, or my grammar was off. I finally didn't care if people knew I was a woman. My whole life I've hid the fact that I was a woman online, I see how differently you're treated. I made that mistake too many times.

We want to feel safe. We want to feel seen as human beings. And we should never feel ashamed of that. Every person deserves that. 

You don’t have to be pretty enough, young  enough, white enough, black enough, rich, successful and whatever else to have standards. Only you decide what makes you feel loved and taken care of.

You have a loving heart, you are human, and that’s enough to demand nothing but the best treatment. The people who try to bring you down for that and say you want too much should take a moment to think why they even need to use someone and treat that someone like disposable garbage. Why they want to hurt and humiliate women and mess with their minds and emotions.

The world has changed so much in the past decades. Human life is losing value because it’s getting swallowed by the economy of instant gratification, and relationships follow suit.

Love has become a dirty word. Something only schizophrenics believe in. People hide it behind euphemisms like “catching feelings”, and teach themselves how to be a product. People have begun to treat commitment and loyalty like some sort of prison sentence when it used to be a natural part of life, a rite of passage into adulthood, and reason to be proud. It’s become more taboo than being a pedo with a piss fetish.

It’s not our job to make ourselves simple, convenient, bite-sized, Internet order pocket pussy. You are not a butthole to be sold on onlyfans for 5 bucks, and our beloved liberators need Ritalin instead of sex, because being unable to focus on one thing, to wait for something, and constantly demanding instant gratification is against our own best interest as a species. 

All that kink poly bullshit exists to distance people from ever needing to feel a deep bond with someone else, because that requires emotional maturity. It’s narcissistic, twisted and empty.

In the end that big important sex drive is there to create and sustain our young, and the bonding that comes with that is nature’s bonus. All of dating is just one big mating dance by the Y chromosome to prove that its mutation deserves to continue existing. You are the chooser. You get to be as picky as you want.

Mating with your screen or fucking hundreds of strangers gives you neither the opportunity to spread your genes nor the ability to bond, and being proud of that is stupid.

You, my queen, are simply a complex human being with deep emotions. What you want is natural. You are sane. You want to be human and to be treated as an individual. Don’t let anyone make you feel like a freak for not wanting to turn your vag into a McDonald’s drive thru. They’re just screeching apes trying to cheat nature, but they all end up cheating themselves out of meaning and personal growth. It’s not your problem.

And even if you don’t want kids, or marriage, or if you’re gay or ace, you never NEED to endure indignity, disrespect, pain, boredom and mediocrity to make someone else. 

I’m glad women are waking up.

Just kidding. My dudes... *That's the whole point.*

FDS aims to be a one-stop shop for all things female empowerment. If it concerns women's issues, even (and ESPECIALLY) if it has nothing to do with men, it's for us. The ultimate goal of FDS is to foster self esteem and raise women up to the point that they understand that male attention is not a in any way defining characteristic of a strong, successful, beautiful woman. It's usually an active hinderance, actually. The idea that women are in some way ""lacking"" for being single is bullshit patriarchal propaganda. Especially now that so many men are incapable of bringing anything to the table except for manipulation, pornsickness, and abuse. 

The fact that there is so much content here that has nothing to do with dating proves that FDS works. Not one woman here is posting complaining about being single. Oddly, this is one of the most frequent lies men love spreading about this place, and the absolute absurdity of it just makes me laugh. **Crying over not having a man is the absolute fucking antithesis of everything FDS stands for.** We know our value. We will not settle for any less than we are capable of giving. Our ladies who are single are loving it. Our ladies who are married, dating, or engaged are in healthy, equal partnerships with men who bring value to their lives.

Normal, healthy people who love and respect themselves don't need to date someone just to fill the void in their otherwise empty lives. The men who come here to troll seem to be incapable of understanding this. I wonder why. 🤔",95149,"The Ultimate Dating Strategy is Knowing You Do Not NEED to Date Anyone, Ever",0,,,

However, when we met we just clicked, our energy matched, we share a lot of things in common; such as we are both extroverted, have dating experience, and are goal-getters. 

This was before finding this subreddit so I was a pickmeisha from the get-go 

I would bake and bring food for him, but him food, drive to his place,etc 
But we never really went out on dates, we just hangout at his place and had sex.
However, after I found this subreddit I started noticing the red flags:

🚩 his room is messy as fuck
🚩 he never took me out on dates
🚩 there were stances where I was paying for the food FOR THE BOTH OF US

I know I’m an idiot and I was just really into him. 

I tried to keep my head up and be understanding that he was just getting out of a relationship and try to give him time.  

Two days before his bday I took him out to eat. And I had planned on his bday to show up with a cake and a gift to his house. But he never replied to my messages  until it was past midnight. 

I think that was the day that I got tired of his shit. I ate his cake with my best friend and destroyed his gift. Lol

However after that I was done with him, and he knew that I was mad and after we had a talk I told him that I wanted him to take me out on dates, to fucking try for once in his life. 

And he changed, he started trying, we started going on dates, he started paying for my food and started calling me everyday. 

But idk part of me still holds grudges and after finding this subreddit idk what’s the best option to follow. Because he was trashy at the beginning and now he is trying so idk if I should stay with him or leave. I still like him of course but I don’t think is as much as I used to...

To add to the story, when I wasn’t talking to him (after his bday) my gym crush talked to me and we went out together hiking. We got along pretty well. He is very introverted, has only had one gf, he is shy and he is a very sweet guy. I know he likes me and has showed me that from the get-go. One of the things that I don’t like is that he isn’t as goal oriented as me, I feel like he is still trying to figure out his career and he is older than me. Is that bad (?) 

So I am very confused and I don’t know what to do. My heart likes them both and idk who is the right guy for me because I’m still trying to figure out things for myself, and the things that I want in a man.",95132,I really need advice on this one...,0,,,

Yet in the dating books ive read written by males these exact same points are made. Not to pay for dinner dates, to have standards/boundaries and communicate them early, to focus on yourself and not be chasing the guy or being needy,  to wait for commitment before engaging in sexual relations.   
I found these 5 questions in a book written by Steve Harvey. I actually think they are worth asking in the first month of meeting a guy you consider as a long term relationship prospect. 

  · 1.What are your short term goals?

\- for the next 3-5 yrs, can you see yourself being part of those plans/goals 

\- does he have space for you in those plans and how does that fit into who he is/what he does etc

\- are they vague plans or something concrete. Is it something he is working toward or just   
\- red flag is if they have no goals which suggest they may be confused and have no plan for their life and no plan for you in their life 

· 2. What are your long term goals in next 10 yrs

 \- He should have a plan and if he does not he may not see you in it or be willing to divulge 

\- He should have a plan for his goals and steps to get there. Something that you can see yourself in

· 3. What are your views on relationships 

o Parents, kids, God

o Will tell if he is serious about commitment, kind of household he was raised in, what kind of father and husband he might be, do it before you meet a man, maybe on the phone

o If he cannot talk about this run

o How he feels about his family? What are his views on it?

o Does he want a family? How does he feel about children? 

o What is his relationship with his mother like? 

o What is his relationship with dad?   


· Ask the next 2 questions after talking for a while before sexual intercourse

· 4. What do you think about me?

\- after a few dates as it reveals what his plan for you is 

\- he should have specifics and not generics

\- if he says you are kind what makes him that, what examples does he have 

\- Level of his specifics will give you another clue into this man’s intentions for your relationship 

\- If he can give you specifics it means he is listening and adding it up, he’s determining if he’s going to keep you , if he sees himself in committed relationship with you

· 5. How do you feel about me? Ask after a month of dating

\- This requires him to go into the emotional part of himself. 

\- Put the brakes until you start hearing and feeling from him the things that you think are important to hear and feel from a man with whom you are willing to forge a relationship",95813,The 5 questions you need to ask to see if a man has value in your life,0,,,

I am finishing up college soon and have been feeling very insecure about my appearance. My appearance attracts the wrong attention from men and sometimes women too. I can’t help the body type I have and I naturally stick out bc I’m tall also. 

At first I would use the fact that everyone thinks I’m a bimbo to my advantage and let them think what they want because I know I am not. But it makes me mad because it’s harder for me to make friendships and men only want one thing already and it makes it even harder to tell if anyone is genuine. I have learned most men are not genuine which is not a shock to anyone on here. 

For example, I meet my best friends coworkers and we go to dinner as a group of girls. One girl has a crush on the waiter and he smiles and is friendly back and she says “oh he probably is only interested in -my name-“ and I’m like huh I just met you don’t even drag me into this. 

In HS I wore baggy t shirts and baggy jeans to hide my figure because I attracted bad attention from the opposite gender despite my innocence. Some boys  are stupid bc they think big boobs= SLUT. like I had any choice in my body. 

Growing up my father did not allow us to get our brows done, makeup, hair dyed or any of that stuff. Bc I have been deprived so long from altering my appearance, my desire to dress feminine and use makeup has only grew but it attracts negative attention. (People think I’m stupid and an easy lay basically) Classic Fashion and makeup is a fun hobby but it doesn’t cover the fact I feel bad about my body. 

I’m sad because people assume the worst of me. I’ve been promoted at work and people assume the manager just has a weak spot/crush  for me.  I know I’m smart and don’t have to feel like I should prove anyone but it upsets me. When a man approaches me I assume the worst from bad experiences I’ve had. I’ve had male coworker tell me im spicy. I’m stern but Ok

I can not afford to do breast reduction surgery because my savings are for school. I am very tall and thin which makes my chest look more disproportionate than it is. Even when I dress classy and professional I feel like clothes look slutty on me making me feel like a LVW. :( 

I notice I’m only friends with a few girl friends of years and a lot of gay men as a defense mechanism over what I’ve dealt with the past.

I’m sad because people assume the worst of me. I’ve been promoted at work and people assume the manager just has a weak spot/crush  for me.  I know I’m smart and don’t have to feel like I should prove anyone but it upsets me. When a man approaches me I assume the worst from bad experiences I’ve had. I’ve had male coworker tell me im spicy. I’m stern but Ok

I can not afford to do breast reduction surgery because my savings are for school. I am very tall and thin which makes my chest look more disproportionate than it is. Even when I dress classy and professional I feel like clothes look slutty on me making me feel like a LVW. :( 

women please help. How can I feel more empowered?",95808,I am depressed at what I see in the mirror.,0,,,

Now that I have seen the light with FDS, I feel as though I have left the Matrix. I feel very alienated by my two best friends and their relationships with men. 

I don't want to cut these people out of my life; I love them very much and they have great qualities. We click really well. I don't relate to most girls my age anyway (I'm in my early 20s) and they are very mature for our age group. However, post-FDS I have a hard time not feeling alienated. 

I understand I'm probably just in a phase, and after a while this won't bother me as much (i.e. I become used to it). In the meantime, how do I avoid alienation from my only two friends? 

***TLDR***: Friends with two people who aren't pickmes but don't follow FDS either. I love them and don't want to let them go, but after FDS I see them a little differently.",95748,How to still be friends with women who don't follow FDS?,0,,,

There’re are studies on how harmful social media is for us in general. And although they do sometimes bring benefit through networking I want to bring up a point we should all be considering.

The majority of these apps, including Instagram, only fans, TikTok...are profiting over sexualized images of women. Whether the woman gets a small slice of that cake (often not) this perpetuates the patriarchal values and sexualize toon of women’s and girls bodies, and creating a more and more dangerous and objectifying culture that harms all women and girls. 

Not only does it harm us through the actions of men, being exposed to all these images so continuously has proven negative affect on how we see ourselves too. 

I very much limit my exposure to these apps that are profiting off of women while perpetuating misogyny towards women. So when I see everyone asking about FDS TikTok ers to follow etc, I very much cringe.

The company was doing fine, but they weren't hiring more people and even let a few of them go, including me.   
There were red flags from the beginning. Onboarding was non-existent and I felt lost the first few months I worked there. During COVID things got busier and busier, because the workload stayed the same with fewer people to get the work done. It nearly pushed me into a burn-out. With this a few weeks till the end of my contract I was told it would not be renewed, eventhough the company had at least enough work for a year whether they got new customers or not. It felt like a slap in the face. I busted my ass for months for what seemed like a (can I say this?) low value employer.  


The problem is that, while I don't need a man in my life, I do need an income. Thankfully I have somewhat of a buffer, but that will run out in a few months tops.   


I have been in this position before. I bust my ass, only in the end to end of with nothing and with it being abundantly clear they don't value my efforts. My self-esteem takes a bit hit every time this happens and I am so sick of it.   


So my question is can FDS be applied to employers? Because I don't want yet another employer to stomp on my self-worth and blame for shit I have no control over and try to lower my value as a person, only to dump me in the end.",95669,Can FDS be applied to jobs?,0,,,

This weekend I had a whole break down and just realized I have been letting one particular person drag me on a periodic basis for the past 10 years. I know that’s it’s been 10 years because I have always kept a journal throughout life. I am moving and I went through my old journals. I felt happy bc my mindset has improved drastically from the needy young woman I once was due to lifelong abuse from my family but I started to romanticize an unrequited relationship. Anyway when I met this particular person, I put them on a pedestal because I felt like they were good. He represented how I wanted to be seen by others and he was nice. We had a really nice infatuation period but it was ruined because a former very toxic romantic partner r*ped me and threatened to have me jumped if I told anyone. I went to this man and explained to him the best I could what happened without saying much. I remember it well because the conversation started with us holding hands and he immediately pushed me after I told him what happened. We were both kids at the time but that’s still no excuse. Anyway until graduation I basically spent 2 years begging/trying to prove that I was not a whore to this person. I grew up and “got over it” once we graduated. I’ve tried to date this person a few times throughout my adult life, it seems like we’re always in each others lives for a few months once every 1-2 years. Since graduating he always tries to have sex with me immediately which turned me off and I never gave into it. So then he decided to be chivalrous one evening when we went to the bar and were very drunk. He was saying everything I needed to hear about the past. Saying he understood and he felt bad about the way he treated me at that time. Foolish me felt like this was sincere since he admitted this unprompted. I’ve never really told him what really happened and I don’t want to tbh anyway that night was maybe 4 years ago and it seems like ever since then whenever I meet with him; he does everything to show that he’s disgusting. It’s crazy because I know he was raised right; he just doesn’t feel that I am a woman that deserves respect. I had an ugly thought that maybe he is still punishing me for what happened when we first met. It made me cry because I really have a Scarlett letter on my back from dealing with that toxic person and I felt like I was being punished for something that wasn’t really my fault. I felt ashamed to even admit that some stupid dude that I had a crush on at 16 managed to smash my heart to pieces again at 26. I just blocked him on everything because he was breadcrumbing me and using me as an ego boost. It gave me an ugly feeling and brought me back to a time when I felt extremely disrespected and violated by everyone I knew. Idk I probably need to go back to therapy but lately I’ve been feeling like people are only interested in me for sexual reasons even though I’m not very sexual. I don’t even post sexy pics. I’m just not sure why I keep getting treated like this by everyone. I feel like nobody cares about me unless they are looking at me lustfully. It makes me feel very....subhuman.

Sex is thrown around as the end all to everything: it’s healthy, it releases stress, it’s a basic fundamental need blahblahblah. The thing is, modern humans have an unnatural amount of sex courtesy of birth control. Without birth control sex would have consequences: pregnancy. Our ancestors had far less recreational sex because of this. If they did the deed frequently they’d either do it while pregnant, or end up pregnant. 

Now here’s another issue. How can sex supposedly benefit women when birth control itself comes with a host of nasty side effects? I’m primarily talking about hormonal birth control, but other methods such as IUDs can still have serious consequences. The depression, the weight gain, the potential for blood clots.... how can the supposed benefits of sex out-weight these health issues? It seems to me that once again MEN are the ones primarily benefitting from frequent sex.

What do you ladies think?",96167,"Why is society so obsessed with sex?

Here are some common PUA negs from men with fragile esteem:

‘Oh WOW really YOU have a degree? I wouldn’t of guessed’

‘Is that your REAL hair colour?’

‘How LONG did you spend on your makeup?’

They may also very deliberately ogle women in front of you like waitresses etc- this is triangulation to make you feel in competition- take note but don’t respond...don’t give them the reaction &amp; ego boost they’re after.

Notice the pattern of belittling &amp; TRYING to make you feel self conscious or on edge. Intimidated insecure men are fond of doing this when they turn up to an online date &amp; feel out of their depth....realistically they know if they’ve lost her interest in 3 mins but they’ll attempt to get petty &amp; see if they can knock you down to size bc they’re salty &amp; hate rejection. PUAs really hate FDS types bc we see through them. 

Also watch out for them subtly trying to imply you’re ‘old’ &amp; must be desperate for kids &amp; marriage bc you’re like 28. These men are the dumb redpilled types who believe women expire at 30. Women are still very fertile at 35 &amp; beyond ...&amp; you don’t owe any explanation for why men are so trash across the board &amp; why you didn’t marry any of your loser ex’s. 

Pay attention if they’re asking any of this awkward nonsense  &amp; being condescending on first &amp; second dates....the negs will only escalate bc they have a very fragile ego. 

It’s not by accident bc they’re clueless believe me, they’re scouting for a Pickmeisha who has low esteem &amp; gets all offended trying to prove themselves. Or they’re just doing it to be petty",96171,Subtle negs- watch out for them,0,,,

He made it clear that relationships without sex never work. On our second date he asked what i think about sex and it came up a few times.

I lost my virginity to him two months after we were official. He would touch me a lot anytime he got the chance but nothing happened. We didn’t talk about it but i think he should’ve considered asking if i was ready.

That’s when he started using guilt tripping. He would ask ‘can we meet later’ and every time i said no i would end up feeling guilty. He would even get passive aggressive if i ruined his plans to get laid. There were times when i was feeling like shit or crying and he’d still ask for it.

I told him once that i had to work so i can’t and he started acting cold. After a few days, i said the same thing and he was trying to convince me so hard. At some point he said nevermind but after a while started again. I told him that i would meet him but it had to be short. I tried to mentioned it a few times to get in his head. He said ‘stop talking’ to me.

I don’t think it felt intimate because he always tried to prove how great he is. He would make me feel bad for not being good at it (i had no experience at all). He would make me feel bad for not doing a good job.

There were a few times when he tried to choke me, pull my hair and slap me. He even tried to do the thing that every girl hates. I told him i don’t like it and he still tries sometimes.

This one time he got mad that i invited a friend over instead of him. He first tried to be passive aggressive but it didn’t work. He then started mentioning it all the time and making me feel guilty for it. I had no clue it was because of sex.
We went out that night and he would touch me inappropriately or kiss me like he never does in public, just to show me what i’ve been missing. He knew my friend was gonna come back to my house and still was trying to make me consider calling him over.

Give less.

Never give so much that when the relationship ends you feel bitter, resentful or taken advantage of.

Years ago I was in a relationship where I moved in with the guy too early. I did cook for him but only when I was cooking for myself. (Mostly scrambled eggs with veggies, quesadillas, soups and sandwiches. Absolutely nothing extravagant!) I just made extra. And I always left every bit of the clean-up to him. He would pretend that it took him a really long time. I never once helped him. That was his job. I figured he could either take forever doing it or learn how to do it faster like an adult. I would walk away and go sit in my room relaxing or doing homework while he spent an hour cleaning up from scrambled eggs with veggies!

He wouldn't clean, so I didn't clean. (I would never be in a relationship like this again but this was my first real relationship and the first time I ever lived with someone) I'm so happy I didn't clean even though it killed me. 

He grew up with a maid so he would walk into the bedroom and just literally throw his clothing, his shoes, his book bag right on the floor in the middle of the room. One time I got pissed when I tripped over one of those shoes and I kicked everything into the corner and his pocket change went flying across the tile floor. I let him pick it up. 

He would say he didn't want me to be his maid but then he would act like this. Not pick up after himself, not cook for himself, not clean for himself. But I damn well didn't do it. He was responsible for his own laundry and his own cleaning. 

He brought me things, did the man stuff, took me out complimented me. I accepted. 

I never gave him gifts or money. (Beyond a card, flowers and dinner out for his birthday)

Later he became abusive and we did eventually break up. Of all of my misgivings the one thing I don't regret is giving too much and being his servant. I am so glad I didn't act like his mommy or his servant!

Don't give so much that you will be resentful and feel stupid when the relationship ends.

If you were to buy or rent a house, they ask for credit/personal references.

Why can’t we ask for references and reviews when dating? 

Can’t we have a website, where you have to log in (and perhaps some system of controlling for double reviews by the same person for the same men)

Where we can look up past things a man sad and did to last dates and girlfriends? It would give us context and ability to see the red flags more clearly for those of us that are inexperienced or the at risk pick me youth.

It’s easier to recognize a guy is an abusive douche if he said the same vile things to other women before you, and you can read about them.

For example if he is telling you that you are unattractive because x, and you are insecure about x, you may just internalize it and not notice the abuse and negging for what it is. But if you also read that he said similar things to 5 women before you, it paints a picture.

First time posting here.

So like the title says, I recently left an extremely abusive relationship. I won't go into details for now, but it was highly traumatic. I'm struggling with starting over and trying to make ends meet while processing what happened to me and trying to recover.

I've been getting a lot of unwanted male attention since I left and started becoming independent, and I've mostly brushed it off. But lately it's been making me more and more anxious to even leave my house anymore, and I was wondering if anyone could offer some advice/guidance.

For a better example of what's been bothering me, the other day I was waiting for my bus to work. It was my first shift and I was nervous, my bus was late. I had headphones in. A man came up to me and tried starting a conversation. I gave him short answers trying to give him the hint that I wasn't interested.

He continued talking and I just kind of froze. I wasn't interested and just wanted him to go away. He started asking if I wanted to hangout, and I started to feel cornered. It probably sounds silly but I felt triggered because I felt like I couldn't get away, like I was trapped there until the bus came to save me. And I think the trigger was my CPTSD acting up.

He continued talking and asking me about myself, and I just came up with lies to avoid revealing anything about myself and my situation/background etc. I almost started crying because I just wanted to get to my job. Not be reminded that I was in a strange new city, feeling lonely and vulnerable because I had to flee from a dangerous situation.

This kind of thing happens a lot. My friends notice too, when I tell them these stories they can't understand why I'm such a magnet for this kind of attention.

I hope this post makes sense, I'm sorry if it doesn't or if it's pointless. I guess I just lack the tools to deal with this sort of thing. I'm frustrated that I can't seem to go anywhere alone without ending up having to entertain some stranger and feeling uncomfortable.

Thanks for reading.",97492,"Fresh out of abusive relationship, trying to heal. Constantly approached by men in public. Advice?",0,,,

**Walk Dates should be completely ignored, like a plague!**

**Why Walk Dates work for men -**

1. There is still a segment of women who think ""walks"" are romantic, different, and charming. This creates a prime situation for men to manipulate. Men have learned this, and use it to their advantage.
2. He gets to **SET THE TONE** of the entire relationship (low effort, no money spent, low standards). It is about **CONTROL**.
3. Women can be broken down (they drop their guard) while on a walk and being talked to. Men have *learned this*.
4. Walks cost no money for him.
5. Walks allow casual dress (for him). He can damn near roll out of bed.
6. He takes ZERO risks in any way. He can just walk away (lol) if you're not hot enough.
7. He risks no social shame. In a restaurant, bar, coffee shop... there is some social risk for him. Walking is alone.

**\*\*Men are using COVID-19 as leverage to get Walk Dates.** *DON'T FALL FOR IT.*

Restaurants, coffee shops, and bars have been open for months with different protocols. In my state, they're almost as busy as they were, pre-COVID. We wear masks until seated or eat on the patios or get to-go.

**NEVER. EVER accept a Walk Date.**

You will be treated like a dog. These men need to be moved out of the gene pool for even suggesting such a concept.

**\*\*\*Editing this post to include ""Hiking"".**

*Hiking is also unacceptable.* When women started catching on to the Walk Scam, they started introducing hiking.",97494,"Why ""walk dates"" are a thing on OLD and why they should be trashed every single time.",0,,,

Along with all of the amazing unspoken things that we talk about here, this often overlooked form of abuse is the top of my list of why I love y’all. 

CoMmUniCaTiOn is often targeted at us in order to exhaust us and make *us* feel like we haven’t tried everything (or that we even have to try everything) and that we are only allowed to speak completely calm and devoid of emotion (unlike most males, who are rageaholics). It also implies that we’re inherently psycho and cOmMuNiCaTiOn is something we have to constantly force ourselves to indulge in; instead of the reality that we are *always* communicating, pleading, meeting halfway, and generally stroking egos in order to be heard (but like...not really heard). 

CoMmUnIcAtIoN is bullshit, and a tool aimed at us to imply that we’re the ones at fault, and the ones who are responsible for setting the mood for peace and reconciliation. You can cOmMuNiCaTe till you’re blue in the face, it will never mean anything.

Dudes can play female characters the whole time, look at porn non stop, want to have sex with as many women as possible, have ladies as wallpapers but at the same time they talk constant shit about ladies. Like wtf????

They want everyone to sleep with them but at the same time they hate ""sluts"" and if you don't sleep with them then you're a ""prude""

Wtf.

And also the constant begging for anal. Pls get help. 

Last thing I fucking hate too: pickmes always pointing out how they look at women together. How they look at porn and laugh. Doing threesomes because he wants it. But they never include another man. They never talk about men or check them out. They never do threesomes with another man.

This is a post I have been meaning to make for a time as I haven't seen attachment styles brought forth a lot around here. We all want to vet men and pick the one who will add maximum value and benefit to our lives. Since I am an avid reader of psychology books, I thought to share a little tip with all the lovely queens on this sub: knowing about attachment styles will help your vetting process. Tremendously.

My therapist recommended that I read ""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel S. F. Heller. At first, it seemed weird to me, but, then this book was a real eye - opener. Why? Because it helped me asses my own attachment style, alongside my significant other's attachment style so that I can determine how compatible we are on a level that's different and deeper to me than, say, liking the same kind of music. Sure, being a metal head myself with a metal head SO is great, but knowing our attachment styles (Secure and Secure) fit? It gave me extra confidence.

Psychology can be your friend, sisters. It can help you predict someone else's behavior. It can save you weeks, months, years of heartbreak. It can be a very resourceful tool for you. It can be your friend in your vetting process by offering you a more specific frame to work with while you're out there living your queen life.

Dating is already tricky and risky as it is for women. Romance can be enjoyed and it can be wonderful, but only if we manage to keep our cool and pay close attention. By no means I am the Supreme authority in how each and every one of yours vetting goes or should go. I only wanted to offer all of you better tools in the future so that you can add more tools to your dating strategy toolkit. Play it safe and, most importantly, play it smart out there, sisters! 🌺❤️",97468,Why attachment styles theory can save you a lot of heartache,0,,,

Well I perused red pill blogs once upon a time ago and these bloggers would constantly deride independent women that don't need a man and gushing over ""dependent"" women who want to please their men and be homemakers.

BUT THEY SAY THIS IN IGNORANCE just like women say they want nice guys.

Men SAY they want a nice submissive girl but if you look at examples they will only respect and truly love a girl that is NOT a doormat. I saw this play out in real life, of course, but also:

I am doing a rewatch of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, for example, and you see this illustrated in Season 1. Taylor doesn't bring anything to the table in the relationship besides being a mom and homemaker (and chased HIM when they first got together) and her husband disrespects her. Adrienne, on the other hand, has her own way to make $$ and doesn't  think much of Paul lol and he tries hard to make her happy on their anniversary.

We finally got the chance to try a relationship three weeks ago. The first week went great and it was exciting. He took me on dates and paid for everything, he was generous and paid genuine attention to me. We clicked. He had a lot of HV qualities.

Then the second week I needed more space and alone time and that really set him off. He got very insecure, kept checking in on if I wanted to continue the relationship, and assured me his feelings, for the girlfriend he just broke up with, were over. Then one of the nights we hung out that week, he TOLD ME HE WAS IN LOVE WITH ME. *Record scratch*

My reply was ""oh wow yeah thats a lot"". I should've left and ended it right there, but it took another week and a half for me to really end it. During that other week and a half he told me he loved me again, kept asking if i wanted to date him, and was using me as an emotional crutch. I felt like he used me as a rebound to try to fill the void and replace his ex girlfriend. He told me he loved me to try to control the relationship and lock me down.

When I ended the relationship, he threw a tantrum. He drove me home erratically and speeding, cussed me out and then sent me a bunch of crazy, angsty texts. 

It was a quick, wild ride and a bullet dodged.

They were butt hurt. They have no clue I said no to them only to spend my weekend to myself. But I knew that the only reason they offered is because they know that this is a memorable day, and whatever bullshit they would do on this day would be 20x harder to forget. I’ve heard so many stories of women having their birthdays ruined by men who put no/low effort in for their birthdays only to make them feel worthless.

And I have had this happen to me a few times. Even though I’m not really sure what I want to do, I feel so powerful knowing that I can surround myself with abundance and pleasure. Today I put myself through a nice workout, listened to the Rich Dad Poor Dad Audiobook, and got dressed up very nicely and bought myself a drink. Of course people stared and tried to cat call, but I paid no mind.

It's been a month and a bit since I left my abusive relationship, so I thought I'd give you guys an update!

First off, I am safe. My child and I are staying with family. Thank you all for your concern! My ex is being charged with a couple different crimes against me. I also am in the process of getting a restraining order. I have a super reputable and nice lawyer and I've also been receiving help from the local women's shelter.

Mentally, I don't think I've ever felt better. I'm working with my doctor on a treatment plan for my anxiety (some stemming from the abuse, some I've dealt with my whole life). I'm finally in a position to not only save money, but to buy myself clothes that fit, that I've needed for awhile after acquiring the mom bod. I even quit smoking again, since with all the stress I picked it up again near immediately after giving birth. Nobody is stealing from me anymore and it's such a relief. I'm making my own decisions and it feels great.

I just wanted to give you lovely women an update since a couple of you asked for one and I wanted you all to know that I've got my happy ending to all this madness. I hope if we have any members or lurkers who find themselves in a similar situation, they can read my words and know that it gets better after letting go. Thanks to you all for your kindness.",97370,"UPDATE to ""I wanna thank this sub for helping me recognize my strength"".",1,,,

Like I’m done with dating and haven’t even really wanted to deal with any bullshit from men for a while. So I’ve been hearing some weird pickmeisha shit from my friends this year but I think this takes the cake. 

My friend started acting really stand offish when she first started dating this dude and they’ve only been dating for a year. I think this is her first bf. 

Today she messaged me saying she bought a house and I’m pretty sure it’s with her bf. I saw a pic with her and her bf holding a sign saying home sweet home. 

I don’t think this is a good idea but my culture and family is way different than hers. Her family is very open minded versus mine would literally kill me if I tried to move in with my SO before marriage. I wouldn’t even entertain living with an SO before marriage anyways I wasn’t raised that way and it’s like a rule on here.

Doesn’t your religion not let you do this (shes mormon)? “ I’m trying to keep my mouth shut. I don’t wanna be the bitch friend but it’s like that sounds really ridiculous and too fast!!! A year!!!?

This has happened a couple times lately, where I chat with a match on app and maybe a week later when they ask for my #/to meet up BAM they update their profile pic and it looks waaaay less flattering than prior pics.  

This most recent guy seems cool, cute etc and was interested in meeting..but now that we developed enough interest to move it out of the app, he put up a new profile pic and he legit looks 5-10 years older than prior pics. His stated age is only 3 years more than me, but he looks much much older than me/my peers. I feel duped haha.  Idk it feels like a “switch a roo” even if they didn’t do it intentionally (obvious it wasnt updated for my sake but I do wonder if these guys are doing it as a “fair warning” before meeting).

UPDATE: i will say I do garner male attention physically (tall, thin, exotic darker skin)...asked if I was a model a lot.

Moreover, the choice of language (""not *all*"") implies that the type of men who are ""like that"" are the majority (as in more than 50%).

If only a small minority of men were ""like that"" then they would say something like ""most men aren't like that"" or ""only a small number of men are like that""

In fact, by saying ""not *all*"" they are implying that the percentage of men who are ""like that"" is pretty damn close to 100%, as in somewhere between 80-99%.

If it was something like 50-80% they would say ""plenty of men aren't like that"" or ""a lot of guys aren't like that"" which implies that while something may be the majority, it is not a very large majority.

Ultimately, when a man says ""not ALL men are like that"" what he is really saying is ""I'M not like that, even though the overwhelming majority of men are""

Most men acknowledge that the majority of men are depraved but they want to be treated like they are the exception. They will never admit it directly but if you look at their actions it is very obvious, here are a few examples:

1) When a father refuses to allow his daughter to be alone with boys because ""I know what's going on in their minds""

2) When a boyfriend is uncomfortable with his girlfriend having male friends because he knows that most of them probably want to fuck her.

3) When a man is uncomfortable with his wife going on a long business trip with a male coworker.

4) When a guy aged 25+ wants a virgin teenage girlfriend because of their ""innocence"" and because she ""hasn't been corrupted by other men"" (even though he will most likely be the one to break her down and transform her into one of those ""bitter man-hating women"" they love to complain about)

5) When men complain that women their own age are ""too demanding"" and ""emotionally damaged"" because they know they have been treated badly by men in the past.

6) When incels and niceguys complain that ""women only like bad boys"" and ""guys who treat them like shit"" and that he's the only man on the planet who knows how to treat her right.

7) Guys who act offended when you take a picture of their license plate or ask for a picture of their drivers license before going on a date. ""Why do you need that, do you seriously think I'm going to rape or murder you? Unbelievable!""

8) Guys who genuinely believe ""if you refuse to date men who watch porn then you're going to be single forever because ALL MEN watch porn!""

And then they do a bunch of mental gymnastics to justify why it's always the woman's fault.

I get messages from angry men all the time and it's always something like ""your posts are GENERALIZING all men. When men read about how most men are predators it makes them feel bad. Not all men!""

Boys, if you are reading this and are feeling personally attacked, you are part of the problem. A genuinely good man would read FDS and feel empathy for us like ""damn, it must be really hard for women to go through life being treated so badly"" and then maybe donate some money to a women's shelter or something.

Yes, we acknowledge that genuinely good men do exist but they are extremely rare and you are certainly not one of them.

If you read FDS and it makes you feel dirty or guilty, then YES, you are almost certainly ""THAT guy""

We are not going to start policing our tone so that bad men can feel good about themselves. If lurking here makes you feel bad about yourself then you probably *are* bad and you should do something to change yourself and improve. I truly hope that you choose the path of self improvement.

Unfortunately, experience has taught me that very few men are willing to admit that they are flawed, and even fewer men are willing to put in the work it takes to change their entire worldview and attitude towards women. These are the ones who send angry, indignant DMs to moderators of FDS. You're not going to change our minds, you're just proving to us that we are right about you. 

So go ahead and be predictable. It's not going to stop us. There is currently an entire movement of women who are waking up and who aren't willing to put up with male bullshit anymore, the FDS subreddit is only a tiny part of that. Already, women are surpassing men in academia and in the workplace, and rising to the highest echelons of power in politics and business. And guess what, we are really good at it. We are quite literally better at leadership than you: [women-led countries handled coronavirus better](https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2020/04/13/what-do-countries-with-the-best-coronavirus-reponses-have-in-common-women-leaders/), and [female CEOs and CFOs outperform outperform their male peers](https://news.theceomagazine.com/business/entrepreneurship/female-ceos-perform-better/).

Your options are to adapt to a new world in which women have more power, or get left behind. The choice is yours. Trying to suppress women and keep us down isn't going to achieve anything, it only makes us stronger.",97945,"People who say ""not ALL men are like that"" are lowkey agreeing with us because even they acknowledge that at least SOME men actually are like that.",0,,,

But I guess I feel too emotionally invested to walk away. He has not walked away and still wants to continue to talk to me (as friends) until he finishes law school. He says that he likes me a lot but he does not have the time or energy to put into me that I need to try to attempt a relationship. He is in his last year of law school and needs to be ready to pass the bar, he says that having me on his mind and missing me has been emotionally draining and distracting from what he needs to get done. I understand that because I’ve felt the same (I’m in school for a bio degree). However I guess I don’t have as much pressure as he does that I’m willing to forgo the additional pain and struggle in daily life to pursue a relationship. It doesn’t help also that we’re long distance. He said that he would like to make this work but after he is finished with law school (in the summer) if we both still have feeling for each other by then. I feel a special connection and he’s like no one I’ve ever met. This is really all devastating to me because I felt like I met ‘the one’ potentially only for it to be taken away because of circumstances outside of my control. He asked me please not to wait up and forgo opportunities in my city because I’m waiting on us because he wants me to be happy. Also that if I needed to cut him off and see someone else who was emotionally and romantically available that it would hurt but he would understand because it would be selfish for him to ask me to wait for him.

You’ll be able to have a conversation right then and there, and it works long term too - they might’ve forgot their manners by the time you talk to them again, but by repeating this, they’ll eventually learn to let you talk without you having to do this at the start of every convo. Source: I have a very stubborn male relative, who eventually learned too.  


1. When they interrupt you, stop talking. Don’t try to raise your voice or battle them. Be completely quiet and wait.

2. Ignore **everything** they’re saying. Do not actually listen - just wait until they shut up. Don’t make a point of anything they say, do not answer to anything they say, do not refer to anything they say here. Literally do not listen a single word. Let them rant as long as they want.

3. When they finally shut up and wait for your reaction, say: ”I wasn’t done talking.”

4. Start over whatever you were saying when they interrupted you. I don’t care if it was a 10-minute explanation of rocket science. **Start. Over.** Repeat you original thought, but do not add anything related to what they just said while talking over you. That gives them the idea that it’s okay to interrupt you, you’ll still listen and pay attention and they’ll get their point clear without having to listen to yours. (It’s especially funny when you get done and they expect you to keep going talking about whatever they talked over you. The face when it sinks in that you didn’t listen a single word is glorious.) 

5. If they interrupt you again, return to step 1. If you find yourself repeating the cycle over 3 times, tell them: ”you’re not letting me speak. Either you listen and wait for your turn, or our conversation ends here.” If they try to make excuses, laugh it off or keep interrupting, end the conversation. Prove them that **if they wont let you speak, they’re not worth your time.** 

Why does this work? First, because sometimes talking over is internalized and men don’t actually notice they’re doing it. Being vocally called out makes them realize it and pay attention to it - especially if it happens more than once. Secondly, by refusing to aknowledge anything they say when they interrupt you, they’ll soon realize they will not get their own point across if they keep doing that. Peoole and especially men have the need to be heard and paid attention to when they talk - when you make it clear that by talking over you, they will not have your attention, they’ll learn to wait until you’re done, because they know that’s when you will be paying attention and actually listening.

&amp;#x200B;

So don’t be offended if the majority of LVM aren’t coming over- we’re not trying to attract these men into our net anyway. Kudos to them for being a self aware wolf if they don’t bother- it’s saving you wasted time. Rather than take this as a sign to level up- they wallow in pity instead &amp;amp;amp; expect us to become desperate pickmeisha’s chasing them &amp;amp;amp; stroking their fragile egos. 

They’re intimidated &amp;amp;amp; stay ogling you for ages hoping you’ll throw yourself on the floor &amp;amp;amp; open your legs to signal you’re game. If he’s ogling you a lot &amp;amp;amp; won’t come over...just know he’s a coward that knows you’re out of his league. You don’t need to do anymore, you don’t need to fall over yourself trying to get his attention. He’s visibly seen you &amp;amp;amp; there’s a reason he is hesitating or isn’t coming over. And you have no business with a guy who doesn’t have the balls to come over &amp;amp;amp; start a normal conversation. They’ve already failed by failing to start. These are lazy LVM who are only used to Pickmeisha’s doing the leg work for them. 

For the majority of men, their pre-frontal cortex is also damaged from excessive porn use so they can’t even read situations or signals accurately- not that they were good at that to begin with. But along with the excessive insular gaming addictions....this adds to their peculiar, incompetent, socially awkward behaviours. 

If they DO have the balls to approach they’re usually going up to women way out of their league bc they’re delusional /desperate so not men you’d be interested in. The types of men that shoot their shot with any and everyone bc it’s no loss to them- they have no shame to lose bc no one really wants them. Pornsick. Overinflated egos. Only interested in getting their dick wet &amp;amp;amp; trying to climb the status ladder/brag to friends. The numbers game. These men aren’t suitable for relationships either.

It’s frustrating I know. So how do we best avoid these types of men since they’re everywhere? 

Short of never leaving your house...the only real way to avoid this frustrating mess is to hang around places the majority of broke insecure scrotes can’t get in. That means not hanging around your local generic clubs/bars &amp;amp;amp; big chain restaurants where any old mediocre LVM can get in. Low value men tend to live repetitive lives &amp;amp;amp; prefer going to places that are cheap, low effort, predictable etc. That’s where you’ll find the majority of them. This means you have to start thinking outside the box....think of places scrotes wouldn’t bother to visit bc it’s too much effort/too pricey/too out the way. Have you noticed scrotes are always complaining about ‘snooty’ women, ‘snooty’ bars, ‘snooty’ restaurants etc. Those are the exact places you want to go &amp;amp;amp; that is the exact type of woman you should aspire to be. Yes whatever your interests are...whether it’s theatre/sport/arts/fitness/food...there are high end places where people with similar interests gather. Even if you live in a dull mediocre town full of broke low value men, you can still do this. Head to the nearby villages &amp; towns that are more expensive &amp; people have better jobs. 

Confident well groomed men with stuff going for themselves have no problem approaching HWV in an appropriate manner, but a lot of them are on the move &amp;amp;amp; when they head out, it’s usually with a plan/purpose. They’ll go to places where other cultured/educated/interesting people gather. For example, they’ll search for the best local breakfast place in town that’s hidden near a beautiful hiking spot...it might not be the cheapest/most convenient option but it’s the best &amp;amp;amp; worth the effort. There’s something stand out about it- like the pancakes being 10/10 or something. They’ll have usually researched these places or been given a tip off from a friend or visited before. 

Go to places/events that require some effort, thought &amp; planning. This is because these men have a zest for life &amp;amp; like filling their lives with quality things, they don’t mind going the extra mile when they know it’s worth it. They will go to bars that have pricey cocktails with quality ingredients &amp;amp;amp; a nice view. They will go to spots out of the way bc they heard it’s interesting, has nice views or the food /entertainment is top notch . A lot of these rooftop bars with be filled with businessmen &amp;amp; the like having after work gatherings as well..the bigger the group the better. Even if you don’t like them romantically, they could be useful for career contacts or something. I’ve seen v ordinary women working at fancy events part time as a waitress &amp; using it to their advantage...whether romantically or professionally. Anything can be finessed if you put your mind to it. Start to think of how these men can be of service to you. 

No this doesn’t make them high value by default, but due to the prices &amp;amp; strict dress codes/ door policies... it certainly weeds a lot of crap out &amp;amp;amp; most (not all) these men will know to court you properly &amp;amp;amp; be able to hold decent conversations/ have a decent job. In short...there is some benefit to you running them a shot or listening to them speak. They know they have to bring something on the table &amp;amp; they have something to put on it, so it’s not an issue. HVM are not going to be the guys arguing about who’s getting the next round of diet cokes lmao- they’d embaress themselves pulling that kind of move in these high end places....people would stare them down &amp;amp; make them feel awkward/ insignificant...including other men waiting for them to flunk so they can talk to you. And you can spot the broke flashy ones who snuck their way in a mile off bc they’re often acting different /immature or ordering a ridiculous amount of bottles for someone’s bday trying to get attention- yes you know the ones with the sparklers. 

So you need to get thinking, where are the places scrotes &amp;amp;amp; cowards would be repulsed by? Places that would make them feel insignificant, out of place, uncultured, unrefined, lost, insecure etc. Places that trigger Male competition &amp;amp; give you leverage ...where men in better industries gather....where they’re the norm rather than the odd one out. Where it is expected they bring something to the table. Places where men would at least be confident/secure enough to approach bc they know they have some pride in themselves &amp;amp; the places they visit. Those are the places you want to spend your time around....and you’ll likely meet quite a few other FDS minded high value women there too....&amp;amp;amp; they can give you even more tip offs. Perhaps you might even make friends &amp;amp; will go out together. This is how you make use of connections...but first you need to mingle around places where high value people gather...then before you know it you’ll have a go to list of where to go. This doesn’t guarentee you’ll meet the ‘one’ but it weeds out the bottom feeders/leeches &amp;amp; gives you a better chance. You will at least have some fun &amp;amp; benefit from dating these guys even if it fizzles. And as we say at FDS, dating should be a stress free experience as a high value woman! You should not be stressing over these men.",98560,How to avoid cowardly manchildren &amp; broke scrotes who approach anything with a pulse,0,,,

When he finally gets off his ass to do restaurant and all that, I have had my fill of his shit (he kept talking about other girls, for one). I agreed initially to the date, but made other plans in the mean time and did not inform him. Naturally, in comes guilt trippy text to tell me how HE felt like a fool. Well, guess what, boy? You dragged my heart through mud before that.

We didn't communicate. I didn't let him in ever again. I didn't do any explaining. Deleted and moved on. Of course, now I recognize I shouldn't have let it come to that point in the first place, but, part of me felt absolutely good about it. I am one petty witch and, yes, I will burn you before I leave you on read and block, LVM. I would do it again in a HEARTBEAT.

Let's discuss for a minute the difference between quirks, flaws, and personality traits. When are they red flags, and when are they benign imperfections in our mate's humanity?

This post is relevant primarily for long-term vetting of our partners. On first and subsequent dates, HVM are expected to conduct themselves to the highest standard (as are we). Yet the vetting process continues throughout the relationship, into marriage and beyond. Subsequently, it is expected that  imperfections will eventually reveal themselves. 

LVM-in-disguise will explain away their toxic behaviour as ""quirks"" or ""flaws"", particularly in later stages of a relationship once access to their target is established. It can be harder to identify these imperfections as glaring red flags - after all, ""nobody is perfect"". 

So how do we distinguish between bothersome quirks, character flaws, and toxic personality traits? What makes an HVM's imperfections different from those of the LVM? 

Let's tackle one by one. 

**QUIRKS**

Quirks are *idiosyncrasies exhibited by someone independent of their relationship to another individual.* 

They are funny or peculiar behaviours that: 

* present themselves *no matter who is present* \- at work, at home, among friends, shopping alone
* present themselves *consistently over time -* they will be with a man *before* he has met you, and they will stay with him *after* you are gone. 
* do not extend to, or otherwise entangle another person 
* are benign - they do not instill fear, anxiety, disgust, and are not a health hazard

Anything outside of these parameters is not a quirk, it is RED FLAG. Other identifying phrases among LVM are: ""strange"", ""weird"", ""goofy"", ""different"", ""unique"" (spoiler alert: he ain't)

**Example:**

* ""My girlfriend is only allowed to wear short skirts, I'm quirky like that"" - WRONG, ya trashy!
* ""I change my bed-sheets once a month, I'm weird like that"" - WRONG, ya nasty!
* ""I haven't told anyone about us, I guess I'm strange when it comes to that"" - WRONG, ya cheatin'!
* ""I'm a little different from the others, I..."" - Don't need to finish the sentence, YA BASIC!

**FLAWS**

Flaws are *shortcomings in character which are managed by the individual through consistent, continuous, and rigorous application of a compensating mechanism.*

Character flaws are only applicable to HVM. Why? Because only people with enough self-awareness to actively level-up can be given benefit of the doubt. They will have established a system, by their own initiative, through which they can overcome their character flaws, or otherwise keep them from interfering with their personal relationships (romantic or platonic). 

**Examples:** 

* *John cannot, for the life of him, remember important dates. Since a young age, he has struggled with remembering his mother's anniversary, his sister's engagement, and his girlfriend's birthday. John compensates by keeping a strict calendar filled with milestones, complete with well-timed reminders that allow him to sufficiently prepare for important events. Though he still struggles with calendar dates,* ***no one in his life is none the wiser*** *because he has not once missed an important moment in the lives of close ones.* 
* *As a result of his upbringing, Joe curses when angry. He disapproves of this behaviour, and has taken initiative to rid himself of this flaw. With self-help and therapy, he has established a mental routine which prevents him from using curse words when he gets upset. He consciously works on improving this routine's efficacy and has almost rid himself of this habit. On the rare occasions he makes a mistake, he immediately stops, apologizes, and* ***holds himself accountable*** *for cursing, even if this behaviour doesn't bother his partner.*

If a man does not take action to overcome a character flaw, it ceases to be a shortcoming and solidifies into a personality trait. *LVM bad behaviours are not bugs, they are features!*

**TRAITS**

Personality traits are the *characteristics of a person that contribute either positively or negatively to the baseline of a decent human being. They manifest through systematic patterns of behaviour, established over a lifetime of action upheld by specific values.* 

* ""Nice"" is not a personality trait
* ""Generous"" is a trait if it manifests at a level above and beyond the basic societal standard of generous. The same holds for ""Communicative"" or ""Empathetic"" or ""Honest"". Keep this in mind when thinking of desirable traits for your HVM.
* Traits are by and large *immutable.* Personalities are forged over a years, a lifetime. They do not change overnight. They are not accidental. Traits are *there to stay.*

LVM will often pass off negative traits under cute names:

* He's not ""forgetful"" when he's ignoring you, he's inconsiderate.
* He's not ""passionate"" when he's punching walls, he's violent.
* He's not ""protective"" when he follows you around, he's possessive. 

**Why is any of this important?** 

**LVM will try to convince you that their** ***toxic personality traits*** **are nothing more than** ***quirks*****, or** ***character flaws*** **to be ignored, dealt with, and never complained about.** 

You will undoubtedly witness undesirable reactions or behaviours from your partner over an extended period of time. It is vital to understand when this is a tic, a character flaw, or a trait emerging (mask-off). 

Quirks are easy to identify - simply follow the checklist above. 

For the rest, remember that HVM will:

* Recognize the faults in their character
* Develop by their own initiative a way to improve on the fault
* Immediately apologize for mistakes
* Hold themselves accountable
* Call it out like it is (no cutesy wootsy excuses)

Anything outside of these parameters is a NEGATIVE PERSONALITY TRAIT, and is therefore a RED FLAG.

Personally, I have no problem letting a man lead. I believe that leadership is a fluid, not a title. The most qualified person for the job should lead. I mean, if you attend 3 seminars a year on how to invest your money. Have a successful business, read 5 books over the past 2 years on conscious parenting because you planned on being a dad soon, worked on your own wounds and have a high level of self awareness and can love with no ego... I have no problem with you deciding for the main decisions with our finances and the education of the kids.


Sadly, the average man hasn’t read anything since the end of high school and it wasn’t a self development book.

I told her that he was intimidated by her and likely found a safer option that made him feel better about himself. I told her that I, too, have been experiencing a lot of more rejections after earning my PhD.

Or even just outrageous ""date"" ideas LVM suggested to you lol 




- Cheap fast food restaurant date after walking date where the guy doesn't let me order a drink, pays and says ""oh it's ok, it was just (insert value) "". He also spent the walking date saying he's not a ""Michelin star restaurant"" kind of guy, probably to justify the cheap restaurant choice lol

- Car dates in my teens and early 20s (I still cringe)

- Meet me at place X while a do an errand I have to do (wtf) 

- Getting salty after they realize I won't go home with them after the first date and then apparently deciding to go dutch and stop the niceness. One of them literally left the table while I WAS STILL EATING and left in rage. Paid his part of the dinner and went outside all angry just because I said I didn't feel comfortable going to their place on our first date lmao Another guy spent the whole date talking about himself and his entrepreneur achievements and not one single question about me. Got extremely salty because I didn't want to continue the date at their place, got up, paid for his drink, said goodbye, left and blocked right after lol

- Drunk dude crying about his ex at our first date in a restaurant and giving me too much information about his ED. Also ended up revealing his age on his profile was fake and was much older lmao

- The typical coffee dates where they don't even pay my coffee

- Paying me for a drink or whatever and then asking me to transfer them my part lmao . One of them after my pick me ass took a bus to meet them in their area lol

- Getting to the place where we should meet and then get a message that he had a flat tire and couldn't come followed by ghosting 

- Netflix and chill at their place or mine as suggestions for the first date. Trying to guilt trip me or neg me ""don't you trust me?"" ""I see you're not spontaneous""

- Cheap ass dates full of sexual innuendos and questions to gauge the possibility of easy sex that night or not

- Having the audacity of wanting me to meet them ar their city (I'd have to take a plane) and book an hotel for myself paid with my own money to meet him for our first date. I was still pickmeisha but even I back then didn't accept this lol

I used to feel guilty I’ve been called b*tch, demanding, unreasonable for wanting a man to pay for dates, be a gentleman, have his own goals and ambitious, has a good career, dress well etc. I’m fairly young (early 20s) so I thought maybe I’d just have to wait until early 30s for guys to want to “settle down.” Until you ladies. 

My mum is the epitome of HVW. In turn, she has my stepdad shower her with love, adoration and gifts. There’s more to him but the post is about women in our lives so I won’t divert. My mum gives advice like it is. She’s told all her children that there are plenty of men in the world and we should be cherished by our partners. She’s quick to pick up red flags I missed in relationships and educated me (ultimately leading to the relationships ending). But she also encourages the relationship I’m in with a HVM rn. 

She has always been my biggest supporter whilst at medical school (she loves hearing about everything I get up to at uni which is so nice). She didn’t go to uni and not in a high paying field but can pay for her living expenses from her job (but doesn’t have to because of my stepdad). But, she makes it known how proud she is of me every day. I thank God for her in my life. 

My stepmom is the complete opposite, a verified pickmeisha. She has no self respect (unless it’s from dragging other women down) and donates so much of her salary and time to false prophets and gains self worth from being a “role model couple”. 

We are VLC now. But when I was younger I was forced to go to my dads house (and yes she isn’t on the mortgage) for the weekends. My dad (LVM for sure) is very money hungry at the expense of family time. So when I went round, my dad dumped me with her and go out (to cheat, socialise or make money).

She would berate me for doing my homework instead of cooking and sweeping in the kitchen. Whilst my brother got to go play video games, smoke, watch porn and grow his beer belly. She’d tell my dad that I wasn’t listening to her but he was barely in so couldn’t enforce anything. 

I wasn’t the best cook (I’m a lot better now but that’s because I really enjoy it). She’d invite her other pickmesheia vultures round, they’d spend 10 hours in the kitchen to cook (Ghanaians can really cook). They loved making me feel awful because my future husband would get “McDonald’s for breakfast, Subway for lunch and KFC for dinner” because I couldn’t cook a three course meal aged 10. 

She’d berate my appearance saying a man like my dad wouldn’t want me (perfect thing to say to a young woman who was already insecure about her looks).  Considering they were both very overweight from all her excess cooking and his excess eating, it was really hard not to lash out because at least my mum fed me vegetables. In terms of her concern over my clothes her husband paid minimum child support, if she was that worried about my appearance he should take me shopping...

She said my degree won’t get me a man, and I need to be more appealing to men, and I’m going to find some scraggly old white man to be with (for those unfamiliar  white men are perceived to be “easy” with no standards, in Ghanaian communities. It’s more impressive to find a guy from your tribe). She never encouraged my academic endeavours even though we are dirt poor so really education is one of the biggest ways to get out of poverty. 

She’s incredibly bitter and I never understood way. I vowed I’d never be like her at all. 

I was wondering if any of us ladies have had other women in our lives who have had a major impact in and way?",98911,Have there been any HVW or Pickmeisha’s who have positively impacted the standards you have for dating?,0,,,

18+ photos, explicit photos. 
Even though if we do think it’s all women the chances of a fake account that is male and then having access to all these photos or even bfs of girls in the group using their significant others account to possibly access these photos. They label them as body positivity thread. I don’t know how I personally feel about this. 

Another thing is “I’ve been through a break up like my photo, or “I’ve just got engaged like my photos”, couples posting pics” like my photo” “show off your man” and just looking at some of even these photos, in my opinion, I see so many what look like low value men with women trying by posting.

 “we’ve been together for “x” many years.


you can see some happy couples but does anyone else also feel like you can just read lvm vibes off looking at how a man is standing, where his eyes are looking, body posture, closeness? 

It reminds me of this Spanish movie called “the secret in their eyes” and pretty much they found a murder victim by looking through photos of this woman, and the man is clearly eyeing her in all the photos. I also used watch a lot of forensic files, criminology  shows and even if they are fictional or real, I feel they do incorporate some good behaviour analyzing information. ( lie to me, ncis, criminal minds, a&amp;e) 

It’s almost like there’s a moment in photos where you can see where a woman is trying by posting up photos and even though the man doesn’t look unhappy, it’s not the same as the first few months of photos, and then using Facebook to get validation of their relationship.

Am I the only one that feels this way?",98909,"Facebook photos, and photos for validation.",0,,,

I (33F) have been single for 7 years, and have had *very few* dates that interest me enough to go on a second date. Because of how RARE it is for me to be attracted to a guy, I find myself falling for a man/fantasizing pretty early on when I feel like we click. (I know this is 100% the opposite of what FDS preaches – I’m trying to improve!)

I recently went on a date with a man whom I felt a strong connection with, and he asked me on a second date only for him to cancel the day before, attempt to reschedule, and then never respond back to my acceptance of the rescheduled day… I haven’t heard from him in over a week since he texted to reschedule. In the past, I would have reached out to find out why he didn’t respond/if everything was okay. This time around, I’m taking it as a message that he wasn’t as interested in me as I am in him. I’m really disappointed, but I won’t chase him.

I deleted Hinge because I’m finding it makes me feel more and more hopeless with every mismatch.  I’m trying to get past the feelings of loneliness where I crave having a loving boyfriend to cuddle with! I have a weighted blanket, but it’s not the same. My friends are all pretty strict with social distancing right now/ have busy family lives that don't leave much time for me. Human connection during COVID has been hard to come by for me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Please hit me with your best reasons to LOVE being single!**

So far, I have:

\- My house stays clean and organized the way I like it.

\- A man’s bad day won’t impact my mood.

\- No possibility of feeling “let down” by lack of romantic gestures/ thoughtfulness from a man who I’m in a relationship with.

\- I don’t have to compromise about where/when I eat meals.

\- I don’t have to worry about a man’s wandering eye.

\- I have extra time for my hobbies/passions.

\- No worrying about someone else’s financial choices.

\- I don’t have to worry about dressing up and looking good on a regular basis (comfortable clothing most days!)",98859,What are your favorite things about being single?,0,,,

Back to the Future is on and there is a scene where Marty is walking outside with his girlfriend. She is being the good supportive gf, trying to boost him up because his band was rejected from some competition. These two girls in 80's aerobics gear walk past them in the opposite direction and Marty literally turns his head to stare after them. His gf lightly grabs his chin and turns his head back to face her, and it's obvious from the scene we are supposed to see that she perceives this as lighthearted and cute and not something to be upset about. Thus the LVM behavior is coded as ""good"" for our consumption, and these messages make their way into our subconscious. Later in the scene she gives him a paper with the phone number of her grandmother's house where he can reach her, and she has written ""I love you"" above the number. She saunters off because her dad has come to pick her up, and Marty looks on as Huey Lewis singing ""That's the POWER OF LOVE"" is cranked up for emphasis.

So she loves him, and he presumably loves her, but he ogles other women in her face.  Nice. I actually never even noticed this scene before, but in life after FDS, you start seeing everything hidden in plain sight. I'm so disappointed and grossed out because I love this movie. 

Needless to say, you can find this insidious coding/programming in many movies and shows, especially comedies. We must be conditioned to see LVM behavior as cute and funny, after all. Stay woke.",98857,"I hate how LVM behavior is coded as ""benign/good"" in popular movies",0,,,

I was at the gym and was doing my workout with headphones on, but my music off. I just wore the headphones so I could work out in peace .
 
On the Machines behind me, two guys were talking about a third guy who wasn’t there.

The first guy was saying that he had the third guy “terrorized” because he would show up at his place randomly at all hours and threaten to beat him up unless he submitted and let him fuck his ass. He went on to describe how dude #3 had a large ass and hips, and if you positioned yourself just right it looked like you were having anal with a woman. Guy #2 said “I thought you were straight” and guy #1 replied that he is straight and has a girlfriend! 

Guy #1 then goes on to invite guy #2 to come with him that night so they could both fuck guy #3. Hearing this made my head spin! At that moment a friend came over to talk to me and The guys shut up when she approached, so that was all I was able to hear of the conversation.

I always identified with the pickme behavior (cooking a 3 course meal for a guy that barely bothers looking up from a video game as you drop the plate off) but not the attribution of said behavior (desperate for male attention). I definitely acted like a ""pickme"", but I was **not** desperate. And I bet many of you don't identify as desperate either. We were in love. We were love. We were embodying the ultimate lover, as we conceived of such a thing. We gave and gave, not because we were deficient and needy, but because we were playing out a sacred relationship archetype. 

Just because you threw some of them at swine, does not mean your pearls are any less beautiful or valuable, or that you were desperate. You were just not selective enough. Women are socialized to be these ""perfect lovers"", and many of us took up that role earnestly. And if men had been likewise socialized, then that probably would have been a good call. I'm sure there are some women who really are quite desperate for approval from any man, most likely due to past traumas, but I think most of us were not desperate for love. We were abundant with love, and gave it from a generous heart. I want to propose we reject the inclination to feel shame for that. 

I love this community. Thank you all.",100151,Reframing of the Pickme Phenomenon,0,,,

I’d also like to mention that I have downloaded it on my phone as a PDF version to have it handy in moments where I need it. 

One chapter I am missing however is anything about STDs. 
Any relationship that I have entered, I expected from the man an STD test before I have sex with him (in the beginning with condom, after a year I a using the pill). The common STDs can be tested in many countries for free. 
I am testing myself after a relationship has ended, and happily before a new one starts, quiet frankly to be on the safe side. 

What are your thoughts around it?

HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY 100k FDS!!!!! Founders , mods and participants you should all feel SOOOOOOO PROUD !!! Before I go to get my celebratory desert on our behalf 😘😍😛. I just wanted to say FDS has empowered me at a time in my life where I’ve literally been bought to my knees career, health and life wise! I was already FDS minded prior to joining BUT FDS has not only upgraded my Reddit experience x1000 ,it has also given me a sisterhood of like minded , badass, boss women to share , commiserate with and confide in, in safety ( FREE FROM THE MALE GAZE) and THAT has literally been a life line for me made even more pertinent during these adverse times!!! Crucially though, it has given me the final push to realise the following:

* MOST women have had eerily similar negative experiences with MOST men REGARDLESS of how attractive they are, their age, race or disposition. Collectively citing behaviour and lived experience does NOT make us bitter and we have ALL been collectively gaslit for far too long...
* I probably do NOT want kids unless my strict requirements are met ( You know or else I'll be told I should have ""chosen better"" ) but if honest, the  child free life is looking more and more like it's for  me AND what an exciting life that will be :).
* I will be certain to continue building a property empire and a sizeable nest egg before marriage IF I decide to do so as whilst I want to settle hypergamously it is CRITICAL that women have their own money, nest egg and source of disposable income and men will ALWAYS be there, as THIRSTY as ever so NO RUSH. Ahem WHAT WALL? LOOOOOL
* I am perfectly content in being single for LIFE if the right man does not come along
* Marriage , whilst an asset with the RIGHT man and at the RIGHT time in a woman's life is by FAR and by design in most mens favour and should NOT be the validating factor in ANY woman's life! *I do believe it should be prioritised if planning on having kids though for security reasons aside from romantic, assuming in a hypergamous union as it should be*

From the bottom of my heart I truly appreciate all that the founders and mods do and to my fellow FDS’ers? I FUCKING LOVE Y’ALL, onwards and UPWARDS DIVAS !!!!!

I read the handbook, learned that I am the prize and that I shouldn't be scared to ""lose someone"" by enforcing my boundaries. FDS isn't just about dating and men though, it is also about leveling up your personality as a whole and working on yourself. Here are some changes I noticed I made after finding this lovely community:

-fashion and posture: I used to be scared of looking nice and put together, but this sub taught me that LVM are less likely to approach women who look confident. I also ruined my previously perfect posture after getting repeatedly catcalled and creeped on by disgusting LVM. However, I fixed my posture again. I can't let the trash get to me.

-I will never approach/chase men again: high school me was that one girl who wasn't scared of anything, so my friends would ask me to go up to boys they liked and ask them for their instagram or phone number. I'd do this shamelessly. I also did it with my ex, I initiated everything but as you can guess that relationship ended. I used to pride myself for having this type of confidence, but I was wrong. Real confidence is not chasing men, or anyone for that matter.

-I am going back to my original self: this sounds strange but here's the thing; my mother preached FDS values my whole childhood, but because I had friends who had different values I felt the pressure to succumb to the pickme mindset. Ladies, I am glad to announce that this won't happen any more. I used to be straightforward with what I wanted, ruthless in my discernment of men and would say exactly what was on my mind. My ex was so sensitive that I had to suppress this part of me, I could not tell him any complaints of mine without his saying ""oh so you want to end it?"" Looking back I should've said ""yes, absolutely"" and moved on.

-My education: I've always been hyper focused on school, but I'm making new rules for myself: absolutely no dating until I finish my degree. Also, I will not date any men who do not hold a degree in STEM (this is a personal preference, I am someone who enjoys math jokes and I constantly had to explain them to my ex who did not know basic calculus... It was frustrating and he made me feel stupid for liking math).

- I stopped wanting to please people: today a guy at my university asked me if I was leaving my library desk as he wanted to take my place, I replied ""yes"". Instead of hurrying up and packing my stuff quickly as I would've done before ""just to be nice"", I took my sweet time. I don't owe this random person anything ✨

-I'm never using OLD again. This is self explanatory, it's full of trash but I relied on it when I was lonely. I don't care how lonely I am, I'll read a book instead. I'm meeting my future husband while working on my PhD, not through a ""wyd"" text on a dating app.

- I've learned that HVM do exist, and I should never settle for less.",100082,How has FDS changed you?,0,,,

For example, a while back traditionalism was more mainstream and accepted (even amongst women), but now theres been a 180 turn. Liberal and sex-positive feminism seem to have become the new 'norm'. I feel like pick-mes have also changed. A while back, a typical pick-me would boast about how she stayed at home and cooked and cleaned, was a virgin, and was 'wifey' material (traditionalism), but now pick-mes are all about watching porn, engaging in degrading sexual acts, polyamory, etc (lib feminism).

Watching porn has become mainstream. Mainstream media gaslighting women into accepting their partners porn consumption has become normal. Fetishes like BDSM have become mainstream. Kink-shaming is the worst thing you can do. Pandering to men and calling it empowering has become mainstream. Essentially a lot of aspects from liberal feminism are now normalized. As mentioned earlier, we socially go through changes. I think as a result of wanting to break free from traditionalism, women decided to do a complete 180 and adopt sex-positive feminism. So eventually, what will happen? Will there be another turn back to traditionalism? Or will something else be introduced?

Also, with men, I'm starting to think things like The Red Pill are becoming more mainstream too. On top of that, the whole acceptance and normalization of watching porn has created a population of porn-addicted men within today's society. So what will the future of men look like?

Things like FDS and radical feminism are not yet mainstream. But, perhaps women will see the dangers of their liberal feminism, and how it actually puts women at risk/ exploits them. However, I do feel as though it's still a long while away. The term 'radical feminism' will scare off many. Women don't want to be seen by men as 'radical', so they tone themselves down in hopes it doesn't scare men off. The main thing with radical feminism, and I think the one thing that completely separates it from liberal feminism, is that it does not pander to men in any way. It places women as the priority and focuses on issues that women face at the hands of men (exploitative porn, sex work, etc.). If a social change happens and a shift to radical feminism is adopted, men would largely be outraged because for once, a movement that does not care to pander to them has gone mainstream. It certainly would not go over well with them, and maybe more of them would not even bother to understand WHY radical feminism was adopted, and rather just go join some movement like MGTOW. This is just my guess of how it will be if radical feminism ever went mainstream.

I was only 16 when I moved in with him and spent the next 15 years building a live with him because he wasn't abusive or directly bad to me. 
I considered our relationship a success the more years went by,  because...hm?. Divorce is embarrassing and I knew what type of dad he would be if we went our separate ways 

My family never said anything,  my friends never said anything,  so for 15 fucking years,  as resentment grew and grew. Being painfully sex deprived while he beat off to porn every day,  convincing myself that picking up dirty boxers, doing all the grow up chores, and paying all the bills,  while raising our son was NORMAL because he didn't abuse me,  or yell at me 

Wanting an open relationship,  wanting a dog so I could walk him. Making a HUGE mess every time he walked into any room.

Telling me he thinks marriage is a sham, having kids is a burden and eventually ""breaking up "" while remaining ""friends "" but using me for sex once a month and companionship without commitment 

Eventually I met LVM 2 who was SO fucking different it blew me away. He wanted me every day,  no porn, affectionate,  the best dad to his dau I'd ever seen.  
HVM I yelled from the top of my lungs,  older than me, sexy, perfect dick, loving!
And a perfect cycle of love bombing,  emotional abuse and money borrowing commenced.

I am mentally the sickest I've ever been, I dived into the ""perfect "" man because he WAS so different,  I was elated for months,  until I realized I was crying every single day,  and eventually punching a mirror out of the frustration of him being perfect to an emotional terror. 19 stitches..

I take FULL responsibility,  I was never taught healthy yet at my sickest I FINALLY have an inkling of healthy , standards and boundaries.  

Thank you for setting me straight,  I am DONE being the good girl who cleans up dirty underwear and lend money because of his sob story.  

I am embarrassed but I finally know now, I am a distance away from a life I dont hate, but I'm on a path, and fuck ALL men , it's rescue dogs moving forward

I am a long time lurker and today i wanted to share something with you. I will apologize in advance for long post, badly composed sentences etc. i am in my phone so this post can get funky..

As the title suggests i came to the conclusion that my father is a LVM.  This post is supposed to be a rant, story time, shower though and discussion.

I thought that women go for LVM because they were seeing patterns at home and thought that is the norm and that is how a partner should be. I guess it is not. 

My grandpa- my moms dad is a HVM. My grandma and grandpa are married for 70 something years years and they still care for eachother. They don’t fight, they embrace their differences and it seems as if my grandpa goes over and beyond to still show affection to my grandma (doing chores for her, doing things that some LVM would think are “woman” work, giving her presents and flowers, even caring for her flowers even though he doesn’t like them etc.) He is still, at 90years, a handy man and works around the house- not as much as he used to but still. He used to make toys for us kids. i find that sweet.  They were kinda odd couple because they both got married pretty late tho, in their early thirties and that was unlikely for people back then.

My mother married at 21, that was the norm 40 something years ago. She chose a man who was successful and kinda rich. Mind me- they are still together and all, he never cheated, so you could say it is a successful marriage. They had few children and she cared for us. He didn’t change a diaper in his life. He didn’t teach us, he didn’t help us with our homework, he was kinda a bad dad. As if I didn’t have one. 
I would understand if he would work at least around the house, help with the hose work, but he is very lazy, he cannot cook, clean, repair stuff. If there weren’t my mom my father would be uncleaned and probably still living at his parents. He is emotionally immature and has alcohol problems. He isn’t aggressive but that is one thing that is again less than optimal.


I am terrified that i will one day marry a dude just like my father. That is why i am constantly searching for red flags on my bf (that can also be a bad thing for relationship, but i cannot help myself). 

I am wondering what is going on with women that they have good role models in their lives but they still chose men that are maybe not very great.

My theory is that:
-patterns that you see in your family do matter in what kind of partner you are subconsciously going after 
-depends on what kind of person you are, you tolerate different things. My grandma is very dominant and everything has to be under her conditions. My mother is a peoples pleaser so she likes that she cares for people, so i guess her marriage suits her.

What did the scrotes have to say about it? 

Sort by controversial on the post to see what I’m going to rant about. 

They made jokes about her acne, compared her before to Sid the Sloth from Ice Age and mocked her by saying she’ll end up alone because “her hisband is going to have one hell of a shock after seeing those kids”. Some even made sexually charged comments about her appertaining now despite knowing her age. 

One commentor even had the audacity to ask why the surgeons didn’t sterilise her during the surgery so she “can’t pass on her defective genes”

Her condition isn’t genetic. Never has been. It’s developmental and environmentally caused. 

Her acne most likely stems from the numerous medications she’s on to help her recover, jaw surgery is a bitch. Even then, acne is just acne. She’s 13 for God’s sake.

I'm still in the middle of my journey -- but hoo boy, I just wanted to pause here as I pack the last of my kitchen stuff into boxes before moving on Monday. I was thinking about how easy it's been -- this move. (Not that moving house is ever something that one actually *likes* doing)

If I'd had a boyfriend -- well, let me correct that. If I'd been with *either of my last two boyfriends* -- this move would have been fraught with arguments, bickering, and irritation, and I probably would have ended up having to do most of it myself, including

1. Scheduling the moving truck/movers
2. Obtaining the boxes/supplies
3. Labeling stuff (and of course the boyfriends would have been shit at this part, and would have resented having to do this sort of ""detail"" work)
4. Ensuring that my cat could be transported with minimal fuss, necessarily involving litter box, cat carrier, cat food, etc
5. Ensuring that utilities were turned on/turned off on the correct days

Like I said, no one actually *likes* moving, but to be honest, this process has been pretty smooth with just me and my cat to worry about.

I started my journey about five years ago, when I realized that no one was going to want an alcoholic waitress for a girlfriend, and I didn't want to be one, either. The reason I was an alcoholic waitress was because I wasn't properly addressing past traumas. My last boyfriend strangled me after I found out he was cheating on me, and in the course of addressing this, I soon realized that my entire childhood had been fucked up.

Make no mistake: The journey to valuing yourself may not be as easy as ""Yasss queen"". You might have to excavate some bullshit. Not just societal bullshit -- family bullshit. And building a mental system that is able to reject gaslighting or (sometimes worse) well-meaning skepticism takes time. Recognizing patterns and being able to address them takes experience. And I am so grateful that I have built this mental system, and I have faith that you can, too.

I've been lucky. I had good friends who trusted me. (And some who didn't, but they're not really close friends anymore) By ""trust"" I mean, leveling up has been received well by them. We've all had that friend who is offended by the fact that you won't accept bullshit anymore, and does their best to poke holes in your newfound confidence or stated goals. Watching you shine shows them how much they aren't shining themselves. Get rid of these people or limit your exposure to them, because they want to keep you small and amenable so they can feel better about themselves. When you shine, you make things a little more unpredictable, and people often don't like that.

Four years ago, I got out of waitressing, and two years ago, I stopped drinking alcohol. I also lost weight, got healthy, fixed my diet. I'm 36 and I regularly get told I look 24 (by 24 year olds).

I've dated off and on in the past four years, but I'm going to be honest here: I messed a lot of that up. I latched onto great men who were doing interesting and cool things, without understanding that *I* needed to be interesting, too. I was able to project an interesting ""aura"" about myself, but there was not much to back it up because, while I *was* cleaning up my life, I wasn't doing enough to fill it back up. I didn't fully understand that I not only wanted to date these men, I also, on a very basic level, wanted to *be* them.

I get it now. It took an obsession with one guy to figure it out. (Don't worry, he was oblivious to it. I didn't embarrass myself ... too much) I'm bringing this up because I think it's easy to say that ""we are queens"" very suddenly, without doing the work behind the scenes to truly understand *why* we are queens. Basically, PLEASE DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP FOR YOUR PAST ACTIONS. I still feel shame about the weird long texts that I sent a different particular guy who really had done nothing wrong.

When you have made yourself small, you start to understand while leveling up that there is suddenly *so much* of you now. You fill *oceans* with yourself. Own that, and I believe in you. Because I believe in myself now.

Another day, another report.

To contextualize I work in a very academically driven hospital and, consequently, surrounded by the most liberal peers, both men and women.

Yesterday, I was working with my supervisor who is dragging his girlfriend along for the past 2 years. They are both mid to late thirties, far from being children or even young adults. I’m in my mid twenties. 

So, we were writing a clinical diary, nothing important mind you, and I wrote “ x patient, 35 years old, married...” and he stopped me right there only to say “oh she isn’t married...that men who was with her is just her boyfriend”.

And this was said with a tone of “being married and being in a relationship in very different.”

This was said by a “very nice and cool” guy, accordingly to most women who work with him. I have nothing to report about him, but that distinction rubbed me off about him, specially because I work with his girlfriend as well and she ia clearly hoping or expecting for a long term relationship.

Even unconsciously they know the difference. That was a very spontaneous statement, which only confirm what we all already know: they have know issue dragging women along. And liberal or not, they all know the difference between serious commitment and “just in a relationship”. All of them.

Be aware and be smart! ;)",100525,All men know the difference between boyfriend and husband,0,,,

The video went viral and people (aka men) of course found the social media of the girl and have been posting memes with her face, spreading her personal information, sending her messages asking for sex service the next time she's on the train and basically harrassing her. No one got themselves the work of finding out the guys' social media, making fun of them, making memes with their face or harrassing them. No one knows who these men are. These men have face ZERO repercussions. Regardless of the role of the girl in this or not, I know that having sex in public places like this is a crime, but why is the girl the only one blamed?  Why can't people shut up and let the authorities deal with the situation?

I don't know the back story and why this girl was having sex in a train, and not much less with two men, was she forced and coerced? Was it by her own will? No one knows. But it's disgusting that women always get the short end of the stick and are humiliated in these situations when the men get pats in the back and zero consequences. No one cares to humiliate men caught having sex on video, no one cares to destroy their lives. But women? Their lives are ruined for ever and harrassed to no end. This girl is probably traumatized enough or has enough issues that led her to what happened in the train, but now instead of getting support or at least anonymity, she's even getting even more traumatized by men and humiliated for everyone to see. Even the news make it seem like this girl was the only culprit of the sex scene, only mentioning these 2 guys as an afterthought. 

Many years ago there was also a viral video of a girl having sex with several guys. She was also harrassed and joked about online for years until she killed herself.

&amp;#x200B;

This serves even more as a lesson that casual sex or even being filmed having sex even if it's within a relationship will only ruin women's lives. There's nothing in it for us, we're always going to be the ones humiliated, insulted and disrespected and the men always get off no consequences because no one cares about men being caught on camera having sex.",100505,Viral videos of women having sex,0,,,

Ladies, your womb is quite literally the most sacred space and holds so much power. You as a woman have the sole power to control life on this planet as we know it. I say all this to emphasize: 

**DO NOT LET LVM/NVM GET YOU PREGNANT**: You will suffer.

1. **Pregnancy is extremely traumatic to a woman’s body.** You carry this child, with no ones assistance but your own. You are the one that will grow and transform in a way that will almost appear alien to you for a continuous 9 months. It is YOU that carries all the risks and complications of becoming pregnant. The emotions, the hormones — everything. LVM will often make you feel afraid, lonely, anxious and unwanted during pregnancy. He will nag you for sex (during and postpartum), depend on you to continue housework and not tend to your basic needs as a pregnant woman. 
2. **Raising children is expensive.** LVM fathers will often leave the mother to not only the child rearing but expect her to work a full time job. He doesn’t have a provider mentality, and often expects you to split with him or even take care of most of the bills as he spends lavishly on his own hobbies. This is assuming the male stays after birth. 
3. **In our society, most males aren’t bound to fatherhood.** They are able to come and go, while the woman bares almost all the responsibility of raising children. LVM will find it easy to leave, and you basically have to sit there and take it. You are expected to care for that child now, regardless of his absence. Now you are stuck in a hussle and tussle with the courts over his crack change to take care of his kids. 

Having children with LVM will quite literally ruin your life. Unfortunately, in our society, we have cultivated a mentality in young women that having children with *any* man is a prize. **It’s not**. More often, women are left with all the burden and responsibilities of children. 

A LVM will destroy your life if you let him. Wear condoms like your life depends on it. In fact, I advocate for no sex for at least 3 months and also STI checks if possible. Males can infect you with deadly diseases that could bar you from having children later on. 

Lastly, I really advocate for **rings before children.** 

The man you choose to have children with should be kind, patient, caring, and most importantly, empathetic. You can only do this by vigorously vetting and ensuring the genes you allow to enter your bloodline will be totally cared for and loved. If all fails, at least marriage will protect you and your children financially.",100459,PROTECT YOUR WOMB LIKE ITS THE LAST THING YOU DO,0,,,

 in a pick meisha world.

I fell for this guy from high school at age 23. We dated for 6 months and I thought things were going well. He was sweet would bring me wine and we would watch anime together. 

He related to me and even wrote me love letters when he worked. 

A few weeks before his court for his car accident was coming up and he was getting settlement he broke up with me. 

I was so hurt because here I was a single mother, at the time working at a dollar store, and it felt like the whole world crashed. 

As soon as he knew he had the money in his hands he was gone. 

I was acting the pick meisha. Don’t leave me, I can’t believe you would do this, did my words mean nothing. Nothing actually meant anything, he went on with his life as if we never met or I didn’t exist.

And yet here 6-7 years later I get a message

“Hey how’s things been? Long time no talk, shitty how things ended so abruptly back then”
 
He has what looks like a 2 year old. 
Like obviously 🙄 doing what he did after he broke up with me. 

Lol 😂 all I have to say is no way in anything would I EVER let this man back into my life. 

Life literally handed me the proof that this man would just up and leave at the drop of a pin. 

For all you ladies going through a break up rn, he ain’t shit. 

6 years down the road they are going to message you and you are going to say, wow I am lucky I missed that bullet.

3) women can not have youthful exploration and learn and grow from it. They are forever marked by that time (even if it’s been 20 years since) and if she’s different with you, it’s a personal insult. Also she is forever obligated to not only disclose all her personal history and business, but is also forbidden to refuse to do any sexual act she has done before, regardless of how it makes her feel now. Her feelings are just excuses and it means she doesn’t respect you as a man

4) women need to be “open minded” and try anything their partners want. How can she expect him to go down on her otherwise, she won’t even give him anal and bondage! Never mind that these things aren’t analogous because women aren’t pleasured by porn sex and lots can’t even come just from a dick.

5) speaking of going down, women shouldn’t expect that because pussies are gross. But BJs come standard.",101084,👑u/pickmieshaexorcist👑 put together these 5 Reddit LVM sex commandments,0,,,

Many women believe that the term means something like “wait and see”, or “it’s bad, but not *that* bad, or “I’ve noted it, but I’ll still continue”. And it’s time to screw that  definition. If a man does something that you deem to be a red flag, and you don’t immediately act on it by aborting mission, then it’s not a red flag for you. It’s really that simple. 

When the traffic light is red, you don’t continue driving. You stop. So, why continue in a relationship when you’re acknowledged that there are red flags present? Because they’re not red flags to you. If you’re willing to tolerate a certain behaviour from a man, no matter how bad and asinine it is, then you can’t deem it a red flag. Call it amber, green or whatever you want to call it. But it’s not red. A red flag means abort mission. Stop. Do not pass Go. Do not proceed. Danger ahead.

Vetting is only a small part of the process. If you’re not willing to act on the information that you discover, whether it’s good or bad, then you may as well not bother. Recognising red flags and acting upon them requires you to maintain some level of emotional distance and to have high levels of self-esteem. If you let poor behaviour slide, if you get comfortable with a man exhibiting so many red flags that a communist rally would be jealous, then you’re allowing your boundaries to busted. 

And if you’re willing to stick around after he’s shown you who he is, red flags and all, then it’s time to do some soul searching and find out why you think it’s okay to accept less than you deserve. Red flags are not ornamental parts of someone’s character. They’re a clear sign of profound pain and misery down the road. Take heed of them and act accordingly.",101087,What a red flag really is,0,,,

Some of you ladies REALLY need to read that handbook in the sidebar.

I've been seeing literal arguments break out in some threads with some women trying to justify walk dates with COVID risks. Yes, there's still a pandemic. Yes, sitting at a table with someone to eat a meal isn't in line with social distancing guidelines. But do you seriously think walking in a park sipping coffee with that same stranger is any safer? You're not six feet apart, you're not wearing your masks, and if you need to take these measures just to go out in public with a stranger that's a sure sign that [your ass should've stayed home to begin with](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/i0emf9/friendly_reminder_that_dating_during_a_pandemic/).

LVMs are using COVID risks and your desperation to justify this lack of effort. It's another way to play the numbers game right in front of your face. Consider how safe that walk date really is when he's trying to do the same thing with five other women this week. Don't you feel special?",101085,"COVID is not an excuse to accept low-effort dates.

A previous post inspired me to write this. The post was about another guy who didn't wanted to take a girl for a dinner date but only for a walk....  


I want to tell you this (especially the male lurkers) that the only real dates turned into an relationship. From the age 16 till 23 I went on all kind of dates. Walks, eating at subway, going to the cinema only etc. But all these ''dates'' never turned into a second date. NO not because I excepted a fancy dinner, damn I was way to introverted to go to a restaurant back then. But because there was no click with the guy...   


I too in that day got a lot of complains that I used them for: ''Free food and etc''. Really? In that day I worked hard and had enough money. I was busy with my own company and had a lot of other stuff to do. I didn't need any free food or company, I really had that enough of my own. I went on a ''date'' with you guys because we BOTH wanted to see if there was a click. But all these ''cheap dates'' there was no click. One guy almost cried about that his father left him, other guys kept staring at my breasts, some even tried to kiss me or touch my breasts or even my pussy! and you know what was the craziest thing? The way I dressed. I didn't dress as a slut at all! I wore a normal black jeans, with sneakers, and normal man t-shirt from a metal band! I only wore mascara and thats it! That is how I dress if you ask me to go to subway. Yet I still got assaulted!   


The only dates that resulted in a relationship were the dates that were at a nice/normal place. For example my last date that turned into a relationship: The guy was 27, we met on a dating website. If I remember correctly, I was the one who first send him a message. I wasn't really sure about this guy, but my feeling said I needed to give him a chance. So after chatting for a while we continued talking on whatsapp and discord. We played games together, talked  A LOT together till late in the night. We were on the same level. He never talked about sex or made jokes about. He didn't push me to go on a date. So after a while when we both felt good, we went on a date. It was the day before my birthday. We met somewhere close to my home (20 minutes by train). He had to drive about 45 minutes by car. We met were a lot of other people were around, the trainstation. (Because I came from there and I knew the way to were we wanted to go and he didn't) He stood on a good spot were I could see him from far away. He stood there nice and a good smile. He gave me very good feelings. He wore nice jeans, a cool jacket (which I really loved) and a pokémon t-shirt. (Now I hear all the FDS people screaming here, but I didn't care about that because we are both gamers and Pokémon fans) He also took good care of his face, hair etc. Wore a nice perfume and deodorant and even had a vest with him if I didn't liked the shirt.   


We first drank something to see if we clicked. We both had a great time and we continued to go to my favorite arcade hall (5 minute walk) There he let me choose which games I wanted to play and even paid for it. (€20? maybe even more?) Than I asked which games he wanted to try and he showed me a few. (I was really happy he didn't say anything like: ''uuhmm the ones you like''  So I was happy that he had a mind of his own and not to follow me like a dog. We still had a lot of fun and he really gave me the feeling that he REALLY CARED about me. We still had a good time and the night was young so we continued with eating at a restaurant. Not to fancy, because we both weren't dressed for that and I like the more normal restaurants than the high end. He paid for the restaurant and after that we drank somewhere else and continued talking. Eventually it was getting late and I had to go home. He walked with me to the train. There was this magic moment, we looked at each other and he said: ''Happy birthday'' I was like wut? ''that is tomorrow'' He said: '' its 00:00'' And than he gave me this sweet happy birthday card with a very sweet and heartwarming text in it that he wrote himself! We kissed and god, he kissed so nice! I was stunned, amazed, everything was so beautiful and perfect &lt;3 We continued to date a few more times, but we both knew that we were going to be lovers and from moment one that we wanted to be together forever. He was VERY patient because I came out of a horrible gaslighting relationship and didn't wanted to rush me to be his GF.   


And no he didn't had a high salary, or was in his dream job. But he did love his ''normal'' job and he was extremely good at it which admired me him even more.   


So a bit tl;dr: Guys, it is about the impression you make, the things you do for her and she for you. She risks to go out with a stranger, dresses all up, and travels to see you. I know that for you guys this seems as nothing, but don't forget how many women get murderd or raped, assaulted. Women really don't go out for fun to get free food, or company. Women put a lot of energy in dating, and most of them are tired because of every guy that comes up with: ''hey wanna have sex?'' Women really want a normal relationship and don't care a lot about sex, that is just a nice extra. Women are also tired of all the violence men give them for not wanting to have sex with them or not letting them assault them.   


Want a good date? Show how much she really means for you! Give her a good feeling by being nice and caring. Don't talk or joke about sex! Yes pay for her food that will give you so much bonus points! Why would you not pay €40,- for food? She came all the way to meet you, putted a lot of effort in it while it is dangerous and she is not even €40,- worth to you? 

&amp;#x200B;

Guys, having a good date is totally not hard! And if you don't want to waste €40,- on 10 dates, THAN DON'T GO ON 10 DATES! You swipe every girl to the right in the hope to get a date. But if you first talked to women you REALLY like, you would have more energy, time and money for the right women. You can bet €10,- on every number, in the hope to win something, but you lost all your money on every other number. While if you bet €100,- on the right number, you would have won big!   


or to say better: Don't waste all your money on large quantity of cheap bait in hope that some fish bites. Spend you money on good quality bait and know where the good fish are.",101084,Only a real date ends in a relationship.,0,,,

I tell him if it's just for talking normally no, but for dating yes I'm not a fan of age gap relationships.

So he asks me if he's too old for girls my age in general. Now this has me suspicious. I tell him I'm not every girl my age so I can't confirm that. Cause there will be some other late teen or early teen who'd say he's not too old. It's not good at all but that's unfortunate reality. I then ask him ""why girls my age though?"". And the he replies ""idk"".

Yeah, I'm forever suspicious of men who look for younger girls. I was groomed multiple times by ""older men"" starting from when I was aged 13 online, on kik actually. Luckily none of it happened in person but it still had a horribly negative affect on me. I used to he one of those girls who say they like ""older men"". I still kind of do but then I remember not all older men are like the ones I have crushed on. They're usually ugly crust lords with horrible entitlement issues and deeply ingrained insecurities.

I've heard over and over men telling each other to girl for girls like me. The young naive ones with daddy issues. They're playing on the fact that they KNOW I needed validation from an older male. Or just male attention in general.. They know girls like me didn't get much attention at all growing up.

I had known this guy for few months now. He is also an Indian living in the US and working as a resident. I am a medical graduate applying for residency this year.

He had asked me out multiple times previously and I refused every single time. 

He used to contact me occasionally. I remained in touch with him for professional reasons.


Last week, he called me and asked if it will be possible to meet for dinner and he was pressuring me to say yes. I said maybe during the weekend since I really didn’t want to go out with him because I had never gone out on a date. (I know it might seem odd but just my cultural upbringing.)

He called me again the next day and convinced me that he is only free that day and to go out with him. He was telling me it was just a date to dinner and that I have to learn to go out and meet people and I agreed. He also said that meeting residents like him will help for my upcoming match season.

He drove one hour to meet me and he asked me to choose a restaurant and we had dinner. When he opened the door for me, he groped my butt the first time. I was too nervous to react. I keep blaming myself that I should have reacted that first time when he did it.

After dinner, since most places were closed and there was an ikea nearby- I suggested we can go there. He kept touching my butt while in ikea and I told him to take his hands off because we were in ikea and he said that all that doesn’t matter in the US. I tried to hold hands with him so his hands won’t touch my butt.

We then went to the parking lot and he groped my butt and I pushed his hand away. He asked if we can hug- I thought that will prevent him from groping me. But when we were hugging, he was pushing his pelvis so hard against mine and I tried moving away. He asked me if he can touch my boobs and I clearly said no and he still tried to touch my boobs 5 to 10 min later. 

I also told him that he groping me was making me uncomfortable and yet he groped me.
He asked if he can kiss me and I had never kissed a guy before and told him that I am saving it for a special moment and don’t want it to be like this and he kept asking me so many times to kiss him and I refused every time. So I allowed him to kiss me on my cheeks.

I had zero chemistry and attraction towards him. I was feeling extremely uncomfortable and I keep blaming myself that maybe I should have been much more stronger and voiced my opinion more boldly. 

It’s been 5 days since this happened and I am sleep late every night. I was very hurt after the incident and I keep blaming myself that I put myself in this situation. I try not to think about it but when I do, I feel very hurt and used. This is the first time I am going out with a guy and he behaved like this to me.

He wanted to meet me again and I told him yes when he asked but I had planned that I would never speak to him after I go him. 

He contacted me few times to ask if we can meet again and I never opened his msgs since they were triggering all this and I just opened them sometime back  - he asked me why I was ignoring him and he asked if it was because he made me uncomfortable that day. So he knew he made me uncomfortable and still continued behaving like that with me. 

I want to let him know that how he treated me was unacceptable and that I feel very violated because he didn’t respect when I said no. But when it was all happening, I didn’t react boldly so I keep blaming myself. 

I want to block him after sending him a msg that he is a fucking pervert who tried to hang out with me in the guise of a friend. 

I just need some support since I keep blaming myself.",101042,Went on my first date and got groped.,0,,,

On my last two dates pre-pandemic, I went out with two guys IN A ROW who both did the same weird thing: they “copied” me as a form of negging. For example, they copied my body language. Like if I stood with my hands on my hips, they stood the same way, not unintentionally but purposefully in a mocking way. And there were various parts of the conversation where they’d both repeat what I said and tried to copy the tone of my voice or my intonation I guess to make fun of what I was saying. 

I have two questions about this. One, why?? They both asked for second dates, so I guess they were into me. Obviously I blocked and deleted. But can we just take a moment to appreciate the lack of logic here?? Why would they think I’d be attracted to someone that spent an entire date mocking me and trying to make me feel self conscious? Wouldn’t you want to make someone feel good about you and themselves in order to get a second date?

Second question - how did I find two guys in a row that did the same exact weird thing? Has anyone else encountered this or did I just win the weird guy lottery? I got so fed up that I decided to take a break from OLD, and then the pandemic happened so it was kind of self enforcing. I haven’t been on a date since.

Inspired by another post here about the guy who told on himself. This applies to men AND women!

*most “jokes” are truth in disguise, they are testing your tolerance to see what you’re willing to accept. This includes “dark humor”, “sarcasm”, putting you down, putting themselves down, etc. (AKA telling on themselves/trash taking itself out.)

They won’t change, don’t hope it’s “just a joke”. You should still take them seriously and take them as they are, call them out if you want to see them fumble. If you’re not laughing with them, it’s not a joke.

People will always tell you who they are, so listen! They are always purposely/subconsciously dropping hints to see if you’re ok with their behaviour. 

Why? Because people are desperate to be known, understood and appreciated. They leave hints, they WANT you to know them. We all do it, so best to watch what you reveal as well.

If they tell you who they are, that’s what they want to be or are allowing themselves become. 

This is why we never do self deprecation or put ourselves down. Don’t make yourself small to make others feel comfortable or more confident around you.

Here are some common ones! 

1. “I’m an empath. I’m empathetic.”
T: I’m a “nice guy/girl.” My morals make me superior to everyone, but also I am a hypocrite.

“Empath” has somehow been twisted 
 from “clairvoyant” to “I’m a nice guy/girl”. Beware, they are not using this word correctly and do not know the definition of empath or empathy.

2. “I’m an asshole. 😉
T: I am socially awkward, have little self awareness and allow myself to be an asshole because I think it’s cool.

3. “I hate cats.” (Not “I’m not a cat person” it’s a hate for cats.)
T: I have no concept or respect for boundaries, not even my own. I am controlling. I seek immediate gratification and convenient relationships.

4. -Zodiac sign or MBTI in profile-
T: (especially if they talk about it) This is a part of my identity, and I like the sound of it. I am allowing myself to be like this group/stereotype.

5. “You’ll be the better looking one.”
T: You must be better looking than me to date me.

6. -anything misogynistic-
T: I blame other people for my failures as a human being and refuse to take responsibility for myself and actions. (See 1.)

7. Mentions “six figures”, name/brand drops, or flexes on you for no reason. (Not the same as being proud or having accomplishments)
T: I have an inferiority complex and I need to remind you I am superior to you. I will constantly flex on you to remind you I’m better than you. I need power because I feel powerless.

8. “I value intelligence and logic.”
T: Everyone who thinks differently than me is stupid. I have little personal growth as a human being and happen to be a “unmotivated genius” tyvm.

&gt;Couples counseling tends to be counter-productive in an abusive relationship for many reasons. One is that this type of therapy assumes the concept of mutuality in the relationship and that the problems are based on a systemic problem between the two parties.

&gt;Couples counseling helps people with conflict resolution, communication problems, childhood issues brought to the relationship and struggles with intimacy.

&gt;In an abusive relationship, mutual goals cannot be attained because the abusive member is not interested in equality.

&gt;Couples counseling sends the message to both the batterer (batterer can be physical, emotional, and/or psychological in nature) and his partner that the problem is mutual and that somehow the partner is responsible (at least in part) for the abuser’s behaviors.

&gt;This type of “provocation causing the abuse” was a common theory in the 1960s and 70s for couples counseling practices. Terms like, “she pushed my buttons” get credibility and both the perpetrator and the victim believe she is somehow culpable for instigating the abuse.

&gt;Both members of the partnership are taught to focus on their feelings when in couples counseling. This approach is counterproductive in an abusive relationship because the abuser spends too much time already focusing on his feelings and not enough time focusing on other people’s feelings (particularly his partner’s).",100982,Why couples counseling doesn't work with an abuser,0,,,

I use to be an awful pickmeisha basically until I found this sub. I honestly had no framework for relationships or anything. I just kept getting with guys that liked me that I felt a certain way for. I would fall hard and fast.

NO. THIS IS NOT A STRATEGY. It’s a recipe for disaster.

I’ve been in relationships with LVM who have cheated on me, emotionally and mentally abused me, and neglected me. FDS literally made me confront my past.

These relationships resulted in YEARS of wasted time and lots of emotional heartache. And keep in mind being with a LVM makes you lose time looking for and being with a HVM.

When on those first dates with the guys, remember to focus on finding the right man, not a relationship.

I don’t recommend telling them on the first date or second date that you’re looking for a relationship. You wouldn’t jump into one with someone that soon right? So I don’t recommend telling him you want one so fast even if its true you wish for a relationship. If he’s a HVM and interested he won’t need to ask, he would be able to tell by how you act.

I think the reason I believe in FDS so much at this point in my life, is because I found it after a terrible relationship where the beginning was almost like a spoof or parody of everything FDS advocates NOT to do. 

Including:

1. Oversharing. I always thought that being “radically honest” and emotionally open about my life and experiences meant that I could find someone to love me truly, deeply, warts and all. Nah, sis, I found someone who would then use all that information against me- I learned that men didn’t have limits about how low they’d stoop when they were angry. There are no “no go zones”. Shitty ex? They’ll bring him up. Shitty dad? Fair play. 

2. *Them* oversharing. Omg a man is being honest about his heartbreak?! Telling me about his abusive ex?! He must be soooo emotionally intelligent! NO. He’s lying, he’s manipulating - he’s basically saying “here is a manual for what I don’t want you to be. Here is also an excuse for whenever I treat you like shit. Here is also a subconscious injection of someone you can compare yourself to obsessively, because I’ve signalled their significance by bringing them up so much”. 

3. Being too available. With time, with emotions, with all resources. 

4. Sex before commitment. There is a subset of men who will endeavour to be really good in the bedroom to get you hooked, because they’ve really got not much else to offer in terms of qualities or skills. Dick goggles are REAL. Protect yourself. 

5. Saying “I love you” first. Talking about the future first. He baited me into these... and then accused me of lovebombing him. If men have nothing else, they still have the audacity.

People come in here, acting like we all have no other model of relationships or dating. Like we haven’t tried being the niCe GiRl, the cOmMuNiCaToR, tHe nUrTuReR... nah. We’ve either done it ourselves and fallen on our asses or seen it happen to someone we love. We *know* there’s another way to have relationships, what separates FDS is that we also know the other way DOES NOT WORK. It hurts us.",94776,I know FDS is true because ...

It's because women are actively protesting against it. The reason why women were allowed to vote isn't because men suddenly decided they should be, it's because women demanded it.

Men can't change on their own. They need to be changed by us. They're far too primitive and self-centered to think about us.

So... Yes, it absolutely is their fault that they're LVM and that they're disgusting, there's no doubt about this. But will they change on their own? I don't think so. I think we should keep blaming men and everything bad they do is absolutely their fault, but they won't change as long as pickmes don't change

Yet, I think women are doing the bare minimum. It's depressing that many women feel as if they can only demand the lowest possible decency from men because ""men will be men"". 

If pickmes continuously enable their behaviour, they will be more prone to doing terrible things and behaving like unweaned babies because they don't HAVE to change. If all pickmes suddenly realized that they shouldn't adhere to the patriarchal society, men would be forced to change otherwise they'd have to give up what they love, adore, worship and LIVE for: sex.

But the existence of pickmes is often owed to trauma caused by LVMs and the society we live in. It's tragic, really. We, women, are alone in this fight because men are NEVER going to change unless they HAVE to. So... I think the first step to fighting society is to enlighten as many women as possible of the truth, which is exactly why I'm so grateful this sub exists.",94572,I think the sad and disgusting truth is that the only reason there are so many LVMs is because there are so many pickmes.

And telling him that I expect the man to pay on all dates even when we will be married with a joint account.

He told me that he doesn’t want to pay all the times and a lot of men won’t like it. I told him that he certainly thinks that because he’s not in the situation where the girl is being amazing to him and he feels like he has a chance with her. If the girl is looking good, shows affection and appreciation all the times, i know he won’t care about paying all the time. He says that even if he has a chance with her, he wants to see that she’s also generous. I said that I show that I’m generous by making the man try my food with my fork. And by giving money or food to the homeless and spending money on lingerie that the man will enjoy as well .

I feel like most men I’ve never met women in their mature feminine essence/doing FDS. 

Then he told me that he dated that architect for 4 years and she was giving him money some times. I asked if he was madly in love with her and he replied “hmm, I was happy. It’s nice that she would offer stuff sometimes”. I asked again “ but were you madly in Love ?” And the answer was “no !”

You see, their brain is wired in a way that they can’t fall deeply in love if they don’t have to work for it. Us women in pickme mode can fall in love with the biggest loser that brings nothing to our lives because society made us emotionally desperate. But for men their brain just don’t trigger the love chemicals if they have nothing to do to be with us. It’s law. They can date you be content  around you because you’re super low maintenance and they can spend that money on sneakers instead, but they won’t feel deep love. 


My friend mentioned that she used to date that successful CEO who was always picking up the check for her the first 3 months. She was not into him at the beginning but feelings ended up growing on her. She started to pay for him on dates and you know what ?! He stopped making an effort. He would ask her to come to his place at 8pm although he would be away for a week for work. Became lazy to go out . She found a bill of a restaurant in his stuff for 2 on a Sunday . It wasn’t with her.
In why men love bitches, they say “if he doesn’t spend money on you, he will spend it on another woman”",94508,Men don’t fall in love when you serve yourself on a platter,0,,,

I met this guy, who was super nice... took me on few dates. I wasn't looking for something serious so on one date, I did exactly what is recommended here. Make out and i realize.. ""oohhhhh"". But in the flow, I was like.. lets fuck it and see if he let's me off. Godddd.... not only he didn't bother getting me off... he didn't put any effort even after I asked him. To top it off, he kept asking me if his dick was small. Oh dude... yes your dick is small and your confidence and slef steem is smaller than this and you better not try to date  a women. And go to the therapy for dealing such trauma like small dick and learn to make women off with other things if your tool doesn't work.

Sis, no matter how good looking, nice and charming someone is. Run away as far as you can, when you find out he has a small one. Chances are, not only his dick is small... he also has not enough exp or desire to put effort to make a woman off. We live only once and we should not be teaching these scrotes, how to put their tiny pipi to work.

After following FDS and taking a break from dating, I think I’m in a much better place and a lot more confident in myself.

Anyway, I recently had a first date with a guy I met on Tinder. We talked for a few days before he asked me out. I didn’t feel comfortable going to a restaurant due to COVID (I live in America and most everything is open even though it probably shouldn’t be) so we did a park date instead, which I know can be low effort but there’s not much else to do. He brought some drinks and things to keep us entertained and I had a good time. He was very confident, chill, funny, and our conversations flowed well.

He offered to give me a ride back to my place (I don’t have a car but I live in the city, while he lives just outside of it) and on the car ride, he asked to see me again this weekend. He suggested picking me up to go over to his place and I (stupidly) agreed in the moment because I wanted to see him again and couldn’t think of anything else to do in this pandemic. 

Now I’m afraid that he was just inviting me over for sex/physical intimacy (even though I did not kiss or hold hands with him on the first date, and he didn’t try to do anything either) and I’m wondering what I should do? I want to suggest doing something else like a picnic in the park, or a drive-in movie (both things he mentioned during the date) but I also don’t want to be the one who plans the date. Should I just tell him I’m not comfortable going over to his place, or try to meet up earlier in the day to avoid any late-night shenanigans? Would it be alright to ask him if there’s anything interesting to do around his area?

I just don’t know how to establish these boundaries without putting in too much effort on my part. TIA!",94502,"Was invited over to his place, what should I do?",0,,,

I can't say much more about that right now, but whatever. 

 Last night I got into it with my boyfriend, and went outside to take a walk. He followed me and kept yelling at me, not letting me move away from him. We were arguing about something I had found on his phone. He shoved his phone in my face for whatever reason, so I grabbed it and threw it. When I did that, my boyfriend grabbed my by the shoulders and kinda hit me. 

 All of a sudden I hear a young woman across the street shout in the most aggressive voice ""GET YOUR FUCKING HANDS OFF OF HER! I HAVE 911 DIALED ALREADY AND I CARRY A GUN, I WILL FUCKING SMOKE YOU IF YOU TOUCH HER AGAIN!"". 

Yall, she was amazing. She couldn't have been more than 21 or 22 and she was so solid. Boyfriend left me alone after that and walked the other way. I thanked the girl and apologized for the drama. She said she had been watching the confrontation and was ready to do whatever was necessary. She actually stayed in her car after she arrived home just so she could see that I got away safely.

One thing I see a lot of women getting wrong is their perception of what financial independence looks like in a relationship. Your SO paying for most of the dates and utilities doesn't show financial dependence and you going 50/50 with your SO doesn't show financial independence. 

From a financial standpoint, 50/50 only works in relationships where both partners earn similar amount of money. But in relationships where there is a significant income gap, 50/50 is detrimental to the person earning lesser, which typically tends to be the woman. If the guy earns significantly more, he'll be able to save a higher % of his income by going 50/50 than he would if the expenses were split proportionally. If you're earning way less and are going 50/50, you'll be *spending* a higher % of your income, therefore you'll be saving way lesser money. This will come back to bite when things go south in the relationship and you have to leave. Not having enough savings means you won't be able to afford basic necessities (housing, food, etc) without the help of your SO or depending on someone else to lend you money. THIS is financial dependence, but most people would say the opposite simply by looking at the point that you're splitting it 50/50. This is why it's important to save a good % of your money, for emergencies and for future goals. 

Also, frankly, I wouldn't advise anyone to be a stay at home mom. It's a very risky position to be in. But to each their own, so if you really want to be a stay at home mom, please find a way to make money from home. Take some money and learn how to invest in stock market, or start a small business, or if you're good at a particular skill, make money by teaching it to others. You never know what happens in the future. People change, circumstances change. You want to be prepared for the worst and hope for the best. 

I don't get how women of this generation are more educated than our foremothers yet we still see a lot of women not use their common sense in matters like this. Money is important. Learn how to save, invest and budget your income, regardless of your relationship status. A romantic relationship shouldn't stress your bank account. Keep that in mind.",94432,Money is power.

We're making a monthly sticky to address any issues people are having with the website sign up.

**If you filled out a membership application on the website in the last 30 days, you should have received an email from us:**

* Rejecting your application and suggesting alternative forms of verification
* Reminding you to sign up with your 8 or 9 digit code
* Informing you we were unable to direct message you your code on your platform of choice

**If you applied prior to 8/1 and did not receive an email from us - we have purged your data for security purposes and you will need to sign up using our new membership form here:** [Sign Up Form](https://www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com/8-digit-code)

Thank you for bearing with us through all the changes we’ve been making on the site!

2. **Use Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter for an expedited approval process.** Our reddit requests are backlogged and many of you are far too new for us to verify your account on the website. For expedited sign up, please apply with your instagram or twitter accounts.
3. **Please make sure you can receive DMs on your platform of choice.** There were some people we tried to send codes to who had their Direct Messages disabled, so we had to pass. If you are unsure, please DM the official FDS twitter or instagram accounts so we can respond.
4. **Please be patient! Due to demand, We are on about a 5 day lag on sending out 9 digit codes.** If you are not an existing sub member or someone we can easily identify as female from your social media, OR we can't reach you, you will likely be passed over for someone else in the queue and not revisited until the end of the month.
5. **If you do not sign up within 60 days of receiving your code, you will be bumped from the approval queue completely and will have to start over.** We have some members who we've sent codes to who as of yet have yet to create an account. Please do so ASAP!

For women who are/were in a similar situation, how do you get comfortable with expressing and actually enforcing your boundaries? 

I have a major problem standing up for myself. And I have problems with conflict, especially when dealing with someone with a strong personality. I'd rather run away than deal with interpersonal problems, most of the time.

This has been my biggest issue in past relationships, and I still struggle with it. I'm leveling up in other ways, but I can't seem to push past this barrier. It makes me feel weak and resentful, people end up treating me like a doormat, and don't respect me.

I know it seems from my upbringing, where I was taught that my individual needs and wants didn't matter, where I was always in second place to the boys in my family. I was raised to be polite to everyone and to never talk back, especially to someone older or in a position of power. And my mom has a strong, stubborn personality and any attempt at standing up for myself resulted in her screaming at me for hours and calling me rude and disrespectful. So I'd just keep quiet and go along with what she wanted. There were never any strong women in my family who I could emulate.

As a result, I've let people constantly push my boundaries and I have difficulty saying ""no"" and getting them to take me seriously. For example, I would know it was time to break up with or ghost a man, but I couldn't bring myself to actually do it. Or I'd constantly let NVM/LVM back into my life. Or I can't put my foot down when they disrespect me and ignore my first ""no"". I don't know what's stopping me.

I have no issues being alone, and even though my mind knows the right thing to do, I have trouble speaking the words and actually getting my meaning across. I used to have major self-esteem and self-worth issues that I'm working on. 

I''m looking for a good therapist to help me work through this, but in the meantime, what have you ladies done that worked for you?",95048,Getting over discomfort with enforcing boundaries,0,,,

I’m in a spot. Currently taking my power back from an abusive LVM. 

Filed for divorce. Going through with it. As limited contact as possible until I can escape. 

Anyways...needing some strength. 

This SCROTE used the CHURCH to manipulate and trap me. 

Think every time I would be BrAve eNoUgH to discuss my suspicions that he was a cheater...he would tell me “TELL SATAN TO GET BEHIND YOU THOSE ARE EVIL THOUGHTS. I MAY BE A POOR, miserable sinner, but NEVER an adulterous man! Can we pray together??”  

I’d dump him. Or try to. 

Then it was always Sunday mass and meeting with the priest.

Hi my queens,

While watching the Housewife series and being on FDs has realy brought me insights and lessons about what I what in life and what I do not

These women are ""rich an powerful "" because of their looks and husbands. Most of them do not participate or have their own businesses.

What has it brought to their lifes are mostly signs of insecurities all the time, in which having no project or assets on their own plays a huge role.

They try to make themselves useful to their husbands by making contacts.  So they make huge efforts to please people all the time, we all know that is not a way that can bring you peace in life and in your mind.

They are constantly stuggling with power : they want to prove they can do something by themselves and they have some power , all the time yet their showed biggest strength shown in the series is to talk to their husbands to make him ""punish "" the other ( Housewifes of Beverly hills, season 1, Camille makes her husband stop doing business with another woman's husband).

They life is fear of losing their husbands,because without them their lifestyles is done.

Their activities consits of going out to social events, mostly in this series. In these vents, they have misunderstandings, comments to and about each other. And they pass weeks, months, talking about the same sentences, moments, that can be really insignificant sometimes yet they insist always on doing this to prove , show that people cannot put them down.

Another observation : the housewifes that participate the less in drama are the ones that participate in their husband's businesses the most,work with them.

Plus, most of them do not try to genuinely help and encourage their sisters. Which is a big no no for ma and other members of the FDS community which is all bout being surrounded by people that you chose to love you and to love them.

As for the lessons that I took from it :

Even if I chose to become a housewife, I'll take care of my mind and wallet, have and do something for me.

I can't and won't chose to live a life that revolves around me dating or being the spouse of any person.

I just want to live happily and peacefully and FDS is getting me the tools to life the life I want on my own terms.",94930,FDS and the Housewife series,0,,,

We do have common friends and those are good people so I felt comfortable with this arrangement. He presented some high value behaviour in the beginning so I thought he might be a HVM.

**WRONG**

Utter manchild. Bragging about how he barely learned how to cook, explaining that the only thing he splurges money on is jeans because his ones always rub between the legs as he is fat, constantly cutting me off, talking over me and even told me to *shut up for 2 minutes* so he could tell a stupid, boring ass story that he knew did not interest me (about footbal).

This is not to mention gaslighting. I mentioned that I don’t want to move in with a partner until we are married and he went off a tangent... he was chastising me, almost belitling me and my choices. All from a place of moral superiority when this guy can’t even speak our native language properly. 

I am glad that I never got to meet him irl in this context but he pissed me off so much. Like sir, you are 30, socially retarded, not very educated, almost-bragging about being overweight, void of charisma and you are trying to teach **me** about life.

A partner should do housework because he is independently motivated to perform this *basic life skill*, and should not expect praise for doing so. Saying that he ""helps"" implies that he is aiding you with something that you inherently own. 

Ownership and accountability for tedious, everyday tasks is a burden that society tends to place on women. It's the reason that a promotion to management general comes with a pay raise; managers aren't compensated for the effort that they put in (at times they put in less than their employees), but for the accountability that they have in ensuring that things are done. If an employee is out sick or resign, managers generally make sure the work gets done and own the potential failure of the effort. You aren't his manager, and you aren't inherently accountable for the task. Ever notice the difference between ""traditional"" women's tasks versus men's? ""Make sure that dinner is available every day for the rest of your life"" versus ""fix things when they break."" One is a daily burden with no reward and only potential failure if the task isn't performed, and one is an off nominal event in which repair is gratified. Don't fall for it. 

Red flags:
- Doesn't keep his own place up.
- Will clean up his own mess, but not others'. 
- Attempts to scorekeep in order to achieve ""fairness"" rather than getting the job done because it needs to be done and he is, presumably, a competent adult.
- Only contributes to everyday tasks during 'convenient' times.
- Family history of traditional gender roles.
- Expects more praise for contributing to ""your"" job.

It took me a long time to learn that doing more than 50% at times is not necessarily enough, and that regression is possible even with males with high value traits. So make sure that you have your self a grown ass adult, even if your FDS is now your FMS.",94909,HVMs Don't Help With Housework,0,,,

For the longest time I thought something was wrong with me and the way I perceive attractiveness.

I have to find a man physically attractive at *face value* before I can find myself even slightly interested in dating him. Meaning, if a guy had HVM behaviors and checked the right boxes, but he was just okay-looking and I didn’t feel the urge to kiss him or his touch had no effect on me, I could not continue to date him (let alone have sex with him). there were a few times I had spent wayyy too long leading a guy on trying to convince myself to be more attracted to him because I “should” be. Never again!

I’ve been called shallow &amp; picky just because I refused dates with men I didn’t find attractive (mostly men but some women too). I thought something was wrong with me because others could date someone they didn’t find attractive but could make it work. I don’t have specific preferences for hair &amp; skin color, height, body type, but I know immediately if I find a specific man attractive or not. I’ve been bullied for “shooting out of my league” cause I’m hairier than most women (middle eastern mix, I don’t shave my arms &amp; refuse to) but other than that I’m told how pretty/gorgeous I am quite often so that might be projection. 

There were actually so many times when my girl friends would complain about how awful the sex was with a new guy, and I always asked them right away, do even find them attractive? 

So. Many. Reluctant. No’s. 

But the men? It was always a win-win scenario. “She wasn’t cute but pussy is pussy”. 

So I’m curious, FDS. Are you like me where it’s a yes or no at face value, or are you able to develop attraction for someone who was just “attractive enough” because they had other boxes checked? (I think this happened ONCE where I clicked with a not-so-attractive man, but it was totally random at a party and he eventually mentioned having a GF. Never happened when going on a date intentionally).",97667,Men rate women’s physical attractiveness on a 1-10 scale. Women rate using 0s and 1s (f*ck yes or f*ck no). Thoughts?,0,,,

However, recently I have been talking more with a friend who is also in FDS, and with her encouragement I embraced the remaining few elements. Specifically 1. “who pays for dates”, 2. “don’t do low quality dates” (previously I thought coffee etc was okay), and 3. “don’t focus on one guy at a time in early stages” aspects. 

I do think this helped with vetting, especially with my ability to more objectively evaluate who is putting in effort and who is not. 

By having multiple people I’m talking to at a time, I could clearly distinguish between one guy who was all “I’d be down to hang out” “let me know what you want to do” and another guy “do you enjoy Italian restaurants?” “I’d love to take you out to dinner” “I’ve made us a reservation at x time”. The difference in effort was night and day, and if I were only talking to the first guy, it wouldn’t have been as blindingly obvious to me that he’s not worth it.

When I went on dates with a guy who offered to pay, he was also better in other ways like holding doors, taking initiative to make dates special by suggesting things I would enjoy based on what he knows about me, showing genuine interest in my life, and not even asking to “come over” within the first few dates. I’m not sure if all of those good things were a random coincidence, but I am now on the page that him paying for the date and suggesting better date venues are clear signs of interest and possibly an indicator of wanting a LTR commitment.

I know this post is only reiterating some of our well known principles, so this is not groundbreaking for many of you. I’m aiming this post at others who maybe felt like I did— I earn enough money to split the bill and I am staunchly a feminist, so I felt resistant to this at first. I thought it was too hard to split my attention between multiple guys, but it wasn’t as bad when I took things slowly and just blocked the ones who weren’t putting in enough effort. It was definitely beneficial to follow these guidelines!! I hope if there are others on the sub in similar positions that y’all might reconsider like I did. It really helped!",97635,Halfway doing FDS [is not as effective],0,,,

So you've been seeing this man (or woman, but let's be honest, it mostly applies to men) for a while, you like him and he has proved commitment to you. He seems like a HVM and all is going well. Until sex.

It sucks. You lay there in the wet spot, orgasmless. He's cuddling you, oblivious to the fact that you didn't enjoy it, at all.

In my last relationship, I just found him excuses. He's just inexperienced, he was nervous or worse: maybe it was me. My pickme friends pushed me to stay: give him a chance to improve. It'll get better. But it won't. He'll just get lazier.

We should not have to teach a man and build him up in any areas of life, and that include sexually.

On top of that... I don't have a large group of girlfriends who know eachother or would even get along... so the idea of bridesmaids makes my anxiety rise. 

I watch these youtube videos of these BIG ASS weddings and a few years later... the couple is getting divorced.

It absolutely does cause mental illness, And no one is talking about it. There is a lot of science behind this. It’s well documented scientifically that hours of exposure to explicit material (not just porn any explicit material) is correlated with reduced gray matter in the prefrontal cortex.

As you see more and more men shooting schools, murdering their wife and kids, raping their sister in law, etc etc. the link is there, both with common sense and with documented science. Why isn’t anyone talking about it?

I tend to at least do my part and vote with my wallet. If I see a brand or a company over sexualizing women, and girls, I stop buying from them. I sure hope more women start doing the same. And spread the word to your pick me friends And family. Talk to them about this.

Since I read ""Becoming Supernatural"" from Dr. Joe Dispenza and ""The Law of Attraction"" from Esther and Jerry Hicks I became big on spirituality. Moreover, it became my shortcut to being able to throw away my whole pickmeisha persona.

There's more dimensions than the one we're seeing. Everything is vibrations and energy. Why do you think you can feel someone staring at you? Or why do you think that when you randomly think about a person from your past you bump into them the next day? If you feed thoughts enough energy they become matter.

So why do you keep manifesting aint shit men when you're continuously dreaming about meeting that one HVM? It's because you are sending it chaotic energy-- you feel incomplete without it, you ""want"" it which implies lack, and deep down there's a wounded inner child within you that doesn't believe she can actually do it.

**Just imagine the universe says ""yes"" to every thought you have:**

* ""I want a HVM"" =&gt; ""Yes, you want a HVM""
* ""I am going to meet a HVM"" =&gt; ""Yes, you are going to meet a HVM""

See the difference? You have to feel as though you already have these things. **The key to attracting a healthy relationship is already feeling loved.** And that's where it gets complicated, because women get conditioned to hate themselves and never feeling like they're enough. We as humans are stuck in a matrix that makes us believe getting a degree and a nice 9-to-5 job, getting married and popping out some kids is freedom. It makes us believe focusing on differences with other groups is uniting. It makes us think sponsored research &amp; traditional education provides wisdom. It makes us believe using other people for ego gratification is worthy of being called love.

**Women though, are stuck in an additional matrix within that matrix.** A meta matrix if you will. In this matrix, we believe we devaluate once we hit 30. We believe we're never going to be good enough. We believe remaining single for the rest for your life and not having any kids is sad. We believe having a man and babies is the be-all and end-all of life. We believe we're intellectual and emotional equals with men. We accept how we're being sexualized to the point where we can't see ourselves as whole anymore but just a mish mash of body parts. We believe you have to look a certain way, talk a certain way, adhere to men a certain way to be deserving of love. You, as an FDS'er are sitting here reading all this and thinking ""no, I don't believe that stuff"" but trust me, your subconscious still does.

So yeah, fuck that. How do you deprogram from something so deeply ingrained? Here's a few pointers:

1. **Making your brain your bitch**

This can be done through meditation. I know meditation seems stupid to a lot of y'all but there's enough research that proves the effectiveness of this practise. Meditating is like making your brain go to the gym. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, the go-to therapy for people with Borderline Personality Disorder consists mainly of meditation.

You can download an app to get familiar with meditation, like Headspace. Or you can look up guided meditations on Youtube. Or you can just use the timer on your phone and gaze at a candle for 10 minutes. The goal is to learn to detach from your thoughts, learning to look at them as if you were looking at cars in traffic.

Once you're nailing this, you can proceed to train yourself to feel feelings you want to feel. So you want to feel loved? You can just give that to yourself through meditation. Here's some meditations that really helped me doing this:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbEuVjYe9BI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbEuVjYe9BI)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeWYtyJbSMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeWYtyJbSMA) (starts at 9:15)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og5Gssmu1Ds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og5Gssmu1Ds) (this one is a little more advanced but jesus christ it changed my life so profoundly)

You'll start to vibrate at the frequency of this feeling and attract more and more of it.

Your brain doesn't like to meditate. Your neocortex is a control freak but since we want to unlearn, we need to be able to surrender. Keep that in mind.

**2. Working with your inner child**

When you come into this world not ruined yet by society, you're unapologetically yourself. The first things you learn about yourself in this world is what you can't be and what parts of yourself you have to change or mute or what's not good enough about you. This creates insecurities, and we naturally start building a protective layer around that insecurity. Say you were kind of slow as a kid, those kids often grow up as the smart ass who's writing lengthy think pieces on their social media. However, this creates cognitive dissonance. Your subconscious feels like a fraud, which creates more insecurity.

Dig deep: what were you being told as a kid?

Moreover, since you didn't come into this world with a manual attached to you, your parents inevitably made mistakes in your upbringing. And you as a child, naturally developed survival tactics to protect yourself from getting hurt or to still be able to get what you needed. Those survival tactics become blueprints and you keep repeating these blueprints in all your relationships. Were your parents very unpredictable? Then you probably grew up always anticipating for the worst reaction in others. Did your parents only show you love and affection when you accomplished certain things? Then you probably grew up to be an overachiever or people pleaser. And so on.

This inner child, or what we call our 'ego', is your subconscious. And your subconscious controls 97% of your reality. Your subconscious also doesn't forget: every memory you've ever had is neatly stored there, even when you've consciously forgotten about them.

The key is to reconnect to your inner child and listen to her. Become the parent she needs and nurture her everyday. What does she need?

This hypnosis is great for reconnecting with your inner child:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6tP8Efiwos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6tP8Efiwos)

And The Holistic Psychologist has some great material on doing ego work:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSz-BKKTbBE&amp;t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSz-BKKTbBE&amp;t=2s)

I named my Ego/Inner Child, which made it easier for me to recognize when she enters the stage. I always listen to what she has to say, but I don't let her undermine my daily reality anymore.

I recommend looking into Bowlby's attachment theory and taking the childhood emotional neglect test:

**3. Be mindful about the shit you have to unlearn**

Write down a list of all the things you need to unlearn and turn them into mantras you repeat to yourself every single day or everytime you catch yourself having a meta matrix thought. Examples:

* I need a man to feel complete =&gt; I am enough. Loving myself is enough.
* I need to prove my value to men =&gt; I am enough. I am the prize, men need to prove their value to ME.
* Being single is lonely/sad =&gt; I am surrounded by love
* I am too fat/my skin is too dark/my hair is too short/my nose is too big/whatever =&gt; I am the embodiment of feminine energy which means I am a QUEEN
* I'm too emotional =&gt; My sensitivity is a beautiful thing
* Aging is bad =&gt; Everyday I'm wiser than the day before therefore everyday I become more beautiful

**4. Practising gratitude**

Gratitude attracts abundance. There's so much science backing this up. Every morning and every night before I go to bed I think of 3 things I'm particularly grateful for. This community is often one of them.

**5. Finding your purpose**

We attract more abundance and positive thoughts once we're in alignment with ourselves. And to be in alignment, is when you are fulfilling your purpose.

Every failure, every bad experience holds a blessing of some kind. It's yours to find them. When you look at all the things that have happened to you in your life, what lesson did you have to learn? Why did you come into this world with this particular body, with these particular talents? Why did you chose  your family, what did they teach you about life or yourself? When you put all the pieces of the puzzle together, you'll discover your purpose.

**6. Practising self care**

Self care is more than having a great skincare routine or taking long baths. Self care is setting firm boundaries, investing in yourself, checking in with yourself EVERY day, exercising, eating well, doing things you love.

Self care is also making sure your chakras are aligned. I know I know, chakras are a bit woo-woo to some. But they actually make a whole lotta sense and even here science is starting to catch up. You can take several tests online to find out which ones of your chakras are blocked and what you can do about it. It gives you info about what fruits and vegetables to eat, what activities to do, what yoga poses to try, what conversations you have to have with yourself. Sometimes healing is just as simple as getting outside and feel the grass on your bare feet.

**7. Let go of attachments**

Be honest: there's some toxic people in your life and you're not ready to admit to yourself they're toxic yet. Drop the pickmeishas in your life, drop all the naysayers, drop all the people who make you feel crazy. You don't need them: meglio soli che malaccompignati. It's better to be alone than to have bad company.

I wouldn't go as far as saying you become the average of the people you surround yourself with but you're certainly heavily being influenced whether you want it or not.

Start reaching out to people who reflect your values and who make you feel good about yourself.

Secondly, let go of things you identify with. When you attach yourself to a certain identity it becomes hard to change for the better and really become resilient. Ofcourse you should have a set of values, and you can be proud of those values, but you have to realize that you don't have to be a certain way, look a certain way, or achieve certain things to be deserving of love.

**8. Be very careful about who you exchange energy with**

Feminine energy is goddess energy. It births new lives and heals wounded souls. Men are visual creatures and you best believe they can see or sense your energy. And if you're an empath, they will gladly latch onto you to feed off of it.

Ever noticed how, as soon as you are dating a guy and sleeping with him, you're more exhausted? You're questioning yourself more? You're less focused? And at the same time this guy seems to do better in life than ever before? Yeah, that.

Every interaction with another human being is an energy exchange, so try to spot the low vibrational ones. Don't spend too much time on social media as it is full of low vibrational energy (even most body positive influencers ultimately want validation in some way). Sex is a super intense exchange of energy so be really, really mindful about who you share your body and your time with.

**9. Live life to the fullest and become the architect of your own life**

Try to look at life as a big catalogue of opportunities you get to pick from. Because it is. You can quit your job and move to Vietnam if you want that. You can skydive, you can hop in your car and drive to the closest beach. Nobody can stop you (as long as what you want to do is legal). Are you living life to the fullest?

Think about the sheer odds, work, particles, energy, destiny it took you to be here. Your body is made of remnants of stars and massive explosions in the galaxies. These are facts.⁠ Everything we are and everything in the universe originates from stardust, and it continually floats through us even today. It directly connects us to the universe, rebuilding our bodies over and over again during our lifetimes.⁠⁠You traveled billions of years, through time and space, molten rocks and stars exploding. You traveled from unknown lands, where time doesn’t exist… To be HERE. Make it worthwhile. Fuck anything else. Get out of the house.

**10. Avoid social &amp; traditional media as much as you can**

Traditional media is full of subliminals that enforce the role stereotypes for women. As is social media. Even when it's not super obvious to the naked eye, there's a clear agenda being pushed. Detach from these toxic messages as much as you can and set yourself free.

We need to feel accomplished and financially secure. We need close personal relationships as all humans do. We need novel and luxurious sensory experiences outside of sex. 

Often times humans seek a partner to fulfill the later two. The problem with that is, when the partner slacks, we feel a deep hole form. Que the pick me behaviors and attempts to extract blood from a rock.

We talk a lot about having a rich personal life outside of our romantic relationships in order to be whole. This is true in a deeper sense than having friends you get lunch with once a week and text with a lot. I know this isn’t news to most of us but this is what it means to me.

Let’s share how we get our vitamins!

Professional vitamins: no matter what profession you’re in or what you aspire to, learn constantly. I’m a freelance writer. There are infinite levels to what I can make money doing in this field. Though I’m making a comfortable income I spend 15 hours a week learning the next steps in my field. I seek out new opportunities constantly.

I also make a game of saving money. I swear, looking at the number in my savings account swells me with pride and independence. I live below my means and look at dropping 1k in my savings every month like a field goal. 

Personal vitamins: These were hard for me to get on track. I will admit that I took self care to an unhealthy place after an abusive relationship. Taking time to myself became isolating. I found myself craving the benefits of relationships i didn’t have. 

That meant going out and interacting with friends and strangers. Saying yes to invites and forming new relationships with women I met. Going out for no reason alone and enjoying myself. 

Spending time letting the women close to me know what exactly it is that I love about them as a person and getting that in return. 

Sensory vitamins: along with my extreme saving and frugality, I do not skimp on necessary luxury for my sanctuary and body. I set aside a certain amount every month for nesting and personal care. 

I enjoy the benefits of my Botox, serums, nails, gym membership, exotic tea and healthy nutrition.

The comfort of my home is paramount. My queen dog deserves the best. She gets a new toy every month and has the best orthopedic dog bed. She eats steak when I eat steak. I feel joy every time I sink into the fur blankets on my yellow velvet couch. I drink great wine and tend to my house plants. These things bring me joy.

So queens, how do you get your vitamins?",97568,"The vitamins. Professional, personal &amp; sensory. When they are fulfilled a partner is not necessary but an addition.",1,,,

Like I can’t live a day without seeing sexual innuendos on the internet like wtf. Even ads about jeans are sexualize geez.

Andddd sex is more risky for women than it is for men because men cannot get knock up. So why tf is that not discussed no hate to those who finds sex empowering you do you. I simply don’t want it and don’t even want to think about it. 

The even that started this rant is a good friend of mines keep asking me when I will have sex so I told her not anytime soon and she asked me why. And I said I don’t want to risk getting knocked up. The women in my fam fertile af condoms alone won’t cut it. And I don’t want to use BC it’s a personal choice so if a man wants to smash he will have to get a vasectomy. Then she ask me if I will shave my pussy. I said no and she said that she thinks I will shave since her other friend shaved after getting with a guy. I don’t even know anymore.

This behavior is discouraged, but to the extent is up to the moderator. Addicts have very poor self esteem and boundaries. Couple that with pre existing lvm behaviors and it's a situation that is very exploitive especially since the nature of support groups is to share trauma.

I recently decided to rewatch The Witcher series on Netflix and realised a few things. 

Firstly, Geralt really drinks that Respect Women juice. The way he acts towards women is on point and I love it. 

Also I celebrate how powerful the female mages are. In the end they're the ones who save everyone from Nilfgaards attack. That one dude in the end fits just perfectly into the cliché that men don't listen to women who know it better. I'm talking about that one guy who attacks the main protagonist head on while Yennefer tells him to slow down, he then doesn't listen and gets knocked out because of his stupidity. 

But the thing that caught my attention the most was the character of Queen [Calanthe](http://imgur.com/gallery/TMmIUNd). For those of you who don't know the series, she's nicknamed The Lioness of Cintra and that name suits her just perfectly. She's fierce, strong and relentless. She doesn't care about what men have to say and takes part in the battles her people fight. During the betrothal of her only daughter, she arrives in full body armour with the blood of her enemies splattered across her face. Later at that event she competes in the fight that evolves. Her responses are witty and direct. While others try to tame her, she doesn't listen to them. Her quotes gave me life and her entire character is magnificent. 

Then there's her relationship with Eist Tuirsearch, who was in love with her for quite a while and proposed to her three times, pursuing her until she accepted at the betrothal of her daughter so her daughters soon to be husband who she didn't like wouldn't be king just yet. But Eist had such a great deal of respect for Calanthe, that he handed all of his kingly power onto her, so she was still basically the only regent of her country. 


It's sad how they ended up because of the war that took place, but her character really gave me life. 

Also when reading any comments on her, it's always the LVM who reply with nasty comments saying her character is ridiculous because apparently they believe she can barely hold a sword. I mean, excuse you, take that audacity off of your eyes and look again how she cuts through the men who try to stop her. That would be you, dear sir, if you were to meet this woman in real life. 

Bless her, she's my role model now.",98297,Queen Calanthe from the Netflix Witcher series appreciation post,0,,,

So I'm on my way to become a software developer. This job will hopefully allow me to live like a digital nomad for some time and work while travelling to my dream destinations, e.g. Bali.

I am all about pampering my body, mind and soul: by exercise (resistance training and yoga), meditation, indulgent self-care, and delicious plant-based diet specifically designed to target my autoimmune disease.

The picture in the middle is one of my biggest dreams: buying an apartment and arranging it exactly according to my tastes. This will be a katharsis after living with my recent ex, who was messy, couldn't care less about home decor and cleanliness, actually hated when I tried to tidy/decorate our house, slept on a mattress in an empty room with things scattered all around, because it didn't occur to him to put them in drawers/cabinets etc.

I am also going to focus on creating more relationships with women in my life and cherishing them. I am excited to attend women circles that are organised e.g. by some yoga schools in my city. 

And last, but not least, I will spoil my beloved cat and also foster homeless cats while they're waiting to be adopted.",98272,"I love the life goals collages you're posting, so I had to create my own and share it with you!",0,,,

I always wanted to wait until marriage to have sex, but my senior year in college, due to eating disorder ( i was a dancer, dealt with a lot of body shaming) and not being surrounded with the best people... i decided to sleep with a guy from the basketball team. it was horrible. he literally just used me as a masturbation tool and there was blood all over my bed since he literally jackhammered me... My roommate who slept around quite a bit... told me you just need to sleep around more. so i slept around 2 more times and they both sucked. ended up with an STD (chylmadia and it went away) that i couldn't figure out what was fun about this?! my roommate would tell me it's the only way to make a guy stay...

&amp;#x200B;

I am an engineer at a tech company. I make 130k, got awarded 80k in stock and even bought a condo. But I am ""religious.""  after all of these incidents i decided to really pray to God for healing ( i was raised Catholic). I live in the PNW and believing in a religion... going to church.. good luck finding a guy who likes that! so when i was dating here, i learned how to get really good at oral so a guy would accept me for who i am. i didn't even want sex because of my past experiences, so i literally would please the guy i was with in hopes he would stay ( i was dating LVM).

&amp;#x200B;

my last relationship was with a 35M, and after explaining what i've been through, he really wanted to have sex with me. so i gave him oral and he LOVED it said it was the best he had... we tried regular sex but again i hate it... he could never please me so i had to buy a toy. He also wanted me to come to his place all the time to sleepover, didn't want to come to my place because i have no AC and a cat. We weren't compatible. He didn't like my religion (he is agnostic) and would always put me down for believing in God. We also didn't agree with politics and he wanted me to sleepover once a week and have sex when... deep down... i didn't want to have sex. We were only dating for 2 months and here i was having ""duty"" sex already. To be honest, i really want to wait for marriage. I am tired of feeling like i HAVE to have sex! My ex used to compare me to his exes saying how excited they were to have sex, how you HAVE to sleepover if you were in a relationship, how they used to send sexy photos ( i told him i used to do this during my eating disorder went to therapy to heal and yet he still wanted me to send him photos).  He also used to watch porn but stopped when we started dating because i asked him too. He used to say "" i jack off thinking about you"" and to text him dirty things.. I just felt this relationship is too sexual for 2 months! He only wants me for sex and anytime i bought this up he would tell me its untrue and how he does like me for me. He's helped me install TV/shelves in my new condo, we go hiking, he pays for my dates, texts/calls me etc.. and i feel like i should want to have sex... maybe he is right i just need to do it for me look at all the things he does...

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; i really HATE feeling like this. Logically i know its bad, and I am working with a therapist on this. but do you  ladies have any advice on how to overcome this feeling? is it bad if i want to save sex for marriage? I've always wanted to do that from day one but sadly i made some bad choices along the way.",98217,How can I stop feeling like men are entitled to me/my body?,0,,,

I went on dozens of dates over a period of 5 years. Ended up in a 2 year relationship with an LVM who later told me he ""was never attracted to me and that's why we didn't work"". Nevermind I asked him more than once if he wasn't into me to let me go and he would reassure me that OF COURSE HE IS HE LOVES ME. Anyway, after I broke up with him it didn't take long for me to be doing the dating thing again. But it also didn't take long to remember how awful it was and after being disappointed and ghosted and all the other stuff, I kinda stepped back. Then Covid happened and I welcomed the forced break.

I don't know if it's the dopamine rushes I'm not getting anymore (and was probably addicted to) or if all of my negative experiences have finally gotten through to me that finding my person isn't what's going to bring me internal happiness. And the longer I go without it, the less I want it. I'd rather snuggle my kitties, keep relearning piano, watch all my shows and smoke a fat bowl before cuddling into my pillows at night. I don't have to worry about what someone else think of my life. It's my life and I created it to be the one I wanted. Without dating, maybe my life is a little boring but it's so peaceful!

Philip Shaver and Cindy Hazen later discovered that children went on to replicate these attachment styles and patterns later in their romantic relationships. Several attachment styles have been identified, but they mainly fall under three distinct categories.

**Secure**

**Secure people feel very comfortable with love and intimacy.** They are very warm and loving, and tend to have high levels of self-esteem. They believe in the strength of their connections, so they tend to have strong, stable and long-lasting relationships. People with a secure attachment style are able to leave unsatisfying relationships, because they know that a better relationship awaits them. Amir Levine estimates that around 50% of the population have a secure attachment style.

**Anxious**

**Like secure people, anxious people tend to be very warm and loving.** However, their desire for intimacy leaves them heavily preoccupied with the relationship, and they constantly wonder whether their partner is capable of loving them back. Because they fear abandonment, anxiously attached people will often resort to **protest behaviours** to get their needs met. These protest behaviours can include threatening to end the relationship, sulking, and getting extremely upset when they feel their affections are not being returned. **Anxiously attached people also tend to get attached very quickly, and will sacrifice a lot to make the relationship work.** Levine estimates that around 25% of people are anxiously attached. **I am also going to hazard a guess here and say that the vast majority of Pickmes/former Pickmes have an anxious attachment style, or behave in a way that have the characteristics of an anxious attachment.** 

**Avoidant**

**The avoidant person, like the name suggests, tends to avoid intimacy.** They equate closeness and intimacy with a loss of independence, hence why they seek to maintain distance from their romantic partner. **Avoidant people often come on strong in the beginning of a relationship, but suddenly pull back when things start getting closer and more intimate.** Levine estimates that around 25% of the population are avoidant.

**How attachment styles can affect relationships**

Now that we have covered the basics, we can move on to how attachment styles can affect a relationship. Generally speaking, the most satisfying relationships tend to be between two people who are secure. This is not to say that people who are secure never have issues, but their temperament and their high levels of self-worth makes it easier for them to nurture healthy relationships and swiftly cut off unhealthy relationships. 

A **secure/anxious** relationship can also work well, because someone who is secure is not afraid of showing intimacy which is what the anxious person craves. It is not uncommon for an anxious person to adopt a more secure attachment style and approach when they are in a relationship with someone who is secure.

**Relationships tend to run into trouble if one of the partners is avoidant.** Since avoidants rarely date each other (in this instance, likeness repels), they often end up with people who are secure or anxious. A secure person will quickly tire of an avoidant's avoidance and will end the relationship fairly quickly. Someone who is anxious, however, will get drawn into the **anxious-avoidant cycle**, because such a relationship activates their attachment system in a very negative way. Psychologists call this the **Anxious-Avoidant trap,** because whilst this relationship is clearly toxic it is very difficult for the anxious person to extract themselves from it. 

**The Anxious-Avoidant trap works so well, because it exacerbates the insecurities of each partner.** Anxious people cope with relationship issues by trying to get closer to their partner and increase intimacy. Since intimacy is an avoidant's worst nightmare, they will respond by pulling away from their partner. Rinse and repeat this pattern enough times, and voila! You have yourself a toxic relationship.

**Attachment styles and you** 

Now that's been covered, you may be wondering what this has to do with you. The short answer is: **everything.** Knowing your attachment style and being able to work out what someone else's attachment style is will save you from a world of pain. 

If you are trying to date and you have an anxious attachment style (there are tests you can do online to determine whether you are likely to have one), know that you are, unfortunately, swimming among sharks. **Avoidants tend to make up more of the dating pool**, because they are more likely to end their relationships for the reasons discussed above. **If you have a secure attachment style, whist you are unlikely to get caught up in the Anxious-Avoidant trap, it is not uncommon for a securely attached person to become anxious when they are in a relationship with an avoidant.** 

That does not mean that secure men are not out there, but you have a much higher chance of running into an avoidant. **Hookup culture and the proliferation of OLD also feeds avoidant behaviour, because men know they no longer have to get intimate/show they really care about a woman before they get what they want from her.** Whilst you should not spend ages ruminating over a man's attachment style, if he is exhibiting any of the following behaviours or smoking guns, it is likely he is an avoidant.

* Sends mixed messages
* Has had a string of short-term relationships
* Is reluctant to make it official
* Does not respond to your feelings, and tries to address them from a point of logic as opposed to understanding
* Demonstrates any sign of having commitment issues

**How to find a securely attached man**

You find a securely attached man by not wasting your time with men who cannot give you the amount of intimacy you need. **You have to know what your needs are**, inside and out, so you are able to recognise when your needs are not being met. Funnily enough, in Amir Levine's book, 'Attached', **he basically reiterates FDS advice when explaining how to find someone with a secure attachment style**.

* Date multiple men at the same time. This allows you to maintain some level of emotional distance, whilst making comparisons. It's a lot easier to see whether someone is acting avoidant if you're dating multiple people as it gives you perspective
* Adopt an abundance mentality. Whilst we know that HVM are in short supply, the truth is that there are many HVM still around. There are far too many men out there to get stuck on that one LVM
* Work on your self-esteem. If a man turns out to be LV, understand that it had nothing to do with you
* Cut men off at the first red flag

Whilst you may not have been able to determine which attachment style you now have, it is possible to improve your dating prospects. By being aware of attachment theory, you can quickly determine whether or not a prospective partner is able to meet your intimacy needs, and be on your way to find a loving, secure relationship.",98199,A post about attachment theory and why it's important for you to be aware of it,0,,,

I’m posting this to show you guys thaf sometimes the “nice” approach is really just a ploy to get into your pants. Like 2 months ago, I met this guy breifly at an associate’s gathering, gave him my number and ge would incessantly message me. I just felt the vibe was “off”. I made it clear to him that I simply wasn’t interested in him anymore (I messaged him through text). He never replied back so I assumed he understood my decision. This morning he messaged me after not speaking for over a month and the link was our interaction. 

I found it apalling when he wrote, “Tried to be nice and polite with you but you turned me down. Decided to go blunt”. In other words. His niceness was a tactic to get into my pants. Morever, he assumed I was a woman who didnt respond to “niceness” when I was simply JUST NOT THAT INTO HIM. By being “blunt”, I felt like a cheap whore the way he was talking to me and decided to block his number.

Instances like these make me very afraid of the current dating pool. Niceness is now a tactic, a ploy to get between my legs. Ladies, continue to be very vigilant... really scope these men out. And always, ALWAYS trust that gut feeling. Initially, he never did anything “wrong” to me but  I just felt weird whenever communicating with him and that’s ALL the reason you need to not mess with anyone. Only be “nice” to yourself and wait patiently for what you TRULY desire and deserve!!!!!",100984,Mr. Nice Guy,0,,,

I haven't watched After (nor will I), but other YA literature comes to my mind, specially 50 Shades of Gray. But even Twilight. And for sure much more that I'm not remembered the names now.

These books and films are written by women who seem to have this fantasy of a woman healing a bad boy. As if their ego would feel better by knowing that they healed a broken man and turned him into a good man. It's as if these men change to better people because they fell in love for this woman and they stood by them in the end. 

We all know that in real life a woman's love doesn't heal broken men, and much less abusive men. Actually a woman's love many times enables these men's brokeness and puts these women at risk. 

I'm not saying that fiction has to be like reality and I also understand that toxic relationships make up for good on screen entertainment sometimes, but I just found this theme in most YA/NA literature, fan fiction and even in entertainment in general was all too common, and most of the times written by women themselves and idolized and fantasized by women, many of them young women who don't know better.

**Must-Haves:**
- Must accept me the way I am and not want to change my core personality. I’m introverted and somewhat quiet and I need a lot of space sometimes and he should embrace that. 

- Must be kind and gentle to people, children, and animals. This includes people he doesn’t know or like. 

- Must be able to apply critical thinking and not do things just because it’s expected or normalized. Must have own opinions and be able to intelligently question things for himself. 

- Must be involved in a career trajectory that he enjoys while allowing him to support himself and save money.

- Must care about his physical/mental health and be engaged in healthy habits and routines. He should exercise and eat well (within reason) and also talk to friends/family regularly.

- Must be able to engage in physical and emotional intimacy in an honest way, and be present in the moment with me. Will offer support when I’m struggling, but also hold me accountable.

- He has to make me laugh, and he has to laugh at me. 

***

**Non-Negotiables**
- Being a complete nihilist; not believing in anything or trusting anyone. Only interested in personal gain with no thought given to consequences.

- Non-consensual sexual aggression of any kind. Using my body as an object, or as a means to an end.

- Being overly careful (cheap) with money. Keeping a tally to be used as leverage later on. Treating everything as a transaction. 

- Extreme insecurity, lack of identity, copying what other people think/do because they are too afraid to be their own person. Follows whatever their friends or family do without question.

- Being loud; talking over or interrupting constantly. Inability to remember important details, events, dates, etc 

- Thinking their job/career trajectory is the only one that truly matters.",100975,My Standards: A list of “Must-Haves” and “Non-Negotiables”.,0,,,

Am I a bad person?

Everyone has seen this post before. 25F and 35M. We dated for 2 months and I broke things up because of incompatibility. Tonight he called asking if we could get back together. I explained to me some things we need to work on including sex. 

We used to have sex in the beginning. I couldn’t keep up with it and later on it wasn’t fu  anymore. I’ve struggled A LOT with sex and have never enjoyed it. I told him I needed a back/space with the sex because I thought we were moving too fast. 2 weeks of this and he started saying we were in a dead bedroom and we Needed sex... later we broke up and I went to therapy 

In therapy we discussed some parts of my past. I was sexual abused my senior year in college. The next year I would enter a BDSM relationship and be sexually abused there. I also would send nudes out to this guy and subject myself to humiliating videos. This whole stems from being apart of my college’s dance team were I was told I was fat and the president of the university doesn’t want to see my fat juggling at the football games...


I never fully recovered from this and when we would have sex he would rush me to orgasm and get mad when I couldn’t. Also the frequency of sex was too much for me. While in therapy I realized this trauma I NEED to heal from in order to have a healthy sex life. I told him I want to abstain from sex until I heal. And I don’t have a time line.

Well he calls me selfish and asks me about his sexual needs. He also says bleeding is common in sex so I shouldn’t think my past was abusive. I start to get really annoyed like WTF why can’t you accept right I’m saying 

So he asks me those times I was into it was it a show. I explained that I have these negative thoughts and I’ve always pushed them away and had sex anyway hoping it would be fine but always they would come back (never had a relationship longer then 3 months) and it’s made sex not fun that’s why I couldn’t orgasm at times

There is literally a disease called breast implant sickness that no one talks about. These women have such harsh and random symptoms that it becomes difficult to figure out what is wrong. Brazilian butt lifts have a 1 in 3000 mortality rate. All this to look good for rappers and internet scammers.

Also can women stop lieing about “getting surgery for yourself”. I need women to be honest and say that they are getting the surgery for male attention. I also don’t judge their choices. We raise our daughters to see beauty as their greatest source of power. So, we end up putting them on a hamster wheel to acquire and maintain male attention. I know that beauty is helpful and that society treats beautiful people better. However, beauty I’d like a car: it is not a very good investment.

I advertised myself as an alcoholic, no car, and a diva retail clerk. The only details and interest in have was ""just ask, I'm an open book"" lol. My pic was a google stock photo of a passed out, drunk woman. 

I probably got a 100 messages last night. 90% had their stated intent as wanting s relationship. My standard answer to those guys was ""sorry I'm interested in casual not a relationship sorry"". 

Their responses universally were as follows:

""I thought I ChANGED iT, its been awhile since I've been on here"". 

""I'll take anything I can get"". 

""Neither am i"". 

""I'm up for anything"".

""Well, a relationship is just a nice bonus."". 

I firmly believe in dating with an intention. But scrote will decieve you about their intentions. So if they respond to an awful low value fakr profile you set up, you KNOW that that they are low value so.if and when they pop up in your real profile.....theyve already weeded themselves out because you cross checked them with your fake profile. 

Frankly, im disgusted with the what I saw last night. That's saying a lot too.  Male depravity has no limits, especially on OLD. So protect yourself and your interests by having a fake profile. It really works.",100849,"Ladies, if you use OLD please have a second, fake profile in addition to your real one.",0,,,

I know how ridiculously unlikely that sounds, but it's true.

I have a foolproof strategy that I applied for years to great success. The one time I varied from that strategy I had an absolutely horrible first date.

My strategy was very simple and born out of experience. 


Step one: Meet men in real life. 

I prefer this because I get to see the man with my own eyes. What he looks, like how he dresses, and how he carries himself. I can assess his grooming and to a degree level of income. I get to decide immediately if I'm physically attracted to him or not before even engaging. This saves me a lot of time! There is no consideration of even going further if I'm not attracted to him.


Step two: The Approach.

This step weeds out most men since most of them are too weak to approach. Saves you lots of time! If he does approach, you can assess how he does it. Is his approach smooth or bumpy and awkward? Is he natural and confident? Is he using pickup lines or making sexual innuendo? This also tells you whether he's interested in you or not, at least sexually. This is important to know what the outset. I don't want to wonder if a guy's actually attracted to me which is why I want to see *him* approach me. (It's probably also why I have a crazy level of confidence in my attractiveness where men are concerned.)


Step three: Converse. 

This way I can see if he can carry a normal conversation. The key word here is *normal*. I am absolutely assessing for normalcy. I want to see how he speaks, his level of education, his level of sophistication, how he treats me and others around us. Do we laugh together? Do we have things in common? Does the conversation flow? Do I like his smile? And very importantly, do I get a good vibe overall from him? It's very easy to weed out the low brows and porn addicts that make inappropriate sexual comments in this stage. If a man says something inappropriate to me I just stare them down for a little longer than is comfortable and then I'll turn and walk away. If you just simply aren't feeling it, tell him it was nice meeting him and excuse yourself to the restroom and don't come back. The most important part of this step is that you should talk to this person for at least one full hour, as long as he's meeting your requirements. I have yet to meet a guy who wasn't normal who could keep up a conversation for one to two hours.


Step four: The date proposal.

Wait and see if he asks you out (on a real date of course). I would talk, laugh, smile and wait. If he doesn't ask you out he's either not interested or he's just too weak. Either way, bullet dodged.


Now for the story of the one time I did not talk to the man for an hour before agreeing to a date.

He invited me out for a slice of pizza, which I would never agree to now. He spent our entire meal getting up and running over to other people that he knew to chat with them instead of focusing on me and our date. Turned out he was also highly racist, sexist and classist, and openly so! It left me stunned at his audacity. After we finished eating he tried to get *me* to pay for my $4.99 slice of pizza with side salad! I flat out refused. I was going to be damned if I paid after spending an hour listening to his disgusting thoughts. The only time in my life I've ever done that, but I had gotten all dressed up and come out to meet him (ridiculous) only for him to show me one of the ugliest personalities I have ever witnessed. 

The coup de gras that really rounded out this magical evening was when he suggested continuing the date by getting a drink. When I told him I absolutely could not, he lunged at me with his fist up like he was going to hit me. Then when I didn't flinch and just stared him down, he pulled out the crocodile tears and started whining about ""poor me"". CRAZY... At that point I gave him an affronted glare, turned, and walked away. Of course I ran like hell back to my car as soon as he was out of sight. I didn't want to display any weakness to that crazy man. 

I never varied from my method again.",100379,How I never had a bad first date! (Except one),0,,,

In the past I haven´t had a lot of success. I went on dates with men from Tinder I found physically attractive but they all turned out to be low value in some way or the other. The most common were men who “just broke up” and were looking for ego validation through sex. So at some point I decided the quality is so low that I have no more time to waste. Months have past and I decided to give it another shoot since I don´t really see a lot of attractive men in real life either and on Tinder there is at least more to choose from. 

So I got on the app again but this time with a different approach. I paid for Tinder gold since I am not interested in wading through thousands of LVM through swiping and wasting my time again. With Tinder Gold you can see who gave you a like and decide if you want to make a match or not. 

Before I tell what happened shortly about me. I am a 33 year old woman, I look younger which sometimes shocked scrotes in the past when I “ revealed” my age. But on Tinder this doesn´t matter because I have my age in my profile, so men can see immediately that I am an adult woman over 30. I am conventionally attractive but not a supermodel or anything. 

So I got on Tinder Gold and in the first 24 hours the Likes and Superlikes came popping in like there is no tomorrow. I got 2000 likes in only one day from an age range of men between 25 and 38. Some of them not my type but there have also been some literal male models among them, doctors, engineers whatever. 

I am not telling you this to brag how great I am. I am telling you this because yesterday I realized crystal clear, even though I never believed it, that the wall women over 30 are supposed to hit is not real. It is just a lie to scare women. There are plenty, and I mean plenty, of options for you as a woman ALWAYS, no matter what age. 

Scortes might say but they just want sex – well yeah, but when I was 20 there have also been thousends of men who just wanted sex. That is not a question of age but just a question of being a woman. The good men are hard to find, with 20 or 40, it’s the same. 

So never ever be afraid of aging, the bullshit they tell you online is not real.",100361,My experience as a 33 old woman on Tinder - The wall is a lie,0,,,

I mean, if the woman is a “HVW” in a LVM’s eyes, can he suddenly change.

I’ve been on the terrible spectrum of this situation. I was talking to an LVM who I met via OLD when we were 18. He showed some very HVM for the first few weeks until after how second date when he was not “ready for a relationship”. I was being a “pick me” girl tragically and still talking to him and hoping for the fact he would suddenly want to “see me again”. He was my first kiss, and till this day I’ve never been in a relationship or had sex, so it made it easier for me to fall into the traps). It ended for good when we randomly saw each other for the last time, where he ghosted me after messaging me that he wanted to “see me again” and the next day he found my best friend on tinder and super liked her. 

After 5 months of NC and trying to “level up” he got into a relationship...whatever ok....(his friend made this “grand announcement” on his popular Facebook meme page) but he literally became the most “perfect HVM” for this other woman. And people in their circles praise him for it. It’s stuff that not many guys...at least guys my age...would ever do for their woman. He just drastically changed, because I’m pretty sure he’s had relationships in the past and he had never even been this HVM even in those (he’s also a serial deleter and told me that girls usually cheat on him including his last relationship before he started meeting me for the first time).

I don’t want to put a downer on myself...but this woman is literally an upgrade from me too. So the question is, if you are a HVW, can you turn a LVM into a HVM? Is it still a red flag if he was a LVM in the past but chose to become a HVM for you?",100289,Can a woman change a LVM into a HVM?,0,,,

Thank you for all the posts you make, the laughs I get from them have given me life the past four months since I stumbled onto this subreddit. 


My first post on Reddit was on another subreddit last October this is a shortened version:

I didn’t know my husband had a porn addiction and I discovered it three weeks ago. I looked at his google photo archive and found photos photos of a coworker he had taken on the sly and had screenshotted from her Instagram and from snapchat conversations. He apparently had such low self esteem that a few compliments from her is what made him notice her in the first place. That and her fake tits. He suppressed everything. How the job was really affecting him and his addiction. And then it manifested into this. He only snapped with her a few weeks but would still DM her about random things on Insta and had stopped going to see her in her building where she works as often. He said it started off as wanting a new friendship because he felt lonely during the long shifts but that it evolved into this. (ADDITION: f*ck him I was alone during those shifts and I didn’t go stalk people). 


THE LIES HE FED ME LADIES. 

And how badly I wanted to believe him. I’d known him since high school. It was hard to let go. 
But so many things happened after that. 
His parents attacking me after hearing me call him a piece of shit and using me as a scapegoat forever after since I couldn’t immediately forgive their baby boy. 
Losing my self esteem.
Hating other women without reason. 
High anxiety 
Always feeling on edge
Moving states again
Finding out he had relapsed even before we had moved for our “fresh start” (3 months later). 
All the gaslighting, lying and feeling crazy. 
Something in me snapped when I found out about the relapse. 

I realized I couldn’t live like that anymore. 
That I deserved to be happy again 
That’s staying with him just because I was afraid of being alone was stupid. 
As we say in my culture “Es mejor estar sola que mal acompañada”
It’s better to be alone, than to be in bad company. 

This subreddit helped me get there during my separation. It helped me realize the red flags I missed, the things I let slide and what I can’t let happen again.

He will self sabotage, fold under the pressure, and sit around and wait for you to leave him, all while you’re desperately analyzing the situation and trying to save it. He will say whatever it takes to get you to stay. Do not look at his words, look at his actions.

Do not waste thousands of dollars and years of your life working on the assumption that therapy and counseling always works.

Now, two years later, he won't leave me alone. He's lurking on my social media with work accounts, he's trying to add me on snapchat, he keeps emailing me. I deleted my gmail account and somehow he remembered an old one that forwards to my new account. I've blocked him on everything and have made sure that all of my accounts private.

Lyrics:

You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off key in my chorus
'Cause it wasn't yours
I saw the signs and I ignored it
Rose colored glasses all distorted
Set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn
You got off on the hurtin'
When it wasn't yours, yeah

We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dance, it was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me

I gave my all and they all know it
Then you tore me down and now it's showing
In two months, you replaced us
Like it was easy
Made me think I deserved it
In the thick of healing, yeah

We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dance, it was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me

You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off key in my chorus

To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
To love, love, yeah

Women are conditioned to give and give and give in relationships and not ask for anything in return. Or we give and hope that our efforts will pay off on some unspecified date in the future, a day which often never comes. It’s so easy to settle into a relationship which you’re not getting anything out of. Asking this question periodically will help you recognise if you’re in such a relationship. This question also applies to platonic relationships, as well. Don’t stay in relationships or situations just for the sake. If something is not adding to your life, it’s subtracting and needs to be cut.",96044,“What are you getting out of this relationship?”,0,,,

-I let go out a lot of pickmeisha friends who unfortunately didn't bring any value to the friendship besides using me as their therapist and clutch for when things go wrong with their Lvms. 

- I took myself out of this work environment that treated me like crap, gaslighted my issues and constantly used me and exploited me. Raised my price in my work and value. You won't catch me settling for a bad work environment nope. 

-I feel less guilty about investing in health related stuff such as massages, accupuncture, spa services, supplements etc. My health is my wealth. 

- I feel better about not responding to everyone who is just trying to use me. I used to feel guilty and always be a people pleaser when it comes to these things.

I learned my lesson. 

After living with verbally abusive relatives and a pick-me mother (whom I love to death but lockdown has shown me a side to her I didn’t see as I’ve put her in such a high pedestal) who literally gaslights me for being “too sensitive” for crying when one of her brothers attack me verbally—- I learned that some pickmes will just destroy your life, even if it’s your own mother. Her dumb, forty something year old brothers don’t contribute financially, or physically to our home aside from being verbally abusive. My mom pays for literally everything in the ancestral house since my grandfather died and all her siblings mooch money off of her. She also washes the dishes, buys snacks for them everyday, organizes the grocery list etc. I call them out for it, and you know what she does? She tells me off for being “negative”, and that I “complain all the time”. I tell her her brothers are never going to be independent if she continues that behavior but she scolds me instead. Jesus... I don’t even know what to say. The good side is I am ABOUT to move out after months of eternal torture since the lockdown in my city is finally lifted after nearly 6 months. 

Another example is a friend of mine who is verbally and physically abused by her current partner. Once when she was pregnant, he slapped her so hard she actually passed the fuck out. She called me evil for trying to convince her to leave the scrote because I’m encouraging her to “break up her family”. 

I don’t even know, ladies. It can be so discouraging empowering other women who in return, attack you for simply caring for their well-being... 😭",95668,You can’t save every pickme out there,0,,,

I was a child when TLC's No Scrubs come out but I always loved that song. It was about rejecting deadbeat men who don't fit your standards. I didn't know that at the time men got so pressed about the song, thinking it was degrading men (the same way men think FDS is about degrading men just because it's about rejecting what is not good for us lol). So this rap group made this song responding to the song TLC had made, because men always have to give their 2 cents and cry when women talk about their experiences in an empowering way.

The comment section of this video is a fest of mad scrotes screaming about how this song was men's vindication, an anthem against the unfairness of No Scrubs. Decades ago and now, men still get pressed when women talk about not wanting LVM. If they weren't the LVM TLC was singing about  (and we in FDS talk about), why are they crying over a girlband singing a song stating their standards? Why do some redditors cry about a subreddit about a group of women not wanting to deal with a certain type of men? Why so mad? Why all these meltdowns?

So what if I wait to find out if a man is worth sleeping with?

So what if I want a man who makes six figures?

So what if I want to date a guy over 6ft?

So what if I want to be taken out to dinner?

So what if I expect men to pay for said dinner?

When I’ve employed this tactic, I’ve often found that the conversation dies instantly. Because the people attacking you are often projecting their insecurities onto you. In addition, they often can’t tell you why they think your standards and expectations are unreasonable. When they see that you’re unbothered, they’ll drop the conversation and move on.

MRI scans show reduced gray matter in the frontal lobe 

“ These abnormalities in the brains of pedophiles are caused by early neurodevelopmental perturbations (Schiffer, 2008). The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRIs) and positron emission tomography scans (PET) has revealed that the abnormalities of pedophiles exhibit appear in the frontal and central regions of the brain. In particular, there is a decreased volume of gray brain matter in the central striatum. As a result, the nucleus accumbens, orbital frontal cortex, and the cerebellum are all affected (Schiffer, 2008).”

2. Where have I seen these words before? Well it was also proven that hours of exposure to explicit images is correlated with reduced gray matter in the frontal lobe 

Kühn and Gallinat [263] conducted an MRI study with sixty-four healthy (non-CSB) male subjects and correlated hours of online viewing of explicit material per week and years of use with dorsal striatal structure and connectivity. Three main results were reported. First, longer duration and more hours per week of use correlated with lower grey matter volume in the right caudate. While the caudate serves multiple complex functions, volume changes in the striatum are associated with several addictions, while the direction of change is not consistent. Second, more years and more hours per week of use correlated with lower left putaminal activity in response to brief, still sexual images. fMRI studies confirmed that the putamen is activated during sexual arousal [265,266]. The authors suggested this lower volume may reflect tolerance brought about by desensitization: “This is in line with the hypothesis that intense exposure to pornographic stimuli results in a downregulation of the natural neural response to sexual stimuli” [236] (p. E6). Given the stronger response to 9-second explicit video clips in Voon et al. [262], it may be that brief (530 milliseconds) exposures to still images do not act as cues for today’s internet porn video viewers, and are instead a good way to measure decreasing sexual response. Alternatively, the non-addicts here examined may be responding differently than addicts would have. Finally, subjects who consumed more pornographic material were found to have less connectivity between the right caudate and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). While the DLPFC is concerned with executive functions, it is also associated with cue reactivity to drugs and internet gaming. Disruptions in this circuit are implicated in drug and behavioral addictions. Specifically, poor functional connectivity between the DLPFC and caudate (as found in the current study) is implicated in heroin addiction [267].

So what?

Exercising judgement when choosing a lifelong partner is a GOOD THING.

This is the person who could become the father of your children (if that's what you're looking for). Even for childfree women, this is someone with whom you plan on sharing *years of your life*, so it is important to choose well.

Just imagine if you were expected to surrender all judgement when making any other important life decision.

For example, imagine you are thinking of buying a house. You go to a viewing, and the house has broken windows, the carpets smell like cat piss, and the furnace needs to be replaced. You tell the sellers, ""sorry, not interested, I want a house that is move-in ready, not a project""

They sigh, exasperated: ""wow, unbelievable. You are so JUDGEMENTAL! You can always replace the windows, carpets, and furnace. Just look at this house! It has a good foundation, walls, roof. You are so focused on it's flaws, you're not able to see the good qualities underneath!""

#Dear men: we are not in the business of flipping houses.

It doesn't matter to us if you think you're a ""nice guy"" with great qualities deep down. If we look at you and don't like what we see, no matter how ""superficial"" you might think it is, tough luck. 

If a house has been on the market for months or years with no offers, it's up to the *sellers* to fix it up and make it more attractive to potential buyers.

In the dating world, it's a buyers market. Women get to choose. And yes, that involves exercising judgement.

Don't like it? Then stay single. Like please do *actually* go your own way.

We'll be over here, with the men you call ""simps"", in happy and loving relationships 💕👰🤵💕",95561,"""FDS is so JUDGEMENTAL"" Yes, and we are proud of it! Mate selection is among the most important decisions you will ever make, it is a crucial time to be choosy!",0,,,

1) Be multidimensional. Choose 3 qualities or more that you will develop to their extreme.  Preferably qualities that are opposite to one another. It’s better when it’s qualities people don’t except you to have. If you are extremely hot and dress like a princess, people don’t except you for example to be passionate about video games or motorcycles .


For example I’m a sexy fit chick into bodybuilding but I can talk deeply about entrepreneurship, spirituality, anthropology. And still be playful , have core confidence and extremely sensual. 

You want to combine extreme feminity with a bit of masculine traits. Just like we would be massively attracted by a man who is a super successful CEO in suits and tie but also into embroidery and fucking down to earth and fucking funny. Or muscular but read books on physics and can do your cornrows better than you.


 2)You have to challenge the pattern they are used to with other women (by other women, I mean pickmes). When a pickme would normally do something, you don’t. Doesn’t matter how attractive he is. Treat him like a king when he’s in front of you but act like you would with a man that you didn’t like too much (but still give small chance) when you’re away. 

3) Don’t interrupt him when he speaks. If you say something and he’s jumping on it. Stop talking immediately. I’m his mind he feels like a king but deep down you know it’s you. You want to hear everything he says to vet him. You already know what you know. He’s here to impress you. You have no one to impress.

 Don’t talk too much. Let him think about what to say next. You don’t need to worry about what to say. It’s his job to entertain you. All you have to do is stay in your body and ask yourself “how do I feel”. This is how you stay in your feminine essence and he will automatically be in his masculine. 

Try to watch the interview of Ashley Graham with Kim Kardashian on YouTube. Watch how Kim says thank you To compliments . Kim is in her feminine essence in that podcast  and Ashley has excellent social skills.


4)Ask him what he wants to do for small stuff like where to sit at the restaurant. He will feel like a boss. When he asks you on a date say “what do you want to make me discover? “

. Make him try your food (feed him with your spoon).Be tactile early on but only after he has said something nice to you. He needs to understand that every good behavior gets rewarded and bad behavior gets punished. 
Rub his thighs for a few second occasionally. Stay close to the knees. Have a soft/feminine voice.

Try to go to 3 different places during the date: if you went for dinner eat the main course there but go grab dessert elsewhere. 

Ask him to come with me buy your cigarettes real quick for example . It will feel like you had 3 dates and you create different vibes. It’s nice.


5)For the first kiss, most men initiate it. But if he doesn’t , you have to do it on the first or second date. If done on the first date, only do it once he has paid. Not before.

Let him reach out after the date. Especially if you initiated the kiss. It’s very rare for men to have a girl initiate the kiss on the first date. He will start to think “omg, she’s so into me. I’m the king” and expecting you to reach out. 

Don’t. Don’t check his IG story either. This will throw him off of his game because it’s not because you kissed him that he has you now. This is the femme fatale mindset “you never fully have me. You need to prove yourself daily and stimulate me daily”.


Next dates until commitment: greet him like a friend. In my country we kiss on the cheeks. 
But during the date kiss him like you can get enough of him. But always end the date first and plan some activities to do after the date with your friends.
It makes you look busy/high value with a rich life. Kiss him passionately when you say goodbye.


6)No nickname unless he’s your boyfriend. A lot of women give them nicknames after 2 dates. Don’t do that. He’s not your boyfriend .


7) Do cool activities with friends and post them on social media. Sometimes you add a pic but no stories. Sometimes you add the story but no pics. Sometimes you add the pic but a story that is unrelated.Sometimes you don’t post anything for a while and boom a pic of you at a cool museum. Sometimes it’s you in a bikini. Must always be different. Most women post the same kind of pics based on their interests . Usually it’s clubbing pics only or selfies. You want to show that you are not predictable and do a lot of activities( see point 1. You are multi dimensional). 


8) Playfulness:say stuff like “if you want to see me again, you have to finish this sodoku game”. You want to challenge him with stuff that will make you have a high image of him. Not stupid games where he’s embarrassed . When you challenge him with little games, his brain understands that you are a challenge.

For this example you could occasionally text him to ask if he has finished. Play with him like kids basically.


9)Surprise him with cool activities “I’m not telling you where we’re going it’s a surprise “. If it’s before the commitment, don’t initiate of course. But if he says “let’s go dinner” and you’re sick of dinners, you can say “I have a better idea . It’s a surprise”. He will still have to pay. The activities you choose to surprise him with must be active ones. Not romantic. Laser game, rock climbing , etc. He must plan the romantic stuff but you plan activities that you would do with friends. It’s important to do those activities as well because in the relationship, you won’t be lovers all the time. Sometimes it will feel like you’re with a good friend. It’s completely normal. Deep love is a feeling, it fluctuates. It’s completely normal.

 Make him close his eyes so that he can surrender when you surprise him. Men don’t like losing control so it’s great to do this to disturb the pattern they are used to.


10)Remain  a challenge:Say stuff like “if we are still together next year, we could go to X”. 

11)Accept compliments without thinking about something nice to say back. 

12)Don’t  spend the night with him at the beginning after sex. It needs to have a progression. He needs to constantly work to get more of you. For men sharing bed is more intimate than sex.


13)Playing the dumb fox when they give you cheap offers “oh! I would have loved to go to X. Let’s do this when we will know one another more . What do you think of this restaurant instead ?”. Don’t accept offers on their side of town or the restaurant underneath their apartment. When a man goes on a date he thinks “I wonder how fast I can sleep with her without having to spend too much and working too hard”. They don’t think “I want to connect with her so deeply”. You need to create the connection with FDS and those tools and other social skills tools.


14)Being mysterious : never say what you’re doing. “I have to go. I have stuff to do”. If you always go out on Wednesday with him, you need to change dates often.
You must have something new with you all the time. Can be a new perfume, new way to make up your eyes or a new nail polish. I stayed with a host family when I was traveling in Europe. The host would always prepare a new dish everyday. I was very excited to come back home after doing all my activities and wondering what she prepared today. If it works on me it works on men too. The brain LOVES novelty.


15)Be fully present when you are with him but disappear completely when you aren’t together .

16)Once he’s your boyfriend. No nicknames like “bae/boo/baby”. I know one femme fatale. She doesn’t say stuff like this to her husband. Only “my love/my man/my safe place”. I feel like it’s good to remind him that you don’t date  menchild only men.

Hope this helps. This is more of a how to be a femme fatale guide. FDS teaches you more how to be high value and vet men. This guide is if he performing well so far. 

Combining both is what makes you stand out and you stop worrying about other women being more attractive than you. Just by doing this you place yourself in the top 1%. Most women aren’t doing anything to figure those stuff out.

I’m confident with this. I tried this on a man . I cut him off and he’s still SPRUNG months later. He thinks that I did some voodoo on him because he just can’t let me go. Don’t underestimate how psychology works. Every tactic added together creates addiction. Stick to this. It works.",101276,How to be a femme fatale.,0,,,

I hope I don’t sound like a pickme, because that’s definitely not my intent. To paraphrase the musical *Company*, “I want *some*body, not some *body.*”

I was definitely a late bloomer who never dated in high school (one guy liked me but I found him creepy, so I said no). I didn’t really find anyone attractive, but I didn’t get any male attention either, so I guess it nullified itself. My dad said it was because I’m intimidating (isn’t that what dads say?) because I’m opinionated and smart and not afraid to speak my mind.

Many moons later, my only “real” relationship was with my NVM ex fiancé, who never really wanted a relationship with me anyway. I’m taking time from dating and such because I honestly don’t care about it right now, as there are too many other things I should be concerned with.

However...my lack of dating history overall makes me wonder if there’s some people out there who are not supposed to be in a relationship? I would like one one day, but I’m not about to say yes to just anyone. My friends and family tell me I have a lot going for me, but no one seems interested, especially not HVM. I don’t plan on changing who I am to snag a man, because that’s the first sign I should be committed, but I do feel like there aren’t even any HVM around in the world.

Does anyone else feel like this? Like it’s never in the cards and they should just forget romance and live their life?",101269,Overall Feeling of No Interest?,0,,,

He was nice, I was my normal, friendly self around him and thanked him for checking out the oven so quickly. Anyway, two days later once the oven had been fixed and I confirmed it by text, he sent me a message saying he was stunned at how pretty I was when he first saw me and that he was single. I felt gross and told him I had a boyfriend. 

I live right next to this tiny Italian restaurant and I share the back space with them. Whenever I was coming back from work I'd always say hi  or chat to the wife or any of the chefs who'd be taking their breaks there. Anyway, the day after the text thing happened, I bumped into the wife as I was leaving my apartment and I burst into tears.

She took me in, gave me some water and I told her everything. She mentioned he was married (ew) and that he had a baby due in December (even more ew) and that he was in his early 40s (bleugh). When I managed to calm down, she told me it was unfair on me that I'm in this position (I'm a college student) and that she'd take care of it. 

Two nights ago, I overheard her talking to two or three guys in the courtyard from my window and I heard her mentioning me and she told them to ""do it"".

Fast forward to last night, I got a call from the housing agency I'm with to tell me my landlord's been hospitalized because he was beaten up badly whilst coming back from a bar so they'll be dealing with any problems I have. I was coming back to the apartment when I saw the wife again and she gave me a massive hug, told me that he would never bother me again and if he did try again I should go straight to her.

I have no clue how she knows what happened (my best friend thinks she's in some shady business) but I guess the moral of the story is, stick up for your fellow women from all those slimeballs out there. Because in many cases, apparently being friendly is automatically a sign of being flirty smh.",98838,My married landlord hit on me and this happened,0,,,

If you have this on your mind, don’t you think men will be incapable of affecting you?
Fake it till you make it girl. Prioritise yourself consciously. Think: Is this a dignified way to act? Does this even need my limited time and attention?


- Stay single until you actually find a man worthwhile. If you stay with the wrong person, you have no space to let the right person in. It’s hard but you have to take control of your life, nobody else can do that for you.


- Whenever you think about a guy too much, consciously bring yourself back to the reality. Men barely think about us, they don’t give that much importance to be in a relationship. There are so many things better than being around a person who wants you just a little bit. 


- Make your mind a palace for you to be in.


- Make decisions rationally and logically. 


- Whenever stuck, divert your attention to a goal: workout goals, career goals, hobby goals, etc. It’s fun if YOU perceive it as fun! 


- You might read the best dating books and self help books that change you slowly but nothing works better than faking till you make it, till you fricking believe it!

Ive also started getting into religion this year for the first time in my life. 


Met a guy, first day of talking we were on the phone til 7 in the morning. Seemed to going great possibly because we were just talking about aspects of our life. Felt pretty happy to talk to a man who didnt wna be dirty immediately, seemed respectful and normal and honestly i was super excited about him and to get to know him because its been a year since i connected with someone.

Day 2. Red flags galore!!!! We spoke more about lifestyle, monogamy and what we need in a partner. Every time we talked about preferences or boundaries he would sort of shame me for them? 

For eg:

I said i would love and prefer that he could: (prefer not necessarily MUST HAVE) 

1. Him to always change and strive to be the best ver of himself
2.  More religious than I so that he can guide me and we can learn and grow together (to which he freaked out and told me why cant i go learn myself which isnt right in our religion)
3. Is resilient doesn’t complaint and stay miserable when life gets hard (i would listen but if he just beats himself up forever thats off putting to me)
4. Love me more than i love him (maybe this is unreasonable but ive never had someone love me equally so id like to experience that if possible)
5. Someone sober (not discriminating against ppl who arent but its just what i need)
6. Is soft in communication and isnt harsh or yells because thats triggering for me



I admit its going to be really hard to find someone but these are truly my bare minimum. i would compromise slightly of course but he totally freaked out said he was shocked and that i was not giving space to my partner to be himself. Which i guess I understand on one part but i dont get why im not allowed to have standards? 

He said a child is easier to mould than a grown man so does that mean he intends to stay the same way forever? Isit because im 25 so i feel change is essential for growth? Are 37 year old men incapable of change and character development?


Im so confused. And honestly drained. I feel gaslighted tbh the entire evening’s conversation left me feeling judged and shamed for what i want and need. I obviously won’t continue talking to him. But i do want to know if there was a better way of communicating my needs or if i did something wrong. 


Thank you lovelies stay safe sending love xo",100031,Communicating my boundaries and being shamed for it? 🙃 How can i do this better?,0,,,

*India has 44 million more men than women. Reasons? Extreme male preference leading to widespread female foeticides and infanticides.*

Now that they've killed all the women, Indian men don't have anyone to marry so they're looking elsewhere, for more gullible targets. 

### 💀 Patriarchal upbringing and male pandered brainwashing of women💀

This starts at birth. Desi women are told that their entire self-worth and purpose is wrapped up in being a self-sacrificing wife, mother, and pillar of the household. After a woman reaches X age, she's constantly pressurised to marry. Often against her wishes. 


### 💀 Blaming the women 💀

The number 1 rule of misogyny is: Blame the women. 

Whenever something is wrong in the house or the family, people always ask “why didn’t &lt;woman&gt; do something about this?”, so from the get-go, your entire future is framed in terms of marriage and your future family. So a lot of women don’t know any better, and they’re a failure if they try to leave. 

### 💀 Internalised misogyny💀

For this reason, a lot of older women in the family/MILs will treat younger women piss poorly, but for some the intention is to teach them at a young age how to manage a household and survive in a joint family, especially when it was tough for a lot of these MILs. 

### 💀The MIL nightmare💀

The MIL will treat you like a slave. Will make you bend over backwards to make sure her son with the face of an elephant sized amaranthus lives comfortably. 

### 💀 Trashy NVM💀

Don't expect them to treat you like a Queen. They don't care about your happiness and they'll blame you if you raise your voice or try to leave. They'd rather you burn your blood and be a fuckin slave while they act like they're living a good life. 

### 💀Abuse💀

Physical, mental, emotional, psychological, sexual. Endless gaslighting. You name it. 

### 💀No financial independence💀

You will be forced to resign from your job. If you don't, The financial component is that men are breadwinners and they’ve never been taught to emotionally or intimately provide for their families, and it’s not like their parents’ relationships showed them any different. So women, even if they want things to change, don’t really have the financial backing or the power to get what they want. If they go back home, their family will be talked about or socially shamed (not to mention her family will probably be the ones doing the shaming). 

### 💀Divorce💀

If they get divorced, the man will easily be married but she will have a “dirty/used goods” mentality about her. And kids make it all the more complicated, because if their lives are affected in any way, it’s the mom’s face and FDS mindsets will change things for women now, but the main thing is that women need to know that there are other options out there and the relationship they see with their parents isn’t the only reality they have to subject themselves to.

### 💀Predatory grooming💀

Society strives to keep female financial independence to the bare minimum. Parents try to get girls fresh out of college or in their final semesters married, what life experience would these girls have?

Men, and their families want younger girls so they can ""mold"" them as they choose.

### 💀 Delusional romantic movies💀

Movies romanticize domestic lives, showing some stolen kisses in a kitchen while ignoring the larger nightmare that half the family is in the living room while this girl is cooking alone and her husband is distracting her.

### 💀Dowry💀

Be prepared to pay dowry at the time of: engagement, marriage, after visiting your own home, after your parents visit you, after the birth of every child. 

### 💀 Housework💀

Be prepared to cook, clean and do all stuff while your family lounges watching TV and your MIL complains that you can't do stuff properly. 

### 💀Family shaming💀

Your family will be shamed for anything your in-laws deem ""inappropriate"". 

### 💀No healthy sexuality💀

Be prepared to have a lifetime of non-orgasmic sex and be ready to be sl*t shamed to the highest level incase you demand anything or masturbate. Men think sex is something humiliating and derogatory done to women. 

### 💀 Restrictions on clothing💀

You maybe forced to wear ONLY traditional Indian dresses or your clothes may be regukate by your MIL to make you ""fit to be a decent DIL"". 

### 💀 Entertaining guests💀 

Your in-laws will call people to the house and YOU will be expected to prepare a luncheon and entertain them. 

### 💀 In-law politics and gaslighting💀

They will make a mountain of a molehill at every point and you'll be seen as the trouble. If you buy something or get a gift from someone, expect your in-laws to get jealous and pass comments. 


### 💀Womb- hijacking💀

You will be expected to be a good DIL and pop out kids as per your family's demands. You won't have a choice! 

The DIL is supposed to have as many sons as possible. But a single daughter and the DIL along with her entire family gets shamed. 

In some parts of the country, illegal tests are being done to determine sex of the child. If female, then it's illegal abortions, throwing DIL down the stairs, murder. You name it. 

Especially MIL expects her DIL to give her grandchild within a year. I've seen my aunts and my mum's friends nag their DIL for it.

If you decide to be childfree, you'll be labelled ""barren land"" and someone who must be pitied. They won't care even if your husband is childfree which is unlikely. 

After having kids and fulfilling their ""kidesire"", you'll be expected to ""be mature"" and leave your job, if you haven't already, to fully focus on child rearing. If you manage work and childcare, then be prepared to be exhausted and get gaslighted by the family for ""riding two boats at the same time"" while the in-laws will try to spoil the kids so that they can blame you. 


### Some feminist commentary

Turkish feminist economist Deniz Kandiyoti calls this behavior Token Torture a form of bargain with patriarchy (PDF) where MIL gains some sense of control over a weaker female in her close proximity i.e. the DIL.

### 💀 State sponsored patriarchal control on married Indian women: 💀

1. The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956

The law upholds father as the natural guardians of a Hindu, minor and after him comes the mother. This means the father is considered the natural guardian of a child, with respect to all legal decisions over a child’s life or even if you need to sign a document on behalf of the child the mother can’t do it by herself. There have been some cases which have been taken to court because a mother has done some investment on behalf of the child and the bank has refused the papers saying that the father has not signed. The actual implication is that the mother is not able to make her decisions on her own especially when she is dealing with the government or official institutions. 

2. Adultery: Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 198(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code

This one is tricky because prima facie it feels like it is pro-women since only, married men can be tried for this. The misogyny in this is that only aggrieved husbands can register the case. So the man whose wife is being cheated upon just has to grin and bear it.

3. Marriagable Age: Hindu Marriage Act

Minimum age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys. Go figure why.

4. Marital Property

In India, there is no concept of marital property i.e. shared property of the husband and wife. After divorce, the court asks the earning spouse (generally the husband) to provide the wife with a nominal maintenance. Unless the property is registered in her name, the wife does not get a share in the property. Also, maintenance stops if the husband dies. Then what? The divorced wife has no property in her hands. Her contribution towards the household is not taken into consideration so as to distribute the property, at least that which was acquired during matrimony, in a proportional manner. Instead, everything remains with the husband and is inherited by his heirs.

5. The Hindu Succession Act

Section 15 of the Hindu Succession Act states that the property of a female Hindu dying intestate should devolve upon (after her children and grandchildren) the heirs of her husband before her own parents.

Even if her in laws mistreated her, by law, all her property could go to them.

6. Rape of a separated wife

The rape of a separated wife carries lesser punishment than the rape of any other woman. Forced sexual intercourse with the former is punishable with two to seven years of imprisonment. Prison sentence for the rape of any other woman ranges from seven years to life.

©To all the Queens for help. Thanks a lot! 🙂

**So my desi queens, I suggest we learn something from our Japanese and Korean counterparts. They raised their voices but no one listened. So now they've stopped dating, marrying and having children in such large numbers that both these countries have a birth rate of less than 1 with a steadily declining population.**

I'm on vacation with my dad right now and I'm noticing things in a way that I've never really been able to put into words before. My dad is a narcissist - and I'm not just throwing that word around. He has no concept of boundaries, he's the kind of person that will offend you and when you stand up to him, he will turn it back around on you telling you that you ""hurt his feelings"". If you set a boundary he will become offended. He is also a provocateur; he enjoys saying offensive and rebellious things for the sake of stirring people up. He is also chronically negative, constantly pointing out his annoyances and dislikes as if everyone else should care. And last point here I'll mention is that he has heavily misogynistic tendencies - he constantly points out women on the street, on TV, EVERYWHERE, and has some kind of comment about their looks/body.  Just yesterday we went on a walk and he pointed out a young woman who he said he thought might be pretty, but that her posture was so bad that she wasn't. Later, he pointed her out again and said ""oh, she doesn't have a butt, thats the problem."" This girl was most likely younger than me (I'm 25.) I said ""dad, she's younger than me"" and he said ""thats never stopped me."" When I was 14, he would not stop commenting on my 14 year old friend who had a very mature body and large breasts. He would constantly mention how attractive she is, and to this day he still asks about her. 

I don't believe my dad is a pedophile - he wouldn't actually pursue and have sex with a young woman. (He's cheated on his wife/had affairs, and they were both with women in his age range. Plus, he's fucked up, but he's just not a pedophile.) When I've tried to talk to him about how he talks about women, including young women, he says he shouldn't have to suppress his natural male tendencies just because women don't like it. I agree that men shouldn't feel ""suppressed"", but theres a way to have your thoughts and keep them to your fucking self, especially around your daughter.

My dad has also commented on **my** body this way, I wear baggy clothes around him because I don't want him to assess my body. He also will ask inappropriate questions under the guise of ""joking"", like after a date asking me ""did he cop a feel?"" I have to act jokey and laugh it off/never act too serious around him about being upset or else he will get mad at me.

Ok, so, I'm rambling here, but you get the picture. The way he has treated me throughout my life has given me an adaptive strategy of never standing up for myself or feeling that I have the right to set a boundary. Because I was afraid of him as a young girl, and still kind of am, standing up to him meant starting a scary fight. It meant getting embarrassed, shamed, and put down. Setting any kind of boundary or saying ""please stop"" meant that I would be punished. Not to mention he is wealthy and manipulates with his money - so if I'm in his good graces I can be provided for in certain ways.

The cherry on top of ALL of this, is that I still love him. My dad isn't 100% bad, and I can see how deeply flawed and in pain he is at his core. I have very mixed emotions about him, which makes it hard for me to just completely view him as a monster...because he isn't, he's just a deeply flawed man.

The way that our relationship has effected me has definitely made me a Pickmeisha, because I've been hungry for love and attention and **completely out of touch with how I feel around men.** Up until only recently, I was not able to identify my own emotions or feel the right to even have them and act upon them. I've been so trained to ""keep the peace"" that its made me out of touch with myself. Often times, I will feel a negative feeling and brush it off, still trying to appease the other person and make sure they like me. It's still a work in progress, but I literally have to allow myself to dislike something. For example, on a date, a guy does something that makes me have a negative feeling...i have to work hard to tell myself, ""hey, you didn't like that! its okay that you didn't like that, listen to that!"" but another part of me is still so desperate for him to want me and like me, even if don't really like him or was turned off by something he did. 

My only two serious relationships were with someone who abused me sexually and held a gun to me, and one with a man child who I am embarrassed to admit I ever dated. Between these relationships, I've had a lot of sexual trauma in other ways that I won't go into, and a lot of problems with low self esteem and depression. I was in therapy for 4 years and made a lot of progress, but it seems that theres always more I'm learning and more to heal. 

I really, really, really want to find my worth and feel good about myself. I want to feel in touch with my emotions around men and able to discern who I like and don't like, but its still just so hard for me. I want to unlearn all the ways I've been a pickmeisha and upgrade. Its so hard to feel like I ever can with my background. Just posting this to get it out there, and would love to hear any wisdom, insights, or support you might have to offer. 

**Tl;dr:** My relationship with my dad has made me feel silenced and completely out of touch with my own emotions. His is a misogynist with no boundaries and I have been unable to stand up to him for my entire life. This has impacted my relationship with the male gender and led me into bad relationships and incredibly low self esteem. I'd really like to heal from this and upgrade into someone who feels worthy of a good relationship and who knows what she wants.",99975,My relationship with my misogynistic and narcissistic father has caused me to be completely out of touch with myself/a pickmeisha,0,,,

Look at a man and take him at face value. Work on the assumption that he will never change, because he likely never will, and if he does, it might not be into what you want them to be. **The only person who will suffer because of this is you.**

Basing your happiness on someone's ability and willingness to change is **codependency**. Being unable to manage your anxiety unless someone acts how you want them to but being unable to remove yourself from the situation is **codependency**.

* **Abusers** try to control others to put themselves first because they **cannot manage their anger**. 
* **Codependents** try to control abusers and put themselves second because they **cannot manage their anxiety**. 
* Neither taker accountability for their part. It's two sides of the same unhealthy dynamic. **You do not have control over other people, only yourself and what situations you're in.**

Anyway, I came to FDS a few months ago because of a suggestion made to me by a member from an anti porn sub and I fell completely in Iove. It’s the first time I felt validated by other women who (finally) share similar mindsets as I do in this world full of pickmes and niceguys. My STBX husband is a narcissistic, manipulative, emotionally, verbally, mentally abusive man who always made me feel like I was asking too much, expecting too much, talking too much, taking up too much space, and basically BEING too much. I quickly realized after joining this sub that I was trying to enforce (force) high quality values on a low quality man. He enabled a porn addiction for the entirety of our relationship, had anger issues, nothing was ever his fault, never followed through on his word, never made commitments. I was a pickme when I met him and was always the one taking initiative and making big decisions and coaxing and coaching him through the relationship. We ended up getting married and having a kid together 🥴 In the last year things came to a head several times with the porn and video game habits and eventually he got into counseling and stopped the porn and video games but seemed to think that was “going above and beyond” for me and if I expect anything more from him then I am “ungrateful” and oh yeah, did I mention we’re cHrIsTiAnS? 🥴🥴🥴

So finally I’d had enough and called it quits. One of the very big ways he’d try to manipulate me was by telling me I wasn’t being a godly wife by leaving him or “disrespecting” him and “treating him like a piece of shit” (AKA holding him accountable for his toxic behavior and refusing to put up for it/standing up for myself). He wanted me to believe that being a Christian wife meant staying quiet and submissive and showing him respect no matter what he did. And so many self proclaimed Christians are quick to spew verses about how a woman should be submissive, let the husband lead, blah blah blah. They turn a blind eye to all the verses that hold men accountable for their words and thoughts and actions. 

As a Christian woman with an antiquated view on marriage impressed upon me by mainstream Christianity, I initially had a difficult time getting FDS values and Christian values to coexist until I looked more into the Bible and saw for myself that FDS values are actually very similar to New Testament scripture (which is the only Testament Christians should be applying to our lives, contrary to popular belief)  on the purpose of marriage and the roles between a husband and wife. FDS is firm in the belief that you should never give a man who you are only dating 100% of yourself. The Bible also says this. Don’t move in with him, don’t wash his underwear, don’t cook his meals, don’t have his children, and don’t give him all of your commitment until he puts a ring on that finger. This isn’t to protect a woman’s sacred virginity to make her holy and pure for a man but to protect the WOMAN from getting stuck with a low value scrote who will spend the rest of their married life sitting back with his feet up and letting her do all the work, never valuing her the way God expects men to value their wives. God knows their are many-a-scrote out there and gave Christian women their very own handbook in avoiding LVM, finding HVM, and being HVW. In the very first book of the Bible Genesis, it explains that men should always take initiative, take the lead in a partnership and always always always be held accountable for their actions. When Adam and Eve took a bite from the forbidden fruit, God didn’t ask Eve “why did you force feed Adam?” He asked ADAM why he ate the fruit when he knew better and was a so-called leader of the family. And already off the bat Adam was a fuckboi and was like “Eve told me to do it, this is all her fault” and God was all like “No bruh YOU ate from the fruit that was your decision, can’t nobody MAKE you do anything. You were supposed to be a leader, I give you free will so you can make good and bad choices for yourself bruh, GTFO since you wanna be a bitch ass.” Another example is in the New Testament when Jesus himself explains how men and women should treat each other in a marriage: Women, submit yourselves to your husbands (there it is! The infamous verse every Christian LVM likes to spew out), and husbands love your wives and Christ loved the church... and gave himself for her. LVM don’t want to have that conversation. Christ took up his cross and committed himself to the church, eventually sacrificing himself for the church and the people. He gave everything he had for the church. He lead the church, he took care of the church, he made sure nothing and no one disrespected the church. And he wanted husbands to enact the same values towards their wives. But everyone ignores that part?? 

Ladies, and specifically anyone here who is Christian — you are a muhfuggin CHURCH ok? You are sacred and special and important and YOU are the prize. YOU are the end goal. And you deserve a man who is willing to take up his cross for you, a man who will do ANYTHING to make sure you are loved and respected and taken care of. He will not let anyone or anything desecrate you. He will LEAD and TAKE INITIATIVE and always hold himself ACCOUNTABLE. If a dude you’re with doesn’t love you like Christ loved the church, dump 👏🏼 him 👏🏼 sis 👏🏼 bc he is not a HV man.",99959,Relating FDS to Christian Values in Regards to Dating and Marriage,0,,,

My little brother has a girlfriend for the very first time at 24, and it absolutely warms my heart to see how far he's come. 

He was caught watching porn as a teen and it was fascinating to see how he reacted to it. He didn't get angry, or make excuses or blame it on puberty. I remember we had a talk about it and he just said it really shook him how he was starting down this slippery slope of absolute degradation and it was a dark path. Since his teens he's NEVER had any respect for boys who would objectify women, and was always highly uncomfortable being in situations where other boys ogled women or made ""locker room talk"". Boys made fun of him and would accuse him of being gay, but he NEVER gave into the pressure in order to prove any kind of masculinity. 

I had a (ex)boyfriend over at my house at one time and he stated he didn't find Eva Mendes pretty at all (like wtf does it matter, who asked you?). I was incredulous, and turned to my brother and asked if he thought eva mendes was pretty. He just stated simply ""All women have beauty, and we do not talk about them that way"". This is a friggin TEENAGER talking like this. 

He wasn't always like this and he chalks up his views on women to a trip he took in his early teens to stay with our older cousins over the summer. Our cousins were very into partying and drinking, and my brother was put in a lot of awkward situations where he was stuck alone at parties with much older teens who ignored him or pressured him to underage drink. There was a girl in my cousin's friend group who took notice of this, and she started hanging out with my brother that whole summer. She'd get him out of situations where he wasn't feeling okay, drive him home safely when my cousins were too drunk to do so, and if he was feeling left out on the trip she'd always show up to take him out to ice cream or go do something fun like a theme park or zoo.

After the trip he was so excited to tell his friends and schoolmates back home about this new friend he made over the summer and the whole experience. He'd show them the fun photobooth photos he took with her and his friends' first reactions? ""Wow she's fat"". 

I think since then my brother really understood how women were viewed in this world. He met this amazingly generous young woman who took care of him like he was her own little brother, and at the end of that story all she was seen for was her looks. 

The way he talks about his new girlfriend is SO kind, he's so proud of her and her accomplishments. He talks about how they've liked each other for a while but he didn't feel right asking her out until he felt better in his job search because he's determined to be a provider. He told me her name and I mentioned it's the same name as a candy and he got so excited, saying he had to look it up and buy her some because he knew she'd find it funny. He gets her flowers every week. I jokingly asked him if I should join church and find someone like he did, and he immediately said ""a lot of guys hide behind God to get away with things, you have to be very careful"". 

We grew up with an extremely LVM father and despite all these influences, my lil brother has somehow come out of it with a HV heart of gold. He's got his mistakes but he's such a good kid, and he's never made excuses for himself. Sorry for the ramble, but if my little brother knew better as a teen there is NO EXCUSE for any of these lvm out there!",99937,A small appreciation post for the hvm in my life,0,,,

Our detractors claim that porn can be feminist and that there’s porn out there that caters to women too.  

So as an experiment, I actively looked around at recommended ""feminist"" porn sites to see if I had somehow misjudged. 

I was hoping, somewhere in the teaming mass of female exploitation, there was some oasis of female catering porn so I could finally learn how porn is supposed to ""enhance"" my sex life, like all the Sex Pozzy Libfems keep claiming it’s going to but never has. 

I started with a list from Glamour mag which detailed 15 porn sites I'm supposed to Enjoy:

[15 Porn Sites for Women That You’ll Really, Really Enjoy](https://www.glamour.com/story/5-porn-sites-for-women-that-youll-really-really-enjoy)

THE LIES.  I looked through all these porn sites and I didn’t enjoy SHIT.

I honestly can’t tell the difference at all from regular ass porn and so-called feminist” porn.  How do I know it’s feminist? Some of the women don't wax as much? 

There is one site that advertises that it's feminist because the women ""choose"" the porn actors they want to have sex with, but its behind an expensive pay wall.  So .... if I want to see women who actually might be *enjoying* sex with someone they *want* to fuck, I gotta pay a premium? But they still want me to watch the rest of their free shit now that I know those women don’t really *like* the dudes they’re being paid to have sex with that much because otherwise they’d charge me to see it? 🤔

What’s especially wild is how they advertise the site with more naked women then men! Why are all the landing pages the same old T&amp;A display and female objectification? This porn is supposed to be for *straight* women, right?? WHY am I looking at titties and vaginas *still*?!

So the first part of the experiment was a complete failure. So instead, I decided to search by *my* specific fantasies and see if I could find something that way. I settled on two scenarios to research:

**Scene 1: All you can eat Buffet**

Two brown skin dudes with goatees and washboard abs eating one pussy from the front to the back. Both straight - I don’t want to see any man on man sex. They can be any kind of medium Brown Skin as in Polynesian, Latino, Black, Italian, etc. 

**Scene 2:  Suitor Fight Club**

15 fine ass dudes in tight jeans and no shirt in a warehouse fight until only one is left standing to the amusement of one lucky woman who watches from a throne. She rides the one who wins like a prize horse and the others have to watch in shame and silence knowing they will have to try again next week. Some of them cry from frustration. And not *fake* tears.  I want them to [chest heave like an NBA player after a game 7 loss to a buzzer beater shot.](https://youtu.be/WSw2RnFjZss)

Surely, Rule 34 of the Internet should apply here right? If it exists, there should be porn of it! 

WRONG. RULE 34 IS A LIE TOO! 

First off, what is this kind of sex even called? It’s easy to find two women giving a man a blow job but two men and one woman? SUSPICIOUSLY LACKING IN INVENTORY. 

Secondly, what do I even search to find the specific physical qualities I like in men? 

Where is the MALE objectification? Why can't I search videos by peen size and shape organized into clickable categories for me? 

What about racial categories? What about body type? Hair color? Facial hair preferences? Jawline? Is there some kind of conspiracy against straight women having physical preferences? Do they assume we don’t have any?

So even trying to find my specific physical sexual preferences was a near impossible task to begin with, and then trying to narrow that down to a specific type of sex scene and it is now fully impossible.

So in conclusion FEMINIST PORN DOES NOT EXIST and RULE 34 is a LIE. 

**At this point, I'm convinced labeling videos as feminist is a form of indoctrination: it’s like they are trying to make women accustomed and compatible to mainstream porn by tricking us into believing we’re being progressive by watching it.**

But truthfully, It’s all irredeemable male pandering male gazey female exploiting unimaginative garbage and we’re missing literally NOTHING by not having it in our relationships.",99935,FEMINIST PORN DOESN’T EXIST and RULE 34 is a LIE. FIGHT ME LibFems and Scrotes!!,0,,,

We are anti polyamory. I've seen some people pushing it in the comments. It's unacceptable and it's not a discussion for this subreddit.

Polyamory is a ridiculous concept that ruins relationships. It's mostly for people who aren't happy in their relationships but don't have the guts to end them, or men who want to sleep around. It is an absolute joke how people involved in polyamory talk about how they ""love"" multiple people. They're just having flings with other people they barely know for six months at a time or less. That's a sad representation of their supposed to ""love"".

Polyamory is a trap for women. It is not to our benefit to share a man with multiple other women. It divides his time and attention among multiple women, reducing attention and resources invested in you. It increases chances of STDs, even with condom use, and women are far more susceptible to infection.

Most men can't even sexually satisfy one woman so I don't know why they think they deserve more than one to disappoint. Furthermore if your partner can only manage having sex three times a week but he's now sharing it with two other women, that means you get sex once a week in your supposedly primary relationship. Scam.

It's just cheating, but right in the woman's face. It's an insult. You are not more mature for going along with it, in fact it shows how weak you are. Women need to know what they want, demand it, and if they don't get it, leave. That is maturity.

Edit: thank you for the awards

Second edit: the folks over at r polyamory are so pressed they've made three posts whining about this post! If you take a walk over there you can see some of the fine male specimens with multiple women hanging off of them that you too could share with multiple other women if you want to be polyamorous 🙃😂💩🤡🤮

After he asked for my number and I said no, I decided to add “too bad you’re short, tall guys are the best” even though I don’t even care about how tall a guy is lol.

However, I need some advice. I'm currently 33. I'm Indian by origin and my parents promoted the arranged marriage route when I turned 21. After two years of fighting them, I gave in and to sum up, I couldn't bring myself to accept the guys they set me up with. Most of them were originally from India and had expectations I didn't think I could meet / want to meet. After 8 years of being unable to stick up for myself, the arrangements finally stopped. I was 'too difficult'. 

I tried dating in my 20s but nothing really worked out either. I had difficulty compartmentalizing the things that were happening. 

I'm now single and trying hard to move on. I definitely have some sort of relationship anxiety from it. (to no one's surprise)

I have difficulty seeing myself as a happy and independent female. When I imagine my future, I get anxious about getting old and continuing to be single. Never having kids. I feel like no one will ever want to date me after a while. I'll be too old. 

This is becoming a real problem. When I date, I go out of my way for guys who could not care less. I accept whoever comes my way and make myself feel guilty over every imbalanced interaction. A pattern I picked up from the arrangements. 

Tldr; How do I feel confident and happy being single? How do I start seeing my life from my own eyes?",97320,Imagining an independent me,0,,,

A couple years after graduating high school I gained pounds to the right places. When I started my first full time job I got involved with a bonefied asshole. He was trying to make moves and I was very flattered with the attention. Then he gets into negging, one of those sarcastic douche bag types. He’d talk about how my chest was flat and neg me about my hair.

Over time, since the job is physical, I lost a lot of fat (30 lbs). Once that happened the attacks got worse, he’d compare me to the thick girl that worked there to piss me off. 

Come to find out a couple months after I ditched his ass that his baby mama was skinnier than I ever was. And notably another time a coworkers daughter came in once and I just missed her, when he said she was in there his description was that she had a “””big heart”””. I saw her eventually and she was smaller than me.. he literally said that just to get a reaction.

So we’ve been getting some feedback that the tone of the sub has changed significantly with the large influx of new users we’ve had lately. 

Most of the newbies come looking for specific relationship advice, which we would definitely like to help with as we think a lot of the main relationship subs are dominated by men and as such give women *the worst* advice (CoMmUniCaTe 🙄) 

We were hoping that as the sub matured there would be more established FDS members than newbies here to influence the comments, but it seems our growth trajectory isn’t slowing down anytime soon so we might be dominated by newbies for awhile. 

To keep the spirit of the main FDS sub alive, we’re going to redirect all specific relationship advice questions to r/AskFDS. 

This will free up some space on the main sub for the established members who want to focus on strategy content and minimize the amount of frivolous, clearly-haven’t-read-the-handbook comments and questions. 

We will still request that newbies read the Handbook **first** before asking your relationship question on r/AskFDS because so many of the questions we get asked are already addressed there and it’s great base knowledge to understand our specific lense. 

And as always, please consider joining the FDS website www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com where we have more privacy for personal questions.

I was taught you have to give up the physical stuff first, then sit pretty and wait and hope you get picked. Throughout my teens and up to my early 30s, barring being religious, I didn’t even know there were other options. 

Honestly, I see again and again and again, these posts from women who have been used and ghosted and had their hearts stomped on, or just feel the unfulfillment from their casual encounters and realize they want and deserve better. I posted supportive messages of the OP and others on that train (I’ve posted a lot of supportive comments on the sub, of both men and women making good decisions) and a couple ~~ladies~~ women come screaming at me, (some with all caps) when I presented backup as to *why* a lot of women decline. Helpful info that I either learned here or my changed perspective lead me to seek out. 

One of the articles that gave a general overview of male mating behavior patterns [written by a man in the psych field ](http://www.interchangecounseling.com/blog/why-men-are-so-obsessed-with-sex/) apparently was an issue, as was a list of [the impact of STDs on female bodies ](https://www.cdc.gov/std/health-disparities/stds-women-042011.pdf) and a study done showing that hookups have [lower orgasm rates ](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/women-find-orgasms-elusive-in-hookups/) . I don’t know what this pick-me was on about but she found the facts infuriating and really did The Cherry Pick Twist on me. 

Must have been reported because after some seriously well-thought out and informative responses that challenged the notion of early sex, they perma-banned me. And whatever mod over there I messaged was a total dick, something about “sorry for interrupting your role play”, which is not only rude but makes 0 sense. That was it, no further explanation, and then had me muted. The only roleplay going on is a sub that professes to help, when it really just supports maintaining a certain power structure that prioritizes a certain group. Because meanwhile, you have a) women who are dismissive of the waiting choice, responding with the whole “heyyyy hookups have their place!” and b) guys on there who are shaming women saying they “just aren’t sexually liberated” or “women set these arbitrary timelines” (of course, women waiting does not benefit men trying to gain and retain power). One of those users even posted one of those “women are golddiggers” gems on a different sub. Do *they* get to post still? Of course they do! 

WTF with those subs? I’ve had other instances where I got crap for pointing out patterns in men, which apparently means I think *all* men. They aren’t helping the single women there at all. It’s like women are just supposed to keep rolling the dice with their vaginas and hoping they’ll get a different result. But so often, *it just doesn’t work*. It’s encouraging to see so many women now say “No to that!” but it hurts to see other women who haven’t gotten the memo that they really don’t have to do this if it’s not working. If they want to and, as one woman put it, have 0 consequences (lucky one she is), fine, but I’ll say the same if you eat McDonalds daily. It’s your right and I won’t shame you and tell you not to do it. *I’ve* done it. I’ve slipped up, from loneliness. But I’m not down with you trying to get other people to do it so you feel validated, and I’m not condoning it either.

It’s hard to know dozens if not more will continue to go there for advice unique to our age group, and will get feedback that does not serve their best interests.

I feel pretty down that there is so little support on Reddit for women to have have romantic relationships with strong foundations, boundaries, and respect.

I say this because I’ve seen women have a hard time understanding how they can have trusting relationships with men without unloading their trauma. To me, this is a codependent behavior because you are expecting an unlicensed person to handle your past traumas responsibly. It also makes the recipient feel like they owe you either the same behavior back or unconditional emotional support. Either way this expectation is harmful and if done at all it should be earned. 

I understand wanting to feel closer to someone by unloading these things but I see it as a get out of jail free card. It’s skipping steps in intimacy and bonding. Just because someone knows all your deepest darkest secrets, doesn’t mean they owe you anything. It also doesn’t mean you can trust them. Wanting to do this to create a false sense of intimacy will just hurt you in the end. This applies to all relationships, but be even more careful with men. 

You don’t need to tell men you’re dating anything. This won’t rob you of any opportunities, trust, or intimacy.

Not many people know about my experiences, and I suppose on the outside I look like a well put together 23-year-old woman -- I'm educated, have a good career, married to a loving man, have a beautiful home with my cute puppy, and I'm fit. The truth is though that everyday is a battle for me.Everyday the memories of what has happened to me haunt me, and some days I can fight them off and just live like a normal, well functioning, productive member of society, but other days, all I want to do is a curl up in a ball and cry. A few times I have seriously considered suicide. 

When I think about what happened to me, I'm filled with rage against the horrible people who have done this to me, the society that says that women are sex objects meant to please men, and even at myself for letting these things happen to me. I was such a weak girl back then, I had very low self-esteem and I was desperate for love and attention. I remember even talking with my friend's friend, and somehow the subject of rape came up. She said that women who were raped/sexually assaulted once, are likely to be raped again. She didn't know that that had happened to me, and she was just saying it very matter-of-factly, like talking about the weather. Sometimes I imagine myself in those situations again, and I think about saying ""FUCK YOU! My body is not public property for you to take!"" and then kicking him in the balls and leaving. I think about how I'm so much more educated now, and even confident I can say, and how these things wouldn't happen to me again. Yet I know that I'm self victim blaming, but that's only because society teaches that when bad things happen to women, it's the woman's fault and she should've known better. 

And this is why I feel so strongly against porn and prostitution (and no, I don't say sex work because prostitution is not work, it's exploitation). To say that these women have the choice to go into the work is just maddening. How can a woman say no when she's naked in front of cameras and tons of clothed men, with her contract being held against her, and her livelihood at stake? I couldn't even forcefully remove myself from when I was being raped, how much more could a woman when on a porn shoot? And I feel so strongly for these women because I know what it is like to be dehumanized, reduced to a set of body parts for a man's pleasure. Once this happens to you, you just start to accept it as your identity. It's a kind of survival mode to protect yourself. I didn't accept that what had happened to me was sexual assault and rape until years later...and I had internalized the message that all I was good for was my body, and so I unconsciously sought after situations in which men would use and abuse me. 

I don't know what this post was for exactly. Maybe just to see if there are other women out there who are like me... silently mourning the violations and abuses against their bodies, remaining silent because people would blame you for what had happened anyway (as some people in my life had done).",97185,How do you deal with the trauma of rape and sexual assault?,0,,,

I felt that building the relationship was more important than my career because I wanted to be a mother to project my maternal needs that wasn't given to me by my mother.

What do you think is my issue here? I am well educated, yet I feel that I am not wise in this regard.

It's like I am doing good in life and career for the sake of finding a good partner, instead of innately feeling good about my achievements. I think this way ingrained to me growing up.  Do well in school and career so you can find a good husband.

Why can't it just be about myself FOR ONCE?
Why can't I claim my achievements and dreams to be solely mine without having a need to show it to guys to gain approval?
Why can't my life just be about me?",97187,Needing Advice.,0,,,

I wanted to add a an addendum to why we shouldn't accept alcohoic drinks dates from *any* man. 

In addition to it being low effort, it makes us incredibly vulnerable to sexual assault.

While on drink dates, my dates would offer me drink after drink. Back in my pick-me days, I mistook this for ""*generosity*"".

Like, ""wow, he's not afraid to buy us a whole bottle?! BALLER!""

In reality, my dates were only on a deliberate campaign to get me black-out drunk.

What's more insidious,  is it happened *everytime*. Even when I had WILLINGLY GIVEN CONSENT.

Let me reiterate....

My dates *wanted me black-out drunk*, even though I had slept with them before and would very likely sleep with them that night.

So, why the excessive drinking? Why were they saying, ""babe, you want another glass?""

Why were they so giddy and impatient to get the bartender/waiter's attention to bring us more drinks?

My dates weren't being ""generous"" or ""ensuring I had a good time"".

They were *grooming me*. 

They wanted me *unconscious*. 

*They wanted to have their way with me.*

This is a recent realization.  So, I hope it helps some women who still struggle to understand, ""what's the harm in drinks dates? At least it's better/more expensive /more effort than coffee!""


Think again. At least with coffee, you'd be sober!  

This practice is quite like how Bill Cosby would *drug* his dates. Even though he already had them in his room. They may have conceeded consent. It wasn't about *consent*. He wanted them *unconscious*.

Consent still implies that the woman is in control.

These LVM/NVM can't stand that!

My background: I'm a newbie and have read the handbook. It's golden. I also follow another Level up Queen (Sheraseven1) on YouTube.

This all happened after a previous sexual assault in high school, childhood physical, emotional, verbal, and sexual abuse by my older sibling, and a 2-year emotionally abusive relationship. I have been in therapy now for about 8 months and have received tremendous help from this, but my mental health is greatly suffering between recognizing all this trauma and the current situation with Covid-19.

It took me 21 years to come to terms with my childhood trauma, and I am currently still discovering the different ways in which these many traumatic events have affected me throughout my life (I am now 22). I had absolutely no idea that my abusive relationships were abusive until I finally ended things with my most recent ex-boyfriend. I am now currently single and plan to stay that way for as long as I can. I also am in college but am taking a break this semester, as I know I am not in a position mentally to take on the workload of school right now. At the same time, I feel like I am doing nothing with my life, and I resent myself a lot for it.

I have the opportunity to work for a really popular music magazine writing articles, but I am falling so far behind in this. I also am in the process of starting a blog, but this too has been pushed to the backburner as my depression symptoms have increasingly worsened no matter what I do. I find myself doing nothing for days on end and hating myself for it, but not knowing how to change things. My therapist has helped me take many maladaptive coping mechanisms and replace them with healthy coping mechanisms, but they don't always seem to work when I need them.

During the quarantine, I've spent a lot of time helping my parents with basic tasks as they are both immunocompromized and have spent a lot of time in the hospital for various reasons, and I am currently living at home. While I've been here, I have organized my childhood room, lost weight, and spent a lot of time trying to work on myself via self-help books and daily meditation, but I just don't feel like I'm doing enough. I tend to constantly start books, exercise regimens, articles, recipes for my blog, etc. but I can never finish anything.

Every mundane task can feel incredibly difficult, but I really want to change my life around and start living the life I want to live. I am tired of letting my long history of abuse control my life, but I don't know how to stop the cycle of depression I am currently in. I have a lot of trouble sleeping, as I am awoken constantly by nightmares, and I feel that this is adding to my demise. I luckily have really great parents and a super strong support system of female friends, but I have a lot of trouble staying motivated to actually do the things I want to do.

If anyone has experience with either of these mental conditions and can lend a sis a hand, that would be greatly appreciated. I am just feeling so lost and could use advice/support.

It’s such a relief. Like the expectation to just fuck someone after 1-3 dates. Bc you “need to know, right?” I’ve never been able to be intimate with someone so quickly; and feel okay about it afterward. I did it when I was younger but even before I found this sub I didn’t want to do it so quickly anymore, if/when I decide to date again. I want to wait months, which I realize is highly unusual these days, but I just need that for it to be enjoyable and right, for me. 

So anyway, that’s just one example of something I was thinking and then one day I somehow magically found FDS. People who say we are men haters or whaaatever, no. If you say that, you’re clearly not a woman or def not one who has been on OLD for even one iota of a second. 

As soon as I got to the sub and became familiar with the values followed in FDS, I stared to realize how many PickMes in my life. They’re everywhere. But it makes me so annoyed how much they don’t even need to be. 

A woman who was saying how she felt lukewarm about her boyfriend, but she’s living in his house, so she didn’t know what to do. He proposed a couple weeks later and she said yes. She’s a success in her career and her family isn’t poor, let’s just say that. 

Another woman who felt she “absolutely had to be a mother” got married and had two kids with a guy she kind of seems to hate. And she said the sex is terrible. *shudder* she’s also a success in her career and they all live in the house she bought for herself before her bad-at-sex husband showed up. 

Another who legit thought we would build a friendship through the trials and tribulations of OLD, and have cocktails once a week where we talked about our feelings and sex lives. There’s much more to me than that. She kept pushing me to get on OLD even though I have expressed clearly it is not for me. Her focus has just always been on finding and keeping a man. It makes me sad. She won’t invest much in her career bc she is too focused on man-finding and doesn’t think her career is long for the world. 

Just a few examples. I was a PickMe until extremely recently. There were definitely stages of me no longer putting up with shit from LVM until I finally said fuck you, we are done and don’t call me. Blocked and deleted. Then was googling about dating and how it sucks so much right now in 2020 (and did even before the pandemic) and found FDS. 

I have had several come to Jesus moments. Had another when I was driving to pick up Chinese tonight: We women are just socialized and conditioned to be insecure and no matter what have a man to fall back on. I see it so often; awesome ladies with duds or guys that make them feel the same level of excitement as when they see their postman/postwoman every day. And I mean like, yes, you want the stability of a good postman or postwoman but I should hope if you gonna marry somebody they look daaayuuuum good in their Postal Service uniform 😂😂 and you wanna jump their bones! It should be like that. 

Side note, then there are the entirely clueless: Another who is in a messy divorce and getting into a messy relationship after it. Another who is getting married and having kids bc that’s what her parents want her to do. 

I just don’t get it. You are great, ladies. Why be with men or in situations that make you unhappy? You only get one life, why let society or anyone tell you that you can’t make decisions, so you default to others? 

Am I in crazy town here, my FDS ladies? Finding truly positive female friends is so fucking hard.",97095,Had a thought today: Society conditions women to be insecure.,0,,,

He opened with ""Nice connecting with you on here!,"" implying that we knew each other. I was thinking he was an old client whose name I had forgotten, so I asked if I could help him with anything. He says ""No, just wanted to connect and learn more about each other. Tell me about yourself."" 

I was already suspicious at that point and should have just stopped responding then, but I naively thought I could gently make it clear I wasn't interested in socializing. I answered, ""There's really nothing to tell, haha. I'm pretty boring."" 

He responds back with ""Why do you think so? 😞""

I'm not going to say anything else to him. But I'm very annoyed by even this short interaction. I feel like this was a lame attempt at flirting. I can't see why else he would contact a random woman he doesn't know, and it wouldn't be the first time this has happened to me on LinkedIn. Even if he just wants a buddy to talk to, it is so inappropriate to contact a service provider on LinkedIn to waste their time and exploit their need to maintain a polite, professional image so that you can have a captive audience to talk at. 

I hate ignoring people, and I hate being blunt and short. But I've learned that sometimes that's the only way to get the message across. And most (albeit not all) of the people who have forced me to be blunt and rude were men. I know this interaction wasn't much, but it honestly gave me flashbacks to other times I had to go against my preferred polite way of dealing with people to cut someone off because that was all they would understand. I had one male employer in particular it reminds me of. I was trying to quit because the pay was garbage and he was taking up my time talking to me about personal stuff. I say ""trying"" because he would not accept what I was saying. He just kept talking at me, explaining why I couldn't quit blah blah blah. I finally just walked away from him while he was still talking. It was literally the only thing I could do, but I still felt so bad about it. 

I've graduated from feeling bad about cutting off clueless, inconsiderate people to being annoyed with them for forcing me to be rude. But good lord is it still annoying. 

Do any of you ladies have stories about times you were forced to be super blunt to get the point across? I understand ignore/block/delete is the best approach in the virtual world, but in face-to-face interactions I feel like it's tougher. I've gotten more comfortable just offering an icy stare if someone says something inappropriate and just announcing ""I have to go,"" if someone is really being a tool. But this goes so much against how I want to be treating people and the struggle is real. ",97526,Cutting Off Audacious Individuals (Online &amp; IRL),0,,,

I got this idea from menwritingwomen and some male-dominated communities of media I consume who often push their popular, often ridiculous opinions as the rational opinions, PLUS the uptick in media that often have punished men who are healed by forgiving and patient women.

By media I mean any TV show, movie, book, video game, social media personalities, music, etc. anything along those lines. Basically entertainment, the fictional realm.

Basically, I'm wondering what kinds of media, what specific things a man could like or dislike that would either make you be alarmed or be reassured. A lot of our fictional interests are reflective of our real life opinions after all, we are all biased viewers of media. 

Personally, and I might go into a rant here, but when a man claims to hate female characters in media for no specific reason or for being ""bitchy"" or ""annoying"" that is a big red flag for me which I really first noticed with my father getting annoyed at Skylar in Breaking Bad. This is typically a criticism because a female character is not helping the main male character out or is being ""difficult"" or in the example, isn't being the perfect wife or mother they want. Breaking Bad I will go into depth with below. Since it's so popular men would've probably seen at least one at some point, it is extremely critically acclaimed after all.

Hating Skylar for being flawed while subconsciously supporting and rooting for Walter (plus the plethora of defenses that he was only doing what he did for the family AND the TONS of Walter White merch and t-shirts) is hilariously missing the point. Skylar is &gt;!trapped in a marriage through Walter's manipulation when he refuses her pleas for a divorce. She has no reason to stay loyal to Walter and her cheating isn't bad when you realize this, instead the whole Ted plot is her trying to make Walter not want to be married to her anymore so she finally has an out. All of her actions while sometimes impulsive are understandable given the circumstances, she is shown time and again that Walter isn't anyone she knows anymore and he is 100% capable of killing her as he already did to many others. Walter also gets sexually violent, attempting to forcibly kiss his boss when he still had his teaching job and iirc there was another scene with him trying to assault Skylar though I'm unsure? Goes to show you how much is swept under the rug for ReLaTaBlE male characters that are monstrous to us.!&lt;

I'm not saying Skylar is a perfect character considering one of her first scenes is so blatantly menwritingwomen that you can't help but laugh at how hard the writers are trying to make you hate her since all the men hate her, &gt;!with her failing to please her husband on his birthday with a lackluster handjob. Furthermore, if the roles were switched with a woman having a double life and her husband being in the dark, I severely doubt Breaking Bad would be as successful as it is because these men cannot relate to a woman who is human with flaws and a dark side. Which is to say ALL WOMEN.!&lt;

Sure, a man could say he hates a character/thing for another reason, but there's patterns in a LVM's and a HVM's line of thinking, even through these fictional works that don't necessarily impact the real world from a glance. As you can see with Skylar, although I acknowledge there are reasons why I don't consider her a great character, it is ludicrous to dislike her for her actions when literally anybody else wouldn't have went along with Walter's &gt;!abuse like a good little housewife and bangmaid.!&lt; The pattern in LVM is that they do not like strong women who have their own conflicts and opinions.

I personally think a man's opinions on fiction IS reflective of their own beliefs and should be paid attention to. What examples do you think of when you think of HVM and LVM opinions of media or perhaps some striking HVM or LVM characters? I'd like to hear especially if there are really striking HVM examples because pop culture nowadays is INFESTED with LVM-relatable male main characters screwing their whole families and lives up without cares in the world with woe-is-me attitudes and even some incel/redpill beliefs. To a degree that I think that it's getting tiring having to read a reckless and frankly unrelatable male character blatantly never think about the consequences of his actions on the people around him. 

Let me know what kinds of examples you've noticed and especially which media to look out for that have some good HVM to look up to. I've been meaning to read some more books so those would be nice too.",97525,Red/Green Flag Opinions in Liked Media,0,,,

I’m 25 years old, 26 early next year.

I was wearing travel clothes. Black Leggings, athletic zip up (tight, like a runner’s zip up.) shoes match the jacket. No makeup.

Conversation flowing, turns out he’s 35.

This ALWAYS HAPPENS TO ME. 

Literally every single guy who approaches me is in his mid 30’s. Without fail. 

I haven’t had a man in his 20’s approach me in YEARS.

I don’t look like I’m in my mid 30’s. I look my age, I think. I carry myself with confidence, I prefer my independence... is that it? They see a confident independent woman?

**Here’s some backstory for y’all before I get to the juicy part.**

Summers 2016/17, I lived in Italy. I met this gorgeous fellow there, and he spoke no English. I spoke enough Italian to get by, yet he refused to speak to me in person beyond simple pleasantries, hi, how are you, I’m well, thanks. (I was a horrible pickmeisha back in the day) and would try to push the conversation farther, but he wouldn’t oblige, yet he added me on Facebook and would text me. Even in conversations in groups of other people, he refused to address me directly, always needing a middle man to translate. He would give people messages to tell me, and I would respond in Italian directly to him, and he would respond through a middle man. It was annoying as hell, and when I would ask him why via text, he would just say he didn’t speak English. 

Eventually, we ended up hooking up, and even in that encounter, he verbally communicated as minimally as possible, using mostly hand gestures. (Come here, yes, no, stop, etc.) It was mediocre at best, and definitely not my finest moment. (Like I said, major pickmeisha.)

That was three years ago. 

He continued to text me periodically, even though I hardly responded, and when I did, he would ask for nudes and that’s all. (I kept him unblocked because he’s hot and I wanted to have his pics to show off the hot guy I met in Italy. Stupid. I know. Not that girl anymore!)

*** ***juicy part*** ***

Today, he messaged me again, and I decided to finally shut it down. It’s been a while since his last “hi”, and I’m in a feisty mood today. So, I responded. 

Conversation was normal at first, pleasantries, he asked if my boyfriend and I had broken up, we did. I knew where this was going. He then started talking about how he thinks of me all the time. (It’s been three years since I’ve seen him, and I haven’t been back to Europe in that time.) He starts reminiscing about that night, and once again, asking me for nudes. Repeatedly. Specifically.

Finally, I say to him, “either I was quite memorable, or you really don’t get laid very often.”  (Forgive me if any of this next part is written awkwardly, I’m translating from italian.)

He says, “what do you think?”

Me: “I think you don’t get laid very often!” 

Him: “I get laid plenty. Anyways, send me pictures, I want to imagine it.”

Me: “After three years? And a world away? Isn’t it more fun to have a girl who lives closer? Who you can actually play with?”

Him: “certainly. But send me pics.”

Me: “what’s the point? I can’t touch you! My arms are too short! Just like your dick.”

Him: “what did you say???”

Me: “You are pathetic and desperate.  I live thousands of miles away, haven't been to Europe in years and you are the last person I would visit if I went there.  You never talked to me when I was there, and all you have to tell me when you text me is disgusting crap about fucking me.  At least to me, you are nothing but physicality and you have no personality to back it up.  You're the last person I'm interested in fucking, so hold on to the memory of that half-assed blowjob three years ago.  It is the last memory you will have of me. Lose my number.”

Him: “wow I didn’t realize you were such a bitch! Bye.”

Me: *block*

Said all the right things, paid for everything, pursued me relentlessly, knew exactly what to do. Long story short: we became exclusive and after I emotionally invested he dropped me because he said he didn’t have time for a relationship because he needed to focus on his law school to pass the bar exam in July. He told me he would like to be my “friend” until then and then once he was established he wanted to give us another shot. Initially I obliged (I know ...) because of the shock to my self esteem and pain of being played. 

But after reading FDS I finally gained the strength to tell him to fuck off and block him. I am proud of myself because I was really into this guy I never felt chemistry like anyone like that on a personal level in my life. I’m not going to lie it stings like hell but I have no time for time wasters.

Last week he had taken us out to eat, and he paid for all of us. Later, I told him I would not eat with him unless he paid, he said “You’ll never find a guy better than me,” bc he was angry he had to pay for me 🤣

Let’s discuss:

* When a man says this to you, he believes you’re trash. He literally thinks you are not capable of getting another “catch” like him and that he’s doing you a favor. 

* I told my ex that he’s “forgettable” and there are so many men that were better than him. They never cursed at me, never made me pay for things and treated me gently. To which he responded that I was only interested in “material” which I told him couldn’t be true, because he never bought me anything of value. 

* I also let him know he’s really no different from the scummy men I’ve dated. Even us being married isn’t a big deal, I plan on getting married again so he’ll just be a random husband lol.

* also let him know that I’ll be blocking him from my social media bc I have no interest in his life. I explained in 9 more years, I will no longer need to speak with him because our children will be grown.

You see ladies, this is why being nice to toxic people never works in the long run. They cannot release their toxic ways and believe they own you🙄 They cannot see that you dumped them and have moved on. I don’t stalk him, I don’t ask about his life. Yet somehow he thinks he’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. 

* LADIES. You are the best thing that’s happened to you. Did y’all break generational curses by getting getting a degree/not being toxic/wealth accrual/etc? That was YOU. Can you afford your own place? That was YOU. Bills get paid? That’s was YOU (or your HVM😃) . Children taken care of? That’s YOU. Savings? That’s YOU. 

These toxic men love to bring women down. And they never stop lol, they could be working on themselves but nah, they rather try to run you down. Just laugh ladies.

No more. Early red flags that in the past you would've made a pass for, should now be seen as an escalation to leave immediately.

Why? **Because everytime you make an excuse for his behavior, even for the what seems like the littlest things, you're giving him the okiedoke to continue disrespecting you.**

When I opened my eyes to the game, I was in disbelief that LVM intentionally go out their way to pushing your boundaries. They want your self esteem kept in pickme mode so they can continue to get away with more and more and drain the life out of you, while you put up with the abuse to stay for the kids. Couple's therapy initiated by the woman is a scam.

**Have your bags packed and ready to go at all times and all stages.** Find that domestic shelter to stay at, a girlfriend's couch, a car--anything. Fear of temporarily hurting from breaking a trauma bond will save you a world of heartache by continuing to break up and make up.

When he first calls you a name, raises his voice at you, ignores you for video games, consistently doesn't clean up after himself or does a complete 180 on you, you gotta jet.

And I don't care if it's 5, 10, 20 years down the line after what seemed like an eternity of emotional investment, bare minimum marital bliss and commitment with 2 kids and a house, you gotta go without hesitation..ASAP.

Writing this to share my story on the past couple months of my dating life. I previously broke it off with a LV ex that came back into my life (way too much to unpack there... the pick me came out strong) a few months back. 

I decided to try out online dating after taking a couple months for myself. What a *mistake*. I was actually going to drive 45 min away to meet up for dinner with this guy who canceled on me 2 hours prior to the date due to “work” and then ghosted me. I had one date with a guy ***going through a divorce*** that was still legally married. And one that continually asked me to “come chill” despite me saying no.

Well y’all. A friend recommended FDS to me and thank you Jesus. I recognized the HVW in me, deleted OLD, took a couple weeks to myself. And now I have a man taking me out to nice dinners, mini golf, axe throwing, etc. I will still be vetting heavily, but no red flags thus far.

I think it’s a mix of perceived class differences as well as misogyny. They respect the male detailers, but the few women constantly were solicited for sex (explicitly) and treated like free prostitutes in comparison to the sales women and service ladies (despite us making the same).

They are momma's boys, never had to cook/clean because their mothers and sisters do it for them before they get married and after marriage they get transferred to another poor woman who has to look after this man child. They are not good at romance either, because their entire idea of romance is from bollywood and other regional film industries which is CRINGE level 1000. They aren't the most attractive either because they don't take care of themselves (hygiene and grooming). Every single one of them is misogynistic and have issues with boundaries. They aren't generous in bed either because their only exposure to sex is porn and they can be quite perverted. They aren't good fathers because their only definition of fatherhood is earning money for the family (lol) which women are doing too nowadays, so if they want children, what do they even bring to the table? They won't help take care of kids. 

This is exactly why arranged marriage is such a strict practice in desi cultures, because they *know* that if this system wasn't there, most of them would never get to touch a woman and would never pass on their shitty genes. To be honest, I want desi women to resist marriage (unless they find a hvm, which is highly rare) and not have kids. Marriage is a horrible deal for us, because if not for your husband, your in laws will torture you.

- We see each other when we want and do effort to enjoy time together more than 1 time a year.
- All expenses together are splitted 50/50.
- Sex is something we can do if we want it. As you know I love sex, it's part of the fun for me. 
- We see for good time and no stress.
- No lie, no hidden stuff, just simplicity.

I will contact consulate to get you entry for maximum 3 months. To to be clystal clear, when we are not together, we could be allowed to do anything we want with other people ? Could we send text daily as I love your support and you know me better than anyone in my life. end so on ...”

I was really excited and requested Monday and Tuesday off. I assumed he was going to plan something fun for us to do. I really thought he was going to propose, as we have talked about wanting to get married, have kids someday, etc. We don’t do a lot because of COVID, but we do like to go hiking and camping. We both love the outdoors and it’s a low risk activity. Now that the weekend is almost upon us, I realize that he has absolutely nothing planned. Oh, and he gave me my 1 year anniversary present early. It’s a $60 leaf blower. I have mentioned that I hate sweeping my patio. So it was nice that he listened to me and got me something that I wanted and needed. But I’m still just so disappointed. At this point I feel like maybe I’m being breadcrumbed. He’s told me before that as soon as he has the extra cash, he will buy me a ring. He’s been working extra side jobs &amp; I know hes got a lot saved up right now. Did he buy me a ring? No. He got me a damn leaf blower. And I mean how hard is it to book us a camping spot to go camping this weekend? Not hard at all. He really doesn’t put much effort into our relationship. He’s really kind, supportive, and we have a lot of chemistry but I’m just so disappointed. I find it hard to draw that line of “I expect more” without coming off as a entitled.

""This idea that if a man chases you that means he wants you, is a myth. A male’s lust for your pussy has nothing to do with you as a person. We as men don’t see personality at first, we see a vagina. Men only stop seeing you as vagina, when you clearly demonstrate that he can’t get away with the same bullshit that typical girls let him get away with. That’s the problem with most women, they say they’re different but rarely show their difference. You don’t challenge men, you roll over. You don’t want to risk pushing him away with questions that gage his motives or tests that prove whether he’s been paying attention during those conversations or just nodding along. Guys like the one above, know that women compromise their value in order to earn “she’s cool” approval. Those women on his Team are there because none of them had the balls to say, “No, I’m not coming over, here’s where you can take me tho.” They are on his team because they think, “Let me show him I’m down to earth and not demanding.” Men love running through women that don’t expect shit but pizza and a 2-liter, but they don’t keep them! Remember, guys aren’t looking to reset their body counts at the end of the year like women, the goal is to raise it! Do you really think because he Facetimes you and acts as if he misses you that his dick isn’t for every semi-cute girl? Dudes aren’t out here saving dick for marriage, these dudes are for everybody! All the time you spend texting and talking, you can’t figure that out? Because you’re not trying to figure him out, you’re trying to fit in so he continues to like you.""

I 100% understand and agree with that.

I have gotten more and more into radical feminism and FDS and have realized that I have been a 100% pick-me for my entire life.

My currently bf has been my bf for 8 years. We started dating at 20 and I am 29 now.

He was the epitome of LVM--jealous, insecure, drunk--I would say that he was, at one point, without a doubt abusive. (drunken rages, punching holes in doors, screaming/berating embarrassing me in front of friends etc)

I try to have nuance. We have broken up and gotten back together multiple times, we have been ""solidly"" together for a year now.

I won't list all of the ways I am not perfect, I know I am not, but I also know I did not deserve the abuse I received in the past.

However, as I first started blossoming into radical feminism, I laid ground rules and set up boundaries that I will NOT allow him to cross and he has respected those.

He hasn't drank in about a year. He is in weekly therapy. He pays the mortgage, and is supportive of me finding myself/changing careers etc and also very adamant that he wants me to be independent and not rely on him--yet still provides financially for about 75% of our living expenses. I only buy groceries and household items as well as furniture, and even that he contributes to.

He does more than his fair share of house-work. He cooks. He cleans. 

There are still things to work on, namely his sarcasm and what I feel is still lacking in emotional intimacy and connections. He does not pressure me to have sex at all. He is in a great career. He buys me presents occasionally just because. 

However, I don't know if I can, or even should, get over the past abuse. It was BAD. Like screaming at me at a party for talking to a 16 year old male friend bad, and then punching a door. Driving me drunk and angry and me crying for him to pull over. Him screaming at me nightly, locking his door and going on binges. He pressured me for sex, would get angry when I had panic attacks during sex, a lot of other very seriously damaging things. Most of this had to do with drinking. I was such a stupid ass pick-me that I didn't even consider these things abusive.

He encourages me to have other friends now, healthier outlets. Encourages me to be healthier. Encourages me to have friends of the opposite sex. 

He was a typical ""if I go for someone beneath me they will treat me right,"" and that wasn't true. He was just wildly insecure, damaged, and tried to bring me down to his level. 

If I met him today, I would say he is a HVM. Expensive date nights and surprises, But I cannot get the images of the beginning of our relationship out of my mind. I do believe people can change, and that is awesome, but I do not know if I can get past the change.

I am stuck between terrified to give up someone who has BECOME a good person, vs unable to get over the bitterness, anger, and sadness at the way he treated me 5+ years ago now that I have gotten out of the fog and seen the abuse for what it was. 

Be blunt if you need to, it's probably what I need to hear.",98189,Please bear with me--can a LVM ever turn into a HVM?,0,,,

However, I made so many pick me mistakes- got intimate too fast and settled for low effort dates (first restaurant date, we literally sat in his car as he googled options as I was all dolled up). He also did not want to be exclusive yet despite me telling him I wanted that...he even told me he kept his dating apps up for masturbation material (I broke up with him, then took him back). I was a LOST pick me. After a bad fight in which he yelled at me for not being enthused enough during sex, I walked out the bedroom, and he walked out of my life...and left the country to travel and got stuck overseas bc covid. We spoke only once since the breakup (he called me) and I realized he was full of shit and I never followed up like I said I would when I got off the phone.

Today he texted me and said he is coming back to our city (he has not returned to the country since our breakup). He asked how I am and told me what he has been up to. I want to ignore him.  Is this FDS approved? I figure he doesn’t deserve my words or an explanation for why I don’t want to communicate.

And these are the lyrics:

  
Verse 1:  
I can go off if I want to  
I can show off if I want to  
**I don’t have to want you to love every part of myself**  
**Got my confidence with no help**  


Bridge:  
**I don’t need no one else to see I’m the baddest in this B, yes**  
**Mind, body, soul is on fleek, yes**  
See the beauty in the way I look and think, yes  
I’m the light, now watch me shine bright  
Celebrate elements that keep my mind right  
**That’s right, I’m my own hero**  
Calling me a dumbo, what’s a dumb to zero  
Im a full psycher, **you know you can’t wife her**  
**These days a fuckboy is hard to decipher**  


Chorus:  
**Oh, self love is all I need**  
**I found my inner peace**  
**I see the pain decrease**  
**When I focus on me, me**  
**Me, me, me, me**  
**Me, me**  
**Me, me, me, me**  


Verse 2:  
I can arch my back to backbend  
You can pay me back on the back end  
Cuz you know a queen stretchin'  
And I get it from my mama, no past tense, follows, secrets  
Shine the light down low and if they have us fucked up, we some ferals  


Bridge:  
**My mama taught me to believe I’m the baddest in this B, yes**  
**Mind, body, soul is on fleek yes**  
Look at the beauty in the way that I look and think, yes  
I’m the light, that shines in the night  
Celebrate the elements that keep my binds tight  
**That’s right, I’m my own hero**  
**I got the vision, read you like a tarot**  
I’m high baking, too heat for my teachers  
You see the power, the power of reading  


Chorus:  
**Self love is all we need**  
**To find our inner peace**  
**I see the pain decrease**  
**When I focus on me**  
**Me, me, me, me**  
**Me, me**  
**When I focus on me**  
**Me, me, me, me**  


Verse 3:  
I can be selfish  
Most of the time I be selfless  
I can’t help myself I know that imma be helpless  
Always make the same mistakes  
I break, I break  
And if love is what you make it  
**I have the tendency to give too many fucks**  
**Gravitate to n\*gga’s rolling up**  
**Lift them up to the home but**  
**This life I’m building on my own, throne**  
**It’s your right to love yourself**  
You have to recognise  
Be about the prayer, do the exercise  
Baby get fly  
**Be the apple of your eye**

To specify, according to Walster, Walster, Piliavin, and Schmidt (1973), individuals often find a relationship partner most desirable when that person is attainable to them (but not to anyone else). This notion was supported by findings from Jonason and Li (2003) as well. The team's third study looked at the effect of different behavior strategies on desirability as a date, sexual partner, and relationship partner. Participants were asked to rate their interest based on scenarios of potential partners who were described as either very easy to get (low availability); very hard to get (high availability); or in between (medium availability). ***The results showed that both men and women preferred very easy to get partners for short-term*** [***sex***](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sex)***, but preferred partners who had medium availability (selective) for dates and relationships.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus, sometimes **the most appealing romantic strategy is to be selective and discriminating**. While this is also a type of scarcity, it is operating in a different way. Unlike playing hard-to-get, which is limiting the supply of your time and attention overall, being selective makes a relationship with you a special and unique opportunity for someone specific instead. As other [persuasion](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/persuasion) research has shown, however, [such a scarce and unique opportunity can be very appealing](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/persuasion-bias-and-choice/201812/4-ways-use-scarcity-persuade-and-influence) too—especially for that particular person (Burger &amp; Caldwell, 2011).

Oh, look at that, real studies that support FDS and not some word salad pseudo science men made up from their asses. Be unapologetically selective and discriminating by having a strong standard and boundaries, it's what makes you desirable as a long term partner. Lowering your standard, settling for less, having no boundaries, being agreeable and so easily available, being *the cool girl/pickme* basically, puts you in a short term sex or fuck buddy zone. Don't be that woman.",94900,Study shows both men and women prefer someone who is not so easily available (medium) for long term relationship.

Okay so I was talking to my friend (we'll call her sally) and the discussion was about a personal situation of mine where I left a toxic platform because my work was because disrespected and I was having mental health problems because of exploitation I faced. 

My arguement was like ""I will not put my time/energy into people who will not respect the value of it. I won't take abuse, harassment, exploitation and bullying just because people enjoy my work. If I'm not having a quality experience, I don't want it. I will not let people overstep my boundaries so they can use me."" 

Sally argued that I should learn to tolerate it because I could otherwise lose potential opportunties by quitting. That I should ""ignore"" people who disrespect me and continue providing them my work if it means that one day I could maybe get a good offer for it. 

Then I said ""That's like choosing to stay in an abusive relationship just because MAYBE they will propose one day. If my standards aren't being met now, I won't expect shit to change later."" 

I used an example of how her dad has never married her mom in 25+ years but has four kids with her. He ruined her credit, and they live in a ghetto neighborhood in a small apartment with cockroach investation. He cheated on her and has a kid with another woman. I even once told Sallys mom that she deserves better and she replied with a heavy sigh with ""I know."" Sally knows her dad is a NVM and so does her mom, so I asked - why does your mom stay with a man like that? 

Sally said that its trauma bonding and that having kids with them makes it more difficult to leave (which is obviously true) but is that really an excuse to stay?

My dad abused and cheated on my mom with three different women and is verbally/mentally abusive. He literally forced her out the hospital a day after a c-section from my birth JUST SO she could cook for his gathering he planned for work. He let his other daughters (half siblings) hit my mom back in the day. I've been telling my mom since I was ten years old that my dad is trash and it wasn't until a few years ago that it finally clicked in her head and her pickmeisha ways dissapeared. 

My brothers ex-wife was also incredibly abusive to him and me as a child. They have children together but he luckily divorced her after 9 years of being warned by people to leave her (including his MIL) 

So I don't know why Sally makes soooo many excused for her mom not leaving her dad. Sally is a pickme herself and she has a LVM boyfriend of 7+ years. Sallys mom works in mental health so she has resources to get help and help her daughters get out of that household and into a better life. I don't know too much about trauma bonding so if anyone has experiences with this, please explain. It really is hard for me to watch women stay in relationships like this when they have an opportunity to get out. 

There are some countries where women getting abused don't even have that, and their lives are in danger for trying to leave their husbands, which is circumstantial reasons. But if you have the freedom to leave- why don't you?",95917,Trying to understand trauma bonding and why don't women don't leave when abused.,0,,,

YOU HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE.** 

Yesterday I went on my first date after FDS. After reading the FDS bible, I picked different guys. Any guys who were suggestive or asked me to go to inappropriate dates (drink, coffee shop etc) I rejected and moved on. I've carefully selected a few appropriate guys who suggested nice dates and I met one of them yesterday. 

So he picked a posh restaurant to go to, opened doors for me and picked up the bill without even so much as a suggestion of anything otherwise. This was the kind of restaurant where they don't even put the bill in the middle of the table, they put in in front of the man. 

As we were at this venue for a couple of hours, I watched other couples on first dates. One couple came in after us and were seated next to our table. It was a well dressed man in his 30s, handsome and tall and a shorter, curvaceous woman in clothing too casual for the venue. I heard during their conversation he asked her if her photos on her dating profile were recent (suggesting that she doesn't look like her photos). Their conversation didn't flow all too well and their date was short. The bill came and the waiter placed it in front of the guy. The guy paid it, while the girl made it clear that is what she expected as she didn't even acknowledge the bill when it came. She commanded respect through out the date. And he treated her respectfully and gentlemanly regardless, through out the date (except for the inappropriate comment earlier of course). 

While I dont agree with her presentation, I loved her confidence and expectations of the man. Old me (pickmesha me) would have felt apologetic for the fact I wasn't what he expected, apologetic that I hadn't dressed up appropriately for the venue. I would have paid halves for the date, to make up for wasting his time and I'd have felt so rubbish and small after. 

New FDS me, realises that is nonsense. He pays for the dates as he asked you out and its what is customary/normal/expected regardless of the circumstances. Men love to make us feel like we deserve less for whatever excuse they like to make. And if you let them - there will always be excuses (with LVM/NVM of course). 

FDS has taught me that regardless of the circumstances, you must always expect to be treated with respect and never accept a thing less.

None of the clubs or bars that I was looking forward to attending as a ~single lady~ are open yet, and apparently they won’t be until the new year. So the forecast is bleak — even the noisy, smelly outdoor dining will soon go away because it’ll be too cold to sit outside.

I guess I will just wait for all that stuff to reopen 😔 But am I wrong for worrying about wasting my best years? I will soon turn 25.

I say HVM because he did exhibit all the outward green flags for one:

\- Educated, owns his own house, well paying job, knowledgeable/intelligent, meticulously groomed, several hobbies/interests that keep him busy and are sources of passion for him, extremely respectful of my boundaries, listened intently to everything I had to say with lots of questions to show he was engaged in the conversation, always set aside time to devote to texting me with his full attention, no back and forth mind games, (he has always made it very clear he's interested but has never brought up ""heading to my place"" or pushing anything sexual) Just overall an independent, generous, and honest ""good guy""

Well. Last week he asked me out on a virtual date wherein he offered to show me around his house (via Zoom) for the first time as well as do dinner + movie. The majority of our dating has been online up until this point due to COVID precautions and we live in a state where everything under the sun is closed anyway, so I said cool, I'll see you Saturday night. 

It gets to the day of and I don't hear from him. I text him twice with no response. On the weekends he typically responds back lightning quick, so this is definitely abnormal. I started to revert back into pickme territory (sorry FDS!) by doing hair and makeup and waiting by the computer. Ugh. 

At 7 PM he texts. ""I'm sorry but I've been with my family all day golfing."" Okie. Would have been nice to know beforehand. Can we go ahead and start our date? No, because he needs to shower and nap and clean up. Okie. At this point FDS energy is flowing back through my veins and I point blank tell him to hurry up, I'm waiting.

At 9:30. ""I've woken up from my nap. Rushing to go shower and still need to tidy up and shave. Hope I have enough time for everything since you don't want me to take too long."" Uh, yeah, I don't. Because our date was scheduled for hours ago. I'm basically over it at this point and have gone to do schoolwork. Pre-FDS me would have handheld him and patted his forehead crooning ""Don't worry bb, take all the time you need!"" Ugh.

10. I text him that I'm calling it a night, I'm tired and haven't been sleeping well. He texts back ""okay well since tonight is apparently no longer an option, I guess we'll have to do tomorrow. You didn't even give me time to set up my Zoom account!""

So you're telling me that you were the one who called this date and, even if you \*were\* out golfing with your family the majority of the day, you didn't bother to do any cleaning, grooming, or basic prep in preparation for seeing me and just thought it would be completely fine to ask me to wait on the hook until 11 to see you?! You couldn't even devote 20 minutes of your completely free morning to setting up your account? You left \*everything\* last minute because it's preferable to scramble around than get in from your golfing tournament and sit down to the date you planned?

No.

He continues to text, ""This entire ordeal was very unpleasant for me."" I test the waters by telling him I'll see him tomorrow and good night. He pouts for a bit and says ""I could have just kept napping. Thanks a lot.""

See the pattern of how all of these activities are ones you’d say to a friend? 

Men use this language when they see you as a potential FWB, and to keep things easy going/no pressure. This way they can rationalize that you guys were just having fun, and it was nothing too serious. 

However, when a man plans an “official date” he is expressing romantic interest by taking action. Formal dates are a demonstration of romantic intentions, and that they’re dating with purpose. 

Note: Beware of “Are you asking ME on a date?” 

This is mainly a passive or manipulative approach to get you to pursue him. Even if he jokingly says it, and you still end up in a long term relationship, these are the men that act like they’re doing you a favor. (Ex. The guys who confess after 10 years of marriage and 2 kids that they were never really attracted to you in the first place). 

Think back to all of the times you took the initiative with a man by either pursuing him (or making it easier for him to pursue you). Now compare that to experiences when a man made a genuine effort to court you. Men will always take what they can get, but only respect what they earn. 

That’s why we have the “date” standard, and anything less is a waste of time.",95902,Guys avoid the “date” word to avoid accountability for their intentions. Pay attention to these clues.,0,,,

Your SO hit you and it was the first time ever, I don’t want you to ask how to make sure it never happens again, I want you to state how you will make sure it never happens again by leaving him and calling the cops on his ass. Your husband is cheating on you/cheated on you and said it would never happen again and you have kids, I don’t want to see you asking how to make the marriage work, I want to see you asking for legal advice on how to make sure he pays and how you will be able to keep your kids. 

Let me clarify, I feel terrible for everyone that is a victim of any of these (plus more terrible things that people do) and I completely understand that when you’re in a situation and at that very moment you can’t think straight or you’re blinded by “love” (I’ve been there) or you’re financially dependent or you’re somehow “obligated” to stay. But I truly wish that I see more of people taking back their lives and not asking others for advice on “how to make it work” when there is clearly something severely fucked up about the situation.",95887,Why do people post questions/ask for advice on relationships that are clearly red flags?,0,,,

“Remain committed to the light at the end of the tunnel.”

We can easily become bitter or jaded because of our past experiences with men. Memes and trash talking are funny and even healing, because it feels good to have support that we are not alone in our experiences. But we must remain in a healthy and non-scarcity minded mindset. There is no woman “too old” for love. You’re not expired goods because you have children. You’re not “on sale” because you aren’t pretty enough, don’t have blonde/curly/red/brown hair, curvy, skinny...whatever!!!

You count. And if you are looking for love, please remain open hearted. Be smart, of course, but be open hearted. There is a person out there for you. Remain light hearted and figure out other aspects of your life, work on your character, and don’t have a scarcity mindset. Practice being stoic in the face of adversity or scumbags. Indifference always hurts more than shit talking. “It is what it is.” 🤷🏽‍♀️ Because it is! Why bother with one scumbag, when there are millions of people in the world? 🌎 The art of stoicism and not being triggered AND not being scarcity minded is a deadly combination. 

Happy Sunday everyone❤️",95880,Remain committed to the light at the end of the tunnel,0,,,

In the past could go long stretches of being single but I was never truly comfortable. In the back of my head, I would always be pining for a man because having a boyfriend meant feeling fulfilled. In hindisght, I have slight codependency issues I'm still working on so I was not happy with myself being by myself though I kept telling myself being single was making me happy. And in a lot ways it definitely did but I still couldn't shake the feeling of wanting a relationship).

Because of this I experienced very little growth because when I did eventually enter a relationship again I settled for a LVM man because he treated my slightly better than the last one.

Even though I'm 29 and would ideally love to start a family with a great father/husband, I do not want to settle again. Ever. I'm trying not to have a scarcity mindset but my standards are way too high now so I want to learn to be satisfied with where I'm at now just in case it never happens. 

* getting a weighted blanket
* getting a self warming bathtub (you can set it a head of time to start heating up whenever you want it)
* full body pregnancy pillow (they make you feel like you're being spooned)
* monthly massages (for oxytocin)
* getting a Baci by Lora DiCarlo (a sex toy that apparently has a 'real mouth feel' 👀 )
* adopting a British shorthair cat
*  trying to make more girlfriends (if my introverted ass ever wants to leave the house)
* mentoring/volunteering (will help with my strong need to nuture others)

I’m not proud of much of this since I was NOT listening to FDS rules for about 99% of the time🤦🏻‍♀️

But I did it. I told him I couldn’t do this anymore. He was a guy I hooked up on vacation in cambodia who I never expected to see again. But then when covid got serious and the hostels closed before I could get a flight out, he let me stay with him for 2 weeks. It was fun, we had a great time, I never expected to talk to him again. 

Then when I got back to the USA and he got back to the UK he reached out. We started talking as friends, nothing more. Then snap chatting. Then facetiming almost every day. Then planning for him to come and visit. Then planning a classic American roadtrip together because it was his dream. More talking. More FaceTimes. Daily conversation. He was kind, sweet, called when I was sad to make sure I was okay. Was there when a friend attempted suicide and I didn’t know who else to call. He became someone I leaned on. 

And then I realized that I had feelings. Strong feelings. I was imagining a relationship with this guy. I wanted more with him. I mean, we were fully becoming each other’s support system and confidante. And I couldn’t keep it in anymore so I told him. He told me he didn’t feel that same way, but that he wanted to be friends still. And I said no. I can’t. 

I cut off contact today. I feel lost and sad and lonely. I’ve cried a lot. But I also know that I did the right thing. That I was hurting myself by trying to keep my feelings in and be just a “friend” to him. That the friendship was no longer something I could handle. And I feel proud of that.

About my last LVM “relationship”.....
Yesterday after scrolling through FDS I found a post where a woman made a collage of her ex’s repulsive behaviors. I was missing my summer man and decided to make one too. Holy hell it was therapeutic! I sent it to a few close girlfriends who all thought it was fantastic/hilarious. One asked me about a particular image of a woman bundled up and freezing cold indoors.
I spent my summer freezing my ass off in this mans house. I told him many times how cold and uncomfortable I was and he never did a thing about it. Especially overnight....I would wear a tank top, t shirt, sweatpants and sweatshirt in the middle of damn summer to sleep and was still cold. He didn’t care and I ended up having to use his dog’s blanket every night.
Why did I overlook this before? What the actual fuck? I was so embarrassed when sharing this with my friend.",95866,Recovering pickmere here with short story,0,,,

So many ridiculously good things have happened to me in my life in the last two months since I kicked him out of my house at midnight. First of all, I have had peace in my life like I have never known before! I sleep like I’m dead at night. ALL my anxiety is GONE, as if a magic wand has been waved. In my brand new job, I just made the biggest sale of the entire year for my company (over $200K!) which the company president called me into his office for recognition and gratitude. I literally look 5 years younger- I remember seeing a photo of myself in the spring when my stress and tension was at it’s highest, and I was *shocked* at how tired and how much older my face looked. Literally 3 days after I kicked him out, I saw my reflection in the mirror one morning and I started to laugh, because I was *glowing*. I just joined a gym. I’m redecorating my home- something that was put on hold for the last two years because there was discussion about moving. 

Here’s how a sis at a car dealership helped nail a narcissist cheater.

He had been looking to buy a new SUV, and had narrowed it down to a model, colour and features. His days off from work were always spent with me, he never had two off in a row, so we made the most of them. Occasionally, on a day off he’d have to do errands or whatever, totally normal, but with the car shopping I was beginning to be tired about hearing about X vs Y, and this feature over that one. The evening before his day off, he mentioned before bed that the next day he was going to go to a certain dealership to see a car he found online, as it was a good price and he wanted to test drive it. I said sure, and was happy for him.

In the morning he left to go do that after breakfast, and honestly, it was like any other day. He kissed me goodbye, and off he went. I sat down on the couch, and read the news on my tablet, and drank coffee. Out of the blue, and I still cannot explain where the thought popped into my head, I found myself wondering if he really went to test drive anything. It as so odd. But before I knew what I was doing, I looked at the dealership’s website, put in the car make and model, to see what came up. There was no car at all in their four dealerships that met the criteria he wanted.

I thought about it for a few minutes, and decided to call. I figured it was possible that perhaps there could be an error on the website for year or feature, and it was better to get all my ducks in a row. The receptionist answered, and I asked if it was possible that they had inventory at any of their four dealerships that were not online. She said no, they list everything. I asked her if she could confirm if they had anything at any of the dealerships that was the specific SUV I knew he wanted to buy. She looked the criteria up. Nothing. The only car that was remotely similar did NOT have a sunroof, and this was a feature that absolutely he insisted upon.

I could tell she was a bit confused, so I laid it on the line. I said, “Look. This is a funny situation, but we are both women, and between you and me, I think my boyfriend is lying to me. He’s told me he is off today test driving this specific car at your dealership, and clearly he is not. Is there ANY way there could be a mistake about inventory?”

Sis said wait a minute- I have an idea. To book ANY test drive no matter where he is, we have to enter all his details in our system. Give me his name, and I’m going to look it up for you. Nobody is going to let him test drive anything unless it’s registered in our system.”

So I gave her his details, she put me on hold, and I calmly waited. She came back on the phone and said, “ I’m sorry to tell you we have no information for him. He was never here, and there is 100% no car meeting the criteria you were told.” I thanked her- woman to woman, and hung up.

After the fake “test drive”, he was going to work. So I waited till I knew he was there, and I called him. I played stupid, and asked him how was the test drive? He said it was great, the car was better than he thought it would be. I played dumb again, “oh, and it was black like you wanted, right?” Yes, he said. Good condition, mileage was listed as in the ad he saw, model year was ideal. Did you make it on time for work? Traffic must have been bad- which location did you go to, sweetie? He stammered a bit and just said “their dealership on the highway. I said oh, which highway? The 95 or the 25? He paused, and I joked, you mean you don’t remember the highway? Then I just moved on with more chatter to keep him talking, clueless. “And did it have the sunroof you wanted?” Yes! It even had the wonderful sunroof! I said it must have been fun taking it on the highway with the sunroof open on such a nice day, how did it drive with a bit of speed? I let him talk on and on about all of the very nice details. 

I stopped talking. Fucking caught, the fucker.

Then I said perfectly calm, “You are lying. You never went on a test drive. The dealership has NO CAR that fits the description you just gave me.”

Immediately he began to argue with me. What are you talking about, yes I did, of course I did, he was completely incredulous.

“No you didn’t, and you are a liar. I looked up the model on their website. They have NOTHING in any of the dealership locations that fits what you just told me. Not only that, I called. They have no record of you in their system for ever booking a test drive, and without that and signing off, you won’t be allowed to even touch the keys to a car on their lot.”

He was stunned speechless for a moment, then started up again! Yes he DID go for the test drive, exactly the car he said! Why would the lady at the dealership lie to me? Wait a minute, work is getting busy, he has to go, HE’LL HAVE SOMEONE AT THE DEALERSHIP CALL ME BACK TO CORRECT THE ‘MIX UP’.

I should have been angry, but it felt like I was in a sitcom at that point. It was amazing. How the LYING was just going on and on, even when faced with irrefutable evidence from a perfect stranger. I said, so you are going to ask one of your work colleagues to call me, pretending they are at the car dealership now? Are you serious? Do you know how STUPID you sound? Just admit it. Admit that you are lying!

Then of course, the argument goalposts changed, and he started getting ‘scrote DARVO mad’ because I had the audacity to not “believe” him and I looked up his fake car and phoned the dealership. I said, “So let me get this straight- you are angry at ME because YOU are a liar, and were caught lying?” I think what upset him was that I was laughing now, because it was all so pathetic and insultingly stupid.

It was the hugest wake up call of my life. There was other crap that went on in this relationship, some seriously abusive stuff. I consider myself a highly intelligent, capable, and strong woman, and yet this man had me snowed. I knew NOTHING about narcissism, knew intellectually about the cycles of abuse, but standing in the forest I could not see the trees. I didn’t link what was happening TO ME with what I had heard happens to victims of abuse: the disconnect was wild.

To celebrate my two month freedom, I am putting every card, love letter, momento this human garbage gave me into my BBQ on Tuesday evening, and I’m lighting it all on fire with a martini in my hand. It feels amazing to have my life back. I still cannot believe I kissed the same mouth that lied to me with such happiness, such effortlessness. I find it simply incredible that the lack of remorse is so... real and present, it’s pathological.",95865,LIARS CLUB: Isn’t it incredible how easy they lie?

The boy was maybe four years old. The mother's friend starts undressing and the boy makes a remark like ""eww, you can't show that!!!"" ""Is that how you're going to work out?"" ""You need to wear a bra!"" 




Neither woman stopped him, they patiently said ""yes I am just changing wait up"". I was fuming at hearing this! The woman then changes into a sports bra, and the boy says ""you're not going like that are you?"". He's visibly offended and disgusted. He also made a comment about her tummy. The woman's friend only said ""I'm going to put on a shirt don't worry.""




The women then paid the boy no mind but I was so irritated that I said ""that boy needs some lessons in feminism"" and the women meekly assented but in a shrug, boys will by boys type of way. The boy could barely speak in full sentences but he could comment on his mother's friend's looks that way? Aaaaaah!!!! It starts so early you guys. 




I do think this will grow up in a society that is more vocally against these attitudes (as I'm seeing guys who are now 18 tend to have much healthier attitudes already).. just upsetting that these women let a little boy walk over them, and probably taught them this in the first place.",95855,Misogyny is learned behavior,0,,,

So for the past one month, I've been talking to a guy from OKC that I thought seemed like a dream. He took me out, paid for everything, we had great chemistry, and seemed to want the same things from life. His only request was to ""take things slow"", which to I agreed. I started noticing about 2 weeks into us talking that communication had dropped off substantially between dates but I just thought he was just busy or something and held out hope. I became so attached to him that I could barely focus on schoolwork and was extremely anxious the days he never texted me between dates. I even made the mistake of texting first on some occasions after 3-4 days have passed of no communication because I wanted to know so badly that he was still there, and he was, but not fully. 

I became fed up with this lack of communication and at the back of my mind knew the reason (he's not that into me) but just didn't want to accept it. I felt like he was my only hope of finding someone I thought I clicked with and also found attractive and have also never been in a relationship (I'm a 20F) so I felt desperate for things to work. I just wanted to know how it felt to be loved and adored. 

So, I told him to call me tonight and we had a chat about the lack of communication. He said he knew we weren't talking as much and that he should talk to me more throughout the week. Should, not wanted to. He said he just ""didn't know what he wanted"" and was afraid due to his past hurts. I told him that I don't want to be with someone who isn't sure about me and then he asked what I wanted to do. I said I wish him well but we need to go our separate ways. There was no fight from his end to try and make things work, he just let me go so easily. From this, I knew that he never really truly liked me in the first place. 

I'm pretty hurt right now and though I know we were seeing each other for only one month, my brain just got so attached to him. I'm never putting myself through this hell ever again. I don't care if a guy says he likes me in the beginning, takes me out or gives me the whole damn world. I won't believe any of that until I see effort being made over a very very long period of time. I believed he was a good guy but if I hadn't had that conversation with him, he would have strung me along for God knows how long. Due to my lack of dating experience, If I hadn't been on this sub, I wouldn't have even known what was going on and been strung along for ages.     

I'm not going to let this get me down though and am grateful for this experience. I'm taking this as a sign I need to focus on myself, love myself more, become truly happy being single and never ever ever ever ever (did I say ever?) get attached to these guys until they show consistently over a very long period of time that they are worthy of those precious emotions. 

If you guys have any big sister encouragement, I would be glad to hear it to help keep me in a positive mindstate. &lt;3",101143,Kicked him to the curb,0,,,

I dated an actuary who worked in the health insurance industry for almost two years. Everything seemed great but when his salary started to grow exponentially, he became more and more selfish. Even though he was making 4X more than me, he started to request that I pay for something so that it shows I'm contributing to the relationship. At the time, he was a recent university graduate while I was still in university. I specifically recall him saying that he would ""never date another actuary because it would turn into career competition at home."" A year later I discussed with him what he said but he replied back ""I never said that."" Through his body language and comments, I started to see classism in him. He tried to tell me that I ""should eat salad with a salad fork"" even though there were no salad forks in the restaurant. When I would ask him for financial or career advice, he acted so clueless. 

Now that I realize it, he probably was not being 100% truthful to me. Most businesses offer retirement investment packages after 6 months, and given that he worked in health insurance, he probably had excellent benefits. Our second year dating anniversary was coming up and he started talking about prenups and divorce. He saw the negatives of marriage as a potential non-investment. He is immensely successful career wise and he will be set for life by the time he turns 28. When I was sick at home, he never offered to help me feel better but when his cats had behavioral challenges, he brought them to the vet ASAP. He always claimed that he couldn't move the relationship to ""the next level"" because of my parents but he had no problem sleeping with me on a daily basis. He showed ZERO interest in wanting to live with me.

This is just a heads up to all my ladies out there: Actuaries may have the lowest rates of divorce but there are always scrotes. My intuition was telling me that if I were homeless and begging on the streets, he would act like he never knew me. Now, I am cautious of overly successful men because they will spend most of their lives on their career to only realize too late that nobody will want to have a family with a raisin.",101143,LVM Actuary in Health Insurance Industry,0,,,

**Men are you:**   


* Tired of: going on dates that cost you like \~ €300,- per month?
* Tired of: swiping every girl to the right in the hope to get a match?
* Tired of: talking to every girl in the hope to get a date?
* Tired of: going on dates every week?
* Tired of: getting rejected?  


Well all the solutions can be easily solved! It will save you energy! it will save you time! it will save you money! AND THE SOLUTION IS FREE!  


FILTER YOUR LIKES AND THAN DATES.   


We all know that you want a girl that is beautiful, smart, caring etc, but why do you want to find it out on the first date when you can find it out by texting them or calling them? Don't spend time, money and effort in trying to date 5 girls a month! Why would you go out every time when you can sit at home, relax and take time to look at profiles that you really like and do other stuff that you like?  


Stop swiping everyone to the right! That is like shooting a gun every second in the hope to get one good shot. Don't waste your ammunition! Be smart and selective! Don't pay for the unlimited like option! Why waste that money when you can buy a good beer with it?   


So now you have started to swipe only the girls you like, you say to me: ''But voice of the internet, now I get less matches!'' Yes you get less matches, but come on, were any of those matches you got any really good? You started talking to a girl you didn't had 100% intrest in, and she noticed that, so she moved on. Now it is time to move on for you too for a prize you really want and deserve!  


Now you don't waste time to swipe every girl on the right, you save energy and time. You don't get depressed by all your matches deleting you, and you don't have to take part in these boring messages any more. Also less matches means less rejections ;) And now you don't have to go on a date every Sunday. Now you don't have to miss any sports!   


Now the next tip is: The matches you do get, don't ask them for a date in the first 2 weeks! You hardly know this girl! ''But voice of the internet! I want to know her better!'' Well dear person, talk to her on the phone than! Call her! Text her! Maybe you find out after a few phone calls or text that she maybe hates your favorite sports team! and who wants to date someone that hates your favorite sports team?!   


So now you don't need to pay for dating apps anymore which saves you money, you also learned to not take every girl on a date which also saves your time, energy and money. All that you can better invest in this girl that has been talking to you for weeks. That supports you, laughs with you and cries with you. You have a good feeling with this girl and you both talk with each other on the same level. You really want have a great first date with her right? So why spend €50,- on every date with lot of different girls, when you can spend it on this truly amazing girl that really likes you? Wouldn't it be worth it to spend even €100,- on a date with maybe your future wife?   


SO AWESOME FUTURE HVM! Why waste all this energy in multiple low effort dates that result in nothing? Why keep trying a way that doesn't work? Why keep fishing with a bait that doesn't attract good fish? Follow all this advice and you will feel better, have more energy, feel less depressed, have more money and more time! Don't waste anything for yourself or someone else! Think about yourself and your future GF/Wife! Do you want to keep going on horrible dates that make you mentally worse and ruin your future? NO I DIDN'T THINK SO! YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF A GREAT LIFE! WHY KEEP TRYING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND EXPECT DIFFERENT RESULTS?",101133,Men/male lurkers I have the solution for your bad dates!,0,,,

I wanted to share with you all some more characteristics of a man that is LV / NV. I haven't seen these addressed recently so here goes

-acts like he's gonna plan a date and you agree on the time, place and day. Then he hits you up last minute to ask you something like ""do you know what the parking situation is like?"" ""Do they take cash?"" ""What time do they close?"" ""Do we need reservations"" its not your job to do his homework for him. These are things he should have looked into himself rather than asking you. 


-taking you out and not being prepared. Ie you go on a trip or even to dinner and theres a toll gate or you have to pay for parking and they only accept cash. LV are never prepared and turn to you to pay.


-complaining / making comments after he takes you out like ""you didn't even eat your food"" or ""that place was really expensive"" or even him looking at the bill and saying something like ouch or yikes. If he asks you to get the tip its rude and lv.


-treating you like a personal basket. This is when you go places or ride shotgun with him and you'll see in further into the dating process when he gets more comfortable. lvs think you're their personal basket to hold / carry their stuff. He will start constantly asking you hold this, carry this, take this. A HV will put stuff in his car securely and get it away so you dont have to carry it. He will want you to be comfortable. Out and about he should carry his own stuff and he can get a backpack or even a bag. hv offer to carry YOUR bags and stuff, not the other way around.


-watching you struggle. This piggyback off the previous. But lv and NV will see that you are having a hard time lifting something or that maybe its icy outside and you're scared to walk on the ice or slipping on it. Rather than even offering to help you or take your hand, they'll just watch and some have the audacity to whine ""come on!"" Or ""its not that bad!"" I had an lv laugh at me for a solid 5 min in target as my short self couldn't reach the the jam I wanted off the top shelf and it was towards the back. He was tall and could have easily grabbed it but laughed as I struggled. A guy was shopping with his wife in their 50s saw my struggle and came over to grab it for me. All he said is ""is this what you wanted?"" To make sure. 

-knowing you dislike a certain type of music or activity and putting it on / suggesting it relentlessly anyways. Ex knew I hated camping and country music yet would always put it on and always suggested camping as a date then said i was close minded when id keep telling him i loathed it and wasn't interested.


-not taking care of his pets. If you go over to his house pay attention to if his pets have clean beds, full and clean bowls, etc. If he has cats are the litter boxes generally clean or are the chock full of poop? Is there litter all outside the box? Is there food all over the floor near the food bowls? Is there dander/ fur all over or does he keep the pet mess under control and vacuumed? One of the easiest ways to see if he is LV is to see his place and see how he treats his pets if he has any. They can pretend being hv but pets are giveaways. Always use the bathroom at his place in the beginning see if its clean. I personally think its a red flag if he has a small apartment and tries cramming multiple cats or dogs in it. One is enough in a small apartment. 


-is he constantly doing ""favors"" for others at his own expense, to the point that hes complaining or hurting him? My lv ex who was broke was always giving people rides, loaning his stuff even his car to others. He was broke yet was shelling out cash to loan to his buddies. These people never paid him back or helped him when he needed favors. They took advantage and yet he wouldn't stop helping.


-job hopping. Its a red flag he could be job hopping if his hours are constantly changing, irregular, or hes going in for shifts and then coming home a lot because he wasn't scheduled. More red flags if he keeps staying late or leaving early. 


-if you're dating a while and he doesn't want to meet your family and friends when you invite him to. Also if he hasn't asked you to meet his family or friends. If you do meet them do you feel welcome there? Do you feel like they like you? Are his friends lv or hv? They will reflect on what he is. Having a bad or lukewarm feeling after meeting friend/fam 2x or more is a red flag trust your gut. 


-his attitude to his exes. Does he bring them up? Does he trash talk them? Does he compare you to an ex? Run. 

-If you watch tv or Netflix does he put on his shows or something hes halfway through? Its rude if you're sitting there. Watch something together, not one of his shows you dont even know what's going on. 


-video gamers and anime lovers are off limits to me. All the ones I've met or dated are addicted lvm bums. 

-female friends. If he has female friends and especially if they hangout. Either way RUN. also if hes talking to an ex RUN. 

-he should be genuinely interested in your job, hobbies, etc and support them. NVM  will say they support you going to the gym and getting stronger but then be trying to get you to eat junk foods or even bringing them to you or guiltily you. Some sick NVMs actually try to fatten the girl up so then they can negg her and she will feel so lousy about herself that she stays with him. Beware. 

-guys that order for you or generally speak for you, early sign of manipulation. More lvm signs if he suggests / tells you how to dress or do your hair/makeup. Does he call your feet ugly or say you have sausagw fingers? Nope. Don't bother with him, run instead.

Yes a HVM will make effort when it comes to dates. But in my opinion, high value is mistaken for high profile. A man should have integrity and things going for him. But here is where things get confusing - I think the biggest thing that separates REAL high value from knock off high value is WHAT YOUR DATE SAYS/ DOESNT SAY! 

I’ve noticed a trend in my negative dating experiences over the years. These ‘isolated incidents’, were actually red flags that flew under my radar. 

I’ll provide examples

1)Passive aggressive comments 

Asked a dude what kind of shoes he wore during the winter, he answered and then said “what about you? ugGs?” insert sarcasm and a snear) I’m white, so he was essentially calling me a basic bitch. 

2) Teasing 

I have large almond shaped eyes, I ALWAYS get complimented on them. I think they’re totally in proportion to my features. One guy called me “crazy eyes” and tried to play it off like a joke.

3) Discredit your achievements or hard work  

Told a guy I was graduating nursing school, his response was to say “how are you going to find a job? There are thousands of people graduating too” 
I was like ????? Seriously???? OR, when I told same guy nursing school was hard he said “medicine is way harder, we learn so much more than you at a faster pace” like cool it’s not a competition 👍🏻 my favourite one was “so you wipe ass for a living” meanwhile, dude was a pothead who drove a fork lift. 

4) misogynistic or sexist comments 

Was wearing a shorter jean skirt because it was hot outside, my date remarked “ah going outside half naked I see” .... any comment about your body or clothing that isn’t obviously positive.... is negative!!! They are being intentionally vague, so you doubt yourself. 

5) Double standards 

When I casually expressed I was into dudes who were slightly older than me he said “oh daddy issues” .. meanwhile this guy admitted he dates women a decade older than himself. Somehow this was ok because he’s a man I guess??? Either way, he obviously thought he could get a pass for doing whatever he pleases  meanwhile other people are messed up for having their own reasonable preferences. They are conceited and stuck up. 

6) Any person who claims everyone but themselves is crazy 

This speaks for itself, if a person bitches about every one of their dates, or calls them “crazy” and “clingy” they are definitely the problem. 

7) People who ask the same question a million times, or those who tell you a story but the minor details always change 

They either don’t care enough to listen, or have an elaborate imagination/ are profuse liars. Believe me, if someone is a decent person they don’t casually forget a huge detail about you. And they also don’t forget details about themselves/ experiences they’ve had.

8) Arrogance and Self-Importance

Some people are too into themselves. They will make comments about their own appearances that come across as narcissistic. Or, they will always claim they’re so busy or receive so much attention from the opposite gender. Confidence is good, but some people take it too far. These people usually think they’re better than most and will let you know in one way or another.

9) **They have nothing positive to say,  or never compliment you**

Why? Because they think if they haven’t done anything overly disrespectful, you won’t notice. In reality, as the saying goes, “if you have nothing nice to say, you shouldn’t say it at all” 
Ain’t that the truth. They’re getting sneaky these days. 

Follow your intuition. All of the people who made these comments were DUDS. Don’t wait until that major incident or red flag occurs.",98663,"LISTEN to what your date says and make note of it- if they say something that doesn’t sit right, follow your intuition!",0,,,

Men unapologetically elaborate on their physical preferences. We've been bombarded our entire lives with hearing men's preferences on how they prefer women to dress, hairstyles, hair texture, makeup, body hair, tattoos, piercings, areola size and color, height, weight, fitness - and the list goes on. It's not a shock to hear men's detailed physical preferences for women, it's utterly mundane and ubiquitous. But for women? Our preferences are less openly discussed, for fear of damaging delicate scrotes' fee-fees. Well FUCK THAT, and no more.

Ladies: I want to hear your likes and dislikes! When it comes to men's appearances, what does it for you and what's an instant turnoff? The more specific the better. Here are some of mine for starters (on mobile, forgive any weird formatting):

Likes: 
- The taller the better. 6 foot plus. I'm above average height and all the men in my family are 6'3"" or taller, it's just what I like. Sorry scrotes - like penis size, height really DOES matter to a lot of women. Short is by no means bad and I'm sure some women like that or are apathetic, but I'm simply not attracted to short men. It's my one physical deal-breaker.
- Strong and sturdy legs. Give me the tree trunks, and spare me the skinny pale chicken legs!!
- Divets/""peen ravine"" muscles. Remember D'Angelo in the classic 90's music video for ""Untitled (How does it feel)""? That's what I'm talking about... and you're welcome for the mental image ;-)
- Broad shoulders. I'm attracted to the classic ""Y"" body shape in men, with wide shoulders and a narrower waist. 
- Strong jaw/chin, but without a chin dimple. I prefer men with fairly strong, angular facial features, but slightly turned off by the ""chin dimple"" some men have (do they get food stuck in that thing?? Lol ew.)
- Healthy, white, reasonably straight teeth. Poor oral hygiene, yellow teeth and snaggle teeth are no-gos for me.
- Full, symmetrical, closely trimmed and well-maintained  beards. 

Dislikes:
- Men who frequently wear baseball caps or hats. You know the type, and you probably know the specific hat because he ALWAYS WEARS IT. In my experience, guys who wear hats daily are some of the most insecure men I've met. I don't think it's a bald thing either, as many of these hat-wearing men have hair underneath... it's like they're using it as a security blanket or something to hide behind. 
- Lack of an actual haircut &amp; style. So many scraggly dudes these days with unkempt hair. 
- Pear-shaped men. For the 90 Day Fiance fans out there, Colt is a good example.
- Excessive back hair.
- Tattoos or piercings. Just not my thing, I prefer a more rugged/classic aesthetic.
- Zero sense of style, no effort put into clothing choices, wears wrinkly clothes, etc.
- Gross feet. No one wants to feel talon toenails or rough, dry dead skin under the covers!",98639,Beyond the peen: what are your physical preferences when it comes to men's appearances?,0,,,

At a point in time, I had just moved to a city with no decent public transport from nyc, where owning a car is extremely unusual. I pretty much took Ubers everywhere in order to get around, and learning to drive was a long process for me. 

In the course of a year I was hit on by Uber drivers over a dozen times, maybe at least once a month. Sometimes they'd just ask me inappropriately personal questions, would ask me for my number, try to flirt, etc. Once a driver passed my destination and wouldn't let me out of the car until I gave him my number. One ran out to open the door to let me out, which I thought was to be kind, but it was to block the door until I would give him a kiss. Drivers would smoke weed with me in the car, would start swerving or driving dangerously if I didn't answer their questions, would raise their voice with me, probe into my personal life, etc. 

I wanted a safe space for women to vent about this, and wrote a post on twox. Immediately I just had responses saying they'd never encountered this, I must have been doing ""something"" because this was highly unusual, and I needed to analyze how I was encouraging these men to HARRASS ME. Like maybe it happened to me with more frequency because it was my primary mode of transport and I was alone for the majority of those rides??? As if creepy Uber drivers didn't exist!!

I've since gotten my license and drive everywhere now, and have a plan for if a ride goes awry if I do need to take one, but honestly fuck that subreddit. They're more than happy to give men the benefit of the doubt and accuse me of what? Attention seeking? Fear mongering? Is it really hard to believe that several men would take advantage of a woman alone in their vehicle, especially before metoo? I was a young girl and did any of them give me safety advice or give a shit about anything other than trying to find out what I ""was doing wrong""? Hell no! 

Thank you for being a supportive and EMPOWERING subreddit for other women.",99926,Gaslit on TwoX about my own experiences with rideshares,0,,,

Nearly half of the men I saw in one day on OLD had some extensive wish to travel. It can be quite a cool dream, but I’m not at the age to let loose of my responsibilities and just travel. I want to focus on my career and save up to getting a home, get married sometime in the future, and be an adult, essentially. Everyone has a different meaning to this word, which is okay, but I would like someone that wants to put down roots and be financially responsible, perhaps with a bit of down time on the side. 

So why do these men expect some girl to just let go and travel with them? If we are talking about a once a year, one or two week long vacation to some different place (and he pays), then hey, I’m down! But after going through this with a guy who was seemingly very intelligent on paper, (phd student and full time research job) but still immature as hell bc he wanted to blow all his savings on his wanderlust/finding himself- i’m swiping left on all these “I love travel” guys.

Do they expect us to give up on all our responsibilities and travel as well? I’m not gonna give up on my dream career or ability to own a cool car or home by spending money on international flights. You want a girl you can be casual with and then just ditch when you move to another country? Do you even have the money to do this?? Like???

Ugh. Have you ladies experienced this recently? these guys in their 20s don’t want commitment and just seem to be running away from their potential issues.

This applies to everyone who uses text messaging or social media, but even more so for the Gen Z'ers on here who basically grew up with phones. So here it goes: 

LV/NVM will **absolutely** try to get you hooked via technology. 

To elaborate: A lot of social predators and f\*ckboys, in general, use social media as their playground. They're trolling women on one app, swiping right on another, all the while texting a few of their real-life supply. If you happen to date one of these guys, they will try to condition you to depend on them emotionally. What do I mean by this? Let me give you some real-life examples: 

* LV/NVM (especially the narcissists) know how to manipulate women. They've probably studied psychology, and they know that if they can get you to associate them with something positive (pictures from Snapchat, good morning messages, shared memes), they can hook you. All they have to do is send you a bunch of nice, thoughtful texts for the first couple of weeks during the love-bombing phase, and soon you're hearing that notification bell and your brain starts thinking of *them,* releasing that dopamine hit and associating the sound with their suffocating attention. It's weird, but our minds are like that. 
* They'll do most of their ""getting to know you"" via phone. They don't call you, or set up a proper date to really talk. Why? Because that would take too much time. They want to hook you (and several other women) as soon as possible. They don't want to go on a dozen first dates and go through the talking conversation over a paid meal every time. *They don't want to invest the energy.* So what better way of circumventing this issue than involving you in a three-hour texting exchange about your childhood? Now you're emotionally invested and he hasn't even left his bed yet. *Next!*
* Many LVM want to accrue social media capital via their follower list. They like having women follow them, especially beautiful, HVW. If they can get you and multiple other women in their social media sphere, it makes it that much easier to engage you in conversation (and, ultimately, a relationship). It's also helpful in compartmentalizing: they have you in real life, and then all of their ""sides"" in their DMs. This type of guy will triangulate you with his female followers, and the hot and cold behavior will get you emotionally addicted. *Block him!!!*
* This one is the worst, but it works so well when you think about it: the little ""read"" or ""opened""  notification that *never*. *gets*. *answered*. Yeah, we've all been there. Isn't it infuriating? Once you're past the obsessive stage, they'll start dropping off the face of the earth every now and again. This serves two purposes: one, it deprives you of that attention they taught you to crave at the beginning with all of the social media attention. Second, it tells you a not-so-subtle message: *I can't even be bothered to reply to you. Aren't you wondering what I'm doing right now? Aren't you starting to question and degrade yourself?* 

And on and on it goes... 

So, how do we deal with these tactics? A few simple steps: 

1. **Set boundaries.** From the moment a guy asks for your number, you must set rules (with him *and* yourself). For example: ""I would prefer that you message me before six pm. I am unavailable after that time,"" or: ""I don't like using Snapchat. I would rather you contact me via text or Facetime me."" If he constantly violates these rules, drop him. He doesn't respect you enough to listen. 
2. **Limit/edit your social media + phone use.** This doesn't mean you have to completely throw your phone away, but do small things like removing Instagram notifications, or putting him on ""mute"" while you work/engage in hobbies/socialize with friends. This way you put the focus back on yourself, and only interact with him when it's convenient for you. *Not* him. You are not a man's emergency hotline; you should not be available at all hours of the day.
3. **Back away from social media lovebombers.** If you've known this guy for twenty-four hours and he's already sending you multiple snaps a day and requesting you on your social media accounts without even talking to you in real life, distance yourself from the relationship. Guys like this jump from one woman to the next. In six to nine months, one of you will be blocked on the other's phone and he'll be spam-liking posts of Instagram models. Trust me on this one. 
4. **Turn off your notification sound for Instagram/Snapchat/DMs.** Prevent your brain from getting addicted to the little ""hits"" of attention. 
5. **The minute he ghosts you, block him.** I don't care if he's a six-foot-four-millionaire-genius. If he's disrespectful or manipulates you via technology... who's to say he won't do it in real life, too? Let that man goooo.

I have begun working through a Bible commentary that covers the Christian Protestant Old Testament (which contains the same contents as the Hebrew Bible) and didn't make it very far before encountering a discussion of ""headship"" in relationships. 

In the book of Genesis, this commentary (written by a man) makes the traditional assertion that because man was created before and independent of woman, that God has given him headship, the position of leader, in their affairs. It even goes on to assert that regarding the Fall of Man and Eve's deception by the serpent that her fault lies in that ""she acted independently of Adam, her head. She should have consulted him instead of usurping his authority."" The commentary continues later on reference and extol the God-ordained ""subordination of the woman to the man"" stemming from Creation, especially in the letters of Paul in which he (is thought to have) wrote that women should not teach or exert authority over men.

These assertions were written as if they were the most natural conclusion one could come to after reading the first chapters of Genesis. In this modern commentary, compiled by a theologian. 

Bullsh\*t. 

Your sister did some background research after reading those lines about headship, because looking at the text itself, I see no subordination or submission there. In the lines previous, man and woman are created as equal counterparts. When God regards Adam, He says, ""It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him"" (2:18). Here the word used for ""helper"" is used about twenty other times within Genesis, often in reference to God as helper to man. Is that an implication of submission? 

Can you believe the audacity of this? Seeing how patriarchal systems and thinking twist religious narratives for their own benefit angers me, especially when considering the women throughout time who have been crushed or suppressed themselves to follow the ""will of God"". The fact that lines like these are used to convince women to stay with abusive partners and submit to their sin is unacceptable and also deeply ingrained in modern Christianity. 

My question for you ladies is this: 

Do you know of any resources, female theologians, or commentaries that consider the original Bible texts and the presence of women? In my research, I came across Elizabeth Cady Stanton's *Women's Bible*, which I had never heard of, but also lacks much scholarly basis. In a field inundated with male theologians espousing beliefs like these without shame and with all the conviction in the world, I want to find a clearer picture. I don't ever want to hear this kind of justification about the ordained submission of women and would like to dismantle claims like these using Scripture.

People can change if they want to change and labeling yourself can be harmful. Just curious about your experience with MBTI and tests like these.)

Dating profiles often include MBTI nowadays. They are either -T (turbulent) or -A (assertive). If someone on their profile states they are -T, stay away. (Example: INTJ-T)

Most people aren’t that deep into it and won’t treat it as more than a silly little horoscope career test. Some people may find it invasive if you ask them to do the test. A lot of people just end up trying to “type” others, (which is not a great idea either.)

If they have a -T, it means they are turbulent, leaning towards being immature, insecure, low self esteem, and generally unhealthy minded. Likely codependent and/or covertly narcissistic.

-A means they are assertive, and generally healthy minded and independent. Regardless of type, -A is pretty good. (Could also mean overconfident asshole who thinks they are the shit or someone who is just generally confident)

I used to be -T and now I am -A, so I know this for myself lol! It’s a huge difference in mindset, and how you view and treat others and yourself.

I would be most wary of INFP/INTJ/INTP/ENTP/ENTJ-T men, unless they are -A most are gonna be -T. They have the “forever alone” reputation.

Though INTP men are going to be more open minded, they are still in the “muh logiCaL minD superIoR to feeLinGs” camp. Check out their Reddit subs.

Mature people of any type can get along with anyone of any type. It’s still just a test and not 100% fool proof or super accurate. Most people will mistype themselves or see themselves as better or worse than they are depending on their ego. It’s hard to be objective with yourself so I wouldn’t take it too seriously.

As for OCEAN test, I see having high O (openness) and C (conscientiousness) as a great trait to have. Translation: they are organized and empathetic/open to new things and perspectives.

If you haven’t done it already, these tests are just another way to get to know yourself and others.",99674,Myers Briggs/OCEAN Test Anyone?,0,,,

A has only slept with one man. She is 23. She slept with him 2 years ago. He is the lowest of low value. She complains he only ever messages her for sex, and often goes several months at a time without speaking to her afterwards. She refutes my advice to block him, saying he’s nice and that I’m being too harsh.

B was in a relationship with my ex, she is 20. She constantly seeks my advice on how to deal with him. He never played me, but he’s playing her heavily. He refuses to be in a relationship with her, but at his every ask she ends up having sex with him in odd places because he still lives with his parents (31 years old, is a retail worker and folds clothes for a living- a position any highschool teenager could do). He got her pregnant and forced her to have an abortion. Ghosted her. 2 months later she’s sleeping with him in his parents house this time. 

I’ve told them both to check out FDS, to block and delete them. 

Neither of them will listen.

I’m getting to my wits end. I’ve been close with both of them for some time, but I am growing tired. I’m tired of them allowing a scrote to abuse them and then allowing them back into their lives. 

Is there anything else I can do? I feel like I’ve leveled up to some extent, but I also feel like these women are dragging me down. I want them to be happy. I truly do. But it feels like engaging with them is sending me backwards. It’s like supporting an addict going back to a drug over and over even though they are hyper aware how bad it is going to end.

I’ve been trying to follow FDS but every so often I falter and look at what my abusive ex is up to.

He would pinch/slap me so he could see how much force it took to leave hand imprints/bruises. He would ignore me constantly, lead me on, told me I would get too big of an ego if he’s nice to me, wouldn’t support my dreams but I was supposed to constantly wait for him, etc. I still have nightmares. 1.5 years later and I still am dealing with side effects while he is so beyond moved on... moving in with women and four months later already with someone new?!

I hate that I check. I’m trying so hard. And I hate more that he acts like a shining boyfriend to these women but I’m left dealing with PTSD.

We saw each other around 3 times a week and talked every day (mistake 1).  I was seeing other guys but this guy and I just clicked. I was able to completely be myself around him. And he paid for everything, took me wherever I wanted, took me to ran errands. We didn’t have sex, he made it clear that sex is reserved for relationships only for him. Fast forward to yesterday, he texts me out of the blue and we’re incompatible and that he doesn’t see a long term relationship with me. I’m absolutely heartbroken. My ego is severely bruised.

I know that this can be really hard for the male lurkers to understand, and probably most of you really can't relate, but many of our subscribers here have far more suitors than we know what to do with.

""inCeL iS a MeNTaLiTy"" they say. ""iT's AbOuT bEiNg AnGrY aNd ReSeNtFuL tOwArDs tHe OpPoSiTe sEx""

Ok, let's unpack that.

So, what are incels so mad about? They are angry that women don't want to date them or have sex with them. They are resentful that women choose to date men who are taller, more attractive, or richer than them. They are angry that women have standards and preferences of our own (""hypergamous""), and they bitterly resent that they do not meet these standards. Moreover, they resent that ""modern women"" are not as submissive and deferential as ""women in the past"". In other words, incels are angry that they are not able to procure the female servitude that they feel entitled to.

In contrast, the women on this subreddit are mostly angry about being lied to, manipulated, used, abused, controlled, and exploited by virtually every man we have encountered, ""chads"" and ""betas"" alike. We are tired of being sexually objectified, we are tired of being deferential, we are tired of being treated like a free therapist/hooker/maid/personal chef by our romantic partners, we are tired of being expected to put men's interests before our own. In other words, we are angry and resentful towards men for acting like they are entitled to our submission and free labor. 

Can you spot the difference? 

It's all about the power dynamic. Men want to stay on top, and women are tired of being stomped all over.

Let me put it this way: imagine you are looking at a labor strike between a group of factory workers and the factory owner. On one side, you have the workers saying ""we want to be fairly compensated! No more unpaid overtime! We want better working conditions!"" etc. and on the other side, you have the factory owners complaining ""unbelievable! Why aren't my ~~slaves~~ employees working!? Get back to work! We're not going to meet our production deadline if you keep sitting around waving signs! What about me!?? If you don't get back to work I'm not going to make as much money!!""

Although the concerns of the factory owner might *feel* totally valid and justified *to him*, in reality they are motivated by a desire to maintain his position of power.

These two perspectives are not ""equally as bad"". These two parties are not ""equally at fault"".

On one side you have legitimate frustrations being voiced, on the other side you have someone who is entitled, greedy, selfish, and refuses to change let alone even *understand* the complaints of the people they are seeking to exploit.

And frankly, I don't really expect the male lurkers to read this and for a lightbulb to go off in their head like ""ohhh I get it now!"" Nope, most likely they will stick to their ""what about meeee?"" attitude, pick apart some minor details of my analogy, and continue on their path of intentionally misunderstanding our POV for their own personal benefit.

This post is really for the ladies. Next time someone else tries to make you feel ashamed or defensive for being angry with men, remember this: **Your feelings are valid. Your anger and resentment is justified. No, you are not overreacting or being irrational. Keep on fighting the good fight. It's high time we overthrow this power dynamic.**",97071,"Women actually have legitimate reasons to be angry and resentful towards men. Most conflict between men and women nowadays boils down to men's desire to control, exploit, and abuse women; and women's desire to not be controlled, exploited, and abused. These two perspectives are not ""equally as bad""",0,,,

Needless to say, I will be finding a new doctor and filing a complaint with the clinic. 

The old me would have given him the benefit of the doubt or even appreciated the gesture. Now I see this as predatory behavior and grooming. I'm thankful that this community has opened my eyes to be able to trust my instincts about men in everyday life. (He had made me uncomfortable one other time, but he didn't say or do anything. It was just a feeling I had. That coupled with him holding my hand told me that he is creeping on me for SURE).

His messaged reached my aunt. And my aunt showed my mom. And then my mom woke me up and showed me (none of them knew about my ex).

He said he just wanted to say happy birthday (sure bucko) and check if I was okay. He said that I was in his prayers. I don't remember the full conversation because he deleted the messages after (it was on insta). He wanted me to talk to him so we can be friends. I told him I didn't want to be friends after how he hurt me.

And im cracking up cause he was like ""Wow. I thought today would be the we finally started talking again after I've been trying to reach you"". Like uhm  no. He said ""I just wanted to let you know you're a good person"". I told him ""I already know im a good person. I may be crazy sometimes. But I know im good"".

What's funny is on the post he made looking for me some dude commented calling me beautiful. My ex was like ""Do you know her? Have you seen her?"". And the dude replied saying no 😂. Like yeah I'm beautiful and you can't havea me bitch. He said he wasn't looking to flirt. Well then why is messaging me when he's still with the girl he cheated on me with? That's just stupid. He kept saying he'll leave me alone but kept talking. He even asked me to call him..

Like wtf, he wouldn't call me when we were actually together so why does he suddenly give a shit about my feelings now? Oh right, because he has an ulterior motive. He doesn't actually care. I'm not stupid and I won't be falling for his games anymore. I would post the only screenshot I got but for some reason it won't let me.

I just wanted to give a big thanks to all the wonderful women here who shared their stories and have inspired me to improve myself. I really wasn't expecting him to come back again. I didn't even think I'd have the strength to turn him away. But I did and I'm proud myself. And I'm proud of all the women in this sub. Thank you all so so much.",97039,"Thank you, fds.
