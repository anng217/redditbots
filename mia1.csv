37,AverageToHot,"&gt;Been dating for a little over a year, but always an open relationship. I‚Äôm 100% ready for commitment and being exclusive, but he has insisted that he‚Äôs not ready and can‚Äôt give me a timeline or what he needs in order to be ready.

Your need is to be in an exclusive, committed relationship and he will never EVER be able to give you that. A man, when he finds his dream girl, would want her off the market ASAP. He wants to lock that girl down instead of risking losing her.

&gt;He‚Äôs on tinder and frequently goes to bars and strip clubs and talks to other girls. Our understanding is that he tells me when he‚Äôs going on dates and especially if he sleeps with them. It‚Äôs been super rough for me, which I have thoroughly communicated to him, but I‚Äôm trying to understand and be patient.

He doesn't give a shit about your feelings. He's okay with seeing you feel hurt and he's okay with being the cause of your pain. Think about that.

&gt;He finally agreed to hear me out tomorrow, though he says I don‚Äôt deserve it because of all of the lies.

Seriously? He's acting like you're the one who's destroyed the whole relationship when it's in fact him. He's inflicted more pain on you than the other way around.

&gt;This guy has seriously been the love of my life and it feels like this would be the stupidest reason to break up, and I‚Äôm honestly scared I won‚Äôt find love again. But I don‚Äôt want to be miserable or scared of him blowing up over me needing more out of a relationship.

No, he's not the love of your life. You just have a low self-esteem and low standards. Him not agreeing to a committed and exclusive relationship? A **legitimate reason to break up.** Him seeing other women and not wanting to only see you? A **legitimate and not a stupid reason to break up.** You've let this man waste one year of your life because you don't have the confidence to find love again. Well, let me tell you. The so-called *relationship* you have with him? It's not love! It's just you being afraid to go out there and actually find REAL love. Because girl, this isn't it.

You needing more out of a relationship isn't being demanding. In fact, your needs are extremely basic -- commitment, feeling loved and secure. He's just not able to meet it. The more time you spend with this dude, the more you spend time in not finding someone who can make you more happy. You're honestly better off being single than dealing with his shitty fucking behavior.

**Here's what I recommend doing:**

1. Break up with him. Go no contact. Delete him from everything. You really don't need him in your life in order to be happy.
2. Read The Rules and Why Men Love Bitches.
3. Go on Tinder dates. Date a lot of new men. This will show you how desirable you still are and give you confidence.
4. Read up on the advice given in this sub. I highly recommend you read the posts I've written on cutting men off, having standards, etc.
5. Expand your social circle and meet friends.

1) never initiate a conversation with a man. He should be doing that in order to woo you, not the other way around.  
2) don't go to a man's house ever unless he's your boyfriend. If he hasn't given you a title yet, don't do it  
3) the man should be the one going to your area. So if he wants to grab dinner with you, he has to choose a place near where you live since that will make it easier for you  
4) stop accepting low effort dates. Only accept dinner dates for first dates so you can really get to know the other person. Plus, you can filter out men who are only half-interested in you since they won't take you out to dinner.

Date is going really well, we have a lot in common, conversation is flowing and I‚Äôm having a great time... until he brings up that I had been annoying him by not texting back ‚Äòfast enough‚Äô and making him feel anxious about it. 

I apologised and explained that during the work day I can‚Äôt have my phone on me (customer service) and that I never meant to make him feel ignored. I told him how happy I was that we were meeting in person, and that I really enjoy face-to-face and phone calls contact after work as that‚Äôs when my free time is. This seems to diffuse the situation and we move on. 

As the date is wrapping up we ask for the bill, so I open my bag and get out my wallet, ready to pay for my food. Unprompted he goes on a rant about how we should pay for our own food separately (yep, that‚Äôs why I have my wallet out already mate) and specifically says ‚Äòwhen you‚Äôve been my girlfriend for six months that‚Äôs when I‚Äôm happy to slap my card down and pay, but it has to be earned‚Äô. Cool, but also, the fuck? 

Go up to the bar and I pay first and then he pays for his part. As we go outside I say I should head off as I have some things do and I‚Äôll chat to him tomorrow. Phone blows up all night and he cracks it when I say again that I have to do some stuff and I‚Äôll talk tomorrow. 

Next few days he gets all sulky and short with me when I talk about some plans I‚Äôm looking forward to. Then finally I raincheck for a date this coming weekend as my employer has gone into administration and I‚Äôm not feeling social as I‚Äôm stressed over my job status. He takes this as an opportunity to say I‚Äôve gone ‚Äòcold and distant‚Äô on him and he doesn‚Äôt know how to read my behaviour.

213,AverageToHot,"Men are the ones who have built entire industries with the goal of manipulating women for sex. The dating advice community for women is built on finding a loving relationship with a man. The more ""extreme"" end (according to what some may think anyway) of that spectrum is finding a loving relationship with a rich man. There lies the difference between men and women. Men try to manipulate women into having sex with them, they want to fuck as many women as they can, while women try to find one person to have a relationship with.

Oh, and also, let's not forget the emotional terror that men cause towards women. I'm a mod of /r/FemaleDatingStrategy and it's appalling how many hateful comments/messages I receive just for having the standard that I want my man to be a provider. Yesterday, I woke up to 30+ comments on one of my older posts (I deleted them now), where men called me a slut, a whore, all kinds of vicious names. I've received messages where men tell me to suck their cock and that I'm nothing but a cum dumpster. Like, women don't go to men's inboxes and become verbally abusive towards them. That may happen, of course, but it rarely does. It's mostly men who verbally abuse women online. 

Men have indeed mastered the art of emotional manipulation through verbal attacks. They invade our sub and tell women to lower their standards and to accept men who are subpar. Like who the fuck are they to dictate what kind of men we should see? Our sub is helping women raise their standards and to not accept anything but good behavior from men, but then we get attacked for daring to not tolerate subpar male behavior. 

The majority of women, in relationships, don't seek to manipulate their man to the man's detriment, but there are plenty of men who use emotional blackmail, who run the ""dread game,"" who lower a woman's confidence, in order to manipulate her into doing what he wants. Don't underestimate men. Yes, there are many clueless men out there, but there are also many cunning men out there. Check out TRP and askTRP. 

Women are overall more caring and more pleasant to be around, just percentage-wise. There are too many aggressive men out there, and that aggression itself is STILL manipulation if done verbally.",1569951602,f24gnwe,t1_f24fdcc,t5_p73kq

311,AverageToHot,"Their counteradvice to our strategy:

&gt;This is all about power. These are pure power plays, is all they are. Don't fall for it. You sense a girl is stringing you along or resisting sex, you next her IMMEDIATELY.  
&gt;  
&gt;So. What do you do?  
&gt;  
&gt;Do something sexual at first meeting. At least, AT LEAST, kiss. No kiss, or she does anything other than enthusiastically return the kiss? Next.  
&gt;  
&gt;And if she returns the kiss, you keep going and you keep escalating. You don't put the brakes on. You make her put the brakes on. You go just as far as she will let you go. If she lets you get all the way to sex at first meeting, then you had best keep going until you get there.  
&gt;  
&gt;2) Always escalate. If she's attracted to you, she expects you to escalate. So do it. If she resists, next.  
&gt;  
&gt;3) Sex by the third date. No exceptions. If she isn't getting naked for you by date 3, next.  
&gt;  
&gt;4) Always be setting up the next date. She resists, cancels too many times? Next.  
&gt;  
&gt;5) No spending money on her before she sleeps with you. Drinks only. No food, no expensive anything.  
&gt;  
&gt;The reason why you take this tack with women is because **they need to have some skin in the game**. If a woman is taking the ""no sex, I'm going to string you along"", she's got no investment and nothing on the line. She will not treat you well. She will believe she can do and say whatever she wants to you, and you just have to take it. And why wouldn't she think this? She's doing and saying whatever she wants to you, and you're taking it now. (and, as you now know, she's fucking someone else on the side and lying to you about it.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Another reason you take this tack with women is because **you take as much power in the relationship as possible.** Relationships are about power. Sorry, but they are. 

This is exactly the kind of men we want to filter out from our list of candidates. I've advocated to not doing drink dates here (they only buy dinner for women they sleep with) and to only have sex once you get commitment (they expect sex by the third date or they bounce). 

&gt;Either you have more power in the relationship, and thus you're both happy; or she has more power and you're both unhappy. That's how it works, and I've never seen it work any other way. So you take most of the power. The more power you cede to a woman in a relationship, the unhappier you both will be. Just how it is.

LOL, this is such a fake cope. Whatever ""happiness"" these moids feel when they take control of the relationship and mistreat the woman with subpar treatment is nothing compared to the happiness they can feel if they're in love with a woman who they would do anything for. The happiest marriages = when the man is more in love with the woman than the other way around. 

Also, seriously? Just because we abstain from sex for a period of time doesn't mean that the man we eventually choose will have a sexless life. In fact, it's the opposite, the more sure we are of the man's affection and love for us, the more sex he will get. 

Women should always have more power in relationships. That's the only way moids can be happy with a woman. A woman who tries hard to gain a moid's affection by assenting to a man's demands (like the ones stated above) will not really be the woman these moids will put on a pedestal, love, and worship. Moids will only be happy if they love the woman more than the woman loves them.",1571689834,f4nip85,t3_dl62ry,t5_xaiot

602,AstridRavenGrae,"I‚Äôm in agreement with you on so many of these points, and I find that the apps are an extension of the trends happening in dating because of the internet age. 

It‚Äôs a case of finding a diamond in the rough, sweeping through dozens of people to find one genuine man who isn‚Äôt caught up in the porn-centric dating view thinking he‚Äôs gods gift to women and we should be chasing and worshipping his dick simply because it exists. 

The internet and dating apps have allowed the very unhinged and depraved access to a wider net of people to manipulate and abuse than ever before. Liberal feminism and the sex positive movement have also told us we‚Äôre all supposed to enjoy and seek out easy sex and hookup culture even though it‚Äôs not in our best interests.  

Calling it ‚Äògambling‚Äô as you did is also a very apt description - it can be a dopamine hit scrolling playing the game of matching, making it easy to forget how cold and meaningless the action is until you get to the stage of actually interacting with someone. 

I‚Äôm anti-dating apps in that I also strongly dislike the way they have replaced in-person dating interactions these days. I use them out of necessity as one of my tools in meeting new people as unfortunately that‚Äôs where the men now are and that‚Äôs largely where they approach women for dating.

I find I need a few dates to feel out the situation and then that flutter or ‚Äòsparks‚Äô starts to build and my interest and excitement grows and grows. This person is a stranger don‚Äôt forget, and attraction can grow over time as you get to know them. 

Tv and media have taught us you must have an earth shattering experience when you meet the right person - but it‚Äôs an expectation that sets you up to be disappointed in real life. First dates can be amazing, or they can be awkward and a bit boring. 

What matters is the intention and the attention of the guy, that he‚Äôs consistently coming towards you with his energy, planning and making the investment in you. Obviously if you‚Äôre not interested in any level then don‚Äôt bother with them and see other people or stay home, but don‚Äôt expect the heavens to open and sing to you on a first date every time. 

However, regards to the other situation with the ex, if they literally bore you to the point of clock watching you have a pretty good barometer of when to ditch them from now on as you have a new boundary.

First off, do you want to be with a man who has a high libido, watches porn a lot, and wants to be poly? Clearly this dude wants to fuck as many women as possible. He's only saying that he wants to be monogamous with you in order to appease you, so he can have his steady supply of sex and female companionship, while he's indulging in porn and possibly looking for new sexual partners.

Secondly, do you seriously want to be with a man who doesn't give a fuck about your feelings? This dude doesn't give a shit about you. He doesn't cherish you. Someone who's madly in love with you won't treat you like this.

""Enjoy your melt down.""""Well u cant eat after your mom says hi to you so I don't care.""

What the fuck. This dude deserves NOTHING more of your time. Dump him because you're honestly better off being single, where you don't have to worry about some crusty porn-addicted dude. Plus, you don't have to be with a dude who doesn't give a shit about your feelings. Love yourself enough to walk the fuck away.

Oh wait, he's your fiance too? Giiiiiiiirl. This isn't the dude you should be marrying. This is the dude that shouldn't be in your life AT ALL.",1573333843,f70y3cm,t3_du1kj3,t5_xaiot

It's also important for women to uphold the ""Would he treat x (a famous model or celebrity) this way?"" If you are his dream girl, he would treat you the way he would treat a VS model or a Hollywood star. That's the kind of treatment that you should expect from the man you're dating. If you don't feel that certainty and excitement from him, he's simply not that into you and you're wasting your time on him. He won't change. It's best to simply play the numbers game by dropping a man who's lukewarm about you and then investing your time and effort on prospecting for other candidates. There *are* men out there who are tall, cute, highly paid who will treat you well. It's best to have an abundance mindset. Women should stop settling, thinking that they can't find the man of their dreams because he's out there, but you won't meet him if you're too busy obsessing over a loser!

Men have no shame whatsoever if they find a woman that they really like. They will push through their shyness, inexperience, shitty romantic experiences, just to ask you out. Nothing will stop a truly interested man from moving the relationship forward. Women really don't have to worry about chasing after men or getting a man interested in them.

He's gaslighting you. He should be acknowledging your feelings and not say that you overreacted. You didn't. Listen to your gut. Believe your feelings more than what other people think. 

&gt;I ask him why would we want to keep in contact (he lives far away) and he said to be friends.

It's an ego boost with him. He wants to reaffirm that he has you on a leash.

&gt;So, I don't want to be friends with him if he's far away, and I certainly don't want a relationship. But I like him, so I unblocked him..... ugh. I like talking to him over the phone, he makes me feel good, but over text it seems like our interest in each other is asymmetric (like I like him more or something). Should I block him again? 

Definitely block him again. He's causing you this much stress. He's not relationship material and he's of no substantial value to you as a friend. A friend won't say that you overreacted and won't neglect your feelings. If you want a friend, go make new ones.

I don't think it sounds weird at all, as I also really don't like to make a forced smile either and I reaaallly hate having my photo taken.

Now, I don't know that I have specific instructions on the 'how' but what I have learned over time is the angles that I best look good with, that generally I look better with a closed-mouth smile, and that the left side of my face is my more attractive side. Other than that I always try to 'smile with my eyes' and I almost make a little laugh to myself as if I'm going to laugh at something really funny to mimic a real smile I would make.

Keep in mind that what we think might not be a pretty photo of ourselves is probably a better photo than we think, due to self esteem and self confidence on our side - but also because 99% of the time we only see ourselves in the mirror, so most photos of ourselves look weird to us.

My goal for my recovery has been to get to a place where I have a mostly neutral relationship with food, and a mostly neutral body image. So I really try not to track calories (as a once devoted user of MyFitnessPal), weigh myself more often than every couple of months, or compare my body to other people‚Äôs bodies, because those things are still really emotionally charged for me and it drags me back into the cycle. Just having tolerance for my own existence and doing the ‚Äúmaintenance work‚Äù of feeding myself, getting sleep, taking showers, etc is enough for me at the moment. Focusing on my creative outlets and recently, exercising a few times a week, have also helped me a lot. My ED made my life revolve around food and now that I‚Äôm somewhat stabilized, I‚Äôm just trying to keep an even keel.

Also I saw people getting crucified as TERFS or conservatives if they challenged trans ideology but I didn't think much of it tbh. I'm more passionate about economic issues but I also lobbied and marched for and championed trans issues as an extension of LGBT issues. 

I started questioning it in my mind when I saw TiMs invading female spaces and making it all about them, even when it had nothing to do with them. It was extremely disillusioning, like we can't have female discussions without them being dominated by TiMs making it about their victimhood, which always had to eclipse womens' experiences. 

Then I discovered GC and radfem and radfem adjacent spaces and it's like the veil has been lifted. I now see it everywhere. TiMs are more important to leftists than women. Full stop. If you challenge it, you're ostracized in leftist communities. Being labeled a TERF means you lose friends, leftist allies, and your community and it's all to protect mens' self-imposed traumas. 

I believe trans people deserve rights and to feel supported.... By trans communities. They can have allies and supporters, but **women's spaces aren't trans spaces**. If they want to engage in the community *as women* (isn't that all they talk about???) that's fine but that isn't the case. They want to control the narratives and language and focus.

The joke is on us because porn teaches you nothing about having sex with a woman. It‚Äôs all fake and performative.

1316,JuddHerpatow,I don't wreck homes. These guys were already actively seeking women OLD. Before me and after me. Having sex with married men doesn't lower my value because I'm not seeking to be valued by these men. I don't respect the idea of marriage.

But most these guys ""love their wives"" but are bored af. From my male friends, chicks are on the prowl too.

Most likely, they will not even think twice about it and continue on with shitty behavior. At least point out their flaws. Nobody improves in  a vacuum. A child doesn't learn how to shit in a toilet by letting them sit in a dirty diaper. It's one sentence. ""I don't send tit pics to strangers."" Then block/ignore.

1439,JuddHerpatow,"From Medline (Please spend your time educating yourself rather than arguing with me):


Once you catch chickenpox, the virus usually stays in your body. You probably will not get chickenpox again, but the virus can cause shingles in adults. A chickenpox vaccine can help prevent most cases of chickenpox, or make it less severe if you do get it.

https://medlineplus.gov/chickenpox.html

AND

Causes

Nerves on the back
Shingles affects the nerves
Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus ‚Äî the same virus that causes chickenpox. Anyone who's had chickenpox may develop shingles. After you recover from chickenpox, the virus can enter your nervous system and lie dormant for years.

Eventually, it may reactivate and travel along nerve pathways to your skin ‚Äî producing shingles. But, not everyone who's had chickenpox will develop shingles.

The reason for shingles is unclear. But it may be due to lowered immunity to infections as you grow older. Shingles is more common in older adults and in people who have weakened immune systems.

Varicella-zoster is part of a group of viruses called herpes viruses, which includes the viruses that cause cold sores and genital herpes. Because of this, shingles is also known as herpes zoster. But the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles is not the same virus responsible for cold sores or genital herpes, a sexually transmitted infection.

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/shingles/symptoms-causes/syc-20353054

Honestly has worked for me, and it's also completely fucked me over. You do you. You're not getting brownie points for thinking you're better for being honest for others, and we won't hold it against you when/if it blows up in your face because, let's be honest, some men just don't fucking deserve our honesty.
2. Then pay for the meal. Pay for all the meals. Show him you are a strong, powerful, protector mommy who has at least $50 in her bank account every week. Let him move in with you and show him what a Queen you are. **If you think it's about money, you're not paying attention.** It's about effort. It's about him demonstrating your worth as someone he is putting forth effort for, that you are of higher value than all the other Pick Mes who are willing to put forth the cash, have sex on the first date, and debase themselves for him like he knows he deserves. You are worth a $50 dinner. You are worth two $50 dinners. Men biologically want to chase, they want to be big strong powerful men, and they want women who know they are worth, again, $50 dinners. Nobody is saying that relationships won't be equal and that you are anti-feminist for letting him pay for you, we're saying let him put forth effort early or he will treat you like someone who isn't worth effort.",1573798655,f7k8u1j,t3_dwmjrk,t5_xaiot

They have to work less for pussy. However IMHO, men under six feet tend do be more accomplished, better personalities, and self aware. Why? Because they had to work harder to be taken seriously. So, you have a bunch of lackluster tall dudes who clean up because women love tall dudes and that leaves me with a hordes of short dudes who are more interesting than the Dramamines up in the nosebleeds. In fact, most men ask me if it's okay that they are 5'10"". And I laugh. Because it's not about the height, it's about the way they make feel.

Let‚Äôs be honest about these non-dating relationships ‚Ä¶ women generally think that if they‚Äôre agreeable to less than dating and they ride it out that it will eventually lead to something more serious, whereas many guys think that if women are agreeable to less than dating that it‚Äôs the shortcut to having sex without the responsibility of a relationship.

Speaking of Domino‚Äôs the first five minutes of my first day consisted of a guy walking in (with sunglasses and a hoodie on a cloudy day) to return a mostly-empty pizza box. On top of this, the pizza was frozen basically as he had it in his fridge for two days. There was bbq sauce on the pizza that apparently he didn‚Äôt ask for... on his bbq pizza.

Your kid is attached and it sounds like it‚Äôs because your partner is a nice dude that has potential to take on a role as step father.

They see it as an opportunity to seize control or power over a person rather than to see eye to eye. It denounces the fight for equality as well as now marginalizes another group. We should be aiming towards toxic men that see women as objects and not be aiming towards being toxic women that use men. They use the excuse that men have done that to us over the years.

I have attempted suicide and hurt myself trying to get rid of the trauma. It‚Äôs horrible. I did all I can by having unsafe sex with multiple partners to being around unsafe people in attempts to stop the pain. 

This rapist is continuing to try because he feels she needs to live up to the expectation he imagined being invited to her house. He is so delusional that he ignored her VOCAL set of boundaries to live out his fantasy with her. He decided that if he kept trying... maybe she has some kink for dominance or that she‚Äôll cave in. If she says some half-assed ‚Äúyes‚Äù, that‚Äôs enough consent. If she continues to refuse to the point he feels his testes are about to be kicked, then he decides to stop. It‚Äôs okay to hurt a girl, but by god it‚Äôs him. Since he didn‚Äôt in his head rape her (though he assaulted her and very much attempted to rape), he thinks he will get away scot-free. This is also because we know that it‚Äôs marginalized that women report their trauma as it‚Äôs pretty much thrown away by the judicial system. It usually turns into some BS ‚Äúhe said, she said‚Äù thing. He‚Äôs going to try and use that. I say she still try to get justice. Heaven knows I wish I had.",1574271532,f85b68r,t1_f853r0p,t5_2qh3p

But I wish I could say this without realizing that if you immediately kicked him out, the assault would‚Äôve been worse. This is probably the grayest trauma I‚Äôve ever seen a woman write on Reddit. If it was the situation I‚Äôd imagine, I‚Äôd immediately have kicked him out or call the police if he didn‚Äôt. He attempted/did assault you. I suggest talking to a therapist or a close friend about this. It may not seem big, but a time will come when the realization of how disturbing and scary this situation actually is appears. I‚Äôd say invest in pepper spray, too.

Some men are not into casual sex and only want sex in a relationship. Many more men want a relationship with a woman but they wouldn't turn down casual sex if the opportunity presents itself to them.

Women often develop their interest in a guy with time and attraction can develop slowly. Men know instantly if they find a woman physically attractive and they pretty quickly figure out if she's ""for sex only"" or ""future wife material"". If a man doesn't need to work for a woman and just falls into his lap, she will most likely end up in the ""good enough for sex"" category or they might end up in a relationship where the man continues to not put in any effort. 

Let's not pretend that men value easy women. They might like them but they don't value them. And women take a much bigger risk if they have sex with a man (pregnancy, a higher likelihood of getting an STD, emotional risks of getting attached, etc), so it makes sense that men need to work more and take more risks.",1572898150,f6jp99g,t1_f6jn9km,t5_2qh1i

It will help the guy have no strings attached sex with you and feel more confident to approach the woman he actually wants. Even if you somehow end up in a relationship, he will most likely take you for granted because he didn't work to get you"". The truth is, men know pretty quickly if they like a woman and if she's worth pursuing. If a man has an actual interest in a woman (beyond just sex) he will approach her first. Even most shy guys will make the first step if they think the girl is worth it.

White porcelain skin is worshipped, as is being thin. You can find some damn good make up and skin care products there, take maximum advantage of them. Also, unbelievably cute clothes. If you can easily fit into their sizes, that would give you a great advantage. 

Other than that, just follow the regular advice for looking good. I do not look like an Asian model but men in Asia found me attractive just as much as men elsewhere. Actually, even more over there since I was ""exotic"", I would get asked out all the time.

It's hard to find a meaningful relationship as a foreign woman there though.

2278,Luckisnot,"I used to think like you when I was your age. I'm still OK with unmarried couples and I consider them just as legitimate.

However, marriage definitely has big advantages. You're considered one economic entity and that helps immensely with a lot of stuff. You become each other's next of kin. You can be on each other's insurance, you can inherit each other, visit each other in the hospital. If you move to another country, good luck if you're not married. Also, you're a team and you're building a future together. Maybe one of you gets laid off and the other one needs to support them for a certain amount of time. Maybe one of you needs to move for a job and the other one is following them. That's pretty risky to do if you're not married. There are countless other examples. If you're in the US, you can also pay less in taxes if you file jointly (most of the time). 

BTW, you're still pretty young and you don't need to worry about getting married within 2-3 years of dating someone, especially if that's not your goal right now.",1573625061,f7dq47h,t3_dvh7qd,t5_xaiot

I found AP 2 a little easier than AP 1. I would take the chem with whichever one you think was easier, if that applies. If you don‚Äôt mind doing a summer class, go for it.

2689,PunnyPrinter,"I posted another reply. I feel ya on the ADN waitlist. I applied and didn‚Äôt get in with a 3.5. I wasn‚Äôt willing to waste another year, so I went the LPN route. Funny thing, if I had just started off going to an LPN program, then LPN-RN, I would‚Äôve been further along in my career, rather than listening to others telling me LPN is waste. That said, there has to be a sense of relief to just go thru an RN program and be done with it all (unless going for BSN).

I like the idea of using the LPN program as a last resort. If you retake your classes and get in, you saved yourself potential headaches.",1573102756,f6rg1ol,t1_f6rc8ku,t5_2vqzl
2690,PunnyPrinter,"I glossed over the fact that you have a local program that will accept your LPN classes. That‚Äôs a plus. Is it an automatic acceptance, or will it be just like other programs where you may possibly be waitlisted? At some of my local bridge programs, you still compete for space with other potential nursing students. Being an LPN doesn‚Äôt give an advantage, but perhaps your college is different.

Are you sure driving 2 hours (is that round trip or each way) is something you‚Äôll want to do close to a year? Nursing school can be incredibly draining, even with just classroom instruction, not to mention clinicals! I went accelerated also, so I‚Äôm very aware of that feeling.

You‚Äôve taken A&amp;P before, so you know what to expect, and that‚Äôs a plus. Even then, I personally would dislike doing those classes at a fast pace. Do you plan to continue on for your BSN?

Getting into a LPN-RN program was smooth for me because I already had my RN pre-reqs completed. Just a warning, going the vocational route will meanat some point you‚Äôll need to take A&amp;P at a public/state college because most RN programs won‚Äôt accept A&amp;P from accelerated voc schools. It‚Äôs why my former classmates are still LPNs, they were under the impression their classes would transfer. 

Taking an accelerated A&amp;P left a bad taste in their mouth (half the class didn‚Äôt make it past A&amp;P) and they refuse to repeat. I did mine prior to the LPN program, so my pre-reqs will be accepted anywhere. Just a thought.",1573096384,f6r8g0b,t3_dsqinw,t5_2vqzl

How many days/weeks did you prepare for it after your classes ended? 

Or did you begin towards the end of the semester?

Men abuse and marry underage girls in other countries because they can. The same thing would happen her if the courts allowed it.

Can it be used appropriately? Of course, basically any time you would also use the word male instead of man. But ""the man and the female spoke"" assigns more personhood to the man, and a clinical dismissal of the ""female"".

You say your not insensitive to people other than you, and yet you dismiss anything they say as a lie. I'm assuming because it doesnt fit with your personal experiences. That is being insensitive.  People like you pushed back hard when women first began being vocal about not enjoying catcalls. And some men insisted that we enjoyed the ""compliment"" of sexual harrassment. 

Their opinion then didnt effect the truth, and your opinion now doesnt either. You can resist and refuse to learn from your fellow human beings, and continue to get downvoted and come off badly in your real life.

I scrutinized her figure. Nice hips, nice breasts, a little tall a 5'8"" but not a deal breaker. Actually, she was beautiful- did she always have that face? Her laugh came robustly from across the room, she was engaged in a vibrant discussion about the sociopolitical climate. She was laughing at her own joke; something about the 08' recession.

She always knew what she was going to say, and why she was saying it. She knew a little bit about everything but somehow managed not to dominate conversations.

Either way though, even a democratic republic is inaccurate,  we still live in an unofficial oligarchy.

As for your last statement, I think we mostly agree on the what, but disagree on the why. Anyone will tell you wealth inequality is a problem, it's just that a loud section of the populous fear inflation more. (Which I think is silly since inflation didnt exactly stop 40 yrs ago when wages stagnated).

What I dont understand is how so many people are capable of blaming the powerless for their problems when it is blatantly obvious who has the power. Sure, I get the concept of the temporarily broke millionaire, but these days so much wealth has accumulated to the top that were talking billions. It's not possible to earn a billion dollars, none of those people can ever hope to earn that much, the people who have it didnt earn it in the first place and that is an effing problem. Those that think they will be upper class someday should realize that they'll never get to the millions if the elite keep doing what they're doing.",1570045445,f27sz13,t1_f27q9zj,t5_37lis

2888,WyvernCharm,"To be honest, I'm not sure I understand where your coming from. I stated we need income equity, which would replace... income inequality. 

Based on your response to me, I'm guessing your assuming that I am proposing a different kind of government or economic system in order to fix the rampant inequity we have today. 

I don't personally think we need to change the basic structure of the system (yet). We don't need to replace anything, we need to de-corrupt it. A democracy is imo a pretty good way to go about things, the problem is when you add money to politics it isn't what it says it is anymore. Functionally, it's an oligarchy. Similarly, I see a lot of benefits to capitalism, but profits over people is a bad way to go. Capitalism can still exist and flourish without sacrificing basic humanity to it. 

As an aside, I do think we need to start priming ourselves to live without capitalism eventually. It's already silly we require certain types of work to be 40 hrs a week when studies show it can be done in 26. If we don't kill ourselves before we hit a post scarcity society, capitalism won't work anymore. We are not a post scarcity society yet though, so I'm still for it.

As for your comments about reflecting on the good stuff... we wouldn't have it better today if the people before hadn't fought for it. If they had subscribed to the same attitude of ""well at least it isn't as bad as X"" we would still be sending children into textile mills and being grateful it wasn't the coal mines. 

Society is supposed to progress, that's what they do. Appreciating what you have is good for you to create dopamine in your own brain. But its personal. I am secure in my base level happiness. But my own ability to control my emotions does nothing to change the fact that our entire society is broken. Telling people it could be worse does nothing to fix the problem or make them feel better. Someone ALWAYS has it worse, and people are coming up with new ways to lower the bar every day.

We have a lot, but we also have lost a lot to. A basic right to privacy being a major example. I see no point to playing comparison games. 
Also, note that I said ""inequity"" I'm not talking about total wealth regardless of allocation. It's the disparity thats the problem.",1570039827,f27jts4,t1_f27bgl0,t5_37lis
2889,WyvernCharm,"Im nbpoc so let me know if I stray out of my lane but, in regards to the initial question...
I can see what your saying about how certain segments perform blackness being limiting.  But I think to fully engage in this conversation we would need to define what you mean by ghetto mentality.  

Some of it is a systemic issue. I lot of what I think you might mean would be solved (imo) by fixing poverty. And also by not fucking tying school funding to property taxes and test scores. 

Some of it could be coming from a desire for clout.  Which can be neccesary for survival, but I think the real issue there is actually coming from the suburbs. Well-off kids wanting to act hard.  Which, to your point may stem from a desire to perform blackness in a way that is expected of them. 

And some of it too is just a perception issue. There is nothing actually wrong with AAVE. You can effectively communicate using that dialect, nothing about it is objectively less smart, if the person using it is intelligent there really is no difference. It's just not ""proper"". But that's an opinion,  not a fact. 

I also want to clarify that I wasnt speaking about black people specifically in my OP. The history of racial division comes directly from the creation of white and black classification, but the rest is an us problem. Divided along racial, sexual, gender, health, political etc etc lines. We would fix most of the ""isms"" by fighting wealth inequity.",1570036148,f27e2ck,t1_f279l5l,t5_37lis
2890,WyvernCharm,"Well said. It doesnt seen that person knows all that much about politics, and especially not what progressive is supposed to mean. Which I guess is understandable, considering how the establishment as co-opted the phrase.

I do hope they take the time now to learn the difference in the two. There is a LOT to hate about the DNC and its corruption, but it's not what most people think. The elite on the left and right aim to fuck us all over, and part of that is framing shit policy as ""progressive"" so people wont demand for things to get better.",1570034183,f27axtq,t1_f26yh4m,t5_37lis
2891,WyvernCharm,"The way I see it, just about every problem in the west (or at least my country) is actually a symptom of income inequity and class warfare. 

In 1676 (US) a rebellion was led that joined together the poor, white and black, indentured servants and slaves alike to fight against a threat. Going against the wishes of the governor. This militia, the rebellion went on to capture Jamestown and burn it to the ground. Bacon died a month later and the Bacond Rebellion died with him.

I want to note that their aim was wholesale slaughter of the Native tribes, which is bad. Genocide is bad. But for the purposes of this discussion, the point is that the wealthy and ruling class saw that the poor could work together to accomplish incredible feats. So they countered. 

They passed laws to raise the status of the poor men, raising their station enough above the slaves that they could feel secure in their superiority. And they created the concepts of black and white we have today, tying blackness to chattel slavery and tying even the poor whites to themselves. 

TLDR: the separation between the races was intentionally created so the wealthy would not have to fear the poor. 

It's all intertwined. That one moment changed the course of history forever. So we can ask these questions, but I doubt we can answer them.

These days the only difference is generations of brainwashing and propaganda. Civics rights advocates have had some success, but conguently the division has been more deeply embedded. I ask you, what would help the most people and be the most effective at doing so? Ending racism or classism? I say classism. I see no appeal in simply becoming slaves together. United and equL in our oppression. I also think, that nothing would end racism more effectively than eradicating the financial instability of those with the most breadcrumbs to lose. Why worry and hate the ""enemy"" that ""takes your jobs"" or benefits from affirmative action if you and your family are themselves secure?

But it is a well laid trap. To end racism we must end the wealth inequity; to take down the elites we must unite first.",1570032629,f2788mh,t3_dc5lmc,t5_37lis

I figured out much later as an adult that it was really just a cultural or spiritual celebration that just so happened to coincide. 

I was lucky to not have been persuaded by the propaganda, and to remember it enough to debunk it. As far as I can tell it's a totally forgotten portion of the news at that time, but who knows how much damage it caused in people's hearts.

Johnson was incensed, ""That. Was. Our. Ride"". Jaw clenched he began making his way back to his remaining companion, knowing he'd have to forgive him quickly if they wanted any hope to survive.

Pretty sure every person has had some less than wonderful moments in their lives. The difference is most people weren't told they were utterly worthless while figuring themselves out. I've talked to a lot of dudes who are really swell people, who have confided in me that they were not always so swell.

Were letting this kids slip through the cracks, and in 5-10 years some percent of them are going to explode and we will blame them, outcast them, and continue to ignore the problem. The adults who are pulling the strings? Yeah, those people need to be combated. But I think we can save some of these kids by offering compassion.

Vocabulary can be picked up by listening. It's how every one of us learned language in the first place.

The only relevant point I feel you made is the last one, but I can't tell you the last time I did that. I do know that one time I picked up a favorite book particularly to parse how the author had set up her dialogue. I failed miserably at being able to pay attention to the details because I became absorbed in the story. For me, listening to an audiobook would probably force me to slow down.

It's like your saying that if your lucky enough to have access to a drug store that has standard over the counter medication like tylenol,  than you should be happy with that. And you shouldnt expect the wealthy to share their knowledge of how to cure or treat diseases like cancer, and all the other research they've done on the millions of diseases we have.

Happiness isnt a destination, it's not a state of being that your supposed to find yourself in all the time. It's just taking 30 seconds here and there to fully enjoy a joke, or petting a soft blanket, having a fun exchange with a stranger, etc.

Learn to recognize these things and indulge in them whenever possible, give yourself permission to break a bad mood for a few moments. Take time with your senses when you get the urge. Learn to distinguish the smell of the air at night vs. the day.

2) I dont think anyone except for maybe the parents understands why they were offended. ""Is it yours?"" Is a totally reasonable comment, I've seen it many times, it is not out of place in the slightest. It's not even a ""well it's not likely an allistic (not autistic) person actually say that"" kind of thing. 

So it sounds to me that the parents are getting offended at who said the thing, not that the thing was said.  They are just looking for reasons to level abuse at him. And we do not need to apologize to our abusers.

I cant even twist my mind to figure it out, OP said her sister doesnt have any fertility issues, and that's the only way I can see it being offensive.

If the sister for some reason had a problem with it, sure, apologize. But her parents taking issue. I dont think so. Especially as it's fairly obvious they are just looking for any possible reason to villianize their future son in law.

3100,WyvernCharm,"Respectfully, (please dont think I am attempting to attack you), your comments read very ""white feminist"" to me. You dont understand where she is coming from, and instead of listening, you've decided that you dont agree and her ideas aren't worth parsing. 

The way I read the video, I saw two simultaneous and somewhat conflicting points. One of those was exactly what you were saying, manufactured opulence is a lie, it perpetuates a conflated idea of class division, and in reality we aren't really separate at all (excluding the true bourgeoisie). 

Which it sounds like we both understand and agree with. We are also similar in another way, neither of us care much about opulence. Now, I am willing to admit that I would like to live in a nice home and have nice high quality stuff that I enjoy. I think that is pretty universal. But it sounds like we are both unaffected by status symbols and rappers in fur coats drinking champagne. 

Which means we are exactly who the video is talking to. It is explaining why many people do value those things, its explaining that showcasing wealth can be a vehicle to hoping for class mobility. ""You have to see it to be it"". I grew up with mixed priviledge,  but that doesnt give me an excuse to willfully misunderstand people who are different from me. 

Hardly anything is all good or all bad. Most things are neutral tools that can be wielded differently by different people. Opulence may be a form of control, but the first time a black man made it to the point he could actually flaunt his wealth- it was revolutionary.  Not only had he become prosperous, but society was allowing him to openly show it. I imagine that was pretty damn aspirational.",1570995030,f3n5fx2,t1_f3ipagk,t5_iezap

3133,WyvernCharm,"I think the people who create out media are responsible in large part for how people interact with each other, and I dont think that will ever change. The difference now is that we are beginning to realize that we dont live in a bubble and that our choices effect how others are raised. People like to pretend like they are free from bias and media manipulation but that is impossible. We all get programmed, only some of is put in the work to debug the system in our own brains. Whether an individual wants to acknowledge that culpability is outside of our control, obviously, but unless we call it out and discuss it, most wont even realize that there is even the potential to need a closer examination. My understanding of this media/ consumer dynamic doesnt change its nature, it exists regardless of its visibility.

As for sexualizing, in this particular post, it wasnt the mention of her physical traits that were a red flag, it was the emotion behind it. It wasnt passive or impartial, nor was it caring or concerned. 

It was a somewhat clinical examination of her looks though, which is often something done by men rating a potential sex partners attractiveness. And it was also laden with regret. Like ""if only she was still skinny her hair and eyes would make her a complete vision to look at"". The regret implies a kind of ownership, a feeling of being entitled to enjoy looking at her body. Very sexualizing and gross, especially coming from a dad.

Is it always sexual, of course not. But you do have to do some extra work to combat the stereotype that men are always horn dogs. Which isnt fair to men, and is another thing we must combat.",1570816821,f3bw1sw,t1_f3bs8dw,t5_3ox0h

I think there was a better way to handle it. I'm sorry you so vehemently disagree. I promise, you dont have to get emotionally involved in order to disagree with someone. You dont have to dislike or disrespect them, you can acknowledge they have some valid points while finding logical fallacies in others.

But we are the frog in a pot of water, slowly coming up to temp to boil us alive and still utterly passive. Look at out collective reaction to Snowdens reveal. We sure cared about privacy- until we were told we didnt actually have it, and shouldnt need it, and that hero is actually a traitor and unamerican.  We do whatever the media tells us too, whilst they trade their responsibility as a check and balance to hold the govt accountable for actual checks to go into their bank account.

3137,WyvernCharm,"I dont think your understanding me. There are a million subtle ways a writer can show disapproval of a character. I'm not saying it has to be obvious or disproportionate. But to write it as normal and completely harmful is also unrealistic. Of dad sexualizes women, including his daughter, to this extent, it's going to bleed into his relationships. 

It's almost like your expecting that I am infantalizing authors, when in reality I'm demanding a higher quality product. 

A very large portion of what we consider normal behaviors and thought are socialized into us,  they aren't innate.  To be a good human,  much less an author,  we have to understand that perpetuating negative thoughts breeds a negative outcome.  We are taught things like racism and sexism through society,  not just the large performances of it but mostly through subtle nuance.  When creating a work of fiction you have a unique opportunity to control the narrative and combat the disrespect.  

Earlier in the thread I allowed that its possible that the book does end up framing the character in a way I would approve of. But it is also unlikely. At this moment in time, people are still being made aware of how much of a role that social conditioning plays.  It is not that common for one to question their own thoughts, especially ones they think are normal.  It is doubtful the author is the exception.  Combating these commonplace stereotypes and harmful framing is the whole point of this sub. A lot of people literally believe women aren't logical by nature of having a vagina. Social conditioning, programming, books, television and self fulfilling prophesy due to those things continues to make people believe that. It isnt true of course, but no amount of (having met women) will fix it. If an author us making a deliberate choice that's one thing, its when they aren't even cognizant that they are being harmful that it becomes a problem.",1570807223,f3bcqfs,t1_f3a87ca,t5_3ox0h

I honestly dont understand how you took my comments to mean something so radically different than what I was saying. 

I choose to believe your arguing in good faith though. So, no. I dont think all books should be sunshine and rainbows, but I do want them to be aware of their characters flaws. Having a flawed character is not the same thing as tacitly endorsing those flaws by providing them no negative consequences. 

They dont even have to be direct, simply acknowledging other characters feel a certain way, dont want to be around them, dont trust them, maybe dislike them a bit, etc. 

Take the TV show Girl Boss, shes framed as both the hero of her own story and also as a terrible human being. Or in Alphas, where you start to realize that even the doctor is deeply flawed and an egomaniac. Etc etc etc. There are plenty of good examples, I dont think this is one of them.

3163,WyvernCharm,"""Critism through words"" is a thing. That's why hate speech, incitations of violence, even microagressions are a thing that we discuss. I'm going to assume your aware of all this so...

I just want to point out, a person calling out is harmless, but many can be very effective.  That's how ideas are spread, and ideas are dangerous.  (The only difference is to whom). Spreading hate to soldiers who were just kids when they made the decision to join, because they hoped for a better life with education and healthcare (and also didnt know yet what the military is actually for), is dangerous. To us. Not the elite, they love to spread hate and divide the people. The last thing they want is for soldiers to realize that what they went through (and were made to do) was wrong. 

Keep in mind, going into service most people have never had the opportunity not to be part of a brainwashing institution.  The school to military funnel is carefully crafted. It works well for them and poorly for us. Including the recruits. Some soldiers might be evil, but the vast majority deserve compassion.",1570745475,f399xbo,t1_f36ebe5,t5_2ukze
3164,WyvernCharm,"As an outsider to this conversation, and an outsider to military life... 
Your either wrong, or you misread something way further up in the thread.  Bobo wasnt saying everyone gets a pass, just that there are layers to the discussion. 

If I'm remembering correctly this all started with them challenging the notion that soldiers fought to kill brown people, by saying that the soldiers themselves had different motivations. 

Like, yes, that is actually what the wars are about (I didnt see them say anything against that), just that the actual people on the ground didnt join up to kill people (most, anyway), most did it because there weren't many options for them. The proganda is real, the hopelessness is also real. It is unconciouble that the military targets children of poor areas to get recruits and then bribes them with promises of college and healthcare in order to get them to lay down their lives and souls. It's wrong that so many dont have access to a future that offering the bare minimum of subsistance is so effective. 

Those kids who agree because they cant access school or healthcare otherwise, then get sent out to be brainwashed and shot up with questionable substances and are made to do heinous things in the name of this country ARE victims. They are also bullys. They can be both, and the goal would be to hopefully give them a safe enough space to come to both of those conclusions. 

I imagine it's very difficult to admit that your an aggressor who shot and killed real human beings for the elites pocketbook, that you were wrong, and that there are tons of people in the world who see you as nothing but evil. 

And I imagine it is equally difficult for those people to admit they they too, have been victimized. That they had been taken advantage of and have been traumatized. For some people, admitting vulnerability is the hardest thing they can do. 

And then, after all that difficulty, they then must also find a way to consolidate the two. Something that it seems your having difficulty with yourself. 

When someone asks me if their is a military discount my first thought isnt ""thank you for your service"", but it also isn't, ""you class traitor murdering sob"". No, the first thing I want to say is ""I'm sorry"". 

Sure, there are some truly evil people who join the military. And there are also those that double down on the proganda. Nobody is asking you to lick their boots. But for the vast majority, they started out as kids, scared they would be completely lost in the world after school ended. And they do deserve compassion.",1570744753,f397wwf,t1_f36u0ms,t5_2ukze

It's how long you have to wait before knowing mom isnt coming home tomorrow, which I think is fair.

I have always worked, and I've held a lot of positions with a lot of different companies over the years, I cant think of one where reasonable accommodation could not be met, or wouldn't be worth losing for the sake of my nephew. 

They were either low paid and therefore easily replaceable, I could have switched shifts with my coworkers, taken a short company leave, discussed it with my manager (none of which that I've had wouldn't have covered for me in such an unusual emergency), planned on working some 10s to make up for it etc etc. Depending on schedule it is very possible OP would only need to take a single day off anyways, a very nominal amount of time in most indistries. And, I can even think of a few coworkers I could turn to if I needed temporary child care. 

72 hours is more than possible. Do I expect OP to adopt the child? No. Do I think, with the way it turned out in hindsight, and in his situation that he made the right call? Yes a do.

3172,WyvernCharm,"I think I understand what your saying, and I think I disagree ever so slightly. If I'm misreading, please let me know.  Also, one hung in really not sure about is what you mean when you mention Terrance. Are you saying he got a big head and blamed it on everyone else somehow not having a conciousness? Or something else. I dont think I have the context to judge that bit for myself. 

As for your points, I think we are mostly on the same page,  but still minorly adjacent. For example, I agree that having the right context is important,  but I dont know that one needs that in order to experience what I would consider the adverse side effect of pretentiousness, and having it doesnt mean you will avoid that effect. 

Or perhaps are simply working of different definitions of what context is. I assume you are discussing going into a trip with the intention to learn from it, and knowing what you intend to learn from it. 

If by context you mean, an appropriate level of emotional intelligence, human understanding, and self knowledge than I completely agree.

It's just that going into an experience with the intention of becoming the master of your own universe is likely going to lead you to the wrong conclusions if the lesson your presented with is different than the one you expect to recieve.

I believe being humble is of absolute importance in such journeys.  But also that our current societal definition of that is inaccurate. What I mean is, it is important to understand that your truth is not everybody's, that others journeys are worthy in their own right (even if we disagree), and to be willing to confront yourself on the possibility you are wrong. To be willing to be uncomfortable. I believe you can still think your the shit, but you can only be sustainably excellent if your spending a lot of time in self examination. 

If you show me a deeply problematic person who works each day to confront their own biases and reprogram themselves, albeit slowly, and another person who knows all the answers and calls themselves woke and ridiculed the other guy- my preference is for the one putting in the work and knows that they do not know everything.

I agree with you on the collective conciousness portion, each step we take makes us all a little more enlightened. Even a small act of kindness can have a ripple effect well and beyond imagination.",1570738989,f38qrff,t1_f38e64o,t5_37lis

What I would like to see addressed (aside from the main point of course), is how ego ties into the psychedelic user. Or more specific a dive into its contradictory nature. I have met far fewer people who have experienced ego-death on psychedelics, and took from it what I believe you believe are the fruits of that experience, than I have who have gotten even more big headed as a result. People who tie their ego to the psychonaut identity and become increasingly condescending. 

If humans are to utilize mushrooms and ayahuasca to reach the next level of evolution, it will not be done through the experience alone. Whether it is innate in humans, or a product of a lifetime and generations of the propaganda you describe, simply tripping will do nothing but re-route the very ills we wish to avoid.

Especially for people with vaginas, not because it has to, but because society has engrained in us that it is supposed to hurt. So most dont take the time to properly warm us up. 

The choice to fake an O is one that a lot of people make. Sometimes it's to fulfill the other persons expectations, or to preserve their ego, or to try and get the whole situation to be over with (without just stopping them and walking away.  Which is totally an option, but not one that would be perceived all that nicely). A virgin knows that people fake Os, and likely has had the experience with themselves to draw off of, or possibly even mistakes a sensation as an O and doesnt know that it can get better.

Ignored it

Apologized to the waiter and let them know they just had a baby.

Started talking exclusively baby talk to her back until she got the point.

Left *with* her

Took her aside to let her know he was beginning to get worried

Made a mental note to look into possible post partum depression later

Realized that she needed time without the baby and offered to be more of a caregiver to them

Laughed in her face and then asked of she wanted dessert.

In return, I offer that emerging science has discovered that the female system is not as submissive during impregnation than once thought. The concept of the sperm going on a survival of the fittest race to go bite the docile and patiently waiting egg is in fact untrue! 

The female body has ways of derailing, trapping, and messing with the sperm and is in fact very active in the sperm selection process! 

I think these revelations will have similar effects of making men confront their own deeply held biases that man=warrior/ superior.

It's not like the concepts I'm discussing here dont negatively effect you as well. Jokes poking fun at men for showing an ounce of emotion negatively effects you directly. Jokes about boys not crying can cause intense feelings of shame, even at funerals. Jokes that men are horn dogs can make you less trustworthy in the eyes of others.

3266,WyvernCharm,"As for jokes, a one off, even if it's offensive is probably fine.  The problem happens when it becomes an idea that has mass circulation and becomes part of societal consciousness. It's all well and good until people start to believe it. And if you tell somebody something enough times, they will believe it. 

An interesting study is Jane Elliots brown eyes blue eyes experiment. Where she told her class that people with brown eyes were smarter than children with blue eyes, and she began to treat them differently. The kids believed it and began to act according to their eye color, and brown eyed kids showed a lot of bigotry and discrimination. Proving that prejudice is a learned behavior. Here is a video, I can't recommend it enough. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqv9k3jbtYU

So if prejudice is learned, perpetuating stereotypes through jokes circulates that prejudice. For example, some people make jokes and spread the belief that poor people are inherently lazy, and they brought it all on themselves. 

You and I both know that most poor people are not lazy, they go to work, sometimes working 2-3 jobs. We both know that being born poor makes it much harder to gain upward mobility, a lot of that having to do with poor quality education, little access to proper nutrition, school funding being tied to homeowner taxes (obviously in a poor neighborhood, schools will get less funding. That sure is helpful and equitable), and having less support at home because the parents are busy working. 

But those who believe that poor people are just lazy make jokes and the idea spreads. Now a new generation of kids believes it, because that is how they were raised. It's just true- if you can't handle the truth maybe try not being an entitled beta cuck (or whatever). And then here you are, of middling means, working hard to survive. 

You go in for an interview, the interviewer see's that your shoe's are worn down, you get passed over for the job. You meet someone and hit it off, they are great, but they keep doing easy things for you. They say they are just being nice, but it feels like they don't think your capable of helping. You hear a snide remark after making a small mistake at work, you challenge them and they respond- ""you know I was joking, don't take it so seriously, besides everyone knows your not exactly a millionaire!"". 

Etc. I hope that helps to explain it. In working class society it isn't a surprise for someone to be working class, even to whatever passes for middle class these days. Put either of us in the same room with a wealthy person though and they are likely to recoil. 

I hope this makes sense to you. Pop Culture Detective can probably explain it better than me though. In this video he discusses the effects of a very common joke in our society- male rape. Hahaha sooo funny. Don't drop the soap or you'll get...raped. Like a woman. jokey joke joke. I can't do it justice, watch this video or at least save it. It deals with how humor can be damaging and it focus's on a really important topic, especially pertaining to men, Sexual Assault Played for Laughs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc6QxD2_yQw

And when you finish up there, see his other video, Predatory Romance of Harrison Ford movies, which deals with not only how certain tropes negatively effect women, but also how they hurt men and leave them confused. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWoP8VpbpYI&amp;t=3s",1571438818,f48gmhr,t1_f488jae,t5_3ox0h
3267,WyvernCharm,"I hear you, and I can definitely understand why you feel that way. It can be frustrating, especially when life isn't easy. And it doesn't sound like your on easy street necessarily. 

There are two concepts that are crucial to understand when discussing topics like these. The first one, you've probably heard of; it's privilege. Now what does get mixed up a lot is what that actually means. It's not saying that life is easy, it's saying that there are invisible advantages that your unlikely to be aware of. Kind of like how a fish doesn't know it's in water.

The second concept is intersectionality. This is basically saying that all people are born with different types of advantages, and disadvantages, privilege and oppression. And the way those things overlap. 

So you can have male advantage, while also being financially disadvantaged. 

You can be advantaged by the fact that you are able-bodied, and disadvantaged by being nuero-divergent. etc. Everything has pro's and cons. Pretty/attractive/thin privilege is a thing that can help you get jobs, but cross that with being a woman or trans and then it can also make you a target. 

Saying that you have advantages because your a white man doesn't mean that you get everything that you want, it just means that you don't have to overcome obstacles directly related to those traits. It's unlikely that someone is going to pass you over for a job, specifically for those traits for example.  Whereas studies have shown that people with ethnic sounding names get passed over for interviews.

I know someone who is a older white man who runs a good size company, and it wasn't until he was put in a position that made him the minority that he understood what being ""other"" felt like. The guy has been an adult a long time and it had never occurred to him until that moment. He isn't a bad person by any means, just blind to that privilege.

I hope that all made sense. I'm going to start another comment to go into how jokes can be harmful as this is already a wall of text. Thanks for taking the time to listen :)",1571436539,f48d03i,t1_f488jae,t5_3ox0h
3268,WyvernCharm,"But they aren't.  So many jokes punch down.  Rely on stupid stereotypes and in general aren't funny. I mean come on,  how many times have you heard this or different variations of the ""women belong in the kitchen "" joke. Even from a non sjw standpoint it is played the fuck out.

Society isnt equal. Men and women, straight and gay, black and white etc etc etc. We live in a world with disproportionate power dynamics. And very rarely do we poke fun on the people with power.  

Jokes are only funny to the people that ""get"" them. If the only comedy you think is funny relies on crappy untrue stereotypes, it may be time to expand your horizons. There is a whole world of comedy out there that doesnt need them.",1571433781,f487oy1,t1_f483dw0,t5_3ox0h
3269,WyvernCharm,"Where are you getting this idea jokes like these aren't harmful? The only way that would be true is if nobody thought the way the joke is describing. Do you really think that there aren't still plenty of people who view a woman's worth based on her housekeeping? Or her ability to bear children? Or any other number of misogynist thoughts?  


Jokes like this may not be harmful for those who know better, but what of the ones who dont? Media plays a substantial role in what we think and how we act, especially as we are growing up. If you see this all the time, why would you doubt it? If you believe it, and you see this, you will take it as validation. You tell yourself that everybody thinks like this and anyone who doesn't is lying and just trying to be a white knight/  virtue signal.  


Idea's are dangerous. The status quo is dangerous. I'm linking a video that does a good job of explaining how media gets into and effects peoples actions and how it can be very unhealthy. The entire channel is really good, and ""Sexual Assault of Men Played for Laughs"" in particular made me cry.

I would argue that while part of the joke is pointed at the reader's goof, of *not* immediately thinking of their life partner as an appliance, a large portion of the humor in the joke is pointing out the ""edgy truth"" of the comparison.

Regardless, your point about those comments that are being quite radical is spot on. It isn't helpful to think in such black and white ways, and I think anyone so quick to pick up the torches are *also* missing the purpose of the movement.

To my mind, the reason people take the time to have these discussions of what is problematic, and why, is to help others learn. We've all been raised in an oppressive society, it takes actual work to de-program a lot of what we've absorbed. Critical thinking isn't always somebodies #1 priority, and many haven't had cause to look at certain things from a different perspective before. 

I'd like to think that most people who bring up discussions like these are the level headed sort. Any new way of thinking will bring in mindless followers of the trend. It is however, our responsibility to police those who would police others, and keep overly aggressive ally's from taking over the movement.",1571421982,f47ga1y,t1_f4728p7,t5_3ox0h
3284,WyvernCharm,"Not a problem at all, I think at this point we can agree that neither of us are likely to be speaking in absolutes. I didn't mean to sound like I thought you were rejecting the possibility in any way. I appreciate your willingness to participate in discussion! 

Now that we've nailed down a rough definition of what constitutes humor, we can get more into the topic. I think a lot of what is happening these days is a push to examine it beyond just the surface level. And trying to get people to make deliberate choices in what they promote. I also think that people who want people to push up, rather than down have a much more complimentary view of peoples intelligence in general.  

An easy example is ""Blazing Saddles"". A lot of people who decry SJWs and PC culture cite this movie as going against those ideas and ""would never be made today"". Because, you know, liberal cucks or something. 

Those people are fundamentally misunderstanding the discussion. I think they hear the word nigger and think that the only way that could possibly come up, would be to poke fun at black people. They hear something that sounds racist and think the racist comment is the joke by default. 

In reality, that movie pushes up. The joke isnt that someone said something racist, the joke is how incredibly stupid the racist are. It's a caricature of them that is very unflattering. The joke isnt on the minority, it's on the bigots. 

It is absolutely still funny today, even to (or especially to) SJWs. There are a couple of less than ideal moments regarding women and gay people, but by and large it is an excellent comedy.",1571420570,f47cq77,t1_f479vab,t5_3ox0h
3285,WyvernCharm,"The thing is, that is society now. We cant just remove children from the world they live in. 

Back in the day when children's programming became a thing, we realized that shows for kids were really just ads for toys. Kids dont have the ability to distinguish them, so we made laws to protect them. 

The exact same thing is happening today with YouTube and online games. We need to adapt and make laws to protect them.

The problem is, we live in a capitalist hellscape. 

And beyond the problems with forcing through legislation that will lower profits more multiple powerful industries/ lobbyists.  As a society, we dont seem to care about the common good anymore. 

Where are the PSAs about the dangers of the internet and best practices to stay safe? Why aren't more schools holding assemblies. Etc etc. 
Just keeping kids off of social media isnt going to cut it. We need to teach them how to use it responsibly, which is hard because so many adults dont know how either. 

And now I feel bad because I brought up a lot of problems, and I dont know a solution. Step one is to make it  priority, but even that will be a challenge. Considering the kids taking a stand and trying to make gun violence a priority are getting shut down.

3287,WyvernCharm,"I respect your response :) 

I would say that your description of what a joke is, is partially true.  I think another way jokes work is by calling out a ""truth"" that validates what people think, especially if it's not polite to say out loud. 

It's not a joke just to say that women are only useful in the kitchen,  but if you put some embellishing on it,  it turns into one. 

In your example, you said a deeply misogynist person wouldn't find the above joke funny because it doesnt violate their beliefs. I disagree, it is still a violation. Maybe not personal, but societally. Even if they agree, they know its uncouthe to say so. 

Fortunately or unfortunately, I dont need this joke explained. I know why it's supposed to be funny because I was raised in the same world as everyone else. A ton of jokes are built around stereotypes.  Doesn't make them good jokes though.",1571418693,f4788jn,t1_f476jac,t5_3ox0h

Nasuada from the Inheritance Cycle (eragon).
She is an absolutely fantastic leader, who thinks deeply about her actions and how others will interpret them. One very simple example is how she deliberately places a vase of flowers in her new official office. Simultaneously honoring her father and putting her own personal touch on the room. 

A greater example is how she fixes the Vardens financial problems. She comes up with an idea,  then she brings a magic user into the room and asks questions to determine whether or not it will work (without giving away her plan so the answers wont be biased), discovers she is right that magic is reliant on energy expenditure not time, and reveals her plan to have magic users create lace and sell at heavily discounted prices to fund the varden. Brilliant!

In order to do what you suggest we would have to cut out an enormous percentage of the day to day items that we use and consume.  Including most technology.

Men and women are not that different. They're are precious few variations between us. Most of what we think is ""for girls"" or ""for boys"" is just nonsense. Nurture, not nature. 

Nothing is inherently manly about getting insulted that someone scuffed your shoe, and for that slight you must now make a really big show of letting them know your going to FUCK THEM UP.

Unravel the nuances of the human experience, and feel secure in what you know, because every day you are learning something new and editing your database to include that information.

Take pride that you look to help people whensoever you have the opportunity, and an equal amount of pride that you know and enforce your boundaries. 

Your ego is about you. To believe that the ego can be healthy when it's being fed a diet of societal expectation and empty calories is a fallacy. The only way to explore and strengthen it without it becoming corrupted is to explore yourself, to truly know who you are and be happy with that person. 

The only way I know how to be happy with myself is to always be working on improvements, empathy, functionality, dependability, compassion,  intellect,  etc. I can take pride in my ego because I work for it and avoid stagnation.

Do yourself a favor and look into the effect Walmart actually had on those communities. I think there is even a documentary with interviews from those people. 

The cliffs notes version is they drove out family owned businesses and funneled their profits out of the economies they were in. 

When you spend money inside of a community that money changes hands and supports family after family until it comes back around. When you spend money at Walmart, it gets sucked up to support the waltons and their $100 million increase per day. They dont spend that money, they dont contribute to the economy.

They are huge benefactors of corporate welfare. Leaving on the government to stop their workers from starving so they can continue profiting off them. Our tax dollars go to subsidize their business, because they cant be bothered to pay a fair wage. Again, 141.5 billion to the Walton family alone- they can afford to pay a the wages of a decent living.

Please, take a moment to consider another point of view.  We are all being screwed. Go out of your way to look at info with a different bias than your own. 

Utilize your common sense: should it be ok to make mass profits off the exploitation of others labor, and not give any of it back? Is it ok to allow your workers to die, just because they are easily replaceable?

Because that is exactly what they are doing. They rely on putting their employees on welfare so they can shrug off the responsibility to pay them fairly. Your tax dollars may be going to feed someone, but its BECAUSE companies are feeding their bottom line.

Do you have 141.5 BILLION dollars? Numerically that is 141,500,000,000 dollars. It would take you...97 thousand *decades* to make that at $15 an hour. 

The Walton family does have that, right now, going up by 100 million every single day. They are stealing from you to do that.

3358,WyvernCharm,"I feel like your taking the allegory to be about 1 master and 1 worker. 1-1 ratio. I dont think it was meant in that way. It's more of a we do all the work, they take all the profits.

Look at Walmart. They employ a ton of workers and do not pay them a living wage, give benefits, etc. In fact, they take advantage of corporate welfare and hold meetings to teach people how to get on assistance, so they can continue profiting from their labor without them dying. 

From there I'm sure they employ a few middle management types that probably make a somewhat livable wage and some CEOs that probably make a few million bossing everyone else around. 

I'm guessing its something like 90% worker bees, 10% other. 

They destroyed the economy and wiped out competition, killed all the mom and pops and hoovered all the money that was circulating inside the towns and moved it to offshore accounts.

90% of their workers do all the labor and  ant afford to live. In return, the 6 members of the Walton family now have literally as much wealth as a full 30% of all the people in The United States of America combined. That's 98,160 000,000 people *combined*.

What could they possibly be doing that justifies that kind of wealth? In a country with 2.5 million homeless children, and 40% of adults cant afford a $400 emergency?

I tried to calculate what percent of 141.5 billion (Walton worth)  400 is. I didnt even understand the answer ""2.8268551236749E-7%"". Maybe its 7 zeros away from a single percent? 

1% of their wealth though would be enough to cover over 3.5 million peoples impossible $400 emergency. 

1% of my income (not wealth, I dont have any) is ironically about $400. I have considerably less than a billionaire to live on, but if somebody told me I could distribute that 1 percent and save 3.5 MILLION people, I absolutely would. 

Instead, the waltons are focused on increasing their wealth, at the expense of people, to the tune of 100 *million* per *day*. In contrast the Waltons employ 1.4 million in the US and 2.2 million total world wide.

Step 2: Pick up some frozen or canned dinners and if you sometimes get in really bad shape, a pack of ensure. 

Ok, now that we've made sure that you wont starve, we can get into some recipes! 

If you have access to an Asian market,  curry is a cheap, easy, and freezable meal! 
Take 1 can of coconut milk and heat with 1 can of water. Stir in 1 can of curry paste (or less if you aren't into spicy). Add a can of button mushrooms, baby corn (I personally cut them in half), bamboo shoots, maybe water chestnuts.  Bring to a boil and toss in some chunks of chicken. A teaspoon of sugar, and a few glugs of fish sauce. Tada! It's great over rice with a fried egg on top. 

Basic chili freezes well, so does red meat sauce. Precooking some meat in general is a good idea. Chicken chunks/ shredded chicken. Turkey taco meat, ground beef, etc. Cook and portion out into single serve ziplocs so you can just pull out what you need, run it under hot water for a second, slip it into a pot with a touch of water and heat it up on your stove.

As a note, if you've got something on your stove and you couldnt put it up the night before..  you probably dont need to toss it. I was raised just bringing curry back up to a boil for 10 minutes or so and continuing to eat it off the stove. Dad would keep the same pot of curry going for a week, I usually would tap out on day 4. Never got sick. 

Speaking of... rice soup! Take your leftover rice and add water and boil.  Lots of water. The starch gets into the water and the texture changes. Add some salt and eat with whatever. Make an omelette out of 2 eggs and a tsp of fish sauce. Bacon is good. Stir fry. Etc. 

Or, add some garlic and ginger and some little meat balls and you've got congee.

Poor mans soup is great too. 1 can tomato sauce, onion, garlic, ground beef, frozen peas, salt and pepper. Very comforting.

Any workplace training module will also specify that it is still harassment even if it osmt directed at the offended person. For example, making racist jokes around somebody but not at them can create a hostile work environment. 

But that's just what the definition, it's up to you how you feel about it. There are certainly different degrees. It sounds like you were made to feel uncomfortable, but not unsafe.

But mostly it's being able to trust your intuition. Which can lead into being too trusting. If you suspect you are a healer, I have other advice. Anyways, it's not like the movies (at least for me), just a pretty high level of understanding.

3394,WyvernCharm,"Thank you so much for your critique, I'm glad that your a fan of the type of story it is. You are absolutely correct about Josie having a rather severe developmental disability. The story stemmed from a prompt that specifies about the mountain of non-aging and the buck dying. I realized that most children wouldn't be happy being in a child body forever, but it would be salvation for a family whose child mentally wouldn't grow- but whose body would. The fear being, it would be extremely difficult to control a 5 ft 8, 190 lbs toddler having a tantrum, and having to send away to specialized care.   


Your comment about a woman generating the amount of slobber I described made me laugh. Maybe I will whittle it down to a delicate lick on the nose. Then again, they \*are\* 300 yrs old and have had only their own company... they probably are pretty weird. No no, your right, my reader doesn't want to experience disgust.  


Is there anything you feel would make Josie's situation more obvious, while still remaining subtle? I don't want to brow beat about it, just like I don't want to browbeat about them being lesbians. My goal was to make it as natural as possible, and if that means sacrificing some clarity, I think I'm ok with that. On the other hand, I don't want to make it overly difficult either. I'll need to think a lot on how to bring up that their both women. I agree with you that the sentence is actually pretty bad.

Some of the subtler elements I think you may have missed entirely, namely that Josie has a significant developmental delay that led them to make the decision to live outside of time. Also, the choice in the end was the choice for them all to die. I'm not sure if that info would modify your critique at all, let me know, otherwise I'll assume not :)   


I'll try to work on the season bit as well, I didn't intend it to be literal, but obviously that is how it comes off. Some of your concerns stem from the fact this was originally a response to a prompt that specified the mountain of eternal youth and the stag dying, I didn't realize how... off it would be without that context. I'll definitely be adding the fantasy element closer to the beginning of the story in my edit.

And she is probably not ok with him whining about not getting to have sex with her
 And she was probably under the impression that it was more of a date night, or a friends get together, or at the very least he wanted her around at least partially because he thinks shes a cool person and wanted to converse a bit. Or at the very very least that the only thing he was looking forward to was her vagina.

Hearing some chud whining about being ""cockblocked"" and knowing that he means me would feel disgusting. I highly doubt shes cool with his behavior, and if she is, she shouldnt be.

He's also exhibiting toxic male behavior, trying to shame you for not letting him get his dick wet. In reality, he should be the one ashamed. Of course, your in high school so maybe not many people will see that. Then again, kids are smart these days. He is being gross.

3409,WyvernCharm,"First Impressions:   


If this is meant to be a self contained narrative story, some careful attention is needed. It is extremely surreal and disjointed; I found it difficult to follow. I'm going to assume that the goal was to create a single narrative, forgive me if I got the wrong impression. If I am wrong, my advice would be to give the reader a stronger framework on how to understand and process what is happening in the story. I think you have some interesting things to say, they just need shined up a bit.  


 \-Introduction-  


This starts off well, I feel that I get a pretty strong idea of who both characters are. Elise is stuck in childhood, she's kind of a manic pixie dream girl type, a dreamer. You showcase this nicely with the leaf scene. Renee is more sensible and keeps her friend grounded, does much of the work in the relationship. I would suggest introducing Renee by name first, rather than as ""her friend"", and then switching it later. It feels a little abrupt. Also, pay close attention to dialogue, its a little confusing who is saying what, and we don't know them well enough yet to base it off of content. I would also suggest that the person who is specifying the difference between octopus and squid, probably wouldn't turn around 2 seconds later and say the difference doesn't matter.   


ACT 1  


The reader is given a lot of new information in this section, including but not limited to- she doesn't like knives, her father does like knives, her father is a preacher, apparently Elisa thinks she is a good friend but will also call Renee an ungrateful bitch \[this doesn't jive with the happy go lucky persona she has, will it come up later?\], and paying for candy makes her anxious. What we don't learn is why any of that is relevant. It introduces a lot of questions, ""what happened to her father?"" ""Why doesn't she feel comfortable around knives?"" ""Why is she intentionally grasping for that memory, is that her last memory of her father?"".  Focus on what your trying to communicate about the characters to the reader. Also, watch carefully for continuity. Is she looking at the ground when she walks in, or is she looking at the cashier? Does the cashier actually turn his body away from hers when she walks up to pay for her stuff?   


ACT 2  


 ‚ÄúWhat do you mean Cents?I was just waiting to see if you recognized me.‚ÄùThe old man let loose a hoarse laughter. At least, Elisa thought he was old. Years of homelessness obscured Cents true age. - I really like this dialogue, it shows that Elisa has can think on her feet and has a rye humor. A bit later, the flashback comes really suddenly, and then disappears just as quickly. Don't be afraid to add more to these sections and fill in details. Why does her mother slap her? I assume it's because she wanted to give the man her money, but we don't know that for sure. And even if that's true- that's such unusual behavior for a person. Most people wouldn't turn and slap their daughter because they were slapped by a homeless person, so we need more info about the whole scene and mom as a character to follow it. Another question comes up, ""why did she have $100 in her hand as a child?""

ACT 3  


Who wants to go to the bar? Again, take the time to tell your reader who is speaking. ""It's his day off""- who is he? Again, pay close attention to continuity. I thought she was walking down the street on a fall day, talking to her friend who had gone on ahead to work. Suddenly her mother is yelling at her, a front door is closing somewhere and there is a bus?  I just don't know whats happening in this section, sorry.  


Conclusion  


The conclusion is interesting. It seems to touch on human greed, or narcissism. This Elisa character really seems like a contradiction. Seemingly free spirited, but also needlessly vindictive. She wonders if she's kind enough to get her friend a candy bar, and it turns out she is, but not the one she asked for, one that she considers inferior.   


Ending thoughts:  


This just lacks focus. I think the scenes are interesting and the characters are worth exploring but you seem simultaneously rushed and wandering. For a story of this length I would spend more time fleshing out just 2-4 events/ memories and tying them together. If you wanted to keep everything than the story would need to be much longer to give the ideas, characters, events, etc the attention they deserve. And they do deserve to be fleshed out. This made me ask many questions, I would love to see how you explore the answers.",1571784507,f4t6esy,t3_dlizv9,t5_2z15u

The reason I reccomend them is that they teach you how to play again. The joy of failing is lost on us as adults,  but it's still accessible. And when you figure out a new move there is nothing else like it! It's also physical. When your first learning it's some real excercise! Once you get it down, it gets way easier, but it also clears your mind as you find your flow. There are lots of teachers online, and the community itself is very giving. I cant tell you how many people I've taught some simple tricks to :)

Im glad your working things out in therapy,  I'm confident you will make great progress! That said,  I'm off to my own therapy appt. Take care!

And yes, media is part of the control system. Especially Hollywood. I'm not saying that we need to never go out to the movies, only that we should be aware that there are alternative motives while we enjoy them. I enjoyed the TV show madam secratary, but I also kept in mind that it was propaganda.

Books aren't the same,  but I'm sure they could be. Unfortunately, anti intellectualism is quite rampant currently, and peoples taste in books is so diverse that  it doesnt make sense to put in the effort to use it for control. You cant currently control literature. Between the multitude of publishing houses and now self publishing it would be extremely difficult.  Now if we see those go away and are left with only a few pumping out propaganda I'll add it to my list. 

Of you dont think powerful people get together to make the world the way they want, your crazy.  If you jad that much power, wouldn't you? The nation is hurting and being controlled by an oligarchy,  so distraction and entertainment is imperative to keep us from civil disobedience.  Its an age old trick.  

Music is the same. We aren't allowed much music with controversial lyrics or political messages. It's available, but not from big labels or on the radio. Most peoples music these days is written for them.

3574,WyvernCharm,"Here is a pretty good primer on what I am discussing.
https://www.wakingtimes.com/2018/02/02/dystopian-warnings-sports-used-control-masses/

Here is an actual study regarding sports and mass media and their causal effect on the population. 

&gt; In the same sense, results of investigations reported by Cummins et al. (2017) [27] and Kim et al. (2011) [23], reveal that the more intense the feelings experienced in sports stadiums, the greater viewers immerse themselves in the event. This demonstrates the great potential influence that the producers responsible for these events can have. However, the experience of such exaggerated feelings can lead to violent and aggressive attitudes towards the opponents of the other teams [40]. These feelings influence the sociability of spectators. From a negative perspective, such excessive emotional reactions can lead to fanaticism, which can lead to violence. This shows that sports media can have both positive and negative influences on society and values.

 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6388264/

And, finally, before I go home. I will quickly discuss how sports have a numbing effect on the population in regards to race. In this I will be discussing the USA where the most prominent minority is black people. If mass incarceration is a stick- major league sports is the carrot. Historically disadvantaged youth could claw their way out of poverty by becoming famous sports stars. It is a dream a huge percentage of young men have and rely on. The only problem is, that being one of the very few famous sports players is no replacement for an actually equitable world with real opportunities. And in this way, it also puts the onus on them, for not being athletic enough when they fail- as opposed to blaming what is really at fault for a lack of upward mobility- systemic and systematic racism.",1573864160,f7miewo,t1_f7mfocb,t5_2qh4i

3576,WyvernCharm,"I'm glad we could come to an accord. 

In my opinion, as writers and content creators we have a responsibility to examine what we are supporting or condemning in our work. Whether it is direct or indirect, we say a lot of things that shape the world- even when we aren't aware that we are supporting them. With sensitive topics it is even more crucial to proceed with caution and intent. 

It would be irresponsible to write a rape scene, and then have the person who was raped suddenly change their mind, and fall in love because the it was such a thrilling experience. A) that isn't real, it doesn't accurately express victim hood. and B) It teaches that an act of violence can be what gets you what you want. It's crucial that we examine our work from multiple angles and make sure (to the best of our ability) that we aren't accidentally giving a message we don't intend.

Media effects society to a surprising degree. A lot of people are raised by it. What they see in books or on tv in many cases, are the only experiences they get with X type of person. So when it is requested that we have more disabled heroes, or write an LGBT protag, or hell a really scary female villain... what we do shapes the world, and including more types of people not only makes our writing more colorful and engaging, it also can improve the world.",1573862283,f7mg06l,t1_f7meduy,t5_3ox0h
3577,WyvernCharm,"It's not valuable *right now* because people are allowing them to control the game.

It just tells them that you wont bother to get involved and therefore your needs dont matter,  they don't need to do anything to improve your life because you will do nothing.  

As for you thinking that who gets elected doesnt...do anything? I don't know of I can help you understand that politicians do affect society.  That seems pretty obvious.  Was nobody effected by the no child left behind program? Was no one. effected by Obamacare? Good or bad, they have an effect.

And even more importantly, local elections have a huge effect. You have been brainwashed into thinking that the superior action is to do nothing. Cant you see how wrong that is?",1573860592,f7mdrzp,t1_f7ma9fq,t5_2qh4r
3578,WyvernCharm,"I'll do my best to explain why, in my view, your comments came off in support of \*not\* making an effort to encourage writers not to create stereotypical patriarchal worlds. I strongly approve of intellectual integrity, and I'm glad it's important to you as well. This is not an attack- but it will be detailed.   


 To start, the comment that prompted you to respond was discussing how a surprisingly large amount of men can't even conceive of a world without male domination, even in fantasy settings. It seems you know that those men exist- which is why it's so confusing that come out swinging and calling the argument weak. For one thing, it wasn't an argument- it was a lament as well as a statement of fact.  


Which you follow up with ""Not in any way saying that a fantasy world needs to be patriarchal' (Not saying stuff, is historically how a lot of people will say stuff. Think of the well known ""I'm not racist but..."") , 'but the idea that a fantasy world needs to be not-patriarchal to satisfy modern sensibilities seems restrictive.'  


Again, nobody was arguing that all fantasy worlds must be egalitarian or matriarchal societies. You are reading a lot into  this prompt that was never expressed. What was expressed was how so many men are ok with dragons and mages but will say \*out loud\* that the marriage between a 40 yr old man and a 13 yr old girl is not problematic because its ""realistic"".   


Additionally, that last sentence of yours sounds a lot like your viewpoint is coming from a place that could be translated into: ""The idea that someone wants this change in the status quo when it comes to media is actively oppressing me"". I'm not saying that is what you meant, I am saying that I have seen this as a dogwhistle often.  


For the next bit,  [ElliOop](https://www.reddit.com/user/ElliOop/) did an excellent job of pointing out where that went wrong. I suggest you go back and reread what they said.  


Based on what you have written, it seems that you are strongly opposed to criticism. Sure, it doesn't feel great- but it is what will help you grow. Additionally, if you want to be a writer, your going to get a lot of it. You will need to learn how to take control of that feeling, and direct it into productivity and improvement.  


If you look through your conversation on this thread again, you will be able to notice that the only times you have directly engaged in what the other person was saying, their ideas- you immediately turn it back around onto what you think, or what you feel. Tbh, you come across as a person with quite the ego. It also doesn't make for a great discussion- you seem to have been forcing the whole conversation into the places where \*you\* wanted it to go, rather than allowing it to happen naturally, including ideas from both parties. By the end of the conversation you are still responding as if they had said that writing patriarchal societies should be off-limits, despite them having told you that wasn't the case- and inviting you to self reflect on why you went to that extreme.  


Lastly, "" Yes, I‚Äôve been told the exact phrase ‚Äúwell if you can imagine magic, can‚Äôt you just imagine a world where women are completely equal,‚Äù... I still feel I need to push back against the idea.""   
If your first reaction to being asked to simply imagine equality is to push back against the concept as a whole- you have a lot more learning to do. Imagine if someone told me, ""cant you even imagine a world where being gay is accepted by the community?"" And... I started arguing that historically gay people have been oppressed, and that stories can still have value even if the societies they are set in are homophobic. And also gay people were 51% of the population? That... was also not a good look.  


Anyways, I hope this was helpful. Keep that intellectual integrity and grow with it. If you make that an important part of your life consistently, nobody will be able to take it away. And you will always be able to feel self assured about it. Cheers.",1573860032,f7md1bz,t1_f7m54uf,t5_3ox0h

I don't think we differ all that much. Still, I don't see the point in arguing for less diversity. It only succeeds to prop up those who would be happier with none. Keep in mind, a lot of the common things you hear said are just shorthand to get the gist of an idea to other people. 

It's like hearing ""Men are afraid women will reject them; women are afraid men with murder them"". And then trying to get into the actual numbers and percent of homicide that can be expected. Or worse, starting an argument about how not to live in fear, or promoting gun ownership.  The point wasn't really to say that every single women is in perpetual fear at all times of being murdered. It was to illustrate a disparage in perspective. 

Similarly, your response to this... it didn't look great. The point is that so many men actually can't suspend their disbelief that a world might not be super sexist, even though they are cool with dragons. So...it wasn't about you. I'm happy to have the discussion in general, but from the approach it looked quite a bit like you were supporting the trolls that hate empowered female characters.",1573854474,f7m4h7b,t1_f7lg4bk,t5_3ox0h

2) No, it does not make sense to include chess or reading into my criticism because, as you have said, sports is a billion dollar industry- chess and reader are not. 

3) I don't know how to tell you that war and battle are not fundamental to humanity. In the past, they have been required to expand empires for the elite. Again, this goes back to control over the masses. In this case, you seem to have bought in to the idea that violence is a fundamental part of humanity. So you are less likely to disallow state sanctioned violence, and may be eager to do battle in the name of your lords. We send out young men to die for the squabbles of the wealthy. That is not what it means to be human. I'm sorry you think that way.  

4) Just to be clear, I do't have a problem with individuals playing sports, I have a problem with the industry. And would hope that you can open your eyes to see what it really is- a means of mass control.

3592,WyvernCharm,"I think the problem is that your looking at this from the perspective that there is no problem, or that the problem doesnt need rectified.

I dont think anyone is saying that there should be no patriarchy in fantasy, just that it shouldnt be the *default*. And the fact is, if we want to make it not that way, we need a conscientious push to writing what we want to see, as well as reading it. 

What you perceive as people trying to take away the privilege to write these trope, is simply a request from the market about what they want to read. There is a huge opportunity here, so much wider and faster than the so what limited scope and opportunity to break into the market dominated by established lore. It's not taking from you, its offering you an opportunity. If only you choose to listen.

You say you want to be a writer, listening to what people want is a good start. Additionally, you argue that your book has little to do with patriarchy so why shouldnt it include it. Why should it then? It would. certainly be easier to write around. If your going to include oppressive power structures, and then act like they dont exist or effect your characters  lives... yeah, that's probably going to be badly written in that regard.",1573838419,f7ldzha,t1_f7kuw1u,t5_3ox0h

The reasons we have labels is to create space for different ways of being and make them valid and visible. For the most part, I've only ever seen those who fall into the majority (white cis straight male able bodied, neurotypical, etc) ever have a problem with labels. Like being labeled takes something away from you rather than it being empowering to know you aren't alone. And, mayne it does take something away, the belief that you are the standard human, normal, better(?), I couldnt say.

There are way too many variables at play. I suggest we settle with, both are discriminated against, albeit differently. 

Arguing that they are discriminating against gay whites is in itself not a good argument. It completely ignores what is actually being communicated,  which is that a lot of gay white people perpetuate a system that disadvantages PoC and in particular, often steal and claim culture that is not their own. The argument isnt a value judgement, and it's not a posting contest- it is just- are you a minority if you are gay and white?

That last thing you said is ""verifiably"" trash. EVERYBODY has different types of priviledge in varying degrees. And being part of the majority race, in a society where race is a distinction that holds a lot of value, and in a system that is majority ran by those of that same race, your going to have privilege.  When you are what is considered the ""norm"" and people unlike you are considered the ""other"" that in itself is a privilege. 

Not having to reflect on a minority status because it does not effect you is a privilege.  I have able bodied privilege.  It doesnt mean that my life is easy, it means that I do not encounter struggles that non able bodied people do. It's not an insult, it's a fact.  It's also better to understand in what ways certain traits about you protect you from things that those without those traits have to deal with. And it's good to understand in what ways your disadvantaged.  It improved empathy, and empathy improves society.

None of those things excuses one to be a bigot. One would hope that having experienced discrimination would lead a person to develop empathy enough not to continue the practice, but often times humans dont work that way. At least not yet.

3619,WyvernCharm,"Is it currently legal to discriminate against gay people in a whole lot of places? Is it pretty common to find people who would WANT to discriminate against people who are gay? 

Everything is an intersection. Most, if not all things have advantages that go along with the disadvantages. Being born rich is a fantastic advantage- being raised by nannies because your parents dont have time for you is a disadvantage. Being white in the majority of society is an advantage, being gay  is not so helpful.

It is ridiculously easy to pick up talking points and ideas, and opinions and societal rules are as easy to pluck from the air as leaves on a tree. It is much harder to apply them and understand the theory and reasoning behind it. It takes time, and that's ok.

That also means that there are a lot of people trying to be supportive, but missing the mark entirely. Which sounds a lot like what happened here. I believe they are genuine in trying to do the right thing, but currently oblivious to the problematic behaviors and viewpoints they are exhibiting. 

If you want a clear path in life, you need to light it for yourself. Critical thinking should be your best friend. Others can show you what to think about, and some options on how- but what you choose is your own, and the options are infinite.",1572665593,f62r2s5,t1_f62l9f0,t5_2qh2n

It does mean that you want to learn why and give it extra consideration and more beta readers. I know of some very silly things people have gotten very upset by, and the only thing it proved was that they were delusional. So proceed with caution, try not to be reactionary, but take feedback close to heart. And do be willing to revise or remove based on people reactions.

Is that going to happen? No. Is it desirable? Sure, I can see that.  And it's not like their list of identifiers is equivalent to liberalism. I would argue that democratic socialism is extremely anti-liberal.

So its important to try and enjoy those bits as much as you can while you have them.

If your anything like me as a teen, you dont get enough sleep. That could make a huge impact on your weight and health. Dont overstress things you cant change, note them to fix later, and concentrate on what you do have the ability to fix.

Mine is a family recipe (I'm first gen). Its simple,  but delicious. 
2 steaks cooked med. rare, sliced thin. 

Combine
4-6 diced roma tomatoes
1 large red onion sliced thin
Around 1 bulb of minced garlic (it's a lot lol)
The steak
The juice of around 2-3 lemons
Fish sauce
Sugar 
6-8 diced thai chilis

Eat on top of romaine hearts (like a taco) and with sticky rice to sop up the juice! 
You can size that down of course,  I usually make that for family meals with a pot of curry also and it feeds 6-10.

The goal is to get the flavors salty spicy sour and sweet all in balance. Its hard to describe. Also, taste often because thai chilis are HOT! You may only want to use a couple. For me, yum nu is best when it's so spicy your eyes water, but it's so balanced and delicious your hands keep going for bite after bite!",1572649905,f61yglc,t1_f61i9ft,t5_37cns

Anyway, I checked it out. And I can see where one might feel like it's going a bit too far. But I disagree. If i hadn't had friends in relationships like the ones described in there i might not understand either. 

What I see is a bunch of women building each other up and empowering each other to get out of toxic relationships. That shit is HARD. I have friends that have been getting strong along for years, thinking hes going to change, or that after all this time they've put too much into it to give up, feeling like the success of the relationship is in their hands, their failure if he doesnt grow a brain. I've seen them get so fucking close to getting out, only to be convinced to keep the door cracked. 

It doesn't apply to certain relationships, it's not about certain men, #notall...whatever.  But looking at it, I'm glad it exists. I'm glad women have people cheering them on for dumping those losers who dont value them. Too often it's just you and your man against the world.

I just don't see how you are jumping to that when, ""Hey, would you like to go out sometime? We could meet up at XYZ bookshop and browse around if your interested."" is about a gazillion times more likely than ""Hey lady, meet me at XYZ bookshop on Friday at 5pm.... or else"". 

And I'm pressing the point because asking someone to go somewhere with you is not and should not be considered controlling. It gives people the wrong idea. I do not want to see a world where people are punished for daring to ask someone to an activity. And, it is hard enough for young men right now already. We've ripped away the old model of masculinity and declared it toxic- because it is. But there is going to be a learning curve, and we need to replace it with new models. Otherwise, they are just out there flailing. 

I don't want to discount the posts I've seen where young men are genuinely afraid to say anything to a woman, or even be around her at all in any way. (I read a story where a guy was afraid to look in the same isle as a lady was because it might look like he was following her). That's just not the world I want.

I agree with the advice to keep the hunt to just a few things, I think it makes a nice ice breaker. Maybe she wont be into it, the great thing is...of she isnt,  they can stop. What a crazy idea huh?

3712,WyvernCharm,"I suggest reavaluating what you consider controlling. Having a couple concrete ideas for a date is not controlling, it's actually considered polite/ neccessary.  

Presumably OPs date knows they are meeting at a bookstore and is ok with that, the only surprise is the scavenger hunt. And as long as OP goes with the flow and let's the level of participation be organic,  still not controlling. That's literally just an activity. 

Controlling would be telling their date that they MUST complete all the tasks in order to get a second date, or that they need to ""pass"" it to continue the date into dinner or some shit. 

Alternatively, it could be bringing the date on q surprise activity with higher stakes than browsing a bookstore. Like skydiving, or taking them for a hike when they were expecting a nice dinner. Something that could cross boundaries, or they might physically be unprepared for. But might feel pressured to go along with because it's a date.

And I dont know why some rando would know the process neccesary to open the vault of a cautious mage anyway. It seems more likely to me that that knowledge can only be obtained by the relative.

I would typically expect to see something like that at the beginning of the story, or in conjunction with a larger problem that it doesnt solve all by itself. Like, Eragon doesnt get magic until later on in the story,  but that doesnt give him an out for his problems, if anything it just gets him slightly closer to a level playing field.

If your going to keep the magic I would suggest having a deeper plot and conflict going on either simultaneously, or as a result of the magic itself. Essentially the character realizing she traded one set of problems she could have handled through mundane means for a set much worse that require magic. 

I would probably be pretty upset if I got invested in her story and the whole thing was literally magically solved.",1572898339,f6jporp,t3_drh08u,t5_2qh2n

I'm certainly not suggesting that anyone should be forced to eat what they do not want to, nor that they would be the entirety of a balanced diet by any means.

Only that eating insects is already a valid practice in many cultures, and there is no reason to dismiss it out of hand. The process of farming bugs for consumption is clean, inexpensive, and doesnt have even a fraction of the ecological footprint than say, cattle farming. It will likely become part of our culture sooner rather than later. So I'm getting a head start on conditioning myself to combat some of my western sensibilities.

3801,_HEDONISM_BOT,"He would pursue me vigorously without games. Called me his GF on the first date and wanted to spend all his time with me. He was perfect in every way. Tall, handsome, shredded, charming, sweet, kind, successful, independent, and romantic. He was majestic. On his best behavior 24/7/365 for 2 years out of 3 exactly. Then, suddenly, and seemingly out of nowhere, he started threatening to blow my head off and murder my family before killing himself.

&amp;#x200B;

It was bizarre. BIZARRE. He wanted to die and take me with him, and my family too, by specifically shooting me in the head, execution style, and then executing my family and friends. He was obsessed with this idea. He would threaten me daily. He would find excuses to do it, he would pick fights on days where there was nothing to fight about just so he could threaten me. There wouldn't be a single day where he didn't threaten to ""blow my goddamn head off"", over small shit. Literally, I once left hair in the bathtub and he went there. After 2 months of this behavior, he put his hands on me and that was the first time I told him to stop threatening me and my family or I was out. He stopped for a while but then compulsively began to threaten me again, and after months of ""trying to help"", ""trying to be there"" and wanting to be a good partner, I ran for my life, in the middle of the night, and left my shit behind. He used my belongings to try and get me to come back and then tried to come after me legally. When he couldn't get me to respond, he tried to file a restraining order against me to paint me out to be the crazy one, and he was laughed out of court. He tried everything in the book to start conflict, prolong conflict, and get me to engage in conflict... but I was a rock, inert and unresponsive and never let it get to me. The less I cared, the more he did. He wanted a showdown, a fight, and IDK why. It still puzzles me to this day. He flipped a switch overnight and went from being perfect to being this conflict-obsessed animal that I didn't recognise.

3804,_HEDONISM_BOT,"It has nothing to do with his attraction for you, physically. I've seen this type of response/interaction dynamic before. I can tell from this short screenshot that you're reaching out more than he is, and you're reaching out with more effort. Men know what that means. Men know when a woman is more ""into him"" than he is, ""into her"". They use that against you. Somehow, you tipped off your hand that you're insecure about your looks, and that's why he reacted the way he did when you gave him your selfies. He knows it's a button for him to push to whip you into being desperate for him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Men have these little micro behaviors, each deliberately planned, and carefully executed so they can manipulate you into giving them what they want out of the interaction. He was able to sense your insecurity and leverage and use that to get an upperhand in the conversation and establish himself as the higher value party in your interaction. You reinforced this with your behaviors by reacting to him, responding instantly to him, and double/tripple texting him or texting with more effort than he is. He's responding with 1 or 2 word answers that are convo enders. You're putting real effort into each message, and it looks like you're reaching hard, and it shows in the texts. He knows it and that's why he's replying with short 1 word answers. 

&amp;#x200B;

NEVER EVER EVER put in more effort than a moid in a conversation. Once he knows you're insecure, he'll neg you until you go along with his dynamic that you are the less desirable person in the interaction. A man's goal is to fuck as much as possible as quickly as possible. Men can pump and dump an insecure woman easier than a secure / confident woman, so they work on damaging your self esteem, and throwing you off balance by saying or doing things to make you feel ugly, fat, undesirable, etc. etc. until your behaviors change to reinforce yourself as the lesser desired party in the interaction. Once this is done, he's going to fuck you, ghost you, and make you beg for a text back. This is a shitty dynamic to be stuck into, and I have seen it happen over and over and over again. Don't let yourself fall into that dynamic. Once this dynamic is set, it is next to impossible to break.

Spend a lot of time on OkCupid answering those questions honestly and put your expectations up front on your profile to get the best result. The rest is just up to you to swipe. If you swipe on at least 50 guys a day (might take 10 minutes of time spent on OKC), and at least 50% of those match or message you, you'll be able to go on dates that are fruitful and that won't lead to a ghost or cancelled plans.

2. He's gainfully employed, is in the upper middle class or better, or has a business, and is in the upper middle class or better. 
3. He's educated at the bachelor's degree level, or greater. He has his own house, and car(s). Pets are a bonus, especially cats.
4. He's romantic, sweet, caring, kind, easy to talk to, warm (and not ghosty), mature, and stable mentally, financially, and physically. 
5. He takes the time to plan fun activities and dates, and he pays for everything. He offers to pick me up and drop me off. 
6. He's a gentleman. Will open doors, hold elevator doors, and does those little ""chivalry"" gestures for me. 
7. He's serious about me romantically, and wants to call me his girlfriend within the first few weeks of dating. It's clear, obvious, and there's no ambiguity or games. 
8. In a relationship: He's secure in himself, confident, manly and strong. He feels confident in taking the lead to initiate conversations, he calls me first, and texts me first, without wanting me to take the lead, or feeling insecure if I'm not initiating. He pursues and doesn't feel insecure when he isn't pursued because he is confident, secure in his manliness, and confident enough to allow me to be quiet and meek without feeling insecure about me not initiating or being aggressive.
9. In a relationship: He posts about me to social media, introduces me to family and friends as his GF, and tells me he loves me daily. He calls me pet names and tells me I'm beautiful and compliments me daily. 
10. In a relationship: He initiates sexually and takes the lead in bed. He is secure in his manliness and confident and allows for me to be shy and meek.

&amp;#x200B;

But if you're too lazy or whatever, here's some stuff you could do. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- It might be a yeast infection. Go to CVS and buy Monistat. Read the instructions and use it. WEAR A PAD, it's going to be messy, lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once you've nuked your vaginal flora bacteria, You'll need to restore vaginal flora balance to yourself. I STRONGLY recommend the Yogurt / Tampon method. It has worked for me every time. Please PLEASE remember to use the lowest-sugar yogurt and be sure to check for the live cultures. It fixes my vag every single time after I've ""broken"" it, lol. Here's the yogurt tampon method:  [https://www.healthline.com/health/yogurt-for-yeast-infection](https://www.healthline.com/health/yogurt-for-yeast-infection)  

&amp;#x200B;

but the TL;DR of that article is to basically go get a tampon, go to the grocery store and buy the lowest sugar / lowest fat greek yogurt you can find, and check the back for ""live cultures"". If it's got the cultures, then grab it. Do NOT get flavored yogurt, get the plain ones. Essentially take this yogurt, use a spoon to stir the entire yogurt container to spread the good bacteria around, then pour some out in a cup, go to the bathroom, and use your finger to scoop up the yogurt and literally shove it into your vagina. Scoop it in there. Really glop it in and shove it in there deep. Then dip the tampon's applicator in yogurt and shove it up there, insert it. It'll basically serve as a ""plug"" to keep the yogurt from falling out. Keep it in for a few hours and then remove it.

&amp;#x200B;

He left, it was no big deal. He came back, no big deal. It doesn't appear that exclusivity was discussed or agreed to by both parties, in explicit uncertain terms, and it looks like he maybe expected her to be exclusive to him, while he remained elusive/ambiguous about it.

For the ones that are deal breakers for you, answer honestly, and indicate that the man's response is ""very important"" to you, and the app will filter out dudes who don't meet that requirement. For example. One of the questions was ""I vote in every election"" \[yes\] \[no\] and then it asks you what answers you'll accept from a partner.

3922,_HEDONISM_BOT,"What has worked for me is the below:

**#1: Confidence, Self-esteem and standards**. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. I practice guided mindfulness meditation and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) at least 30 minutes a day, every day, **without exception.** For CBT, I listen to two audiobooks by Dr. David Burns on Audible: ""Feeling Good: The new Mood Therapy"" and ""when panic attacks"". These help you stay grounded, establish consistent and lasting confidence, and maintain your self esteem. Let's face it, and let's be real. Dating is psychologically testing. There is a LOT of male toxicity out there and we need to have the psychological self-defense mechanisms necessary to protect ourselves, especially in the predatory environment of dating. There will be rejection. There will be heart-break. There will be boundary violations, and triggering situations, and 1 in 3 women are sexually assaulted in their lifetimes. Again, mental health is vital and CBT/mindfulness meditation is pivotal in maintaining a persistently healthy set of standards, boundaries, and self-esteem/confidence. 

&amp;#x200B;

**#2: Photofeeler.** There's a website called PhotoFeeler. They have a feature which allows you to upload photos and have them ranked for attractiveness by the opposite gender in a statistically valid way, so you can be objectively aware of which photos work best for you, which angles are not your strongest angles, and which outfits, hairstyles, and settings present you in the best light. THE FIRST 10 UPLOADS WILL HURT. You'll find out (like I did) that what you think is attractive or a good angle for you, is in fact, your least flattering perspective. As you modify your photos and learn what does and doesn't work for you in terms of photos, your attractiveness scores for the photos will improve, and you'll have the best photos to use for online dating, and this will translate to significant changes to how you're received on OLD platforms. 

&amp;#x200B;

**#3: For your profile**. Write out exactly what you want in a relationship on your tinder bio / OKC profile. Leave no room for uncertainty. This is VERY important. The more upfront you are about what you're looking for, the less time you'll waste on pointless dates where it eventually comes out that you're incompatible. It is VERY VERY helpful to have your experienced friends look over your profile and give you feedback. Go to the girls in your friend group who've dated the most men. The ones who have had at least 5 relationships. Those girls know everything and their feedback will be GOLDEN. 

&amp;#x200B;

**#4: Date at least 3 men non-exclusively until exclusivity is established**. NEVER EVER EVER date ""only one guy"" at a time. Because he's also dating several girls at the same time. If he's the only guy you're seeing, you'll fall for him, and he might not reciprocate. Date others, let one of them come up with exclusivity as their own idea, and then cut off the other men you're seeing to be exclusive. This will also help you act busy, and will help you figure out what you do and don't like. Drop what you don't like, and swipe on what you do like.",1570464143,f2wcndq,t3_dekd2z,t5_xaiot

Seriously. I took up Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and I learned in CBT that people can be addicted to emotional states. Some folks are addicted to anger, some are addicted to jealousy, some are addicted to insecurity, some are addicted to humiliation and feeling inadequate, and some people are addicted to conflict. Some are addicted to control, arousal/alertness, etc. etc. It's like crack / cocaine to them.

One of the coworkers I work with is addicted to control, conflict, jealousy, winning a competition, and emotional arousal. She thrives in environments where there's chaos.

They go above and beyond in pointing out qualities and traits about themselves, which they personally believe, make them ""nice"", but fail to include those other behaviors which turn women off. Behaviors like aloofness, acting cold, putting forth very little or zero effort in dating, and generally being very dry, lackluster, and unappealing. Again, I'm being very very blunt and honest here, but typically, if a guy's going out of his way to describe himself as ""nice"", and complaining that women aren't into him, you can bet your sweet ass that he's not paying for dates, that he's not calling or texting her to say good morning. that he's not telling her she's beautiful, or making romantic gestures. That he's not making her feel special. That he takes hours to respond back, or doesn't respond at all. That he's texting multiple girls at once, while expecting her to be exclusive to him, that he keeps her guessing about how he feels about her, that he will make rude remarks about her weight, preference, or other qualities about her.

Some men hate exhibitionist (attention seeking) behaviors and because of this, Lingerie is a huge turn off for those men. These types of men often times love subtlety and modesty. I'm going to give you a quick pointer on how I get this type of man to become obsessed with me, with a few sexually powerful moves that they can't resist. I hope you find it helpful

&amp;#x200B;

Sex usually lasts between 18 seconds to 30 minutes. It's not the main act that this type of man is going to fantasize about when he jerks off to it later. What works best for this type of man is the foreplay. The anticipation. The lead up. He wants to be teased. Cuddle up in bed first. Watch something relaxing or funny together. Spoon each other, with him being the big spoon, and you, the little spoon. Casually start rubbing his thigh with your hand, or casually rub his forearm, in a gentle, relaxing way. keep this up for like 10 minutes. Kiss his forearm here and there, and leave it at that. Gently rub your ass on his crotch. Kind of rub your legs against his every once in a while. This lets him know you enjoy his touch. Then leave things be. This is building up the tease. 

&amp;#x200B;

At night when you're going to bed, put something on TV. Assume the ""sleeping in his arms"" position, where he wraps his arm around you, and you tuck yourself into him. Casually and gently rub his chest, specifically the pecs, do it kind of mindlessly and cluelessly. They REALLY like that. Over time, escalate to rubbing his stomach and his pecs, every once in a while plant a small kiss on his inner chest. A light, brief one. And leave it at that. While in his arms, Move your thigh up and put it on top of his. Occasionally rub your thigh against his legs, longingly, like you're doing a stretch-hug, almost. Every once in a while, plant a series of 3 light kisses in his inner chest where your head is (close to his nipple). Literally enjoy this time, cuddle him with no sexual intent. If he's sleeping on his back, kind of sleep close to him, in a way to make your ass touch him, lol. Literally rub your ass on him, slowly and gently. If you can get away with putting a thigh on him, do it. The constant touching will help him bring his guard down. Once it's down, and he relaxes, he'll be more open and receptive to sex. When you know it's going to lead to sex, prolong the teasing for as long as possible. Get him to a place where he can't stand it anymore and he jumps you, lol. Like continue to rub him until he takes your pants off. Then don't rush to take your panties off. Rub your ass on him, gently, nonchalantly until he moves to take them off. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to suck him off. Start with kissing his chest and stomach. Literally bombard his chest with light, gentle kisses and do that for a while, slowly, and then slowly move downwards. Then lick lightly once or twice, and then move back up with the kissing. After a while of this, light sucking, and teasing. As you get more into it, consider giving him an oral creampie. Make sure to lightly flicker your tongue on the head when he's cumming and stroke the shaft. Let it all go in your mouth, and then spit or swallow if you want. HE WILL LOSE HIS MIND. 

&amp;#x200B;

These types of men LOVE being teased. When you get him to a  point where you know you're going to have PIV sex. Take his dick and use the tip as a ""dildo"". Rub it all over your clit, over and over and over again. Masturbate with it. This will tease him HARD, and every once in a while slide it in a little, but not all the way, pull it back out and continue masterbating with it. Do this for as long as he can stand it. You'll notice that this will build up the tension so much, he'll cum himself as soon as he pushes it in and you bounce on it a little.

3955,_HEDONISM_BOT,"You put your relationships into boxes. Online dating provides you with so many options. Here's the approach which worked best for me:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Swipe left on the HOTTEST guys only.
2. for hookups: pick one or two that you're going to sleep with. Ideally, this person will be physically attractive and make you feel hot and bothered and turned on. Ideally this man will work hard to wine and dine you first. Go get this out of your system if you've got the ""fear of missing out"" bug. Remember and keep in mind that this man that you're seeing is only a hookup and you're both free to see others. 
3. Of those left-swipes, go for those men who have those relationship qualities that you want. It's okay to date men for relationships, and other men for hookups. I recommend you date multiple men at once.  This is how you can keep yourself busy and occupied and it helps you from thinking about any one man. 
4. This is really important. In all of this, take ZERO shit from men. Ghost any man who isn't paying for dates, who doesn't make you feel special, and who isn't treating you well. Ghost any man who you're not attracted to, or don't feel like they're relationship material. It's okay to reject unsuitable men.",1570390152,f2t2n3d,t3_de1h2b,t5_xaiot

He knew she wanted to be exclusive. The dynamic is all wrong. She needed to see other men, he needed to worry that she was going to meet someone else and disappear from his life.

He was so angry that he threw an iPad against the wall. Why? He found out his ""ex"" got engaged. An engagement is very very serious. She's not going to leave that guy anytime soon.

IMMEDIATELY SWIPE LEFT ON ANY MAN WHO:

\- Doesn't mention employment or income in their bios. They're unemployed. Some unemployed moids will put ""self-employed"" but will have typos, spelling errors, and other giveaways that show you he can barely read and is probably unemployed.

\- Doesn't want anything serious, or only wants hookups or ""FWBs"". Men who flat out say marriage isn't for them. SWIPE LEFT.

\- Put that they're ""finishing up a degree"" or are ""still in school"". No sis, he dropped out or is dropping out. Some of them might actually be in school, but over 90% of them aren't. They'll put that shit on there to get women who are obsessed with ""potential"" to fall for their ""potential"" and respond back. IF HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS DEGREE ALREADY, SWIPE LEFT.

\- Uses the term ""G.E.D"" ANYWHERE IN HIS PROFILE. SWIPE LEFT. SWIPE LEFT SWIPE LEFT!!!!!!!!!!!

\- Doesn't have a photo of himself in his profile, or every single photo is a group photo, and you gotta play ""where's waldo"" to figure out which one he is. He's doing that because he's insecure. This will spill over in the relationship. DON'T DATE INSECURE MEN.

\- Uses derogatory, misogynistic (Th\*t, H\*e, B word, SL\*T, etc) terms to refer to women, or uses the word ""females"", or says shit like ""Just here to see if there are any good women out there"". This is a red pilled man or an incel, SWIPE LEFT IMMEDIATELY.

\- Has pics/vids of him smoking a blunt. He's immature, hasn't outgrown the teenager's mindset, and is probably unemployed (or underemployed). SWIPE LEFT.

\- uses language like ""I get money all day, on my grind, or I hustle"". This kid is lower middle class at BEST, and insecure about it. SWIPE LEFT.

\- Has a """" ""music"" ""career"" """". This type of man is a narcissist, and has the HIGHEST AMOUNT of drama, conflict, instability, poverty, and chaos in their life. THey will spend WEEKS on a gig that's going to pay them $170, and you'll be stuck in the role of ""fan"" and ""supporting girlfriend"". He will have a ridiculous name like ""BigDickSEAN"" or ""TopGUNNA\_MIKE"" or ""Pu$$yEater69696969696969$$$"" You'll have to spend endless hours commenting on his ""YouTube"" ""Channel"", and his ""Soundcloud"" ""page"", and referring to him as a ""rapper"" or ""lyricist"" or ""artist"" and you will be 9 out of his 17 ""fans"" and followers on social media. You'll be expected to spend your time following him on twitter and commenting on his ""latest"" ""album"". He will mass-spam his ""music"" to your family, friends, coworkers, and linkedin contacts. He will expect you to talk about it at work functions and events. He might even bring copies of his ""mixtapes"" to these events and try to pass them out. You will be taken for a WHIRLWIND of emotional ups and downs and you will end up with several mental health issues trying to date this type of moid. You will be too embarrassed to confront your coworkers, colleagues, grad school associates, and law-school classmates after they've heard his ""music"". People will distance themselves from you, and your calls will begin to go to voicemail, and you will begin to slowly become uninvited from basic functions because your coworkers and friends will be too embarrassed to be seen with you. He will cheat on you with his ""fans"" and will like photos of women on social media. Your best friend will end up on reddit over-explaining this type of moid to other women because she's heard all about it FOR YEARS and was there during the whole ordeal.

\- Blank profiles: ASSUME HE'S FRESH OUT OF PRISON, AND HIS PAROLE OFFICER IS IN THE ROOM. SWIPE LEFT.

\- Men with their ""niece"" on their profile. That's his child, he's looking for childless women and he'll ""surprise you"" with his child/baby mama drama after 6 months of dating and after you're hooked. Swipe left NOW and save yourself the heartache.

Oh yeah and ""*I'm looking for a down to earth girl*"" means ""*I'm looking for a chick that has ZERO standards, and will pick me up from my parents house so I can come over to her place to netflix and chill after a McDonald's dollar menu date, that she pays for* "".",1571079068,f3qqdyv,t3_dhrvdq,t5_xaiot

I learned from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) work that people can be addicted to emotional states. People can be addicted to feeling insecure and feeling jealous or outraged. These emotional states provide hidden rewards for people that are addictive and hard to let go of. For example, an insecure person usually has shoulder(s) to cry on. Their friends and family will flood them with reassuring messages and support. Everyone gives an insecure person sympathy, and some people even go out of their way to ""help"" you when you're insecure.

It's important to learn to be alone, but if you're using your alone time to nitpick at your own insecurities and ruminate endlessly about your ex, a distraction might be more suitable.

I will ALWAY advise women to set up OLD profiles IMMEDIATELY, just to see what's out there. If you're obsessed and infatuated with your ex, it'll help to flood yourself with hot, sexy men, and you can NEVER EVER EVER have too many ""good morning beautiful"" texts from hot men.

You do NOT have to disclose the number of partners you've had. You don't. Do a ""cost/benefit"" analysis. What would this information do for you? Why is it SO IMPORTANT for you to disclose this?? Is it ""to be honest?"". Well how will this ""honesty"" benefit you? Is your man being honest with you? Is he 100% honest about everything, 100% of the time?? Even if he is, what will disclosing your past do for you, other than (probably) change his image of you, and the relationship dynamic?

&amp;#x200B;

I want women to experience the greatest success in dating. Period. If you guys don't believe me, run a series of tests. Seriously. Go to Google and pick out some chick's photo and set up a fake dating profile for a girl. Test out this strategy. Go through and find 10 high quality men who pass all of your filters, and divulge an imaginary number of exes (33). See how each and every one reacts. This is the test I ran, and almost all of them ghosted my fake profile. It was a unanimous response. I STRONGLY recommend creating a ""dummy"" profile, where you test out the dating advice we give you. I've tested out SEVERAL strategies, and divulging your sexual past is something that's going to turn off every single man you come across, except maybe for the rare 1% of men you run across.",1571016338,f3ofarb,t3_dhdlw1,t5_xaiot

Then under ""more"", in the ""children"" box, check the options you want. I checked ""wants kids"" and ""might want kids"", and I unchecked ""doesn't want kids"", AND, I checked ""doesn't have kids"", and made sure to leave ""has Kid(s)"" unchecked. Under ""Education"", I made sure to check ""University"" and ""post grad"" only, and left ""high school"" and ""two-year college"" unchecked. I left the pets category unchecked.

4069,_HEDONISM_BOT,"&gt;I have had the same results with every photo I've tried and many have been gorgeous shots with exotic scenery and good composition or funny moments.

This presents the very core of the problem at hand. What you think is an exquisite photo could be unappealing to the opposite sex. You might discover that a cutesy photo with an adorable kitten will score higher among your target audience, and you'll never find out.

&amp;#x200B;

You seem to be resigned and willing to accept this idea here, which is riddled with cognitive distortions (Cognitive behavioral therapy) ""*I don't think that's remotely probable. If anything I have a below average face structurally and I think this is the highest I can simply score*"" because you seem to struggle with low-confidence and/or low-self-esteem.

&amp;#x200B;

Your score of 5.0 or whatever indicates that you do not have ""a below average face"", since a below average face would score a 4.3 or a 2.0 or something. This is a distortion called ""discounting the positive"" which you are engaging in. I also see evidence of ""all or nothing thinking"", and ""jumping to conclusions"". I also see several other cognitive distortions (labeling, minimizations of positives, maximizations of negatives - both are the ""magnification"" distortion) in your comments/posts.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I recommend this book ""Feeling Good: The new mood therapy"" by Dr. David Burns and also ""When panic attacks"". Both are available as audiobooks from the audible app and you need to listen to them over and over and over again until the messages stick. You've gotta persist and really really be diligent in applying the concepts and methods. Do the work and give it a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm recommending this because your biggest problem with online dating appears to be your self-defeating beliefs, and the very obvious and pervasive cognitive distortions which permeate from your post and comments. Until you get a grip on these and learn to defeat them and improve your mental health, you won't be able to find legitimate solutions to your online dating problems because your self-defeating beliefs, harmful/unhelpful thinking patterns, and the subsequent behaviors will defeat you at every turn and undermine your efforts.

&gt;It is an objectively good portrait shot of me smiling that represents me well in good lighting.

&amp;#x200B;

This is actually the problem. You've run your photos with others and the views of your friends will be biased. Your friends aren't going to want to risk getting you upset or hurt your feelings or tell you unpleasant information. This is why photofeeler is best, because they ask your TARGET AUDIENCE what they find appealing. Don't give up. Take the feedback, and learn from it. Apply it to the next round of uploads. I want to challenge you to upload at least 50 photos to photofeeler, ONE AT A TIME, and let them get to at least 50 votes. Take the feedback from the comments and apply it. Notice which poses give the highest scores, and which poses don't. Notice which settings are the best scoring, and which ones aren't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking because your first 10 or 20 will hurt. These are the photos which reveal to you the sad reality that what you consider as ""attractive"" to the opposite sex is very different from what the opposite sex finds attractive.

It's very important to persist through this uncomfortable stage where you're learning what does and doesn't work.  As you learn this info, each subsequent photo will build upon what you've learned, the scores will improve, and you'll eventually asymptote at or near your peak ""score"".

&amp;#x200B;

This might work for a while. Eventually we might reach a point where results will be needed, and visible measurements of improvement will be required for funding to continue in this field. Every time there's a mass shooting, or a bunch of kids take their own life, or something crazy / ridiculous happens, people will ask ""what's working? What's broken"". Sooner or later, the field of psychology will have to confront the reality that someone somewhere might start asking ""what are we missing?"", usually when a funding stream is ""not seeing results"" and is under attack.

4150,_HEDONISM_BOT,"Here's a genetic perspective. Men in societies all over earth try to circumvent the basic biological reality that women are the gatekeepers of life. Women get to decide which male fathers offspring. Men have removed/altered this choice through thousands of years of war (killing men/keeping women) to alter paternity by removing choice (killing their male competitors).

&amp;#x200B;

Men fucked themselves. Men were the ones killing other men to eliminate their ""competition"" for a genetic spot in the next generation of offspring. Sooner or later, there will be no going around female choice of paternity. Women will choose who gets to father their offspring, without men eliminating their ability to choose as the world becomes more progressive and less religious. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's getting harder and harder to engage in imperialism and provide men an opportunity for war, and a chance to eliminate men / male competition, with the current power structures in the world. Birth Control and progressivism is also spreading, and religious control of women's bodies / fertility is on the decline. The birth rate is also declining and more women are choosing to become mothers, and choosing who's going to father their children, and aborting unwanted pregnancies, many of them from unfit fathers. In a few generations, humanity will look VERY different from what it looks like now. I hope male toxicity dies out in a few generations....

You can tell he was, and so can I. This type of man who's very successful lures women in, who then fall in love with their ""potential"", and this is the psychological ""hook"" he uses to keep her coming back for more. When she asks for commitment, or wants more out of the relationship, they express disinterest, and keep her coming back for more, by nitpicking at her insecurities, and keeping her ""in line"", perpetually in a state of insecurity, hurt, and heartbreak. This is what some women need to be ""kept in line"" by men like this. The only way to properly handle this type of man is to straight up come to the table in a psychologically sound state, with complete confidence and security in yourself. This will allow you to refuse to engage with him, and refuse to cave into his psychological traps, and to have the dignity, confidence, and security in yourself to leave when he tries to reel you in with negging, nitpicking at your insecurities, and his lack of commitment. EXACTLY how this OP handled it. She came to the table CORRECT. MENTALLY SOUND, and resistant to negging, insecurity, and bullshit.

üì∑

We dated for 9 months and I ended it because he was messing me about and said he didn't know what he wanted and he was bad at developing relationships.

I told him that when he met someone he liked, he would know.

Anyway we stayed friends (which was probably a mistake because I liked him a lot) and he recently told me he met someone and he thinks he's going to marry her. Less than a year after I broke it off.

I'm happy for him but also it hurts so much. Less than a year and he's just walked into a great relationship for him, despite telling me he's a commitment-phobe, and I'm still stuck on the dating carousel of despair.

I'm not religious but I feel like god is punishing me :( I feel so deeply unloveable. Like I will never find my person.

How do you stay positive?

If we expect men to be better, tell them why. It's really not that much effort. 

First of all. It is not your job or place to teach a man how to behave and treat a girl.

 I'm also considering how  maybe the ""aftermath"" of the trauma and how it puts things into perspective that reveals we DID ""cope"" maybe not as well.

Hear me out, it's a weird paradox I've been trying to pick out since I read your comment. We (INFjs) can assume we're coping during that trauma because we don't register it as a ""trauma/conflict"", so we think it's normal and push down out emotions, get confused by Ni-Ti ect. We're coping in small ways like taking breaks/escaping in our heads/to places/rooms ect. (our introversion), we use our idealism to create a better future/scenarios and live in our heads, we get lost in our hobbies like reading. In this way we are built to protect ourselves, and cope well because INFJs are pretty self-centred, thus we can numb ourselves from the world and how it affects us (not sure if this is right).

So once we're out of our heads and dealing with acts that develop the trauma their in doses we can manage during the time eg. getting your siblings ready for school, paying the bill, cooking, --all that trauma is individual. In the moment, it's so normal and small that it would barely affect us.

However, it isn't until we get overwhelmed with ni-ti and pile these individual moments/actions up together that we break down. We break down ""after"" this, not during it. **It's not the acts of trauma itself that makes us not cope, it's out memory and understanding of it.** That is why you hear about the aftermath of trauma in this subreddit not so much the ongoing issues which are often presented as ni-ti.

Mass swiping is the GREATEST advantage a woman has in Online Dating. Having 40 messages in your inbox, and only getting back to the top 15 is my current strategy.

I personally would never do Bumble. The premise of the app puts women at a dating disadvantage by setting them up to take on the burden of courting, when they don't have to.

That's not the best strategy for you. If you're on Tinder or OKC, ONLY SWIPE RIGHT on the HOTTEST men, who make you drool. Swipe on like 500 men, and don't stop. Only swipe on the hottest men, and about 30% of those 500 will be hot. A lot of them will match with you instantly (or will match with you when they next login and see your card in their swipe stack). The messages will trickle in. Of those, get back to like 10, and keep swiping. Log off and repeat tomorrow. 300 moids, only swipe right on the hottest, and then get off. After a week of doing this, your inbox will be cluttered with messages from the hottest moids that you've matched with. Only get back to the best quality ones. Don't stop swiping. Literally keep it moving. This allows you to create competition for your time/affections. Ghost the 3/10 you're dealing with. He's not into you, sis.

&amp;#x200B;

I am an attractive woman. My PhotoFeeler scores on my pictures are between 7.2 - 9.5. Most of the recent ones are leaning towards 9.2 - 9.5 because I've learned what does and doesn't work with men for photos. I NEED THIS ADVICE. I have been treated like COMPLETE SHIT by some of my exes. I've been cheated on, had my time wasted, and was strung along. I've been engaged twice and walked away from both men. 

&amp;#x200B;

I learned some of the information we discuss here on FDS the old fashioned way, by going through it in my own relationships. Some info, I've gleaned from books like ""Why men marry some women and not others"" and ""The Rules"". Some info, I learned from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) books by Dr. David Burns. Since discovering FDS, I haven't had to pay for any dates, haven't been treated like trash by any man, and have legitimately begun to see improvements in the types of men who are in my online dating inboxes. Some of the most useful advice that I've learned from this subreddit are: 

1. NEVER EVER commit to a man who isn't committed to you. If exclusivity isn't EXPLICITLY DISCUSSED and agreed to, by both parties... it shouldn't be assumed, and both parties should continue seeing others. 
2. NEVER pay for dates. This creates an additional filter for men who are wasting your time/bullshitting. If it's expensive to date/waste your time, they won't be doing it. They'll filter themselves out of your life, early on, and you'll eliminate unqualified men and fuckboys a LOT faster &amp; have more fun being spoiled and taken out. 
3. NEVER EVER reveal your sexual past to ANYONE, it's a major turn off for most men and will scare most of them away and destroy their attraction to you. 
4. Present yourself in the best light, put effort into your photos, online dating bio, and be clear, upfront, and firm with what you want. 
5. Vet men extensively. Only swipe right on the HOTTEST MEN who meet your list of ""wants/qualifications"". Swipe often, and without reservations. Swipe left on men who are unappealing, who have low effort profiles, who aren't looking for relationships or who have misogynistic information (those are incels). 
6. NEVER date just one man at a time. ALWAYS be dating a few men on rotation. NEVER worry about any one man or get your feelings hung up on any one man. Message at LEAST 15 guys at a time. This will force you to take longer to get back to some men, making them compete for your time/attention/affections.
7. Be high quality/high value. Don't be too available, too soon. Don't text or call more than he does. Don't initiate contact or plan dates either, and definitely don't pay for shit. YOU STILL OWE HIM NOTHING. 

the information I've learned &amp; shared here has been INVALUABLE, and I appreciate every single poster who takes the time to share their experience with what does/doesn't work for men and I *really really REALLY* appreciate the harsh truth tellers, the controversial advice posters, and the brave women who go out on a limb to share very unconventional (but successful) dating information/advice which maximizes female benefit.

Some hold onto misery, suffering, and twisted thinking patterns because they're scared of changing themselves and see the process of change as being too much work and out of their range of capabilities.

What you do is swipe on 300 moids. Some will match, and some won't. When they log in tomorrow, your card will appear in their stack, because you right swiped him. He either will or won't message. You won't worry about that though, because if you're using Tinder with maximum benefit/success for yourself in mind, you will have swiped on 300 moids and at least 40 of them will have messaged you back.

&amp;#x200B;

What are you doing to get this result? Are you only swiping on like 10, and then worrying about them? Don't do that, sis. NEVER worry about a single moid. KEEP IT MOVING. Unmatch ghosty moids, unmatch moids who don't text first and unmatch boring / lackluster moids. Keep it moving.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're struggling with this, set a basic rule for yourself. You are on tinder for 30 minutes a day, max. 20 minutes will be for swiping. 10 minutes for responding to moids. SMOTHER yourself with moid attention. This will kill any desperation and neediness that you have. Sign up for Tinder, OKCupid, Match, and all of the moid infested apps. Once you have all the attention you need and want, and you legitimately feel no desire to worry about any one moid. THEN you can begin to take dating seriously.

üì∑

Two years ago I dated a woman who was a cousin of one of my friends. We met at a birthday party and I asked her out. We hit it off. She had just gotten out of a relationship, but was fine with dating me. We got along great. Had the same interests, texted or saw each other everyday, etc.. I took her out to dinners and beach trips, all paid for by me cause she was broke and had no job. I did everything for this person and I wasnt expecting anything in return besides a little respect and gratitude. I even found her a job and helped her with a car payment at one point. Shortly after helping her find a job she came to me with ""I dont want to be intimate with you anymore, because I feel like I'm not over my ex still"". My response was that I was fine with it. She suggested proceeding as friends and I agreed. Then a week later I find her tinder profile advertising to do the very same activities she was doing with me the last few months. She also had been making mild comments about dating other guys when we would hang out. I called her out on her shit and the chaos that ensued ended my friendship with her and my mutual friend. She basically tried to claim that I only wanted to be friends so that I could date her again at some point. She also(conveniently) never paid me back some money I had lent her and started ghosting me. The irony is that on social media, people praise her for being strong and independent and I'm treated like the asshole. I wish that she had just told me why she really wanted to stop dating me and start seeing other guys. Ladies please, if you're gonna stop dating a guy, please be honest about why. How are we ever supposed to improve if you cant be honest about what went wrong or didnt click?

Tl;dr woman used me as a rebound and I'm considered the asshole.

Some people care about their partners history some dont. I wish I was the kind that didnt, but I cant. As soon as I start to like someone, the thought of them being with someone else makes me feel physically sick. I've dealt with this before too, and it makes me want to ask questions and pry, even though I have no business knowing and the answer might hurt me. The stupid thing is I have a history too, obviously, and it doesn't seem to bother anyone I've seen. I've been trying to not think about it, and for the most part it works, but when it comes to things like discussing that we should both get STD tested, it forces me to think about it and it hurts.

### [I \[33M\] broke up with my girlfriend \[29F\]. I've been told that I'm overreacting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dmj12a/i_33m_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_29f_ive_been/)

üì∑

My ex an I were in a relationship for three months and dating for four before that.

We weren't exclusive during those four months, and we were just casually dating. After four months, I realized how happy she made me, and decided that I wanted to make it official. So I asked her to be my girlfriend. She smiled and said she really liked me but she wasn't sure she wanted to put a title on things, and asked if I would give her the weekend to think about it.

I figured it was a blow off, but on that Sunday she called me up and said she was absolutely sure the answer was yes.

We've been very happy and things have gone well, other than that we hadn't had sex yet. She said she wanted to wait until she was ready, which I've been cool with. I understand it, or at least I thought I did.

So this past weekend, she decided she was ready. I planned a big romantic dinner, took her to see a play, and showed her a very nice time.

As we got back to my place, I joked that I was glad she was ready because it had been about a year for me. She laughed and said, ""Yeah, I'm sorry.""

I replied that it was ok and that I respected that she had to be ready because it was probably a while for her too. She started averting her gaze and said, ""Well, not as long as you.""

I responded, ""We've been involved for seven months. How much not as long?""

She wanted to drop the subject, but I was upset and kept pressing. She finally admitted that she had been seeing me and someone else at the beginning. She liked me more, but she already had a date set up with this other guy that weekend when I asked her.

Her friend advised her to go on the date, have sex with the guy, get it out of her system, and say yes to me after so it wouldn't be cheating. She did exactly this, ended it with him, and called me up after.

I told her to get out of my car. She started sobbing and apologizing saying that it was a mistake. I told her I didn't care. I told her that she lied to me, as far as I'm concerned she absolutely did cheat, she buried it for three months, and then acted like sex was something special and important to her when in actuality it was something to get out of her system with someone else.

I told her it was over and I never wanted to see her again. She begged me to forgive her and I told her it's not happening.

She's texted me numerous apologies saying she wishes she could go back and change it and I've ignored her. Her friend, yes the one that gave her the advice, called me up and said that I should be mad at her and not my ex. I replied that I actually am angry with both of them because they are both terrible people.

A friend of mine told me that I was overreacting and we weren't exclusive until she said yes, but that feels like such contrived garbage to me that I won't even hear it. Am I overreacting? Did I make the right choice?

Instead of ghosting him at the 2 week stage, she let her desperation continue to guide her further into entertaining him until he had her hooked, 2 years later. Now that she's hooked, it's harder to pull the plug and just leave. Sooner or later, this dude will meet a girl he is into. He's going to chase and pursue this girl, and OP is going to watch his new GF get wined and dined, get dinners paid for, get introduced to family and friends, get shown off like a trophy, get his affections and attentions, while OP quietly lurks and stalks his social media from afar, wondering why she's ""not good enough"".

&amp;#x200B;

I see it over and over and over and over and over again on the breakup, heartbreak, dating/exnocontact and other relationship subreddits. Some of these women are stuck on these men for years. I knew a girl in college that put herself in this situation. Of course she grew up catholic and became so desperate for this one man's affections that she threw herself at him constantly. Eventually this turned him off, and he dumped her. She continued stalking him for years after, and I spent my college years being an absorbent shoulder for her to cry on. She NEVER EVER went on another date or entertained another man. We lost touch after graduation and eventually, I ran into her at a Walgreens almost 4 years later and she told me she ""was still the same. She misses Michael the same, still"".

### [Will he ever be ready](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dnoph4/will_he_ever_be_ready/)

üì∑

So I (F30) have been seeing a man (30) for almost 2 years, we started out as friends and eventually started sleeping together. He is a pretty complicated person, very, very introverted, lives alone, doesn't maintain alot of friendships. For a while he was depressed and I believe I still is, he was unemployed and didn't see anyone except me for alot of this time.

He has told me on multiple occasions that he loves me, he has told me he wants me to move back home with him, we have jokingly talked about how we would raise our kids, sometimes when we are out he refers to me as his girlfriend. I really believe I'm the only person he has slept with since we have been sleeping together (I've asked him directly) But whenever I bring up us being in a relationship he always says that his not ready. Reasons being that he can't support me the way he thinks a man should or he can't treat me the way I deserve (he seriously never writes back to people including me, I've had friends of his msg me because he doesn't respond, he actually didn't have a phone for 6 months when I first meet him)

I am actually in love with him. We stay up late and talk for hours together. He pushes me to be who I want to be. I think he loves me too but whenever we get to close a wall goes up and he pushes me away for a little while, then we just restart the cycle a month later. Growing up he moved alot had a bit of a rough childhood and I believe he was in a way neglected.

I don't know what to do I physically hurt when the wall appears. And I just don't know if I should let time progress things or if I have to give up on him. He does actually tell me that I should be looking for other people because I deserve happiness, funny though get pretty jealous when I talk to other guys. I don't want anyone else and he keeps pulling me back in.

Has anyone ever ended up with this person after so long of not actually being a couple?

It sounds like you feel like you are expected to give ""good ones"" a chance. This is part of the misogynistic psychological damage that I've seen on reddit that happens to women when they're around predatory men and their stockholm  syndrome sympathizers. You are fed SO MUCH propaganda telling you that you need to give a ""nice guy"" a chance, that you should feel awful for dumping a man when there's ""nothing wrong with him"", yet men are free to leave relationships for any reason, and they're cheered for finally going after their happiness. NO SIS. You can leave ANY MAN for ANY reason, and you don't need an excuse or justification. You weren't feeling it, is your ""nice, polite"" way of saying ""there was no chemistry"". It's okay. Men are allowed to say they're not attracted to their wife anymore, and leave/abandon their families and nobody bats an eye. So it's okay for YOU to leave a ""nice/good man"" if you're not attracted to him, nobody in this subreddit will bat an eye at you. You're not a monster, or some sort of horrible human for having feelings (or lack thereof).

But my feelings didn‚Äôt come back so I knew I needed to communicate better with him. 

This seems more like you're spending time with men who you are just not that into. It sounds like you're just not that into them to begin with, and you ""convinced"" yourself to date them, and then halfway through, you come to your senses and realize that you're not that into them. Or maybe you were, and they did something to turn you off. It's okay. Your feelings are valid.

&amp;#x200B;

YOU DON'T OWE THEM ANYTHING, sis. You can end a relationship whenever you want, for ANY REASON, or no reason at all. Your feelings are VALID BY DEFAULT. You don't need to explain yourself. You don't need to justify your choices to anyone.

By the way, it's totally okay to only date men who you're completely into. You're not being a monster, you're not being ridiculous or unreasonable. You don't owe men a chance, especially the ones you're not into. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see this a LOT in women. They've been put through YEARS of people telling them that they need to give certain guys a chance. That makes a lot of women feel like they OWE ""nice guys"" a chance, and they don't. You don't owe anybody ANYTHING.

First and foremost, DO NOT throw yourself at him the way these other girls did. They failed because they don't understand that men don't like it when women make the first move.

How do you get him to chase you? Be his friend. Be innocent, cheerful, fun to be around, and make it rewarding for him to have a friendship for you. That's the only way to get this type of man to initiate. When you hang out, make sure your looks are ON POINT. Dress modestly and take care of your hair and makeup. Make sure you look nice. Be his best friend. DO NOT talk about sex, sexuality, your exes, your past, who you're dating in an attempt ""to make him jealous"".

### [Now That I'm Wiser](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/dnr9sk/now_that_im_wiser/)

üì∑

Five years ago, I said ""I do"" for the wrong reasons. I was overly optimistic and naive, and I ignored all the red flags in our relationship. I felt guilty at the thought of hurting him; I missed the opportunity to be honest with myself that there were more hard times than there were happy times. I didn't face my low self esteem head on, and neglected to better understand my needs, my wants, my heart; I failed to be my biggest advocate.

Here are a few important things I've learned that I'd like to pass along:

1. When your partner says the main reason s/he loves you is because you take care of her/him, run. When kids come into the picture, your partner will disappoint you with her/his selfishness and self-centeredness. In my case, my partner turned to other women for attention and validation while I struggled with our young child.
2. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. My partner lies about so many little things. It makes one crazy to think about the bigger things that are being lied about.
3. Adopt a dog together. You can gauge her/his level of patience, compassion, and empathy when raising the dog together. Kids require so much love, kindness, and patience. In my case, my partner would rather browse YouTube videos rather than engage with them because he is always ""tired and needs a break from \[his\] long work days"".
4. Energy levels need to be in sync. If your partner runs on less energy than you and sleeps way before you do, there will be issues. In my case, the issues center around child care and sex.
5. Sex. Your partner should be respectful of you and your boundaries. Just because s/he has her own fetishes and fantasies does not mean you need to oblige. Porn is not real life.
6. Have similar humor, core values, and¬† respectfulness (comparable behavior/decorum; an acceptance and understanding of each other's cultures, family, friends). Birds of a feather flock together.
7. Spending habits/budgeting and an understanding of needs over wants, with a flexibility to know that needs and wants change based on circumstances like growing a family or job loss. Being unable to indulge in a luxury vehicle should not be cause for argument.
8. Kindness is not weakness. Nice is never enough.
9. Sincerity is baseline.
10. Integrity is non negotiable.
11. Healthy communication is a must. If your partner solves problems by stonewalling, gaslighting, etc., you'll find so many of your days wasted on maneuvering around bullshit.
12. There is zero tolerance for physical, emotional, mental, and financial abuse; or cheating. Know your worth. If you don't know your worth, take the time to figure it out.

The first few dates/weeks in the relationship, they'll throw everything at you, sweep you off your feet, make grand romantic gestures, and then, once they sense that you're ""hooked"", they stop entirely. The goal of this is to get you to call him back to back to back, to get you to double &amp; tripple text him, and to trigger your insecurity and desperation. Desperate, insecure women are easier to fuck for these men.

### [I checked mu ex's reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dn5m10/i_checked_mu_exs_reddit_account/)

üì∑

I broke up three months ago. I regreted it. I used to check her social media/reddit account a few times a day, even tho she had completely stopped posting/commenting anything. We talked, face to face, exactly three weeks ago, she made it clear there wouldn't be any second chances. She also asked me to stop snooping around her reddit account, as it is personal. I obliged. Today was a shit day, I miss her, I miss her so fucking much, I don't know if I can go on without her. I checked her account a few minutes ago, she had made three new comments, after two months of silence, one from two days ago, two from today, one of those just three hours ago. In one of them she was giving support to another redditer, the support I used to recive from her, the support I used to give her, the support we used to share, the support I so much need, the support I chose to end.

I'm blocking her after this post, I've blocked her everywhere already, except on text. She's moving on with her life, four days ago a friend told me she already has a new boyfriend, I saw them laughing together the next day, they seemed happy.

One day everything will make sense, I just hope I'll feel like this life was woth it when I get there.

4459,_HEDONISM_BOT,"&gt;**So I‚Äôve recently started seeing this guy who has been insanely nice and seems to really have all his stuff together. We‚Äôve been on about 7 dates within the past month and a half and have taken it to the next level and are now sleeping together. We don‚Äôt get to see each other really all that regularly because we‚Äôre both pretty busy, but so far everything has pretty much gone perfectly.**

&amp;#x200B;

You fucked him before he declared that he wanted to be exclusive with you. MAJOR MISTAKE #1. You accepted the conditions of him setting up a dynamic where he's not committed to you, doesn't have to see you regularly, and still gets to fuck you.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**First of all, I don‚Äôt actually know how serious he wants to take things. We have a pretty big age gap and he has children and I don‚Äôt, so we had agreed to start seeing each other casually.** **Lately he‚Äôs loosely thrown around the bf/gf terms and has been using pet names (babe/sweetheart), but I haven‚Äôt met any of his friends or his children.**

&amp;#x200B;

He's older so he MIGHT be more experienced at dating than you are. This gives him an advantage. You agreed to start seeing each other casually - this was major mistake #2.

&amp;#x200B;

You aren't ""Conditioned"" to attract shitty men. This man is a shitty man. You have given up all negotiating and bargaining power in the relationship and he's going to dump you once you start demanding titles, seriousness, or exclusivity. This is because the dynamic is already established. You've already used everything you got, and he knows you're the more interested party.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to demonstrate how fucked this situation is, in non-romantic terms, using a car analogy. It'll be easier to see the situation at hand this way, because most women haven't been psychologically abused, negged, and gaslighted about car prices, and the process of negotiating a car sale, like they are with the process of negotiating a relationship and ""relationship costs, terms, and conditions"".

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine that you find an AMAZING 2009 Toyota Rav 4 SUV, in Great condition, with low mileage. It is used and has a tolerable amount of damage associated with it. You evaluate the value of this vehicle without much inspection, without getting a second opinion, and very rapidly jump to the conclusion that this car is the ONE for you. You don't look at other cars or shop around, you focus exclusively on this one and ONLY car. There can be no other car out there for you, therefore you decide to buy this car. Imagine that the posting price for the car is $5,000. You have $10,000. You come to the dealership with $10,000 in cash, ready to buy this one car. During the negotiations, you lose your shit. This car is SO ABSOLUTELY THE ONE FOR YOU, you just HAVE to drive off the lot with it, after 7 days of ""thinking"" about it, and test driving it a few times. You sit down with the dealer to negotiate the price of the car. Before the dealer brings out a contract for sale, and before you even hear what terms and conditions you'll be signing for. You slam $8,000 of the $10,000 you have available on the table and tell the dealer that you're prepared to drive this car off the lot, RIGHT THIS SECOND, and he can skip the terms, conditions, and negotiations. You're sold. You don't even need the title to it, you ""trust"" the dealer. You don't demand a receipt or keep anything as proof that this car belongs to you. You ""trust"" that the dealer will let you have it, without proof. The dealer takes your cash money, and you drive the car off the lot, without the title in hand. After a few weeks of driving it, you realize that you paid $8,000 on a car that's worth $5,000, and some of that ""damage"" / baggage you ignored initially is really starting to bother you. You begin to have buyer's remorse and return to the dealer. You tell him that you want $3,000 back. The car was worth $5k, and you paid $8k. You now want the title to the car, and you now need all of the ""official paperwork"". Will the dealer give it to you? He might, if he feels like it. He might not. The dealer has all the power in this situation now. You are at his mercy. This dynamic is already fucked. There might be no fixing it, only lessons to be learned. Does this situation make you feel anxious??

&amp;#x200B;

Because this is the EXACT dating scenario that you have entered. Make no MISTAKE about it. The $10,000 is your affections, your time, and sex. The Dealer is your ""boyfriend"" and this is the dating situation you have entered.",1572033668,f57autg,t3_dn1n12,t5_xaiot

Moids like this fail at the basic maths of age. Even if you're 45. You can be that younger one, to men in their 50s, and men in their 60s. You can be a ""Melania Trump"" at any age, if you're looking to feel like the young hot thing, if that's what you want. Most women can be that young hot thing to a man if she simply chooses to go after older men :/. They can gripe about 20 year old women and teenage girls all they want, but most of these women won't entertain a man above 28, and most of them think that post wall 40 year old male-hags are gross and creepy.

Moids like this only talk about ""the wall"" as it relates to women. Men hit a wall too. AGE IS NOBODY'S friend, but women are unilaterally shamed for daring to survive past the age of 30.

Have a ""sex only"" dude, who you keep a secret, to keep you satisfied, while you quietly shop around for something ""suitable"". This sex-only dude doesn't get your real name, your real number (fake google voice number), doesn't know where you live. This makes it easier to ghost, cleanly, and without social repercussions. NO SOCIAL MEDIA POSTING. NO PICS, or evidence. You only go to his place. Ideally this dude is gorgeous, stunning, and he brings the condoms. If you play your cards right and employ FDS, he'd be buying you dinner and courting you first.

so there we were, a little over a month in (small duration of time but it felt like forever) I had given up so much for him. he didn't drive, so I drove. he wasn't good at controlling money, so I paid for alot. I even helped build his business by buying him business cards and making contracts without wanting any money back. just after we went to one of his events, things started to feel stale. now, quick back story on myself: been cheated on multiple times, stolen from, beaten up mentally and physically. so I have a little bit of a trust issues which I'm working on. so, he had broken his phone prior to the event, so I bought him a new phone. and yes, occasionally I would glance at it but he would do the same for me. it wasnt that I was suspecting anything, it's just a force of habit. regardless, we get into an argument over text obviously. he said he didn't have time to talk mid way through this argument that had me heated with anger and anxiety, so I exclaimed ""you don't have time to talk about saving this relationship?"" to which I got back ""you know what, we are over"". this was less than 24 hours after we had a conversation that he brought up about how we didnt have alot in common. there's alot more to the situation so if you want, I can post more about it. if you came this far, thank you for reading my story ‚ô°

This is dating advice which comes from men.  SHE NEEDS TO IGNORE IT, and realize that this relationship is fucked and leave ASAP.

This is important. This is why men are invested in negging and nitpicking at women's self esteem and triggering insecurity. Because if you WERE confident, you would've never given that asshole a chance, or would have dumped him the second his assholery comes out, and this doesn't benefit them. Negging you happens at ALL LEVELS. They nitpick at your personality, your ideas, your intellect, your looks, your youth, your weight, etc etc. Their goal is to make you doubt yourself, and this gives them the advantage. Women who doubt themselves are more likely to let men get away with bullshit. You're more likely to suck his dick/fuck him on the first date if you're insecure, and they won't admit that.

### [What the fuck is wrong with people?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/dmizzz/what_the_fuck_is_wrong_with_people/)

üì∑

I've posted about this guy I met last month a few times so I won't go into too much detail but I am passed the point of feeling sad and onto being pissed off and just disappointed.

I met a guy in early September and we hit it off very well in messages. We hit it off even better in texts, he was so attentive and sweet, and this was before we even met. Yellow flag? Now, I believe it is. We met and he could not have been more excited and expressive about how he felt. When we parted ways after our first date, he told me he already missed me. Yellow flag? Now, I believe it is.

So this kinda stuff continues. He tells me to leave a goddamn toothbrush at his house the first time I stayed over (and 2nd time we hung out) because he just *knew* we would be spending a lot of time together. He can't wait to introduce me to his friends, he wanted to wait to sleep together because he didn't want to rush and ruin things, etc. etc. Hindsight is 20/20, and maybe this all should have been a warning but I guess I thought it was genuine excitement. Even though I was a little like ""WHAT""...I felt very similar and I ate it up.

He got distant and cancelled plans that he set up. I try not to read into it and didn't mention any concerns until it was twice in a week. He assured me over the phone and in person when we saw each other again that he was still just as interested and he just got busy and stressed. I left it at that. He made another plan. Then cancelled that plan. He didn't talk much the week of that and went away for the weekend. Sent weird, confusing texts and at that point I was like, ok what the hell is going on??

I got no straight answers. I told him very clearly, if he isn't interested that he needs to be fair to me and just tell me so. I thought we both enjoyed hanging out and that we wanted to keep doing so and get to know each other. I got no response to that so I took that as my answer that he wasn't interested in dating me. I then later on was told that I was wrong in thinking that.

I took a few days to not give any energy to the situation and came back to see what the fuck was happening. Why he can't just say what's on his fucking mind like an adult. If you act weird and someone questions it, just say what is going on. He tells me that we should meet up and talk and get on the same page. I let him know if it's something he can say over the phone, there is no need for a meet up. Because the whole ""we need to talk"" thing is making me think it's because he doesn't feel the same way that I do. Once again, I am told that I am wrong and he wants to explain things.

The day comes to meet up. I am anxious as fuck and wondering if this is all even worth it. But I'm very curious as to what he has to say. An hour before he texts me that he is not coming. That he doesn't feel comfortable. That I was being too serious before. That he scares easily.

WHAT. THE. FUCK is wrong with people. So you come on strong, get distant and weird and I question it and that's me being too serious about things? A big part of why we clicked is because I thought we were on the same page about dating. How the fuck am I going to get to know someone if I don't spend any time with them. Okay, cancel on me once or twice, things come up and life gets hectic. I get that. But again and again, yes I am going to question if this is something you want to pursue. I gave him multiple chances to say he was too busy at the moment to date. Or he lost interest. Or he met someone else. Be a fucking adult and tell someone that. Playing games and sending cryptic messages for weeks is not the way to act. ESPECIALLY when the weeks before that was nothing but great conversations and great dates and future fucking planning.

What is wrong with someone like him? What the fuck could not be said. What is so fucking scary? How do you tell someone you think you need to talk, then tell them you need to talk BEFORE YOU TALK? What a colossal waste of my time, my energy, my feelings.

I did like him, too. Through most of that shit I still liked him. And I'm not going to say I acted cool and collected the whole time. I eventually lost my cool and send some long winded texts. But nothing crazier than all the shit he said to me when we met. Yet, it comes back on me. And then I start to wonder if I did something wrong along the way, that scared him off. But fuck that thinking, I liked someone and I wanted to spend time with them. I thought that is how you date.

I told him that there was nothing to talk about and I didn't want to speak to him again. I can never bring myself to send the classic ""you're an asshole. You wasted my time. You lead me on,"" etc etc texts because it's not my style and it's not like it will resonate. The crazy part is that I have been out with other guys since I met him. I ended up not connecting with anyone like I did with him, but I still put myself out there because it's too early to know for sure about anyone in 1 month. That's why I said I wanted to get to know each other to figure out if it could be something.

What the fuck.

Well, I have a date tonight so, we'll see. At least I try.

4492,_HEDONISM_BOT,"A romantic dynamic is established in the first few dates.

This is rare. Like 5% rare. It's like making a $10,000 offer on a car that's worth $6,000. Then trying to walk back on your initial offer of $10,000, and negotiate for a $5,000 price, rare.

Once a dynamic is established. You're usually stuck in it, and there's not much you can do to change it.

&gt;  
&gt;As it turns out, everything I knew about dating as a woman was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the ""dating advice"" given to women actually comes from men. ""Dating advice"" geared towards women, that comes from men is easily identifiable. Please learn to identify and IGNORE male-authored ""dating advice"" directed at women. This ""male-authored advice"" typically tells you to:

1. **It tells you to Lower your standards.** It standard shames you and tells you that being selective and choosing to date only high quality men is going to lead you to a lonely life with cats in it, they also typically dangle the ""mid-30's"" negging point at you. This is a common misperception. Women, at ALL ages, have an easier time finding dates and people to spend time with than men. This is evidenced by the abysmally low response rates that men receive on online dating and when ""cold approaching"", in real life.  The goal of this male-authored advice is to get women to let their guard/standard down and give incels, unattractive men, manchildren, abusers, narcissists, cheaters, unemployed men/NEETs, and low-quality /noncommittal men a ""chance"". They won't get past your filters otherwise.
2. **It negs you, nitpicks at your flaws, tells you you are unworthy and have to ""bring something to the table"", and attempts to lure you into a place of insecurity**.  There is a phenomenon out there in the dating world where men are 100% vested in making as many women insecure as possible. They tell women that they're going to end up alone because she's (insert insults here: Older, bigger, smaller, shorter, taller, etc etc.)  They want to create ""herd insecurity"" in women by telling them they become less desirable when they're older (*sure, but men become less desirable with age, too. As they begin to bald, descend into dad bod, and Erectile dysfunction kicks in... and the wrinkles, gray hair, etc. etc.... we slowly realize that age is nobody's friend*).  This ""advice"" helps cheap, lazy, unattractive romantic partners fuck more women, easier, and cheaper. The goal of this ""advice"" that comes from men is to make as MANY women insecure as possible because insecure women initiate, go dutch on dates, fuck and suck on the first date, send nudes, pay his bills, do his laundry, suck his dick, and when he ghosts her, she gets the blame. You do everything and get nothing in the end. This benefits men 100% and you can see exactly why they give out this ""advice"".
3. **It tells you to initiate, pursue, go dutch on dates, become too available** (text back immediately, accept ""reschedules"" at the last minute), have sex sooner, rather than later, and commit to him exclusively and automatically, by default, without expecting or being told exclusivity is at hand. The goal of this ""advice"" is to give into the lazy romantic partner's weak efforts. To reward his lack of commitment with your own commitment. It benefits men 100% and you can see the bias in why they dish out this ""advice"". 
4. **It tells you to be ""honest"" about your sexual past, something that NO MAN wants to hear about**, and having any discussion of a sexual past will turn off and scare away most men, because most men are offended that you had the sexual NERVE to exist before you met him.  Most men also have a fetish and obsession with sexual innocence and purity, and they want to fuck as many ""low N-count"" women as possible (N= number of sex partners) and that's why men tell women to be honest, to see if she fits into this ""purity"" male fetish. They want to fuck. They don't want to fuck just any girl. They want to fuck pure girls. That's why they need to find out this info from you, and lose interest when you tell them.  When you tell him you've had 4, or 7, or 300, or 1, he typically loses interest and respect for you, and then proceeds to look for a way out and starts treating you worse when he finds out that you don't fit this common male fantasy of ""the virgin GF/Bride"". The goal of this ""advice"" is to get as many men laid to ""pure women"" as possible, and you can see why they're vested in doling out this ""advice"" to women.

&amp;#x200B;

These are just a few of the common themes/patterns I've noticed in male authored ""dating advice"" that's aimed at women. IGNORE IT, LADIES. It doesn't work!!!  Men want a woman who makes them work for the sex, who is ""pure"" as evidenced by a lack of sexual past (or a lie she tells him about it, lol, stupid moids), a woman who reinforces boundaries and tells him ""no"", a woman that's not available, and that's too busy to be worried about him.",1572023130,f56h0iz,t3_dmz7vm,t5_xaiot

üì∑

I‚Äôve been married for two years and have been with my wife for 6. I‚Äôve never loved her. We started dating in high school when she asked me out with a group of her friends. She was fun to be around, but I could always take it or leave it when it came to being around her. We kept dating, but the whole time, I always said I needed to break up with her before it was too late. I never had the heart to break up with her because I knew she loved me. Well, after several years, I was under so much pressure from others to propose. I thought that maybe if we were married, I would learn to love her. Didn‚Äôt work. I *like* her, I guess, but to be honest, most nights I hope that when I get home, she‚Äôs not there. Not because I want her dead or something, but because if she was just gone, maybe I could really find love. I know that I‚Äôm definitely the bad guy and I honestly hate myself for this.

4542,_HEDONISM_BOT,"&gt; Everyone here seems opposed to cheap first dates. Maybe I'm naive or something, but...what's wrong with a cheap first date? I've always thought of that as a good thing. Aren't dates supposed to be more about getting to know each other than the food itself? 

Here's what's wrong with a cheap ""first date"". If you are young, nieve, or have had less than 5 LTR relationships (lasting 2+ years), you won't know when a man is stringing you along. You may know it and not believe it, or be too insecure to leave, because you're inexperienced at dealing with breakups effectively. Most men who will string you along and waste your time, bullshit, fail to commit, will also generally be cheap. Because their intention for you was to fuck around to begin with, they won't want to set aside a ton of money because they plan on ghosting you now, or 3 months from now, or don't see anything longterm with you. They won't tell you that up front, because then you won't suck his dick in the backseat of his car, after going dutch on Dinner and a movie. That's why. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you only agree to go on a date with a guy you've had time to vet, and only if he pays for dinner (like $30+ at least). You'll know he's trying to impress you, and is putting forth an effort. This creates a ""security deposit"", where if he's going to waste your time, it's going to be expensive for him to bullshit. If he's bullshitting, he won't be able to afford it for long, and will drop you sooner, rather than later. You will find out after 4 or 5 dates that you're seeing a fuckboy, as opposed to 3.5 years and 2 kids later. Sorry/not sorry. A man who's not bullshitting and who sees something longterm with you will do the work of courting you. Dating is literally 80% about weeding out the bullshitters because again, every man wants his dick sucked in the back seat of his car after a few drinks, on the first date, but only a man who wants to be with you longterm will pay for dinner first, and drinks, and several extravagant dates to get there. The fuckboys will bounce after date #1, or #3 once they realize you're not going to put out without significant evidence of investment in you, from him. 

It's an additional filter, which is very effective. You'll also see this in businesses. Like when you go to buy a car at an auction, you usually need to put some money down that you're going to lose if you only came there to ""window shop"". If everyone attending an auto auction pays $250 to get an opportunity to bid on a car, only the serious bidders will enter and you'll be most likely to only encounter serious bidders and avoid bidders who are bullshitting. This weeds out the people who are just ""shopping"" for a car, and aren't serious about buying it. Same with housing/apartments. If you require 1 months rent as a ""security deposit"", then the person has to be completely serious about renting to fork up the money upfront, and you weed out ""nonserious"" renters.

&amp;#x200B;

it works for businesses and it'll work for you. Literally find a way to demand expensive dates upfront, and this will create a ""buyin"" amount for dating you. Fuckboys will weed themselves out, and only serious applicants will make it to the second or third date with you = /

4543,_HEDONISM_BOT,"One of the biggest problems I see in relationships is when a woman agrees to date a man under a shitty dynamic and then expects him to change this already established dynamic.

&amp;#x200B;

If he didn't start off paying for stuff and treating you/spoiling you, he's not going to change. Treatment in a relationship usually starts off great and typically declines from there, if you accept it. If you accepted him as a romantic partner when he was depressed, broke, and ""working on himself"", and you suddenly expect him to change into someone who's mentally sound, ambitious, and is better off, you're in for a world of hurt and dissapointment. The second thing I notice is that women expect that when a man ""changes"" and upgrades himself, that means he's not going to upgrade his romantic life too. SO MANY posts on r/ExNoContact are from women whose boyfriends got a new job and started fucking around with a new coworker. A LOT of men upgrade EVERYTHING. INCLUDING THE GF/WIFE, when they ""change"". You'll end up being the wife who helped him throughout grad school or who waited on him hand and foot during med school, and now that he's a new physician, he's shopping around for a new GF because the new status affords him better options in the dating world. I see it over and over and over and over again. Literally like 30% of the posts on r/survivinginfidelity can be summarized as follows ""He got a new, better paying job, and is now sexting/seeing/fucking other women"". 

&amp;#x200B;

This is why I tell women not to accept ""project men"". Once they are ""complete"", they'll upgrade the GF/Wife too. Most men won't reward a woman's loyalty with reciprocated loyalty.

Essentially the rules of dating were written by men, for the benefit of men. What truly works on them, the effective strategies, come from experienced women who went out there and figured out what does and doesn't work on men.

About what they do and don't like in a man, about what they do and don't want in a man, how those tendencies change with age. You'll also be able to say that you've lived a life and haven't missed out on ""living it up in your 20s"". A woman who's saving herself for marriage, and isn't going to be dating a bunch of dudes and will end up learning life lessons at 27, that the rest of us have learned at 17 and that's dangerous. You'll be falling for bullshit at 27 that we've become immune to at 17 and you'll be making 17 year old mistakes at 27. If you want a traditional husband and children, you can't afford to waste time at 27 making 17 year old mistakes that can lead to you wasting a decade or longer on a useless fuckboy. Experience matters :/ , whether you like to hear this or not. You don't want to be fooled or to fall for bullshit at 27 or 37 because you've only had 1 boyfriend all your life and are inexperienced at dealing with these men.

Women with the mentality that they have to ""save themselves"" for marriage typically come from backgrounds that push a biased, traditional agenda which does NOT maximize female benefit in relationships, and women need to lookout for themselves when these toxic belief systems lead you down a path where you find yourself in a relation/situationship which isn't benefitting you.... 

&amp;#x200B;

and technically, you can achieve the same results by lying and telling folks that you're a virgin :/. I can be a 27 year old woman with 150+ sex partners, and with careful discretion, diligent OPSEC, and smart choices, be able to lie and convince a man that I'm still a virgin :/.

You're head isn't in the right space of mind and your not treating yourself well (especially with how your letting these guys treat you). **So you need to take a step back, get a vibrator (or find a good FWB), learn to be comfortable with your loneliness and then get back into the dating game.** 

Seriously, your young, well educated, have a career, good life prospects and interests and GORGEOUS but this is not it.  Hold yourself to a higher standard and own it. **If you don't tackle being okay with loneliness that it will be an issue that persists**. In order to embrace it you've got to be alone for a while, and **fall in love with yourself to the point where you don't NEED someone (to escape loneliness/yourself) but WANT them (to compliment and benefit your life).**

Obviously with that in mind, I have not taken into consideration the effects of mental health (like depression) and how it effects loneliness, but this is sound advice especially because it sounds like your just horny and lonely. 

I would also recommend you sit with yourself and **consider if a FWB dynamic is really for you**. From your comment you seem to enjoy the cuddling, emotional and aftermath of sex. This will prove problematic with any FWB situation and may just break your heart. If this is what your yearning for it's best to hibernate for now with a vibrator and seek a relationship that will satisfy this urge once you've dealt with your loneliness.

With that in mind, I really don't want to see you dropping out. Centerlink is tricky but, according to my dad's advice, you need to be persistent, assertive and ""smart"" about how to ""use"" the system. So don't give up.

Your family/relatives seem trash enough that it wouldn't hurt to recommend you seek to make yourself independent from your parents. I don't know much about that route, but there will have to be information online. From there you could get more payment from Centrelink as well as move out to your own place.

He only put in more effort because he realized he has male competition for your time. Men move quickly to eliminate their competition by increasing their level of effort so you can ""choose"" them and eliminate the other guy. If you want his effort to continue, continue to see other men who are investing more than you are. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now. I'm going to point out a powerful and painful nugget of truth. Successful female dating strategy has to be implemented before you even meet each other. Before the first reply message is sent to him. Since you were dating him since you were 16/17, you likely made rookie mistakes along the way which tipped off your hand that you were more into him than he is into you, or that you were afraid of losing him. THIS IS A BIG MISTAKE. If you want a man to treat you well, he has to know that you're not fucking around, that you'll drop him overnight and ghost his ass as soon as he fucks up. If you have a history of forgiving him and taking him back with little to no effort from him, then you might have to accept that he's never going to truly fear losing you and treat you right. If he didn't treat you well from the very start, he never will. It NEVER happens. Men start off treating you well, and the treatment typically declines with time until you leave them. That's a sad reality of dating and it's typically irreversible. If you accepted low treatment from the start, then the situation might be fucked. You might have to start over with a new man altogether because a successful dynamic has to be established early before first contact is even established, unfortunately :(",1574609274,f8kaw33,t3_e09b0g,t5_xaiot

Male-authored dating advice aimed at women advises women to limit their options (date 1 guy at a time, no matter what),maximize their loneliness (wait after a breakup to date other men), desperation (telling women they need to initiate, make the first move, go dutch or pay for dates), and insecurities (telling women they're going to hit a wall, become too old, and their time's running out), and think with a scarcity mentality (telling women that there are no/few good men out there). ALL of this is bullshit. It contains exaggerations of reality which are laughably false and ignore information which shows evidence to the contrary to serve the male imperative. If women buy into this dating advice, they'll end up falling for losers, getting pumped and dumped, wasting time on fuckboys, and heartbroken when ""he doesn't change"".

You're completely right. You can't always know what a person is like from spending a small amount of time with them.

&amp;#x200B;

CBT teaches you to pinpoint your own cognitive distortions, self-defeating beliefs, attitudes, tendencies, and your psychological vulnerabilities. Once you practice CBT and get good at it, you'll learn to skillfully identify these SAME cognitive distortions, self-defeating beliefs, attitudes, tendencies, and psychological vulnerabilities in other people simply by listening to the way they talk (or don't talk) and observing their demeanor and body language. You can even glean this info without ever meeting the guy in person by googling them and looking at their posts on social media. You can tell if someone's a narcissist, addicted to anger, drama, or conflict from their posts.

You didn't do anything wrong. You're learning and still grasping how to date effectively. I want you to do some reading on love-bombing, gaslighting, and narcissists. Learn the ""Gray Rock"" method for dealing with narcissists that won't fuck off. He's going to waste your time and break your heart. This guy sounds like he's addicted to drama, and it kind of sounds like you might be addicted to drama too. This is an emotional addiction to the physical state of being alert, aroused, excited, driven, and focused and it is REAL. It's parallel to an anger addiction. Learn how to control and manage it. Learn to get your fix for drama from nonharmful sources (social media scrolling, watching TV, etc.) and not from your own personal firsthand experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Know that your emotional addictions can be used to control and manipulate you. I strongly recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). A CBT therapist can teach you how to pinpoint your emotional vulnerabilities and guard against others who may be using those to manipulate you. Narcissists and sociopaths are experts at pinpointing emotional and psychological vulnerabilities and leveraging those to get their way, and punishing you effectively when they don't get your way.",1574441879,f8boton,t3_e020ih,t5_xaiot

&gt;I am actually a man. And I am not pissed. Because it is the truth... I'm actually very impressed by how well they understand us and how we think. And I think it is honorable that they are trying to warn the massive amounts of naive women out there.  
&gt;  
&gt;The true nature of men is that we will take advantage of women for sex and other things if we are allowed to. The entire history of the world shows that. But the opposite doesn't seem to happen. In the few countries where matriarchy exist, the women do not take advantage of men in the same way.  
&gt;  
&gt;I respect them for keeping it real and understanding how to improve things for women in relationships. Deep down I know if they did succeed and all women followed their advice, it would be bad for most of us men. All of the shit we get away with now would be a lot harder. But I do feel it would overall be better for society, and would elevate men to try harder and become better people. So I am kind-of rooting for them.

There are apps like Reddit where you can chat with people who are similar to you, in chat rooms and meet people there. A LOT of online dating apps are also very useful for finding friendships. I just checked the OkCupid app and there's a ""new friends"" option under the ""my ideal person"" section, so if you want to find friends, you can choose to uncheck the relationship boxes and only look for friends, screen/filter by certain demographics (age, etc.), and swipe away. Be sure to revise your profile or sign up with a different profile altogether for making friends and maybe post different pics and re-write your bio a little. I'm actually not sure if those ""filter"" questions would help you pick out a good friend, but I guess, in theory, they would?

ANYWAY, the first ""experiment"" I ran was the ""ugly dude"" test. Do ugly dudes really treat you better than handsome dudes? I tried it with my own dating profiles.

Repeat this experiment over and over and over again until you legitimately begin to believe these two fundamental self-esteem building beliefs:

70% of the ""work"" of dating as a woman is about eliminating unqualified men. Unqualified men are:

1. Men who are ""not that into you"". These men will eventually leave you for a woman who they ARE into. Maybe they abandon you after 1 week. Maybe it's 1 month. Maybe they abandon you after a  decade, 3 kids later, and you get to decide how much of your time they waste and how badly they hurt you :(. If they're not that into you, they'll ask to go dutch (because they don't want to waste money dating someone they don't see a future with), and string you along. It's all a waste of time, and you've got to ghost these moids at the 1 date or 1 week stage as opposed to 10 years later, after 3 kids and an expensive divorce.

These are men who don't want to marry ANYONE, EVER. They do want to get laid so they might lie and string you along, and if you can't get a direct, clear answer, leave. You're wasting your time. 
3. Manchildren, losers, unemployed/underemployed men, criminals, drug addicts, project men, and men who are abusive. These men are bad deals, period. They're not financially, mentally, emotionally, or physically prepared to court you, properly, and they're too unstable to build a life with. Men need to come to you COMPLETE, and if he's not?? He needs to go fix his life and then come back after its fixed, if you're available. 
4. ALL MEN who don't want to do the work of courting you, and some men who do the work of courting you and then ""slowly fade"" the level of effort in the relationship.

They did briefly gloss over the stages of pregnancy but no high school or college, or advanced post-bac curriculum taught me as much about pregnancy as Reddit has, and that's a shame. I didn't learn about IUDs or other LARCs until a college leveled Maternal and Child Health class that was required for my curriculum. It wasn't until I received my first ""middle class"" job after college, with great health insurance and the opportunity to choose my PCP (I chose an award winning OB/GYN) that I really learned how the pill worked. I was on birth control for YEARS, and the first physician to describe how it works and give me clear instructions was an award winning OBGYN, who I researched. He died earlier this year and I had to find another PCP and my new one hasn't listened to me (I literally showed him a picture of the pill I wanted and he wrote a prescription for something totally different), and didn't bother to describe how it worked. He begrudgingly prescribed it. I am SICK of this attitude in medical professionals.

I agree with you. I straight up refuse to have sex with anyone without a condom unless they get STD tested and show me the results. I also get tested and show him the results.

4814,_HEDONISM_BOT,"&gt;What's the slow-fade? Sorry, out of the loop.

when a person ""love-bombs"" you, they essentially go completely all out in flooring you when you first meet them. They'll arrange for extravagant, elaborate and incredible dates, go out of their way to woo you, make grand romantic gestures, and rapidly involve themselves into your life by making sure you're official on as many public-facing platforms as possible, so they can ""claim"" you. They are also quick to say ""I love you"", typically within the first few months of the relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, once you start showing him signs that you're ""hooked"", he slowly pulls back his efforts, or ""slowly fades"" from the relationship. Most women who haven't been love bombed before immediately panic and freak out, and respond to the ""slow-fade"" by trying to ""fix"" whatever it was that she thinks is wrong, in an effort to ""win back"" that type of effort again from the love-bomber but they don't realize that love-bombing is a tactic typically used by men to lure women in and make them fall in love rapidly, and make it painful (or embarrassing) to leave him. It's a monstrous evil practice and the only way to respond to a love bomber is to just straight up ghost them once all the grand romantic gestures dry up.

4822,_HEDONISM_BOT,"&gt;You arent the customer, you're the product. You best believe they're going to maximize profits. Maybe you'll find true love off of it, maybe you wont, but that's only a side effect.

You are absolutely both the customer and the product. You see, each and every one of those ""unattractive men"" that it shows to me, is also a user on the app, and Tinder cannot sell its ad services if the ad services aren't effective marketing tools so it needs as many people on the app to ""have a good time"", or as good a time as it deems/calculates fit in order for it to maximize the value of its ad services and sell it to other companies / consumers. 

&amp;#x200B;

The App AI / Algorithm is sophisticated enough in that it can probably deliver matches to me which would get me off the app and married in the next hour (or the next 20 minutes, or the next   
5 minutes) because it probably knows what will work best for me based on user data and what I swipe on, but if it does that, then it loses out on the 1.7 years of ""swiping activity"" it *could* get me to do, in order for it to show me enough ads to maximize profits for the parent company. I think it builds a profile of all its users (or buys it from Google/Facebook or other data selling sources) which helps the AI / App figure out exactly how long you'll be on the app before you quit, uninstall it, or leave it a bad review. Or it has aggregated user data which tells the Tinder AI something along the lines of ""This young 34 year old college educated woman will likely uninstall Tinder or leave a bad review if I don't find her a ""good enough"" match within 8 months, or 1.2 years or 6 years (whatever the true number is, based on data). Therefore, the Tinder AI likely has some calculated ""sweet spot"" that it knows its users will have which will keep them on the app long enough for the users ""to have a good time"", rake in ad revenue for Tinder, avoid negative user reviews, AND it also knows exactly how long it can keep users dangling before giving them that ""perfect"" match before they leave, thereby maximizing the amount of ad revenue/time spent/data about you it can mine &amp; sell/  on the app they can ""squeeze"" out of you without you leaving or leaving a bad review.

This is actually important. Your personal ""narrative"" guides your cognitive biases and your reward / punishment systems that you adhere to, behaviorally. YOU, personally, don't find reward in cheating, but I PERSONALLY do. A lot of people follow Abrahamic faiths, or were raised in religious or conservative households which push and advocate the traditional relationship model, and those folks who ascribe to this and agree with it, will not understand the motives of people who haven't. This is why I used the car example to explain the motivations behind people who cheat so I can describe this phenomenon to folks using a neutral example that's not prohibited in the Abrahamic religions or the traditional model of the relationship. I hoped to avoid triggering the knee-jerk reaction to infidelity using neutral, sales terms and a similar situation so I can get the concept across without having to navigate complex cognitive biases that are unique to each person.",1572889284,f6j52gy,t1_f6j3euc,t5_2sjkv

If I'm using Tinder and it's showing me very hot guys for the first 50 swipes, over 20 minutes, and the quality goes down after that, I can choose to get off the app and uninstall it, or choose to continue swiping on less attractive men. Suppose I choose to swipe on less attractive men. The next time I log in, it shows me 30 hot guys in the first 20 minutes, and I proceed to swipe on less attractive guys after that. Then the following day, it shows me 5 hot guys, or 3, or 0. Once the AI that's behind the ""sorting"" of the cards figures out that you'll pretty much swipe on anything, it'll show you ""anything"" because it knows you won't uninstall it :/ therefore you're not hurting Tinder's business revenue (ads being shown to you) because you'll continue to be on the app for hours a day regardless of the quality of men you're seeing. The goal of this AI is to maximize profits for Tinder (and get you a match, of course....)

&amp;#x200B;

Let's suppose I start using Tinder and the same situation as above happens. 50 hot guys are shown to me in the first 20 minutes of me being online, and then it's showing me less attractive men. Suppose I rage-quit and close the app.  Next time it shows me 50 hot guys followed by less attractive men, after 20 minutes AGAIN, and same result. I exit the app. Same thing the following time. And the following time, and the following time. The AI will then establish that I will only proceed to swipe and use the app if it's showing me 50 hot guys, over 20 minutes. It tries to get me to stay on the app longer (so I can see more ads and give Tinder more profit/ad revenue). Next time it might show me 50 hot guys, after 20 minutes and an additional 50 hot guys for 20 minutes, until it shows me less attractive men and I close it again. Repeat 1,000 times and the Tinder AI now knows that I, \_HEDONISM\_BOT will ONLY use the tinder app if it's showing me men in the top 20% of the attractiveness category and it knows not to show me anything else, whereas another user u/\_ANOTHER\_USERNAME\_EXAMPLE will only use the app if it shows me hot guys for 1 hour, or 5 minutes. Some people will swipe on anything. All tinder knows is that it needs you to view its ads and rate the app ""experience"" well in the Play store / apple store app. So it's got to show you ""good enough"" matches that keep you happy enough to view ads / push revenue up, but not too crappy so that you won't head over to the play store and leave bad reviews. There's a sweet spot that this AI is trying to calculate.

Oh and this AI is competing against the OKCupid AI, and the Match AI, and the Grindr AI, and the POF AI, to see / get at the exact precise point where profits are maximized for the Parent company.

&amp;#x200B;

Since this is an emotionally charged situation, I'm going to give you the following example to help you better see why some people do it:

&amp;#x200B;

Suppose I am selling a car that is very valuable to me. I have a few options because a lot of people want to buy my car. Option A is offering $10,000 cash, and is ready to give this cash to me with a $1,000 down payment and pay the rest using a monthly payment plan over the next 36 months... Option B plans on giving me $30k for the car upfront, and an additional $3k each month for every year after the sale. Option C wants to give me $50k for the car, and an additional $10k every month for every year after the sale. 

&amp;#x200B;

Suppose I REALLY liked Option A, because his personality and other non-financial aspects really speak to me, and I decide to give option A my business. Suppose that after 8 months, option A suddenly starts to miss payments, consistently, and continues to use the car. Options B, and C, are available still, plus a few additional options that are equally as valuable as options B &amp; C. Considering that I am strapped for cash, I am now in a position where those other options become much much more lucrative and I then decide to withdraw my business with option A in favor of Option C (or F or J or Z) because they simply offer a better deal than what Option A is giving me.

I stayed with him for 10 years (engaged for 6 years) before finally ghosting on him after he pissed me off one last time. He cheated on me SEVERAL times throughout the relationship and I ""forgave"" him. The last and final time I found him cheating, I ghosted him and was sexting dudes 6 hours later. After I ghosted him, my next boyfriend treated me better, but it was still a low-quality relationship so I ghosted this guy too after 3 years when the already low quality began to drop. The subsequent relationship was the best I ever had, until he suddenly and COMPLETELY changed, literally overnight and became a domestic abuser who threatened me daily. It became the worst nightmare situation of my life, and I ghosted his ass new year's eve because I couldn't take his threats anymore and I wasn't walking into 2019 with a domestic violence relationship. This one lasted \~2.5 years and we were engaged at the 1.5 year mark. I dated another guy earlier this year who was amazing on paper, ticked my every requirement, and he attempted to love-bomb me and then pull the slow-fade. I ghosted his ass once the ""slow-fade"" began. I'm now dating a wonderful and amazing man who's incredibly smart, funny, handsome, and successful.

I really thought that if I gave him my virginity, I was tied to him for life and had to make it work, otherwise, I ""wasted"" my value on him. Once I got over this, in therapy, I was able to ghost that guy. I slowly worked on my self esteem and mental health and each subsequent relationship was basically me tolerating less and less bullshit from men. Once the bullshit starts, I'm out. Simple and plain and easy and blunt. I'm out. No questions asked, no justifications needed, no excuses for myself or him. I'm out.

üì∑

A year ago my ex-husband told me he filed for divorce after being together 30 yrs, married 27. I was devastated even though I saw it coming from at least a year back. I was a stay at home parent for the prior last 6 years with a daughter who had graduated college and on her own and a son with autism who had just moved into an apartment through a special needs agency. I was a hot mess for several months. Fortunately my ex and I managed to be civil, negotiate our divorce and stay in the same house until I was settled and found a job I love in education. I still have resentment,. I can say I am much happier on my own (I am fortunate to have alimony) and my job offers me insurance and summers off to take care of our son with autism who still needs us to be there in his life. I respect my ex and will always appreciate him as a father and provider. I am seeing someone who is friends with benefits. There is life after divorce. I know I am fortunate in my situation. But I know that my marriage was no longer healthy and sometimes moving on is the best thing that can happen. I found myself with a job I love, where I am supported and appreciated and know that I don't need a significant other to fell complete.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few wonderful books by Dr. David Burns that are great for panic attacks/anxiety/depression and a lot of related issues like low self esteem/confidence, assertiveness training, communication techniques, etc. etc. They're called ""When Panic Attacks"" and ""Feeling Good: the new mood therapy"". There's also a third one called ""Feeling good together"". These books are available on the Audible audiobook app if you feel like hearing them, and I think you can get them from a public library for free. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dr. Burns website essentially has podcasts which also cover the material for free, but I personally recommend the books. Have him listen to these books (or read them) over and over and over and over again until the messages stick. Persist with this, and don't let him drop the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy books no matter how much he insists. There tends to be a phase that you go through with CBT where you feel like quitting on it, and you've got to persist through this. Apply the concepts and do the written exercises too. Employ the techniques and don't give up. Eventually the messages will stick and he'll improve.

I am a medical professional and never knew about vaginal prolapse or enlarged feet, or a woman's hair going from straight to curly, or other shit like women having their nipples go from light pink to dark brown over a pregnancy. Most women admit that they look at least 10 years older after having a baby.

\- You'll likely feel or get jealous when you watch as your friends/GFs are wined and dined by their amazing spouses, or when you sit in restaurants and watch other women get their shit paid for.

\- You'll likely be asked to perform lewd and sexual acts more often, because he sees you as just a warm hole to stuff his creampie in, and not much more than that.

\- If you allow him to impregnate you, and then proceed to keep this child, instead of yeetusing that feetus, beware that the child won't make you ""closer"" to him.

Even if the insecure girl does everything for him and worships the ground he walks on and sucks his balls daily, the ""fate"" of the forever girlfriend is always devastating heartbreak when he inevitably cheats or leaves her for another woman who is high value and has confidence.

You work on your mental health and go to therapy. Seriously. There are 2 wonderful books by Dr. David Burns called ""Feeling Good: The new Mood therapy"" and ""When panic attacks"". There's also a third book called ""Feeling Good together"" that discusses relationships. It's pretty good so far. These books all cover Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which discusses the importance of thoughts. The essence of it is that you FEEL the way you THINK. Changing your thoughts will lead to changes in how you feel. It also outlines the most common cognitive distortions (lies present in your thinking/AKA distorted or ""twisted"" thinking), and teaches you to identify them in your thoughts, and then fight back at them. Identifying cognitive distortions will help you learn to think more objectively, more clearly about yourself. CBT also teaches you to fight back against your negative thoughts. Below's a quick list of the cognitive distortions:

1. All-or-Nothing Thinking / Polarized Thinking. ...
2. Overgeneralization. ...
3. Mental Filter. ...
4. Disqualifying the Positive. ...
5. Jumping to Conclusions ‚Äì Mind Reading. ...
6. Jumping to Conclusions ‚Äì Fortune Telling. ...
7. Magnification (Catastrophizing) or Minimization. ...
8. Emotional Reasoning.
9. ""should"" statements
10. Labeling and Mislabeling
11. Personalization
12. Control Fallacies.

First and foremost. I see evidence of ALL 12 cognitive distortions present in your post. I'm going to cite them using the numbers mentioned above just to show you. When you say ""There is nothing amazing about me."", I see 1, 3, 4, 7, immediately. When you say ""no real skills, no natural ambition to GET real skills"", I see 1, 3, 4, 6. When you say ""it‚Äôs hard to call myself a queen without looking hella delusional."", I see 10, 8, 4, 3, 2.

You have GOT to stop falling for your cognitive distortions or ""twisted thinking/deceitful thoughts"" and learn to fight back against them. Dr. Burns' books teach you that self-esteem and ""confidence"" is literally the absence of negative self-criticism. It's the state where instead of bombarding yourself with insulting, negative, criticisms and vitriol, or nitpicking or ""magnifying"" your flaws.... you do the opposite. You look for positives and focus on those. You simply need to stop criticizing yourself and nitpicking at your shortcomings to be confident.",1572721493,f67p2tb,t3_dqcbz0,t5_xaiot

üì∑

As my husband and I are navigating the waters of separation I have found that he was shaken to his core when I told him I wanted to leave and that shaking seems to have brought out the best in him. He is not overtly pursuing anything romantic with me but he is being kind, checking in (a random call just to say hi and see how my day's been was absolutely UNHEARD of before), he's been gracious when I've had to spend a bit more than what we budgeted for certain things (I would have been lectured for at least ten minutes for even the slightest grievances in budgetary spending before), he has helped clean up the house and volunteered to finish dishes so I could take a break (again, NEVER happened before). All of this is leading me to feel myself ready to just say, Well, maybe we could work this out and still be together. And then I get pissed at myself for being so ready to just sit back and settle for this very unhappy union, and also so angry that THIS is what it's taken to awaken him to being a halfway decent partner. It's just so fucking frustrating. And I just want to scream FUCK YOU in his face for treating me like shit for so long when apparently this other person was there all along as well. I have no idea how long this ""good guy"" will stick around, but I'm still moving forward with plans to find a job and an apartment, to continue to separate myself from him while still having to stay connected as we co-parent our kid. What a mind fuck. Ugh.

&gt;I can't find myself able to give men the time of day. It's very hard to date, especially on apps which seem to be where everyone meets now and it's so easy to lie. I'm terrified of being lied to, of committing myself to a man who's deceiving me in some way, such as cheating on me or just not that into me and stringing me along. With that in mind, I find it hard to give anyone a chance.

First and foremost, do not be afraid of being lied to, or committing a man who's deceiving you. You might end up getting a few of those, despite your best efforts, because men lie. The key is not to let it destroy you. It'll suck for a while but you can cut him off and move on. Don't be afraid of meeting the liars, because you can ALWAYS choose to walk away. You can ALWAYS choose to swipe left on low effort profiles and even if your best vetting efforts fail to screen out a fuckboy, feel secure in your ability to walk away.

Second. Date RUTHLESSLY, like a cold, calculating b\*tch and don't give a single fuck. Now that you're aware of the bullshit that men pull, you're better equipped to walk away if a potential romantic partner isn't giving you all that you want and the situation isn't maximizing your benefit. You don't need to justify or give any excuses. You are completely justified in ghosting, and you don't owe them SHIT. You can literally block a motherfucker for any reason, even if you're just bored and feel like being evil or petty. Your choices are valid, as is, period. If you don't feel like having him in your life. BLOCK, DELETE, IGNORE, NEXT!

Third. Dating is actually EASIER when you're emotionally nauseated and don't feel like dealing with men. It's like the filter has come off, the gloves are off, and the rose-colored glasses have been thrown out. Dating when you're emotionally nauseated means you're more likely to turn down a dude who's bullshitting, it'll be easier to ghost moids this way, trust me. You'll discover that you're IMMUNE to love-bombing, especially when the pullback/slow-fade happens. You'll be able to NOPE them faster and pine over them less, and forget them easier. You'll get better results because your tolerance for bullshit is even LOWER and you aren't willing to put up with ANY bullshit. This will only yield you better results.

It runs counter to the male-authored dating advice that's spewed at women which advises them to ""wait"" before dating. Sure, wait, if you need space or time to heal, but realize that emotional nausea is a powerful weapon that will enable you to reject ruthlessly, and get over a moid faster. That's why they don't want you to date when you feel sick of men. Because you'll be more ruthless. Male-authored dating ""advice"" advises women who are fresh out of breakups to ""wait"" because it maximizes the chances that her male ex will be able to beg for her back, or she might feel lonely or desperate enough to sleep with him again. It also puts women in a position where they're at risk of ruminating on their ex, stalking social media profiles, watching him move on, and letting loneliness and desperation fester. This leads to hasty, risky situations which don't maximize the woman's benefit. This male authored ""advice"" works against women. Date when you're emotionally nauseated. You'll have better results with higher standards and lower tolerance for bullshit.",1572530882,f5wuqbl,t3_dpnca3,t5_xaiot

The key is not to let it destroy you. It'll suck for a while but you can cut him off and move on. Don't be afraid of meeting the liars, because you can ALWAYS choose to walk away. You can ALWAYS choose to swipe left on low effort profiles and even if your best vetting efforts fail to screen out a fuckboy, feel secure in your ability to walk away.

&amp;#x200B;

Second. Date RUTHLESSLY, like a cold, calculating b\*tch and don't give a single fuck. Now that you're aware of the bullshit that men pull, you're better equipped to walk away if a potential romantic partner isn't giving you all that you want and the situation isn't maximizing your benefit. You don't need to justify or give any excuses. You are completely justified in ghosting, and you don't owe them SHIT. You can literally block a motherfucker for any reason, even if you're just bored and feel like being evil or petty. You r choices are valid, as is, period. If you don't feel like having him in your life. BLOCK, DELETE, IGNORE, NEXT!

&amp;#x200B;

Third. Dating is actually EASIER when you're emotionally nauseated and don't feel like dealing with men. It's like the filter has come off, the gloves are off, and the rose-colored glasses have been thrown out. Dating when you're emotionally nauseated means you're more likely to turn down a dude who's bullshitting, it'll be easier to ghost moids this way, trust me. You'll get better results because your tolerance for bullshit is even LOWER and you aren't willing to put up with ANY bullshit. This will only yield you better results. 

&amp;#x200B;

It runs counter to the male-authored dating advice that's spewed at women which advises them to ""wait"" before dating. Sure, wait, if you need space or time to heal, but realize that emotional nausea is a powerful weapon that will enable you to reject ruthlessly, and get over a moid faster. That's why they don't want you to date when you feel sick of men. Because you'll be more ruthless. Male-authored dating ""advice"" advises women who are fresh out of breakups to ""wait"" because it maximizes the chances that her male ex will be able to beg for her back, or she might feel lonely or desperate enough to sleep with him again. It also puts women in a position where they're at risk of ruminating on their ex, stalking social media profiles, watching him move on, and letting loneliness and desperation fester. This leads to hasty, risky situations which don't maximize the woman's benefit. This male authored ""advice"" works against women. Date when you're emotionally nauseated. You'll have better results with higher standards and lower tolerance for bullshit.",1572530263,f5wtf4e,t3_dpnca3,t5_xaiot

Male-authored dating advice aimed at women doesn't work. They're not being honest and forthcoming because the dating advice which DOES work, comes from experienced women who've had several LTRs and Short term relationships, and witnessed first hand how men act and react in the real world. We share our experiences with what does and doesn't work, along with great resources and reading material. They HATE this place because we straight up rip their ""strategies"" to shreds and teach women how to date with their own self-interests in mind, to maximize benefit to women. Our advice doesn't help the male imperative and goes against their goals of easy, cheap, freely available sex, and that's why they come here to mass downvote our posts and comments.

üì∑

A lot of people here have been saying how they cheated and how they regret it so much, but I don't understand why you would do it in the first place. I just can't tap into that mentality (fortunately).

Like you KNOW cheating on your partner is immensely hurtful towards them, and yet you still DO IT. And then you somehow get the nerve to say how much you love them. I mean, if you make a decision to do a thing that is immensely painful towards the core of your loved one's emotions, then maybe, just maybe, you don't really love them? But then you look at your partner in the face after cheating on them and tell them you love them? It's just so twisted to me.

I just don't get it man. Rant over.

Save yourself the time. The litmus test is the paying for dates. Men know if they're going to be serious about you within 5 minutes of meeting you. They know if you're GF, one-night stand, or wife material by simply looking at you and seeing how he feels. Asking him to pay for dates forces him to show his cards to you.

I enjoy it while I can, because after the honeymoon period I know the emotional labor is switching to me (although perhaps with the advice of this sub, I can change that).

5070,ceramicunicorn,"We had to abandon our traditional roles, because we saw our grandmothers and mothers have babies and then get left for (or just cheated on with) younger, hotter models...and if that happens, many of us want to have our own money if we need it. The alternative is risky. 

You‚Äôre generalizing about young women. Some are gold diggers, yes. But many of us love the person for the person. As for lifting? Yeah, it‚Äôs good to be in good physical shape, because a lot of people like doing active things, and want the kind of partner they can share in those things with. There are those that don‚Äôt care about physical activity...but I wager you weren‚Äôt interested in those women. 

*Did* these guys really love the women for who they are? I know there are female sociopaths and narcissists who are real good at masking....maybe we all need to be better at seeing the signs. Not ignoring them in favor of prioritizing the potential of ovaries and bank accounts.

It hurts us at all ages. And we don‚Äôt want that, we don‚Äôt want fuckboys. And so while those of us who refuse to understand how men work- no matter how much we ‚Äúdon‚Äôt hate men‚Äù and ‚Äúlove them‚Äù- end up getting destroyed, those of us paying attention, protect ourselves. We have to.

If anyone hates men, it‚Äôs just a unique combo of bad things that happened to them that lead to trauma that lead to hate. If you have no compassion, you would do well to avoid those women as they avoid you and there‚Äôs not problem. But it isn‚Äôt most women. I don‚Äôt hate men. I know men with great qualities. But I do know they could evolve beyond claiming to be helpless to their biology, and for those that claim to want authentic- and not transactional- love, they‚Äôd do well to evolve in that way. It really is possible, but guys would have to make shifts in their priorities first.",1570288754,f2krttq,t1_f2fmrnh,t5_su6ij
5072,ceramicunicorn,"uuuugggghhh I KNOW, but what I‚Äôm saying is that there are plenty of people who *mistake* it for really being loved for who they are, and then get hurt...or they know what it is, but then they end up hurt anyway, because they unintentionally got emotionally invested as they got so accustomed to the person being around. And whenever two people are using each other, one half always comes out on top, and that hurts the other person, even if they were *not* emotionally invested, because it turns a life upside down if it‚Äôs tied into someone else‚Äôs. Someone is going to lose.

People love to talk a big game about how they can pull that rich man or that hot breedable woman, and never get invested, and they are going to be the one to come out on top in the arrangement. The reality is, while I think sociopaths actually could do this most successfully, that‚Äôs a small part of the population. I talk to a LOT of single people, and most do want authentic love...but due to outdated cultural norms/scarce resources, set their priorities all wrong, play the transactional relationship game, think it‚Äôs love, then are miserable when it falls apart. And I‚Äôm saying, there *is* a way to avoid that. It‚Äôs less thrilling, and it‚Äôs less glamorous...but authentic, long term partnerships were never either of those things...but are generally more satisfying than the alternative.",1570287587,f2knttm,t1_f2kl224,t5_su6ij
5073,ceramicunicorn,"This ‚Äúhitting the wall of depreciating looks‚Äù thing is nonsense. We have been trained since girlhood that the way to play the game is to look good, and are educated in beauty and health regimes from a young age, and we keep this up all our lives. We never talk about ‚Äúdepreciating looks‚Äù in dudes, and trust me, most of y‚Äôall do not age well. And yes, it does matter more to younger women, who can pull a hot young guy, and if they make the sacrifice it isn‚Äôt because of who you are as a man, it‚Äôs about the resources. 

As far as divorce rates, I can‚Äôt say why women leave, but I‚Äôd be interested in how many of those divorces were older men marrying much younger women, and the old man‚Äôs resources aren‚Äôt needed anymore (you *can* have a better choice of avoiding this, *if* you prioritize who the person is vs. having ‚Äúbut she‚Äôs hot and she breeds!‚Äù blinders on). I‚Äôd also be interested on what leads to those divorces. Is there an epidemic of men who are helpless- simply helpless!- to their biology, chasing around younger women and ignoring their wives, that then leads the wives to leave? And I‚Äôm sure some wives are just pieces of shit! We don‚Äôt know! 

My point is, while there are crappy people everywhere, it seems to me, these transactional relationships- which many people mistake for love- end up hurting people, and perpetuating the cycle does not help. If we valued people for people and not for what their bodies and bank accounts can make, we‚Äôd be closer to something like real love that I see a lot- maybe not *you*, but a lot- of people craving.",1570286885,f2klnvm,t1_f2jgx5g,t5_su6ij
5074,ceramicunicorn,"And those older men have to understand? This. Is. Not. Being. Loved. It is not being loved for who you are. 

But again. It‚Äôs a two way street. It is not love anymore than it is to choose a woman for being a sexy walking incubator, choosing that over what‚Äôs going on in between her ears...what kind of parent and partner she‚Äôd actually be. Like when people value how pretty their bride/groom/wedding will be over the long haul part...the marriage, the kind of long term partner that person will be.

5076,ceramicunicorn,"The reality is though, if you‚Äôre over 45 and you‚Äôre looking at chicks in their mid-20s, and one actually gets with you, there‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôs not about love, it‚Äôs about your resources. You have to be ok with that chance, that it isn‚Äôt about who you are as a person. You always have you. But your resources are limited. And the second those resources dry up or she can get someone more attractive...you‚Äôre done. 

Of *course* it‚Äôs up to you to determine who is amazing. No one is shaming you for your actual preferences. The problem is you‚Äôre often not realistic *about* those preferences. Guys for the most part, you don‚Äôt age well. You just don‚Äôt. You haven‚Äôt been coached on your appearance since childhood. An older woman? She‚Äôll be ok with your signs of aging. A younger woman? Not so much. And those of us who befriend you, have to hear you complain about how this or that young woman used you and we‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúOf *course* she did!‚Äù You just have to know what you‚Äôre getting yourself into. 

My frustration is coming from a place of guys who claim to want love, but can‚Äôt parse out what it truly means to be loved and respected for who they are as people- even when they go bald, paunchy, wrinkled, etc. If someone in his 40s/50s came along who is awake to the idea that older women have a whole lot to offer, that would be rad.",1570223626,f2fwh8m,t1_f2fubgw,t5_su6ij
5077,ceramicunicorn,"Well yes, they‚Äôre independent and career oriented...what are they *supposed* to do with the time, when they‚Äôre overlooked? Moreover, I‚Äôm finding a lot of young women are concentrating on career as well...they see the generation before them sacrificing everything for a man, only to get dropped (after she pushes out and raises those kids), for a younger model. So they‚Äôre trying to build a nest so that in the event it happens to them, they have a safety net. Awareness comes at younger and younger ages now, and women simply are not willing to find themselves helpless, as they were in the past. 

For those that aren‚Äôt, and the plan is a man, do not mistake that for ‚Äúmore love to give‚Äù. That‚Äôs often not love. That‚Äôs often wanting your resources- financial, some sort of legal status, your sperm, etc. You have to be ok with that transactional type of relationship, if you‚Äôre a guy in your 40s and up chasing after chicks in their 20s. Very few older men are as physically attractive as they‚Äôd like to think- because boys simply aren‚Äôt brought up since childhood to put the same amount of effort into that arena. Older women more likely don‚Äôt need your resources...so you‚Äôre likely to find true love there, but true love isn‚Äôt just putting up with a bunch of bullshit from a guy. It‚Äôs also encouraging you to be the best you. If that‚Äôs not what you want, actual love and acceptance isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre really looking for. You‚Äôre looking to be flattered, until a young hot thing has made the most of your resources.

Once a young woman has got that cash from a much older man, there‚Äôs no further incentive- as women have the importance of attractiveness hammered in and are introduced to beauty regimes at a young age, they generally age better than men- and getting the drop can happen to you too.

Upon first time having sex, it would be an additional invoice to balance out the risks that are about 0 for men- potential sexual assault, pregnancy, the much lower likelihood of having an orgasm and the higher likelihood of contracting an STD he didn‚Äôt even know he had because men are more likely to be asymptomatic.

Such invoices to make it all ‚Äú50/50‚Äù would be awkward, so it‚Äôs assumed men they‚Äôre going out with are smart enough to know about these additional costs, and will thus handle the bill.

5154,ceramicunicorn,"I don‚Äôt know, girl. I rarely see it coming, because as someone for whom love is hard to find, I don‚Äôt understand throwing away someone who loves you. Unless you never loved them to begin with. Which means every single one of them lied to me, which now means I can‚Äôt believe anything they say, and I need to know it‚Äôs all bullshit and I‚Äôm easily replaced. If they *all* lie, why would I build a life with any single one, and live a lie?

For me, the answer brought a closure that I can‚Äôt seem to find internally, and I stopped thinking about it much sooner. It‚Äôs like, something I can improve for the next guy, or something I could not, and that‚Äôs that. 

Of course, if I never loved, then it wouldn‚Äôt hurt when they walk and I wouldn‚Äôt care that it died. But that seems like a sad way to live.",1571927193,f50gpxh,t1_f4yrbal,t5_xaiot
5155,cjs293,But in all seriousness how do you answer that questions? I‚Äôd be like ‚Äúuhhh I‚Äôve pumped gas for my own car before‚Äù,1571878120,f4yjsmw,t1_f4y3um9,t5_2qh1i

5158,ceramicunicorn,"I have a hard time with this when it goes as far as it being done. When it dies (if I cared about him), it‚Äôs like someone I care about dying and not knowing the cause of death. I always accept the answer, no matter how stupid it is, but up to then it drives me crazy to not know the real reason why he threw it away.",1571865681,f4xhr90,t3_dm26b9,t5_xaiot
5159,ceramicunicorn,"What he said is simply untrue. All of the women are *not* chasing the top 10% men. I‚Äôm not, because I know I probably cannot get one (for romance). Yes I have my limits- I‚Äôm probs not dating a horrifying looking guy, but an average one is possible, and I‚Äôve accepted that. His problem is that he feels entitled to a 8 or 9 babe...and (unlike what most women do) refuses to prioritize personality over looks. I‚Äôm tired of men whining and stamping their feet because they can‚Äôt have Gigi. I understand we all have limits, but the idea that he said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too old for me‚Äù even though he admits you‚Äôre attractive- when he‚Äôs not even trying to have kids!-  means he deserves to be sexless.

I would for sure make compromises and go for a guy that looks like him, if he was a true prince. But he‚Äôs so terrible, I wouldn‚Äôt fuck him if he looked like Beckham, out of principle. I‚Äôve seen men ‚Äúsettle‚Äù for women who are not their aesthetic ideal- great, smart, kind women who have maxxed as much as they can- and those men are very very happy because they prioritize how they‚Äôre treated over having a trophy. But Allen is deplorable and so he shot himself in the foot and gets no one.",1571845757,f4vp3is,t1_f4vkr3k,t5_xaiot
5160,ceramicunicorn,"You didn‚Äôt read what I wrote. I did not say dictate, I said make a plan I can agree to. I also said we are not in a relationship yet, and I want to gauge his willingness to make an effort to be in one. He is the romance gatekeeper, I gatekeep the sex. He need not worry about me not being an equal participant in sex when that time comes- I make it crystal clear that I will do so enthusiastically, for as long as he treats me well. Once he has committed, then I know in fact, when that time comes, we will be *both* participating in the romance part, instead of me doing all the planning (which again, is harder for me to restrain myself from doing, than just taking over and doing it myself because it‚Äôs so easy for me, yet seemingly so difficult for them) in the relationship, while he kicks back and relaxes. I will not participate in another relationship like that. Moreover, men value what they work for. 

It *is* a war, because it‚Äôs a constant battle to fend off a man‚Äôs desire to quickly get sex and then move on. The advice to ‚Äúhire a day planner‚Äù makes 0 sense. I‚Äôm guessing this unsolicited advice is coming from a man, or at least, someone who does not date men and does not understand what it‚Äôs like to be on the receiving end.",1571768652,f4rkfrs,t1_f4ricca,t5_xaiot
5161,ceramicunicorn,"Looks like a bunch of them crawled over to downvote. God forbid we have a space where we can openly counterstrategize against the sexual-manipulation-without-commitment and total lack of concern of harm done to our bodies, that we‚Äôve had to deal with since we were teenagers.",1571759485,f4qx8zt,t3_dl8eil,t5_xaiot
5162,ceramicunicorn,"This is super confusing. Shows his hand in insisting he‚Äôll never get married...then tells women what they need to do to be worthy of marriage? Yeah, not manipulative at all! Also, even if he *could* get all these things (he can‚Äôt), his game is completely off, laying out all his cards like that. Shit he‚Äôs not even *good* at manipulation. 
Also there‚Äôs nothing *steamy* about him. This is the kind of guy I might settle for *if* he was really good to and committed to me and there was none of the bitterness and delusions, but he seems totally lost on the idea that most of us can have disconnected hookups with hot young things, because most guys will stick it in anything. Why would we settle for a hookup with this? Because money? Big whoop. It‚Äôs 2019, not the middle ages, unless he‚Äôs throwing in a car and a year‚Äôs worth of rent paid, she‚Äôll be fine without his charity. 
Also no young girls should be around this man. I wish to God you could find her parent in order to ensure contact with him is entirely supervised. And tell Allen *not* to tone down the profile. Women should know exactly what they‚Äôre getting into.",1571756965,f4qqlqa,t3_dkvjdy,t5_xaiot
5163,ceramicunicorn,"lol you can bet there‚Äôs a certain type thad would show up in sweats to meet Bey (or for a job interview, depending on the company culture)! Maybe the nicest most designer ones they have, but still. I‚Äôm guessing though that‚Äôs not what came through. Anyway, I‚Äôm glad you moved on, although I probably wouldn‚Äôt have bothered with the explanation...only because what you experienced (bad behavior, bad hygiene), I have found to be de rigueur, and I just don‚Äôt have the energy to correct each and every one (I do give feedback if I‚Äôm asked for it).",1571670663,f4lrxvm,t1_f4lqlu7,t5_xaiot
5164,ceramicunicorn,"Just to be honest, I‚Äôm way more bothered by the behavior and poor hygiene. Dealbreakers. But not really the sweatpants, unless it was a super nice place where he stuck out...or he was clearly slovenly and out of shape. I find that active people tend to dress pretty casually, so I don‚Äôt mind it. Just offering a different perspective, since it was a highlighted point.",1571669585,f4lod6f,t3_dkuqne,t5_xaiot

My photos and bio have been positively eval‚Äôd. They are as good as they can be without getting pro photos, which I don‚Äôt have the means for right now.
Meanwhile, in another post I see ‚ÄúI got like 4 messages of the height, body type, education level I wanted, crystal clearly relationship minded and no kids that I wanted the day after my bf broke up with me, within hours‚Äù.
That being said, being 15 years younger than me probably helps. And- probably drop dead gorgeous? Or the post was just- not true. 
So it seems what I can get is a dad who drinks a lot and, off a different app, a guy who is very nice but lives with a family with kids and shares common space with them.

You know who never worries about whether we are in ‚Äúcompatible stages in life‚Äù? Men 9 years OLDER. Or 15 years older. Or 20! With children (I have none), sometimes grandchildren, men who own companies, who live suburban lives, who don‚Äôt go out like I do, who are approaching retirement.

And so then I wonder about a singles resort and again I‚Äôm thinking, it‚Äôs gonna be like, so it‚Äôs my looks that you value? So you‚Äôre looking to hook up and never speak again? What happened here stays here? 

It‚Äôs like now that my eyes have been opened, I feel resigned to taking on one of these ‚Äúvery visual! very physical!‚Äù creatures, and then having to mold him so he can learn what it is to value someone for who they truly are and not just what they look like.

The time it worked out before that was my ex-husband. All I can say is that I wasn‚Äôt very into him when I met him. I found him reckless and impulsive and didn‚Äôt expect his feelings to last.

5283,cjs293,"The reason why everyone says you have to be happy on your own, is because it's true. Going into a relationship expecting them to bring happiness to your life is a recipe for  a bad relationship. You need to have your own independence and own sources of fulfillment/happiness from life outside of a relationship. Not being in a relationship should not be driving you to say these things -- venting or not. Expecting a relationship to make you happy puts a lot of unconscious pressure on your partner and a goal that they won't be able to help you reach. When you date someone, they should be complementing the life you already set for yourself. They should not be your everything or sole source of happiness. 

Dating isn't easy, but you are putting way too much pressure on it and need to take a step back. The best relationships come when you aren't trying so hard to find someone. Because with that mentality, you will eventually be clinging onto every seemingly good date you go on, which will cloud your real view of the person. Take your time.

I was.. sadly.. sucked into the popcorn of MRP for quite a while.. trying to diagnose exactly what's wrong with those men.

Their rigid thought processes need a flow chart to solve problems. MRP ""solutions"" appeal to them.

Let's translate the first few steps of dread, so you can see why these stemcels were jumping on the couch and hooting ""it works"".

1. Stop being a whiny little bitch when she says no to sex (-unattractive), stop being a Nice Guy (about 100 unattractive behaviours in that book)

2. Stop being a lazy, aimless, minimum wage fuck who's cruising through life now that he ""got the girl"" and expects sex on tap just for getting married (-unattractive). Go to the gym (+attractive), lose fat gut (-unattractive).

3. Stop being a boring couch potato, ""gaming"" isn't a hobby (-unattractive). Get out from underfoot and get a real hobby. Have something interesting to talk about for once (+attractive).

4. Conditioning lol. Whenever she's pissed and you leave, she's happy, but it didn't work how you think. Give her alone time so she can relax (+attractive)

5. Dress and groom better, learn to flirt and seduce your wife instead of going for the titty honk. (+attractive)

By now they're going ""omg hurr durr who knew, stop being an unattractive fucktard and she responds"". Most of them stop here because they simply don't have the social skills to flirt with waitresses without a 1 mile radius of second hand cringe.

They freely admit, trying to seduce while still being unattractive is a huge turn off (again, no shit). Don't do step 5 with a beer belly, then pout and cry about ""muh needs"" when she shoots you down.

The first steps to being fuckable, stop being unfuckable.

This pattern is repeated a *lot* on the porn addict subs - /r/loveafterporn and /r/partnersofpornaddicts - heaps of sex at the start while you're shiny and new and they're not using (and you're the source of constant dopamine hits), and then the novelty wears off and they resume porn use, which leads to ED in the days after they binge.

If he doesn't use for a couple of days, does he seem more present, attentive, focused on you?

And sometimes he seems to not care so much and he's not present, going through the motions?

Daily use is *not* normal and healthy. It's an addiction and men rarely want to acknowledge it or admit it, or consider stopping. It's been normalized, and that shit ain't normal.

If he's been honest about his previous use (once a day is a lot...) he's already halfway there. Would he be open to learning how destructive to the relationship it is and stopping completely?

imo a lot of them have severely low self-esteem, and desperately need the validation of their spouse sexually desiring them, and they confuse it for love. Nothing else will do. Acts of kindness, non-sexual intimacy, words of admiration and affirmation, gifts, being pleasant and kind, none of it will do. Only sex will do. Imagine being the one required to prop up their entire world with your vagina.

I also believe a lot of them have chemical imbalances, such as depression or a lack of dopamine. They NEED the oxytocin and dopamine after sex to feel normal. They have no other ways to self-soothe and regulate their emotions (therapy, exercise, connection with other friends), and they start blaming their wives when they FEEL unloved, undesired, unwanted and depressed. Yes, they sink into a deep depression and blame you, if you won't fuck them. As if your vagina is an SSRI.

It's not just compatibility via acts + frequency.

Find out their world view, self-esteem, levels of validation required, and love language. If their dick is their love language, run.

* The mind overvalues reward, fails to appreciate risk, and fails to activate systems that warn of impending danger.

Person B grew up with normal parents who let them have a firm sense of Self, who never lied, tricked, interrogated or otherwise mindfucked them.

Person B looks at A in confusion and says ""No you're wrong, go away, you seem kind of absurd"" (or they just sense it, and distance themselves, because they're healthy).

Person A finds a new victim, C. Person C grew up with a personality disordered parent who frequently thought C was a clone of themselves, or never listened when the child described their preferences, opinions, ideas and dreams. They argued with and denied who C was, as an actual person. Person C lost their sense of Self, and let a disordered person define their Reality. They have weak boundaries and had their protective instincts beaten or berated out of them. It feels familiar to have someone tell you what to do, who you are, and what's Really going on, because you're so forgetful and don't know who you are, or how to protect yourself. C thinks that the way to earn love is to have no boundaries and let someone else tell you all about your Self.

3. Complex PTSD - childhood abuse, neglect and abandonment has been recognized by the CDC to cause complex trauma, which manifests as most of our current day maladies. I suspect every woman who ""keeps finding narcissistic men"" is a codependent fawn.

4. The Human Magnet Syndrome - more in depth and intergenerational reasons for being a narcissist or a people pleaser.

She was also busy and emotionally neglected him. He had to share a lot of things with his siblings. He grew into a skinny, socially awkward ginger with poor social skills and was a virgin until 19 or so. She overemphasised scholastic achievement in the household and let the golden child eldest son win illogical arguments without correction. His dad's catch phrase was ""no whining"" so he was neglected by both parents.

So he was:

emotionally stunted like a 2 year old. he rapidly regressed and wanted cuddles over everything (including my need to sleep) and his own housework. his place was fairly filthy. I was his new Mummy. Yay.

interpersonally stunted like a 5 year old, he didn't know basic social skills that we learn in kindy.

He had ADHD and Alexithymia. She didn't know this (he had a very big family), no-one had ever had an in depth conversation with the guy and *noticed* he had severe learning, memory, non-verbal and tone of voice deficits. Complete inability to recognize my emotions. This led to a detrimental lack of empathy. He violated my boundaries and couldn't tell I was upset.

belligerent, argumentative, and created arguments to win out of nothing. he had no active listening skills. most of what he did was verbal abuse. he said he spoke to everyone like this. he had no close friends. I was his new verbal punching bag, he was ""winning"" all the arguments he never got to win vs his brother, and he felt special, clever, superior and powerful. He was the ""always mister right"" and ""water torturer"" type abuser from ""Why Does He Do That"".

he was a mild hoarder, combined with the memory issues, had too much meat and like 10 apples in his fridge at all times, as well as the usual ""spare room full of junk"". He kept bringing additional things into his house to feel safe.

porn addict for 25 years, form of hoarding and self-soothing

something fucked him up and he became voyeuristic. tons of his porn was ""spy cams in showers"", teens, and cameras going right up vaginas. he was 40 years old. he also creeped on me in the shower until I had to lock my own bathroom door.

obviously his deep fear of abandonment combined with executive functioning deficits made him think that ""lying to my face"" that he wasn't a porn user was a good idea. right after I said ""liars and porn users are my dealbreaker"".

He was also the ""pathetic narcissist"" from the book Sex &amp; the Narcissist. Kept the facade that he was bumbling and inexperienced in bed. That was his whole M.O. woe is me, i'm just an inexperienced boyfriend. you'll have to do everything.

I told her about the neglect she had done and that he had ADHD, no social skills, and was abusive. I was still a dumbass and didn't tell her about the porn addiction.

I doubt she'll ever truly grasp how fucked up he is. It's not like he's going to tell her.

Subtle 'tactics' are suggested for every step of the \*cough* seduction - incapacitate, isolate, escalate - aka get you drunk, get you home and rape you. They call it ""lowering her Bitch Shields, getting past her Anti-Slut Defences, giving her plausible deniability, and overcoming resistance"". I call it the Rapists Handbook.

Incapacitate - usually alcohol, could be sleep deprivation. ""Come on, just have one drink. You're no fun. I bet you can't match my drinks! Just stay for one more, I'm having such a good time, aren't you? You don't need sleep, let's stay up and watch the sun rise, it will be so romantic. You didn't like that drink? Try a different kind. I bet you like girly drinks. Let me top that up for you. But I paid for a whole bottle of wine. Don't let it go to waste. Oh god, you're not one of those boring people who don't drink are you. Could have told me before I came all this way that it would be a waste of time. What's the matter, are you a lightweight? Can't hold your liquor? That girl over there is being a good sport""

Isolate - ""Come back to my place so I can show you &lt;random cool thing&gt;, it'll be quick. I know another bar down the street, let's ditch your friends. Come check out my car. Can I come in for a minute? I have to use the bathroom.

6 months is about how long a disordered person can keep a mask on, so if his behaviour stops being great here, he's going to phase 2 as one of two things. He's an abuser, and p1 was lovebombing to get you hooked, in which case p3 will be the cycle of abuse where you're convinced you can get 'the good guy you know he is' back.

What happens as she ages and it's no longer innocent and he expects her to still have no boundaries. What happens when she starts saying no. What happens when she starts dating other boys and becomes a sexual being. What happens when he *neeeeeds* her to come back and soothe him and she rejects him. I can see this turning into mania and obsession.

It's emotional incest and engulfment. It's abuse of his power as the caretaker for a child. He should be meeting her needs unconditionally, not relying on a CHILD to meet his. This dynamic isn't healthy.

Are you way down in the negatives, and the meds put you at ""meh""?

When was the last time you were happy and felt that spark of joy?

The only thing I can relate it to, is when I was on BC pill, and it was as if my joy was dampened? I felt kinda meh, and was unable to get that spark of joy, wonder, excitement, that surge of lust required to get into sex. (what a great contraceptive!)

I guess what I mean is, do you (or anyone) know if a different med will kinda.. uncap that joy, allow you to feel the spark of lust.

Or are people with depression, on meds, doomed to never feel lust :(

Would a more holistic approach to your health be possible? Set smaller goals to nibble away at every issue? When you're depressed, solving them all completely, all at once, may seem insurmountable.

So for the next week, your goals are a 10 minute walk every day, to the corner and back. Get some sunlight. At least one healthy meal such as a smoothy. 20 minutes of journalling where you write down things you're grateful for in your life, your partner and yourself.

Same goes for age, weight, catfish/better looking pics and marital status. Zero tolerance for complete lies about who he is.

They may blame themselves for their lack of sociability. This can decrease self esteem and begin a cycle of self-doubt and negativity.

Someone with depression may develop irrational or disproportionate feelings of guilt.

People with depression sometimes become intolerant of the behaviour of others.  A depressed person can become overly sensitive to perceived slights and even experience emotional outbursts when they feel slighted.

People with depression can become preoccupied with what is wrong with them, leading to anxiety.

People with depression often develop a pessimistic view of life.

Disturbed sleep is one of the most common symptoms of depression. Sleep deprivation adds to fatigue and exacerbates other symptoms such as low productivity and feelings of self-worth.

Depression can occur alongside pain one cannot link to another issue or injury, including headaches, muscle aches, and chest pain.

I want to guess your wife is more anxious and irritated than she's letting on, with the idea that she has to ramp herself up for cuddling? More like brace herself for the incoming anxiety.

In the end of my last terrible relationship, the idea of cuddling him made my skin crawl. It was no longer a relaxing, intimate activity. He had ruined it over the years of taking liberties, violating my boundaries, having no respect for my autonomy, and simply using me for his own selfish gratification. Any movement to come in for a cuddle was just another attack, another way for him to Take from me and ignore me. He clearly wasnt looking at my face. He was ignoring my distress and discomfort. For the entire relationship. He was a *danger* to me.

If a dude isn't in attunement with me, can't read my facial expressions, it's incredibly dangerous. He was just plowing on with taking his pleasure and it disgusted me.

He had a lot of mental and emotional problems, not saying you're like this.

But if what you've been doing is 1/10th of what my ex did, I can see why your wife has shut down and shut you out. You're not safe. Don't make babies with unsafe man. On a primal level. She can go through the motions of treating you well, but deep down, I doubt she truly trusts you with her body or her life. Go to a haunted house this Halloween.. see if she pushes you in front of a dude with a chainsaw.... ;)

I have a terrible picker, so I'll also be crowd-sourcing other women's opinions of the men.

2. Lying. They're lazy or want to fuck with you, and pretend to forget, training you to do the work yourself because it's easier than the hassle. Example ""no I didn't do xyz it's a mystery"" (only works on fuzzy instances where it's possible they didn't do xyz).

""Come as you are"" will explain your libido brakes and accelerators. Many people make the mistake of stomping on the accelerators, trying to fire up their partner's libido, spice it up, turn them on, when really it's a brakes problem.

3 kids and no childcare sounds like a TON on your brakes - stress, exhaustion, mental and physical labor looking after 5 people.

Do whatever's necessary to take those brakes off so you get some time to yourself to unwind and get back to.. well, your Self, not mommy, not wife, you.

You may also have responsive desire. For example, my libido is like.. -5 when nothing is happening. A crude/juvenile/overt/graphic approach, tv show, comment or touch is a turn OFF. A sex scene out of nowhere in a movie is like woah dude wtf. Whereas the slower romance and flirting between characters that makes sense is a much nicer build up to being receptive irl.

How's your husband's flirt game? Is he doing nothing to seduce you and keep you at zero or +1 during the day, and randomly going ""hey, sex?"". Keeping your mind lightly on sex all the time (without coming across as heavy badgering) is easier than trying to dig you out from -5. Of course you'll only be receptive to flirting once the brakes are off.

Something else you can do is track your cycle and put a reminder in your fitbit or ovulation app to prompt you to pounce him / overtly make yourself available for his initiation.

Is he doing anything other than being critical of your performance? Has he asked how he can help, or just blaming you. So many times I read about partners being so awful, short tempered, sulky, whiny, pouty, dismissive, oblivious about Life and angry, and expecting that to turn their partner on.

Your body fat is because of diet - cut out breads/pasta and sugar. Learn simple recipes with meat+veg like beef stir fry.

6682,ino_y,"Yes, huge red flags. Being inconsistent with his treatment of you until you're isolated is alarming.

A decent guy would be proud to claim you and show you off in public, and act the same - affectionate and caring - as behind closed doors. ""doesn't like being intimate"" is bullshit code for ""embarrassed to be seen/associated with you, and doesn't actually care for you, about you, or whether this hurts your feelings"". He could at least hold your hand, but he's pleased you fell for this weak excuse. Don't make or take excuses for poor treatment.

He's conditioning you to accept different treatment in public vs private, and that always ends badly - in private he starts saying shit like ""you made me so angry"", but you've already accepted the notion that ""he treats you differently in private"" so this alternating behaviour is the norm. Then you start wishing for ""the real him"" to come back.

If he treated you nicely in public and private, then started getting angry in private, it would be a starker contrast, and you'd bail, see?

You're already unhappy and questioning his behaviour now. He's leaving for college. Long-distance first relationships never work, not when you're already far from rock solid.

I know it feels nice to have someone, and have the idea of a future, that safety and security. But he's already not what you hope. You're already wishing to change him.

Research things like Boundaries and how to say no, Assertiveness, codependency, what does emotional blackmail look like and so on.

Great books - When I say no I feel Guilty, Not Nice, The Art of Saying No, Boundaries.

Make a list of your dating Rules. eg, never go to a man's house, get yourself to and from dates, never cook and clean for a man who isn't your husband, never go to a place you can't get yourself home from, only 1 drink on a date.

Make a list of shady behaviour so you can spot it early, eg. men who ignore you when you say No, and who treat it as a negotiation or ""convince me"", men who place their wants over your needs (eg you Need to go home and sleep, they Want to spend another hour with you).

Think deeply about what went wrong when they were taking advantage of you. What red flags did you ignore, what were you thinking and feeling when they started up their boundary pushing shit.

Get your self-care and household in order. Have a daily and weekly routine. If you get this right and up to scratch, you really won't have time to date or be lonely. It will become an ingrained habit that you will be able to do without effort, for the rest of your life, and when things get tough.

How myopic. How dick-centric. Of course he can only see ""sex life"". Of course if his dick fell off, he'd scramble to fix it. Because he's obsessed and consumed, with tunnel vision.

If you broke your ""relationship"", would you be so quick to assign blame? Would your partner make her displeasure immediately known?

That your complete lack of effort means you don't love her? That until you're ready to resolve your ""issues"" and resume a normal, healthy relationship, she's valid in treating you like a child?

No? Because she has a shred of humanity, and is unfortunately trapped with a Drill Sergeant type of Abuser from Why Does He Do That.

The absolutes, the rigidity, the entitlement oozing from this insight into the psyche of an abuser made my skin crawl.

Entitled to physical, emotional and sexual caretaking, deference, and freedom from accountability. That he has inflated rights, he knows best, so he's righteously punishing her, correcting her and retaliating against her for resisting his control. Controlling every part of her life in a farcical display of ""improving"" her, but actually applying so much pressure in so many areas, her only release is to cave to his selfish demands in one area. The part where he thinks SHE is abusive? Fucking lol. I feel sick.

Oh jesus christ. you know where that's from? Married Man's Sex Life Primer. A fucking joke of a book written by a dude with no credentials, who got all his wisdom from like.. observing 3 women at work or some crap.

The heading was ""You're not responsible for her orgasm"" and it was highlighted a few thousand times. The actual explanation has been ignored, because men are lazy shits who gleefully clapped like monkeys over the removal of responsibility the title implied.

If anyone bothered to read it, yes, you're responsible for figuring out your sexuality. What turns you on and off, how you prefer foreplay, where your erogenous zones are, how gently or firmly and how long you like to be touched. Exactly how do you orgasm, what do you need. Articulate that. Give him a clue.

The message to the men was ""if she's going to lay there and expect you to experiment for 2 hours while she gives no clues, then yeah, so sad, you're not responsible. If she DOES tell you what to do, LISTEN. Do what she needs, or you know what? She's not going to come back for more, duh"".

Ladies, yes, you are responsible for experimenting on your own, and you're responsible for telling him exactly how you orgasm. If he starts up his bullshit of faux inexperience, incompetence, or ""his ex didn't do it like that"", or ""I know what I'm doing"",

6872,jalapenopancakes,"A culmination of things that overwhelmed me badly causing an emotional meltdown in the middle of a flight from New York to Detroit.  When I landed it was pretty much open sobbing, sitting on the floor at DTW. 

I was in a dead end relationship and a dead end job, and I hated where I lived. I was on my way home from an absolutely horrible business trip (even though I had closed deals and hit goals, it was never enough for my boss), and I was at my wits end. My mental health was garbage.   I think I broke down when I realized that I desperately wanted to be home, but I also realized that I will never get the support or love I need there either. I felt so trapped and for whatever reason I couldn‚Äôt just brush it off like I had the thousand times before that.  The more I thought about sucking it up and convincing myself that it was okay and that it wasn‚Äôt my fault, the more that path just felt completely impassable and overwhelming. It WAS my fault, and it was hard to accept. 

Once the crying hysteria ended (lol you have no idea how many times I was asked by strangers if I was okay. if you happened to be there at DTW with a woman in a suit audibly wailing, I‚Äôm sorry!), I cleaned up in the airport bathroom, freshened up, and then sat down outside of my gate and opened up a notebook and wrote down what I wanted my life to be like in 5 years.  I still have that piece of paper today.  I wanted a career with a company that loved me and paid me my worth, I wanted a husband that knew my value and treated me super well, I wanted a child, I wanted an MBA, I wanted to lose weight and I wanted to return to the gym. 

Called my mom once I landed home from the connecting flight and talked to her the whole way home and I told her what I was going to do. 

- 1 week later I dumped my ex bf of 4+ years. 
- A week after that I moved out of a house I hated and into a bright, sunny, cheerful apartment.  
- After I completed my move, for the next three months I job hunted like mad. I called on every resource I knew. I had old college roommates looking at my resume, high school friends practicing interview questions with me, I was calling every friend or acquaintance I knew who had a job at a reputable company and asking how to navigate the waters. I was even calling my clients for references and other opportunities. In the end, I had 3 awesome offers and I took the one with the absolutely amazing company I‚Äôm with today.  Then I told my old boss to fuck herself to her face and I only gave her a few days notice. 
- Those three months were also my three best months in sales (100k/mo+) I ever had at my old company. I went out with a bang. 
- By accepting the offer I had instantly increased my income by about 20k annually. 
- Then, from 3 months after the meltdown to 8 months after, hardcore nun mode. Standards for dating went sky high. I started working out all the time, eating better, and studying for the GRE.  I ran my first 5k ever. At the end of the 8 months I started dating my husband. 
- 15 months post meltdown I was engaged, I had lost 60 lbs, and had started my MBA. I had an office instead of a cube at my work by then. 
- 24 months post meltdown I had been promoted and I married my husband. 

It just keeps going. The only thing I have yet to cross off the list is completing my MBA and having a child, and both are happening in the near future.   All because I stopped blaming everything around me and took responsibility for where my life was.",1569674549,f1p7zdf,t1_f1p4f3l,t5_2ya42

I have gone on SO MANY dates where it became painfully obvious that the man wanted to treat me like some kind of sex dispenser: dates and flowers and attention go in and sex comes out.  And the sad thing is that women aren‚Äôt really taught how to see this shit behavior anymore: I certainly had to figure it out for myself.   We get caught up in the romance bit of it, excited that he sees us as a person and not a thing, but lo and behold if you don‚Äôt put out... the magic is gone. 

I can count the number of men on one hand that I‚Äôve gone on dates with who didn‚Äôt see me as a prize and saw me as a complex human being.",1569669383,f1p1fhd,t1_f1ot3eh,t5_2ya42
6876,jalapenopancakes,"Many, surprisingly enough. Keep in mind, the perspective here is from a woman who wanted a husband, not casual sex.   Men here generally tend to focus mainly on the ‚Äúreceiving casual sex‚Äù aspect of dating.  The criteria for success for what I was looking for is vastly different and reprioritized from what I would be looking for if I wanted something casual. 

As said above, women will often settle for the first man who shows confidence when pursuing her, and will stay in a dead end relationship in hopes of salvaging it far beyond when she should have left. Men do this too, of course, but I‚Äôve noticed that actually MOST of the women my age (older end of millennials) that I personally know will excuse the shit out of their boyfriends (or husbands) horrible behavior. 

One personal example: my best friend dated a guy. He was decent to look at (he looked kinda greasy to me but I could see why someone might like him), charismatic, and creative. However, this man had a raging alcohol problem and would drink around his child (from a prior relationship) and my best friend would just.. make excuses for it.  ‚ÄúOh well, he doesn‚Äôt drink all the time ‚Äú and ‚Äúwell at least his child was young enough so that he doesn‚Äôt have to remember finding an empty bottle of vodka in the backyard.‚Äù

If that were my boyfriend, I would have trashed him the second I even sensed the booze problem. 

I personally excused some bad behavior and lowered my standards for men before I learned that it was the exact opposite of what I should do if I wanted a lasting marriage. My ex boyfriend (4+ years LTR) had an ex wife and a child from that marriage, and he would have the child at our home every other weekend. Normal weekend dad relationship.   

When my ex would drive the hour and a half or so to pick up his son, the first thing he would do when he arrived home was go and take a nap and leave the child in my care for most of Friday evening.  After he felt like he had slept enough, then he‚Äôd play video games and still leave the child with me. He may watch a movie with him or take him somewhere out on Saturday, but mostly my ex would take most of his precious time with his son and spend it on naps and games for himself. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong: I LOVED this kid. It was the hardest part about breaking up.  But we were dating and living together, he had no intention of ever proposing to me, and he used me to do wife-shit for him constantly.  I lowered my standards for treatment and commitment because I thought if I was nice, he‚Äôd see my value and change.

Here‚Äôs what I did:

- I behaved in a receptive way. I allowed myself to be pampered, taken care of, etc. BUT, I always showed gratitude and poise when men gave me resources.  I never put myself down (‚Äúyou‚Äôre so sweet, I don‚Äôt deserve this!‚Äù but instead always put an emphasis on how his actions made me feel (‚Äúoh you‚Äôre so sweet, you make me feel so wonderful!‚Äù). 
- I would push subtly for men to contact me and treat me in ways I felt were the best to get to know him and establish intimacy. For me, this was phone calls.  Instead of ‚Äústop texting me, I don‚Äôt like it‚Äù I said things like ‚Äúwhen a man calls me, it makes me feel very cherished.‚Äù  They will call. 
- I never outwardly said I was dating other men (not sleeping with) but I would always tell the truth when asked. ‚ÄúYes. I‚Äôm dating other men. It‚Äôs important for me to continue to date because marriage is a decision that cannot be made lightly.‚Äù 
- When my husband asked me to his girlfriend, I said No, and I then restated what I wanted. I said that I thought he was incredible, but a committed relationship without marriage wasn‚Äôt what I was ultimately looking for.  He was perplexed and a little upset at first, but he came right back with a vengeance. 

He took up all my time. He made it impossible for me to make plans with other men because he was so busy trying to keep me from ever meeting them. He figured out my game (and called me out on it several times, hah!) and learned how to win it.

My husband went all out for me.  I have dated scores and scores and kissed a zoo full of toads.

This stage of your life is one of the few opportunities to use your biological sex to your advantage.

If you can research some search term like ""the surprising reason why x"" you'll come across examples of the kind of thing I'm thinking of. 

So for instance, your character is acting strange. It seems to have one explanation. But there's ""a surprising reason why.""

The world is messed up in some way. Common sense would say it's because some source is causing the problem. Or the world appears to be operating smoothly, naturally. But there's ""a surprising reason why"" it's actually not. 

The important pieces are that you have lock-tight intellectual understanding of how the ""surprising reason why"" *works* logically and that the reason not so cliche and done-to-death as to be really unsurprising. 

Also, you need to include some descriptive hints that if someone else were an already expert on this ""surprising reason why"" they would be able to use inductive reasoning to guess what was going on. So, a psychologist for instance might be able to recognize the character's behavior as symptoms of something bigger and more troubling whereas readers might find the same personality attributes charming or random.

Women‚Äôs leagues are very few and far in between in the US, and they consist of women who have been playing since they were kids. No one watches the games,  and women just play for the sake of playing the game generally. 

Roller derby is different in the sense that there‚Äôs a TON more than just playing the game. It‚Äôs the social scene, it‚Äôs the LGBT scene, it‚Äôs the visibility,  the camaraderie, and the endless thinkpieces on gender written about derby. 

When a man joins a women‚Äôs roller derby league, he‚Äôs offered endless validation.

Sex SHOULD be something that can be freely enjoyed by both parties, that should never have any negative affect on your value as a person, but we don‚Äôt live in a perfect world.  We live in a world where sex is weaponized, and there‚Äôs no massive cultural change on the horizon. 

My accidentally-pinkpilled mother (who has been deliberately single for ~ 15 years now) put it best: 

‚ÄúMen are like dogs. They can take an old bone and bury it in the backyard and forget about it for 10 years but as soon as another dog goes in that backyard and started digging up that bone, that dog is going to suddenly defend that old bone with everything he‚Äôs got.‚Äù

Most men never want what is easily available. That‚Äôs what FDS is all about: we protect ourselves from this behavior and we deliberately behave in ways that purposely weed out the dogs from the high value men.   Withholding sex is a way to protect ourselves from emotionally investing in a man, and then getting hurt over and over again. I lament with you: it shouldn‚Äôt be this way.

7186,jalapenopancakes,"I lost my father to suicide when I was a child.  I am so, so sorry for your loss. 

This pain you feel right now will feel unbearable and it will feel this way for awhile.  You won‚Äôt know truly why it happened and you will never get the answers you need to make it feel better right now. Racing through all the scenarios and ruminating over what went wrong will only make the pain worse.  Just know: what happened was beyond your control. 

For me, my dads suicide was almost an out of body experience, then shock, then followed with the sinking-pit, punched in the stomach type of feeling that was seemingly never ending.  To cope, I found that it helped to ground myself: focus on the immediate, tangible things near you. What is near you, what can be touched?  What does it smell like?  What does it feel like?  I had a really heavy blanket back then and I‚Äôd go under it when I felt this way just to feel an experience that wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äúgut punch.‚Äù  Spending time with a pet or a family member with some emotional intelligence (folks who don‚Äôt handle emotions well will not help you here) is also healing and will help you stay connected to the world and help alleviate that tendency to ruminate over your friends death.  

Don‚Äôt turn to alcohol or drugs, and get in to see a therapist. As soon as you can.  This is trauma and it affects the body and mind, and you need to heal in order to be well. Therapists can help you do this.  

And last.. IT IS GOING TO GET BETTER. This pain is immense. It‚Äôs overpowering, and it‚Äôs awful, but it‚Äôs not forever. You will survive this and you will begin to heal. 

I wish you the very best. You‚Äôre not alone. People have experienced this pain that you‚Äôre feeling right now and they‚Äôve lived, and even thrived afterwards.  Be very kind to yourself. You need it, you deserve it. Please take care.",1573450929,f77ckge,t3_duna03,t5_2yuqy

It's an artful dance between innocence and raunchyness that men are absolutely captivated by. It's a lot of fun and an excellent way to get a man absolutely hooked on you. 

The key is subtlety. You don't have to describe in graphic raunchy detail what you want to do to him, but being too prudish is straight up boring. A little insinuation goes a long way. You gradually ramp it up, then lay off, then ramp it up again. He'll be enthralled by the push/pull, and before he knows it, he's your addict.

7599,lyricthesecond,"&gt; But how long to wait? A year? 6 months?

It's more a matter of getting to know him, vetting him and determining if he's trustworthy rather than any prescribed period of time. In women, orgasms kickstart logic-fogging bonding hormones like oxytocin in the brain, so you want to be sure you're not bonding to a piece of shit. 

Nothing is foolproof, but good signs I've noticed are: He's not overly secretive about his phone/computer, he respects your boundaries and doesn't try to talk you into things you've said no to, doesn't make snide jokes at your expense (you're not being too sensitive, he's just a dick), doesn't gawk at other women when you're out, doesn't expect you to pay for things, he introduces you to friends and family, makes time to see you regularly, accepts you as you are and doesn't try to change you. 

 Also a big part of it is trusting your instincts. Do you believe in your heart that this man in genuine, or are you just fooling yourself because he checks off your boxes you want him to be ""the one?"" Does something just feel ""off"" about him? Do you often find yourself questioning your reality? Is he too smooth or just seems ""too good to be true?"" Do you know his home and work addresses? Exactly what he does for a living? How does he deal with conflict? What's his sti status?

I'll let you in on a secret, your intuition is more powerful than you know. When you're with a high value man who treats you well, it *feels* right. If you have to ask yourself if you're being too sensitive, you're not. When the relationship is healthy, you're not constantly stressing over the things he does, questioning your reality, trying to ignore that painful gnawing in the pit of your stomach.

 Of course, no relationship is perfect. We all have our ups and downs. But when you're feeling bad more often than you're feeling good, when the whole relationship is mostly misery and drama with sprinkles of good feelings here and there, then that means your relationship is bullshit.

7615,lyricthesecond,"You know, my parents have a very similar dynamic. Due to their lack of closeness, I became my mother's confidant from a young age. She complained to me, and relied on me for the emotional intimacy that she wasn't getting from my dad. I was made to feel responsible for her happiness.

It wasn't till much later in life that I realized this in itself was a form of abuse on me perpetuated by my mother. Since she was the ""lesser of two evils"" between my parents, I related and sympathized with her more, but unbeknownst to me, I was being emotionally mistreated by her. I gradually started started to distance myself from her and her problems. These days, I suggest that she talks to a therapist about it and I've limited contact. As soon as she started ranting about my dad, i no longer sympathized with her, but instead encouraged her to take responsibility for her own life. My life is much better for it. After all, I have my own problems to deal with. 

At the end of the day you have to realize that your mother is making a choice. Like you said, ""it takes two to tango"" Regardless of the reasoning behind it, she's choosing to stay with a man who mistreats her, disrespects her and takes her for granted. She's choosing to adopt the role of a victim. She's choosing misery over joy. Despite being able to manage her life and support herself, she has decided that she cannot live without him. 

Your parents relationship isn't your responsibility or problem. Don't allow your energy to be sucked into that dynamic.  You also have your own life and problems to deal with. 

It sounds like you're young, and possibly still living at home. It takes time and distance from the situation to see things for what they truly are. Based on some of the things you said about your mom's opinion on your dating choices, it sounds at though she has some issues distinguishing boundaries between herself and you, her wants and your needs. It doesn't sound like she fully respects you as an autonomous individual. 

It's a messy process, but try to disengage from that whole situation as much as possible. It's not healthy for you to be exposed to that.

2. Then, education. If there isn‚Äôt a college listed anywhere, swipe left. If the college listed is more than 40 miles away, swipe left (Tinder U shows me a lot of people from far away colleges). 

3. If they pass that filter, I look at the profile. If they have less than 3 photos or have nothing on their bio, I swipe left. Most likely looking for a hookup. If their bio says they want a plug/hookup/‚Äújust want to meet new people‚Äù/fun time, swipe left. If they have overtly sexual bios/pics, swipe left.

If you seek out an explanation from someone who turns out to be deceiving you, OF COURSE he's going to come up with some plausible or semi-plausible answer to throw you off.  Don't give him a chance to make you doubt yourself. This is especially true in the beginning, when you don't know him. 

If he's sociopathic, he'll already have a whole library of excuses and cover-ups at the ready.

First red flag, but I chose to ignore it because we had good chemistry over the phone. I steered it to dinner instead which he agreed on, and then he suggested a local deli üôÑ 

At that point I called it off, (which, in hindsight I should have stuck with). He apologized and suggested several nicer places. I ignored my gut and went out with him anyway because ""he seemed so nice on the phone."" 

Needless to say, the chemistry didn't carry over in person and he was just a hot mess. The date was a borderline disaster. 

Moral of the story, if he initially suggests a low effort date, then he's a low-effort man. For whatever reason, he's trying to invest as little as possible in you.

When I did let a bit of the real me out, they weren't about that... Who they met me as is what they wanted.

I just moved, have a total geek out job, I dress like a bum.. For real... And I'm just enjoying being super comfortable and just being me. The guys who meet me like this, they are attracted to me for different reasons, because of who I am.

A guy I'm seeing took me out to an event, he joked he only invited me to see what I look like in a dress. When he saw me, his jaw literally dropped and he couldn't take his eyes off me. And that felt awesome, cause it wasn't just him expecting of course I'll look that way, he was genuinely amazed and appreciated the effort I put into it. And we still got to geek out and have fun.  Definitely felt the difference between him enjoying my company and the guys enjoying arm candy.

So who you show guys is up to you...I anyway notice I get approached more now because I'm not as intimidating, and the guys who do approach me aren't just looking for one thing.

It really means they've come to peace with what they've decided to do and feel a weight off their shoulders, and all the great stuff they're doing is just from the burst of energy, living out what they know is the the rest of their life.

On the other hand, if they've been going through counseling, getting professional help and start coming around, there's a reason for their new outlook. But even then, it's always good to check in and see how they're doing. Seems like It's always the ones who seem like they're doing just fine who need to hear from loved ones the most.

I guess the thing is, we didn't treat it like our differences were just a number or just a different culture like it's something to ignore, we were interested in and embraced it. 

We broke up for totally different reasons after a 5yr relationship, but yeah...

By all appearances, nothing happened to me and I was okay. Didn't find out about it till I was a teen, but I grew up with dreams that my mom had kidnapped me and unexplained constant thoughts that my real family would find me one day and never felt like I belonged anywhere.

I'm in my 40s and even though I can watch horror movies and all sorts of crime stuff, kidnapping scenes is what terrifies me, in a really bad way.

I'm a hugger, and esp if there's been great conversation I'm happy to meet them and reach for a hug. Most times guys are okay with that, many times I've gotten a weird look and ended up apologizing awkwardly.

I've had sex on the first date and I've waited several months. Depends on my comfort level and neither sex soon nor waiting awhile made a difference. Guys I slept with soon have turned into long relationships, guys I waited too sleep with suddenly ghosted. So just do what feels right.

In most of my relationships, the guy pays for drinks and meals and I tend to be the one who cooks for him and invites him out to and pay for experiences, like tickets to a show or events etc. But lately I've run into guys who prefer splitting the check, so I don't cook anymore. First date usually he picks, he pays. But I do the whole, what looks good to you? thing to make sure I pick things in his budget. 

Other than that though, I just look at it like I would going out with any friend. The whole point isn't to act in a way to make him like our approve of me... So I can't really act wrong.

I'll be honest though and say that when I see a guy who is super stylish, which you definitely look like you put yourself together, I feel like he wouldnt be all too interested in me because Im super low key.  

Id also be worried you want me to be in the gym, rock climbing and out surfing with you.  I figure they mentions it cause they want someone to share a high active lifestyle with and want someone who can keep up with them, and thats sooo not me!

But, that just probably means you woulnt be interested in dating me, cause of lifestyle differences, so no harm in that.  Like if I saw at least one pic of you looking casual, and mention something like, Im into xyz, cool with someone who isnt but takes care of themselves, that would tip me into sending a message.

Go figure!

I divorced in my mid 20's, and figured I would finish what I started as far as the whole family thing, wanted another baby and assumed I would meet a guy, get married, have more, all that fun stuff. Wasnt in the cards.

Now Im back to the mentality of my youth... I want to work on my career and travel. It would be great to meet someone to share my life with, but so many my age are locked down with child custody/visitation, a house, a career theyve been in for years and well, just all very legitimate reasons they arent in any position to get up and go.  So while it would be nice, I am also mentally prepared for it that I may not find the guy who has the freedom I do.

On the other hand, had you not been pubic about it, your husband would'nt have experienced and opened his eyes to just how low and nasty his ""friend"" is.

Right now he's mourning the friendship. He chose to end things, and for good reason, but that's a long time to know someone and cut them out, even if it's for the best.

That was the final straw... And though she was truly a horrible friend, it took some time to get over it that I was never going to talk to her again.

A guest making demands on how you should live in your own home is rediculous. It's your home to furnish and use as you see fit. Some people have an extra room they use as an office. I had one I used as a library and craft room. Whatever the reason, you decided how you wanted to use the space you are paying for. 

Expecting you to change how you live, eat the cost of furnishing a bedroom, and putting all the dog things and the dog outside is rediculous. That weed is legal has nothing to do with not wanting your house to smell if it. I'm surprised at all the people who keep saying you have no right to anything that happens in your home and a guest has more say than you do so just give her everything she wants.

The argument that it's tough for a 20 something to live on their own doesn't apply here. It will for your children, but you're not her parent and you're not obligated to take care of any or all of your family members kids when they turn 18. 

Which leads me to why You're the AH. You never should've agreed to this in the first place. You already knew what your niece and her parents are like. Just like how you have the right to live how you want in your own home, you have the right to decide who lives in your own home.

She made the decision to take up the position before asking you if she can live there.

People are always on the lookout for typical depressive behavior, totally unaware that their super happy, funny friend is hiding their behind their ability to bring happiness to others.

On coming to terms with it that they are ready to go, they may feel relieved, like a weight off, will spend more time with loved ones and wrap up some loose ends.

There's a reason we do often hear... They seemed to happy, or that they just didn't seem like they'd do something like that and all the things they've been doing recently as proof they were happy.

I've been dating since my divorce in 2001 and can assure you, not a whole lot has changed since then. If you enjoy someones company, it's natural to want to see them again. If you don't hear from them, you're going to think they're not interested (I think the 3 day rule to contact someone went out in the 90s... If it was ever the in the to do).

Just take it easy and date by date, instead of worrying if you're enough to impress her, learn about her to see if she's someone you'd like to continue seeing again. It's like what they say about job interviews, you're interviewing them as much as they are you. They're looking for what they want to bring into the company, and you're looking to see if that's a company you want to be a part of.

So instead of feeling like any wrong move will run everything, just take it easy. She's just a regular human being.. Get to know her and if she doesn't like something about you or vice versa, you've still successfully dated. Dating doesn't mean you must spend your lives together after one date. So no worries, just have fun.

The guy I'm seeing now, I did that to him. He was dealing with his divorce, it was stressing him out, it was all he talked about, and we weren't seeing each other at all because he kept cancelling plans. I told him we should take a breather while he sorts things out. I knew there was a risk that I'd never hear from him again, but you know what? If I didn't, then I'd know there was no hope for us anyway.

Now I did reach out once just to say hello, and about one month after we stopped seeing each other, he called to ask me out, let me know the divorce is final and he wanted to spend his first evening as a single man with me. He says he thought about me all the time, but really appreciated he had that time to deal with everything.

Not a super happy ending, he's still emotionally dealing with his divorce, but at least aware enough about what he's capable of to not be exclusive. Still, we have dates coming up, he texts and calls, he's still putting in effort and knowing I'd be willing to walk away I think helps put things in perspective.

7712,ponchoacademy,"When it comes to stuff like this, I'm the worst woman to do this to. I'm going to paint a picture of a really messed up relationship, but bare with me cause it proves my point.

For 5 years I dated and lived with a guy who ran his own company... He had offices and factories in 4 different countries, traveled quite a bit and there were many late nights and early mornings on the phone because of the time differences.

When we first started dating, he lived in another country, but would visit me once a month, always called to say good morning and good night and made time to talk if I needed him. After a year, I moved to a city where his American office is and that's when we moved in together.. He still traveled about 1-2 weeks a month to his other offices and factories, but again, never missed a day to be the first and last voice I heard every day.

Stuff went to hell, then his business partner fell ill and he took up even more responsibility. Still, I never felt neglected, there were times he's have to spend several weeks at one of his other offices and he brought my daughter and I with him so that we weren't apart all that time and so we could see where he works and enjoy Europe. We didn't ever go more than 2 weeks without seeing each other. He was thoughtful, attentive, loving and though I understood he was running a company and all the stress that comes with it, I never felt like I wasn't important to him. 

In the end, I found out he was married, with 2 other girlfriends. And yes, I left immediately.

But, it taught me a variable lesson. If a guy can run an international multi million company while maintaining a wife and 4 girlfriends in 4 different countries for 5 years, there no excuse for a guy in my city to not have the time to acknowledge I exist or have any time to not see me.

So yeah, a super weird tale that proves, when a guy wants something, he makes time for it. There is no such thing as too busy.

I don't blame you one but for feeling the way you do. It sounds like he invited you into a relationship that he's not ready to make any time for. It would be one thing is you weren't exclusive, but it reads like he put you in lockdown and now feels is safe to stick you on the back burner while he puts all his focus simewhere else.

Personally, I would tell him you understand he has a lot on his plate, so you would like to take a step back so that he's free to focus on that, and then when he's ready, if you're still available, you'd like to reconnect and see what happens.",1569780140,f1w4jf3,t3_davqh8,t5_su6ij
7713,ponchoacademy,"While I do have a daughter, it has led to me getting really upset when I am frustrated with dating and people would tell me, why do you need to date? You have a kid! As if it's the same thing. Gah!!!

But yeah, besides that point, I really feel where you're coming from. I divorced almost 20yrs ago and really thought I had my whole life ahead of me to remarry, have more children, all that fun stuff, but it wasn't in the cards. Two long term relationships of 5 years each, leaving me with 10 years of feeling like...wtf life? While she was a total surprise, I'm grateful my daughter came to me, because as it turned out, that was my one shot.

I've received the advice to take some time being single and connect with myself... At which point I'm like okay... I'm going on 6 years, I'm learning a new language, have traveled, I took cooking classes, I taught myself programming and now in a new and amazing career because of it. Like.... Obviously I'm going this wrong, if 6 years and a total life overhaul isn't indicative of taking time to concentrate on myself, what is?! Lol ugh.

ETA: I said 6, but just realized my last long term relationship ended 10 years ago. My my how time flies!

And yeah, I had a solid no separated/divorced guys thing because of all the insane drama that's involved, but now that I'm in my 40s, most available guys I meet are either separated or freshly divorced. I figure in another 10 years I'll start running into widows and the stress that comes along with that.

While I really would love to meet someone, after almost 20 years of trying, I've come to terms with it that it may never happen. I used to be really sad about that, but now it would be no different than continuing my life as it's always been. Would be amazing to meet someone though, I admit. And I won't shut that door...

In the past year I've started an amazing career, money is no longer a stressful issue, heck, my credit score went up 150 points!! I'm living the life!! Lol

The only thing I'm missing and ready to concentrate on now is finding someone to share my life with. All the other stuff in my life didn't come easy for me, so I'm willing to understand this won't come easy either. 

As far as everyone else, I was once at a get together soon after my breakup with a guy I nearly married. Everyone there was either married or had a bf with them... I was the only single person there. I fell apart, stepped outside and called my ex in tears, the whole what's wrong with me, everyone else is with someone and why don't I deserve that too.

He was like, first of all, I'm a douchebag. (This was true) and second of all, would you actually even want any of those guys? He said if I just wanted a warm body to show up at places with, I could get that... Easy. But do I really want to spend my life with the first guy that comes along? 

I went back into the get together and really looked at what was going on. And yeah, he was right. Not only wouldn't I want to hook up with any of those guys, I knew some of the happy couples were having troubles I wouldn't want to deal with. So instead of being focused on what other people have, I decided to focus on what I want and I'm willing to look for the right guy for me, not just settle for someone just to not be alone.",1569777713,f1vyfmn,t1_f1v51fx,t5_su6ij
7715,ponchoacademy,"Lucky (?!) for me, I don't equate sex with love and feelings. Between an abusive childhood and incredibly low self-esteem, when I was younger, I assumed if a guy wanted to sleep with me, it was just too satisfy a need and I figured I wouldn't see him again. Once we had sex I'd be like, well that sucks...I really liked him too. Then shut down and move on. Definitely threw some guys for a loop who didn't understand that instead of bringing us closer, sex made me disconnect from him.

On the other hand, when it's with someone Im in love with, then the sex is incredibly intimate and means more than just physically gratification. My feelings develop through getting to know someone, it's on a purely cerebral level, without that, the physical aspect means nothing on an emotional level.

The only reason I don't sleep with more than one guy at a time is for health reasons... Doesn't phase me at all if I'm casually dating a guy that's sleeping with others. I just keep on guard how serious he is about always using protection.

Yeah, I think calling it DTR might've been a bit misleading. I def prefer it if a guy is the one to move things to that level. I would never ask a guy, what are we and where is this relationship going. Mostly what I was trying to do was express where I'm at as far as developing feelings for him.

I think that helped, because there wasn't pressure to act on what I was feeling...I was just putting it out there and he responded with what he's feeling at the moment too. We kind of tapped the table, so to speak lol just to check in and see what's in each other's head as far as what we want and why/how we'll continue seeing each other and decide if we're comfortable with that.

7736,ponchoacademy,"I still dont see how all those variables would mean massive amounts of responsibility because hes home.  But like I said, it could just be the personality of the dogs Ive had that they didnt need that.  Ive never known anyone who was unable to go to work because they had to stay home to give their dog their full attention, but it sounds like its out there and a real concern people have about his ability to get any work done if a dog is in the house.

What does require a lot of attention though are kids...if he cant have a dog in the house for that reason, then that sort of rules out any possibility of starting a family so I really hope thats not something he said he liked the idea of too.",1571717581,f4p6jfe,t1_f4p46fe,t5_2xhvq

But my other cat was a sweetie...all the same, cats do have a need to sharpen their claws and tend to be a bit (a lot) more on the temperamental side than dogs are.

One of my dogs was a chewer and we had to be on top of it buying massive amounts of chewers to keep him occupied otherwise hed move on to the furniture..but the other two? Chill af.

&gt;I asked what changed his mind, he says that he now doesn‚Äôt want the added expense and responsibility. He wants to focus on his goals and himself

From the context, these reasons he gave are not specifically about during the time hes  actively working.

And to be clear, I do agree it being fair if he doesnt want a dog for those reasons, and he feels that he just wants to focus on himself.  Thats fine of him to feel that way and express it..but if she has a different view of their life together and still wants the one they spoke of having together, then that is fair too. Even if it means it wont be with him afterall.",1571716689,f4p5jyh,t1_f4p28k8,t5_2xhvq
7739,ponchoacademy,"Im not bitter at all....not remotely.  I honestly cant even think of what I would be bitter about, looking back on raising my daughter on my own is a lot different and not at all stressful compared to how it was looking forward and being unsure and scared about what lays ahead.

To clarify, when I said its been 6 years to a friend, at that point, it had been 6 years since my breakup with a guy I nearly married and about 10 years since my divorce. In those 6 years, I was focusing only on myself and my daughter.  That may not seem like a long time to you, but it was to me.  And now that Im going on 20 years since my divorce...by my standards, thats a pretty long time. And to be totally frank, it was not difficult at all to find guys who were willing to jump into a relationship with me, I ran into many guys who viewed us as an insta family wanted that and assumed Id want that too...but I was very careful to slow things down and decide whether or not he was someone I wanted in my and my daughters life.

If you think that going 20 years without getting married is a sign of desperation and willingness to jump into a relationship, you have a much different view of me than well...anyone Ive ever come across in my life.  Youre right, by my own admission I was not finding the right guys, which is why I talked about it with a friend and expressed my fears, my concerns, my worry that I would not find that someone and she was an incredible source of strength and support when I needed it.  Not sure how having a friend to talk to about those things fights against the point I was trying to make to OP to be a friend who will listen and help instead of pass judgement.

To circle back around to my first statement, while I was sad and scared at the prospect of not providing my daughter with what I thought of back then as the perfect family unit, I can honestly sit here now that shes an adult and say we've had a wonderful life together. And while if I did meet a great guy that would have added to our lives, not meeting someone in no way takes away from it.  The fears I had 20 years ago turned out to be unfounded, but that does not negate what were valid feelings and fears I had back then, and I can totally understand being having been in that position what its like to feel that way.",1571716143,f4p4x5i,t1_f4p1qw5,t5_2xhvq

If I met an otherwise perfect mate but they wanted to be the provider and I would have to give up my job and be a stay at home mom to be with them..they are not for me.

Notice the trend? If you have to give up on something because you dont share the same lifestyle in order to be with someone, then that is not the right person for you.

The thing is, the whole purpose of dating is to get to know someone, share who you are, learn about who they are, and decide if you share the same views on what you want out of life, and decide if the things you dont agree on are things you can live with.  In this situation...he knew she had a life long dream, does not want to live that way, led her to believe he did, then waited until the relationship progressed and they bought a house and planning to marry to tell her that her life long dream isnt important to him and will not be a part of their lives together.

Its not only that he does not deal with problems until they are on top of him, which I totally agree it seems he has an issue with that...but that she made it clear this was a lifelong dream and he agreed on it as something that would be a shared part of their life.   Its not just about him not being a dog lover, its that he waited until they were in a committed relationship and bought a house together to tell her he doesnt actually share nor wants a part of her lifelong dream.  

I would definitely consider breaking off engagement with someone who led me to believe we shared the same ideals in how we would live our lives together then decided its not what he wants after all....whatever that life together entailed.",1571714306,f4p2nk8,t1_f4oe2l1,t5_2xhvq

Maybe I just somehow always ended up with the laziest dogs ever, because the favorite pasttime is sleeping... my dog now...he goes between sleeping, looking out the window, takes great delight in barking at the mailman, plays with his toys, eating and twice a day walks, though if Im home I'll let him out to run around the yard.

He would be pretty estatic if I spent the entire day focusing only on him and didnt do anything else.  It seems people think thats what owning a dog is like, but that certainly hasnt been my experience. Half the time Im wondering where he is (usually asleep somewhere)",1571713690,f4p1uds,t1_f4or6k1,t5_2xhvq

One dog of mine was a chewer, but all different breeds (but big dogs, my current is a lab) and all chill af.  They just slept all day. How I leave things is exactly how things would be when I get home. 

Besides that, none of that even actually matters. Suggesting to replace the life long dream of owning a dog with a cat as if its pretty much the same thing....is kind of like replacing the life long dream of owning a house with an RV.  Yeah, RV's are cool and technically they are a home but...not remotely the same thing.",1571713320,f4p1cem,t1_f4oah7a,t5_2xhvq

There's an adjustment period of getting comfortable with new surroundings and people, and then theyre gone before they actually relax into feeling like they are home.

There really is not way to compromise and get a dog but not really.  And though its not a kid, it really is a pretty big decision to talk about and agree on..which they did. And now he's changed his mind.  There are divorces where things are hung up on who gets custody of the dog...they really do become part of the family, and if he doesnt want that, shes left with giving up on what he full well knew was a dream and incredibly important to her, or moving on from the relationship.",1571711818,f4oz8an,t1_f4oq9rm,t5_2xhvq

If in conversation with her you are just being judgmental over her life, choices, how she dates and not trying to understand why shes so focused on not being alone yet will say you are sure you know what she needs, then I can see why she would get defensive.

Im telling you, when kids are involved, the dynamics really do shift in the brain..its not a minor thing to be scared and worried about the idea of being a single mother or of never finding someone who will be in your life.  Depending on how recent her divorce was..she may either be in a stage of I need to find someone or if some time has gone by, feeling like she will never find someone.  It genuinely is a crappy position to be in when its not just you, but your responsible for children and you want to provide a stable family for them.

Its really unfortunate that she has trusted guys who turned out to not be good for her, but if like you say theres a patter of abuse, then take time for yourself still isnt good advice.  Its not actionable and doesnt mean anything.  When I was going through a particularly rough time, a friend of mine (who is not a mother, so dont think Im coming down on you for that...just that I do notice you havnt mentioned or acknowledge any of the stress involved with understanding the anxiety with being a single mom)  instead of just passing along generic advice, she actually talked with me about what I was experiencing. We talked about the guys Id been dating and she pointed out that there was a pattern in the guys I was dating. Her advice wasnt to just stop dating, it was to be more aware of the type of guys I was trusting and to reflect on why they are the ones I give my heart to.  Instead of encouraging me to avoid the situation, she helped me think about it, she asked me what it is Im looking for, and really helped me understand how and why particular guys were not good for me. In the process, a ton of heavy stuff I hadnt thought about in forever came up.  The whole thing was very revealing and emotional.  And yeah there were times I didnt like what she had to say...I needed a second to think about it and for sure, if she decided to go talk to her bf, I would have shut down instead of keep talking to her about personal issues.

If she had come at me the way you describe how you think about your friends situation, I would have a very difficult time talking to someone who looks down on me like that.   Telling her to give up on looking isnt helping...helping her be more aware of the things shes doing, actually taking time to understand why shes making the choices she is (I really do believe its out of fear) would go a lot further. Its not about the time..its what you do with it.  Take time for yourself doesnt mean as much as talking things through and as a friend who is trying to understand where shes coming from, offering personalized advice that can actually help her.",1571710014,f4owi3a,t1_f4otdl6,t5_2xhvq

In any case, no matter where you work, you'll still be dealing with people. And people can be annoying to work with for so many reasons, regardless of the company.

While kiddo was growing up, when I went out I didnt have more than two...tops 3 drinks.  I just had this huge fear and worry that if anything at all happened to her, I would not be in a state of mind to be there for her.  I have been in situations where I was feeling a little tipsy, but got a call from home and its amazing how the adrenaline rush can sober you up in an instant.  Thats not possible with drug use, and I avoided even smoking pot for that reason.

Even when I traveled from work and was on the other side of the country, I never wanted to be in a situation where if she needed me, I did not have enough wits about me to get on a flight and be there and be of use to be there for her a few hours later. It wasnt until she was a teenager that I relaxed a bit, but not much. Now that shes an adult, I feel a lot more freedom in being able to just let loose without worry, but my tolerance is pretty much nothing after so many years of barely drinking (on the bright side...drinks are cheap when it doesnt take much to hit me! lol)

So yeah...I can see where hes coming from...just that disbelief that if you are needed, you would not be capable of being there for your child. Distance isnt much of anything, but your clairity to be able to make the best decisions so that you can be there asap and be in shape to function and be there for your child that would be concerning. On the other hand, I get it the desire to just get loose and have fun and not worry.  I can see how that would feel good...it was just my personal decision not to do that because my responsibility for kiddo was always at the top of my mind.

So, okay after all that kinda feeling like its a NAH. I totally feel where your ex is coming from. I would be very disappointed and upset too to know that if anything happened, theres a possibility Id be on my own to handle it and not be able to depend on you because of something you chose to do that prevents you from being there for our kid. Thats a pretty crappy position to be in.  I get that you want to get away and have that kind of fun, and dont think you are TA for wanting that.

Courting doesnt end until theres a proposal...up til that point, both people in the relationship are still trying to decide whether or not this is someone they want in their lives and long term.  That certainly isnt figured out and overwith by date 4.

If hes saying in a post, and to her, that hes old fashioned...then of course shes going to assume that means he is going to take on the provider role, and its ridiculous hes questioning why hes not paying for him. Thats like claiming to be chivalrous, then complaining she never opens the door for him or offers him her coat when hes cold.  Her being independent and progressive should not be what he uses to change his behavior to be a different kind of man than what he says he is.

I ended up never remarrying and raising kiddo alone, and all the advice to just stop looking, work on myself and let love find me totally helped.

Even friends who know me well, have given me that advice and I did angrily shoot back to them, Ive been single 6 years, been to therapy, picked up several new hobbies, changed careers, living my best life truly...what more do I need to work on exactly and how is continuing not to look going to help.  Its a platitude.  Now that I am actually looking (literally anywhere I can) I have met a pretty awesome random guy online. Its too late for the whole family vibe, providing my kid with a father figure thing since shes grown now, but I dont want to keep not looking and working on myself alone for the next 20 years either.

Given that your friend is going through some valid frustration with her current situation (and dare I say it fear...pretty sure shes scared to end up like me and knows its entirely possible she will) and having an emotional talk with you about it, getting on the phone with your bf did send a clear message to her what you thought of that.  Would have been understandable if you let her know, hey..lemme take this and let him know Im in the middle of something here, or just let it go and explain to him later.  But yeah..YTA not only for how you treated her in that moment, but that you go on to minimize what shes going through, judgmental over how shes dating and wants to remarry, does say a lot about how you are not listening to her to at least try and see where shes coming from and why she said you would never understand.

At the end of the day, you probably arent the best person for someone in her position to go to advice for.

Without a healthy role-model teaching me certain behaviors were not okay, I grew up feeling like Im bringing it on myself and whenever something happened to me, it became a part of what in my world was normal, even though I hated it, it made me feel awful, and I wished it wasnt that way.

When I got older, I did come to realize...it was not me and just the way things are...there are just some really nasty predatory guys out there, and I was low hanging fruit. No doubt my own self image made me an easy target for guys like that.  I still  have married / gross guys trying to hit on me, but now I recognize that them for what they are, and I recognize I dont have to put up with it and shut them down immediately.  

This increased sense of self worth also is why I now meet guys who are decent..not the gross ones, not the white knights who are looking for someone weak to save, but a guy who values himself and wants a woman who values herself too.",1571697801,f4o8ceu,t3_dl6fy9,t5_xaiot

Besides that, instead of doing everything you can to keep things going, do everything you can to decide whether or not this guy is even what you want in your life.  Its not about playing it cool and being what you think he wants you to be, its about finding the right guy for you.

Theres also a huge difference between living a full life and making time for him in it, and trying to play it cool and not act too interested.  Theres nothing wrong with being interested, just dont rearrange your life and make yourself available...its up to him to recognize your time is precious and see you when theres a chance to. Hes not going to do that though if a) he thinks youre not really interested b) he knows youre pretending not to be interested but really into him even though you barely know him.

I can totally see my teammates feeling the way you are... I dont share my personal life at work at all, I try to keep my head in the game as much as possible and dont mix the two.  But Im dealing with serious medical issues with my daughter that has me completely gutted inside...she nearly died when she was a baby, and with what she has it wont necessarily be a long process of coming to terms with it, she can quite literally just be gone in a moment.  I needed time off both for her appointments, and also for days where I just could not function...not sleeping, days spent in tears.  Its just me and her... Ive told my manager, but no one else. He moved some of my tasks to other teammates and took things off my plate, and maybe its just me, but I feel like ever since then, the team has gotten more cold towards me...cause they are having to pick up the slack.

On the work front, Im also struggling, have tried reaching out for help, have done as much as I can on my own but appreciate more than they can know when a teammate takes a second out just to talk to me. But as time goes on, Im sure that because all they have to go on is what they see, they have the vibe Im not worth the time and dont want to help me in any way.  Which in turn has made work beyond depressing, on top of what Im dealing with at home.

The work environment feels horrible for me, home is horrible, Im going through a rough af time here and consider it a win when I can go in and not WFH. 

So yeah, the only thing you know for sure is that you dont know what is going on with that person or what they and the manager or whoever else is clued in on.

ESH... She cant agree to try and work on the marriage, instead to harbor resentment and make a public display of issues you had between each other several years later.  In the moment, I can understand getting defensive, but that is what it was...getting defensive over your actions. You made a bad decision and you know it.

At this point, you both need to actually make an effort to resolve this issue and actually move forward from it.  She needs to stop pretending shes working on the marriage if shes not willing to forgive you or let it go. And you need to truly own up to what you did.",1571692236,f4nqws5,t3_dl2a26,t5_2xhvq

Long after you have resolved the issue and moved on, that person hasnt gone through the healing process between the couple, and will forever look at them in the worst possible light.

After reading all the comments, I gathered that things are resolved and going well with your wife, you have tried including your family in the wedding, to spend time with them and put in the effort to spend time with them, yet they still give your wife the snub.  I dont see not attending the wedding as spite, but to avoid a hurtful situation as well as saving yourself and your wife the humiliation of being around people who cannot move on from the past and accept her into the family.

Considering that both of you would say such cruel and heartless things to each other, I dont feel like Im going out on a limb to say its possible she doesnt share all of her most private thoughts and experiences with you.

She may be coming from a place of pain, may have had a miscarriage or had to get an abortion or found out she cannot have kids or maybe just flat out doesnt want to have children..who knows.  Given a constant talking to trying to convince her how amazing babies are and making her feel like less than a woman because shes not interested in being a mother definitely would be enough to make anyone be angry and makes the reaction a lot less odd.

For whatever reason, she snapped...not the right thing to do, but definitely also not right or fair to keep pushing her buttons, then go as far as to personally attack her by saying no one will want to touch her and make her a mother.  Side note: that comment right there definitely does reduce her to nothing more than her ability to breed, so her reaction to that is pretty understandable.

You're living a happy life, with your family and baby...don't make it such a huge deal for you to try and convince your sister she should be living your life. And dont let her negativity about that life take away from it that its what you want and have.

So the idea of someone completely and totally unrelated to me trying to form a relationship as a sister would be a complete no go.

However, you have no idea what Kate has actually been through, it really seems that she has some sort of issue that its so important to her to try and reach out and connect with you.

I once dated a guy who was in his 50's, never married or had kids, had been in one serious relationship.  At first, it was refreshing and nice to spend time with someone who had no issues whatsoever, but as time went on, I realized we did not relate to each other at all.  His life was easy and carefree because he never took any risks whatsoever, he completely avoided any situations that might end badly or required any level of responsibility, and he had no coping skills for what I felt were basic adult tasks.

Right now Im seeing a guy who just went through a divorce, and will admit, I kept it very casual and was prepared to run (and did at one point) because I wanted to avoid any divorce drama. But we've gotten to know each other, and can relate and are sensitive to each others needs as far as fears after a bad relationship, the vulnerability, etc.  When I say Im not comfortable with something, he fully understands how it feels to be in that situation and comes not just from a place of, I respect your boundaries, hes acutely aware of not wanting to be the person to make me feel the way he has be treated and felt in the past.

So...I think its not so much finding someone who has no baggage, but finding someone who has relateable baggage, who has experienced life in a way that you can understand each other.

I would much prefer that to someone continuing the relationship, developing a relationship with the kids, in an experiment to see if more time together would change your mind at the expense of my feelings and the childs feelings.

This is what dating is about..and as a single parent, theres always that risk, one that someone wont be interested because you have kids, two that once they meet the kids they will back out, three that after being in a relationship and the kids have formed a bond that the relationship will end.  The only difference between dating one person and dating a package deal, is that there are more people who can possibly be hurt in the end.

Its no different from if you meet someone online, you like their pics, the conversation is amazing, but when you meet in person you are left with the feeling you really dont want to see them again. Do you just keep seeing them anyway because in conversation you said you are excited to meet and be with them? No...dragging someone along is cruel, its better to be honest with yourself and them how you feel so that you can both move on to hopefully find someone who is a right fit.

Same thing here...in theory you were fine with the kids, but once you met them you were not.

I was scared she would be mad at me for not saying anything all those years letting her believe a lie (and believe me, with each passing year I felt worse) and I also worried how devastated she would be to not only learn the man she thought was her father, wasnt...that not only did he not want to stay in her life, but her own father didnt want to be in her life either.

I felt like I completely and totally failed my daughter by not being able to provide her with the one thing I wanted so badly growing up...But when she was 16, she told me she doesnt have any feelings whatsoever about not having a dad, that shes happy and loves our 2-person family. She flat out said, how can I miss something Ive never had? And said she wouldnt want her life to be any different because she likes our family the way it is.

Though we both grew up without a father, our environment was totally different.  I grew up feeling like if my dad was around, then maybe I would feel loved and wanted.  My daughter growing up had no doubts how much I loved her and how proud I am of her.  She didnt have the hole to fill that I did.

You're not in a relationship with either of these women, and they aren't committed to you either. You don't know who to choose because you don't actually know them yet. You don't have enough information to choose.

This letter is a huge turnoff though. I would've stopped reading at, I chose the other woman over you cause I met her first. I wouldn't have been any more enchanted if you chose me because you met me first. The message that sends us you'll choose any warm body if it's the first one you met instead of based on a woman's qualities and what she brings into your life.  

I wouldn't want to hear from you again cause I'd assume you just decided to go with me because things didn't work out with her and you don't want to be alone for the weekend, not cause you actually had any interest in me.

If you don't want to get to know women before you commit to one, that's fine... But no need to burden someone with all this inner dialogue that definitely comes off as insulting, not just to get but your reasons for dating.

We didn't even have a kitchen for me to clean or cook in for two years, it wasn't a priority over the rest of the changes we wanted to make since we dined out every night, didn't need to clean or do laundry either since we had a maid 2x a week, plus the pool guy and the landscaper to redesign and decorate the lawn and garden. He took us to Europe a couple times a year, paid for my kid to go to private school, if I wanted something over an agreed amount, he paid for it since he wanted me to put my own money into savings...

...and I used that money to get my own place after he started feeling like we weren't equal partners because he was able to provide a lifestyle I can't afford on my own, and that I would stay with him no matter what to not give up that lifestyle. Being with a man who treats you well does not negate being with a man who knows you can hold your own and respects that you have enough pride in yourself to not live life accepting a handout.

It's one thing for a guy to provide because he wants to take care of me and I expect that, but I'll never again put myself in a situation where he knows I'm dependent on him for our entire lifestyle. If I had contributed anything at all, even if not as much as he could, it would've been our house and our lifestyle we shared together because I put something in.

I'm saying he should think abd evaluate before he reacts.

Not to mention, his phrasing is incredibly condescending and chastising. You are totally right that even if he thought there was a problem, he could have said it much better. 

No parent on Earth appreciates having their kid scolded by a stranger, especially when theyve done nothing wrong. To add to it, he touched the girl. I can tell you... If a man walked up to my teenage daughter, touched her shoulder and said young lady what do you think you're doing, I'd freak out hardcore.

It takes a huge level of trust to bow in front of family and friends (and god if one is of faith) to devote your life to that person. To be legally bound, to trust sharing your home and finances, to know they will be the one in charge if faced with the decision to pull the plug, to be the one possibly planning your funeral when you die.

A spouse has more rights than your parents, kids, anyone. They are essentially you. Sure you can get a power of attorney, and file whatever paperwork to give them the power to make certain decisions, but ""I'm his wife"" carries a lot more weight than ""I'm the woman he's been living with and I have a power of attorney"" His kids or parents can fight you and win. And it so goes both ways. A guy will have to be insanely amazing for me to trust him more than my own daughter to trust him enough to marry him. But if I don't trust him, with all that, then of course I won't marry him.

So yeah... If a guy is all about playing house but isn't sure he trusts me with the responsibility of being his wife, then I don't see the point in staying around.",1572164050,f5e38p1,t3_dnlvgz,t5_xaiot

A month into a relationship a guy told me he loved me. I thanked him for letting me know and said I wasn't sure how I felt yet. It didn't crush his soul and damage his ego by being honest with him, he accepted that and respected I wasn't there yet. It took another 3 months before I was ready to tell him I loved him too. We were together several years and nearly got married. 

He really appreciated that I took my time and was sure of my feelings, he also liked that I don't fall in love with every guy I date... My love is genuine..once I feel it, that's it. He's only one of three guys I've actually had strong feelings for. We broke up nearly 10 years ago and though not in love, we still have love for each other.

He lost it, told me he wasn't in it to date, he just wanted to fuck me and felt I had some nerve taking an Uber instead of going home with him. I broke the third date rule apparently.

I ignored him, and about a week later he texted to see if I wanted to go out. When I didn't reply, a few hours later he sent another text compromising we don't have to go out since all he wants anyway is to fuck. No reply from me.

A month later, he texts again saying he doesn't want to fuck me anymore, but I have 48 hours to respond if I have any hope of salvaging the friendship. No reply and he hasn't contacted me since.

This is why I don't block guys though, the whole thing was pure...not gold, aluminum maybe.

Whether a woman wants to be a stay at home mom, or get her PhD and practice medicine, that's fine. Whether she likes it when a man opens the car door or prefers to do it herself that's fine. Whether a woman feels safer when her man is home or is a black belt with gun permit and fears no one, that's fine.

Shaming women because they do what they want to do instead of what they're expected to do is the entire reason feminism was needed to begin with.

When Im on a date with a guy who proclaims he's a feminist, I know that's it. Cause most of the time it means hes going to use it as an excuse to never have to do anything and be lower than low effort. That's the guy who will walk through a door before you and darn near let it slam your face cause you can hold your own door.  They won't even treat you with basic courtesy, citing feminism. 

Now, there are guys who actually believe women aren't helpless and are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves, but also still enjoys doing things for a woman because he wants to.

I'm insanely tall and the dresses she chose looked rediculous on me, another friend was overweight and felt incredibly uncomfortable in them. We went around in circles for awhile with different dresses before she gave up on the idea of going with one style for all of us.

So what she ended up doing is she selected a specific color, but we were free to choose any dress we liked in that swatch. That way even though the dresses were different, they were still uniformly the exact same color. And the bonus was we all would have dresses we genuinely like and would wear again.

Personally, I don't think that makes him a jerk or selfish, you both decided to start seeing each other knowing he was going through some stuff that affected your ability to date.

You already know what you did wrong, you're totally aware that you did something you'd never suggest someone else do. It's one of those, it's easier to give advice than to take your own advice things. Your interest in him and what you were feeling clouded your judgement.

And then even after he told you he wasn't ready to talk, you'd show up at his house to force him into discussing his feelings, yeah... That would make anyone feel even more uncomfortable.

7843,ponchoacademy,"The thing is, even with casual sex I have requirements. I was fwb with a guy for a couple years and I let him know from the get go, I still expect to be treated like a human being. I'm not going to enjoy sex with someone I don't like.. And he agreed with that.

We went out for dinner and drinks, we considered each other friends who we could talk to and do things with. The only thing was we weren't and had no plan to be in a relationship. Our friends just assumed we were dating, and we never really corrected anyone since it wasn't anyone's business to know we were just fwb.

I've been in that situation with other guys and same thing.. I'm upfront that I'm not booty call material. If sex is all a guy has to offer, then I'm not interested.

Now, as far as casually having sex with several different guys, I wouldn't be comfortable with that and just haven't done it. I don't see anything liberating about exposing myself to a bigger STD risk. I don't even see the point or why having sex with a lot of different guys all the time is supposed to be fun.

I dated a guy who wasn't American, and we got into some interesting fights where I something and he thought I meant something wildly different and offensive, and vice versa. Between local customs, common sayings and slang in our own country the intent came off very different to someone not familiar with it.

Now... What makes you TA is the way you passive aggressively and snidely replied to her while also making a digging comment about her culture in comparison to yours.

She let you know she wasn't comfortable and you basically berated her for it instead of trying to understand and work with the fact that there are differences in culture. While it's great you take pride in your cultures way of opening up your home to others, learn to have respect for people of other cultures who don't do things the way you do.

It just never occurred to you the dress was available and you weren't in it to get something out of it. Had you known it was a possibility, naturally you'd want a dress that was literally made for you.

He's not TA because he probably didn't put much thought into what would happen to the dress. Someone asked so he said yes. When the issue came up he realized that given the circumstances, it probably is more appropriate and a nice way to say thank you for helping him and decided you should have the dress afterall.

She's not TA, she did think of what would happen to the dress, asked him about it and asked if she could have it. She didn't take it well to be promised something then find out she can't have it afterall.

It's just a sucky situation all around.

Personally, I did once do this for a guy where he was trying to put together a portfolio because he wanted to get into clothing design and he paid me, not much but honestly it was a fun experience even though the measuring and fitting process is pretty involved. 

Only after the clothes were done and after all the photoshoots, did he think about it and ask if there were any pieces I'd like to have. Out of about 20 outfits, there were two that I really loved so he let me have those, then held a garage sale to sell the rest along with other items cause he needed the money. But still... It wasn't anything either of us thought about till after everything was all done. I can imagine if someone else knew about it and asked, he wouldn't have thought twice to say yes to them.

""But he's tall like you! Why are you being so picky!!""

Even without the idea of sex, putting yourself in a situation where you're completely alone with a guy you barely know in his territory, and with no way to get your own self home, is not the best strategy. 

I've been in that situation, and can tell you..when plans change and all of a sudden the new plan is to be alone in his house, that was the plan all along. No decent guy will think that's reasonable, would want you to feel comfortable and take you out somewhere public. He was a jerk the second he suggested pregaming it at his house. As if a bar needs pregaming. I would've given him a look that would have him regretting such a stupid thing.

Anyway, definitely be more on the alert for stuff like this for self preservation. And make sure you always always have a way to get yourself home. Whether it's the first date or you've been together for years. Was once with a guy for several years, he started screaming at me at a restaurant and threatened to leave me there knowing I had no way to get home.

Anyway, I can't see making that much of a big deal out of it, I could see maybe just looking at them like wtf, putting the clothes back in the bag and moving on. Maybe later saying yeah I didn't find that funny, I'd appreciate it if you don't do anything like that again.

Like does she need a detailed transcript of what everyone said and did about everything that happened when you were a kid? That's pretty silly and unreasonable. I can barely remember every minor detail of every single convo and thing I did last week.

I do think there's something to be said for being transparent with her about what happened when you got drunk. You didn't lie, you told her even though there's no way she would've find out otherwise. Lying is not the issue here. However, you did betray her trust and can understand her being upset about that.

Considering you want a future with her, I would suggest couples therapy, to find out and resolve why she feels you lied about things you certainly didn't lie about, and also to make sure you can both resolve the feelings around you kissing someone else while drunk, otherwise, she's going to be resentful and hold this over your head the rest of your lives.

So basically.. The only baby I've held on purpose is my daughter. I mean, I think there great and all... I just don't want to hold them.

Pretty sure that goes for divorced women too. I'll admit, that really put some perspective on things.

I divorced when I was really young, and once I was ready to date again I still had my whole life ahead of me. I'm sure it would be and feel a lot different if I'd divorced in my 30s or 40s instead.

With you on cheaters..I definitely can't be with one and if I were with a guy who said he cheated it would make me reconsider being with him.

He thought that was totally fair and we saw each other casually while I continued to date. It's been six months now, his divorce finalized last month, and so far things are going really well to the point we're considering not seeing other people. 

Just because I think there's more risk involved dating a guy who is separated than a guy who is single, or more risk dating a guy who got divorced 1 month ago than a guy who got divorced 10yrs ago, doesn't mean I'm just going to refuse to give things a chance.  Everyone comes with risks, the only way to avoid them all would be to not date anyone. it's a matter of how much risk is involved, being aware of it, and deciding whether or not the it's a risk worth taking.",1571951004,f52kf3o,t1_f527hhz,t5_su6ij

Now, he did have a way about him regardless that made him difficult, but long after we broke up, and its been almost 15yrs now, Ive seen through the years how it keeps escalating. I dont know what it is, but something is going on in his brain and its getting worse.

I take integrity very seriously though. I joke around a whole lot and when Im kidding about something, its so obvious Im not trying to actually get away with it.  But, to seriously think Im being deceitful, not a chance.  It hasnt gotten as serious as flat out calling me a liar, but I have dated guys who have said they dont quite believe me or just give me that look like...you cant be for real.  

That gets under my skin and I have said, without trust there is nothing...if you have your doubts about me then we shouldnt be together. I wont be with a liar and I wont be with someone who thinks I am one. That usually makes them realize, oh crap shes serious.  

Im also super clear about it that I dont do warnings and dangle the idea of a breakup over their head...when I say its over, its over immediately and I dont go back.  So yeah, having very clear boundaries of what I expect, and making it clear a breakup would be quick and permanent does tend to make a guy second guess if he really wants to take his chances.  You guys have been together 4 years now, he should know by now if you are trustworthy or not.

I agree with those who said dont just jump to breaking up, see if hes willing to go to counseling to figure out why all of a sudden he doesnt trust you.

No worries if the shoes are off feet, it's only on people...anyone at all.  Im not exactly sure when it started, but I know that its freaked me out ever since I was a little kid.  I even made up a rational-ish explanation that one could trip, fall, hit their head and die from the injuries.  But..to be totally honest, I actually have no idea. I cant remember a time myself or anyone else actually tripped on laces. But when I see it, my heart starts to race and I have walked up to strangers to let them know their laces are untied.  Then I anxiously keep an eye on them hoping they tie them right away. If I cant let someone know or they just say thanks and keep walking, my mind will race for hours thinking about it.

Personally...I lace my sneakers so that the end are permanently tucked inside, that way they can never be untied. When my kid was small, none of her shoes had laces. Velcro for the win!! And I taught her how to lace her shoes like I do. Now she laces then normally, but permanently knots them so that she doesnt drive her mother crazy lol",1571945203,f51wrm3,t1_f51txad,t5_2xhvq
7873,ponchoacademy,"Well.. When someone is separated there's the risk they'll decide to try and work it out afterall. Getting a divorce is emotionally and financially expensive, so there is a bigger chance they'll go back, even if they don't even still love the other person. A guy I was seeing went back to her because he couldn't handle not living with his children. 

If he's newly divorced, there's the risk he's still emotionally wrapped up in mourning the loss of his marriage. Dated a guy who things were going pretty alright till the first anniversary they weren't together came along. He completely broke down and realized he still has healing to do. 

Theres a pretty rough adjustment period getting used to a completely different way of life esp if kids are involved that is not literally the same as a guy who just broke up with a girl he dated. They may be just a guy, but what someone is dealing with can have an impact on getting into a new relationship.

All that being said, just because I can acknowledge there are risks doesn't mean I'm going to completely blow off a guy I'm interested in just because hes recently divorced. After what I've experienced, I go in knowing if he hasn't had time to deal with the divorce and all the changes in his life from it, that can affect the odds of anything developing between us.",1571944167,f51tj99,t1_f51a5yh,t5_su6ij

Whether a woman does it or a man does it.

There's usually something pretty dark under the surface that they're hoping you won't notice or will let slide. Every time I ended up with a guy like this, it ended with his true colors shining. Like, youre going to ruin this relationship just cause I slept with someone else? After everything I do for you?!

7875,ponchoacademy,"They said it in a harsh way, but this is codependent behavior. You drive him, help his business, buy him a phone, pay his way for everything, probably a lot more things you did for him... What did he do for you?

Now, I'm not saying to keep score,  it's not about that, but while you're putting in all this effort what was he bringing to the table as an equal partner? If he wasn't doing anything, then why were you doing so much? 

Even if someone is a great person, it's really uncomfortable to have someone you just met put you on such a high pedestal. I once met a guy who on our first date I mentioned I need a new battery for my car. For our second date he wanted to buy me the car battery and then take me shopping for Christmas gifts for me daughter. It was incredibly overwhelming. On our third date he gave me a necklace and was asking me if Id consider moving to his neighborhood and how his house is big enough for all three of us. I was a freelancer at the time and he had thought up a plan how we can go into business together.

It was beyond too much too soon and the moving in thing was the final straw. We'd known each other 3 weeks...I barely knew the guy and I hadn't done anything for him to be so invested so quickly to the point of planning our life together. After we broke up, he called, texted and emailed me for almost 3 years. First he was mad, but in the end he was sending me YouTube videos of love songs saying it made him think of me.

I mean, there are people who can control how they display emotions, it's called being a psychopath.

I've laughed about something in situations that were totally inappropriate, felt awful, embarrassed and apologized if possible.

The laughing in and of itself doesn't make you an asshole. What matters is how you handled things once it happened, which you left out.

Theres a show I liked, can't remember the name but pretty sure it was an English show, where after each challenge round a member of the group would have to leave. Depending on how fast they got through the challenge is how much of a head start they had to run and climb over a wall before several huge dogs were released to go after them.

The contestants were always so scared, crying, afraid they won't make it. You'd see them just barely making it over the wall with the dogs pulling at their pants. Then there was one where someone tripped and fell, and the dogs caught up to them and... Their tails we're wagging so hard... The camera quickly pulled away just as the dogs surrounded them on the ground to make it seem like a threatening situation, but yeah... Those people were never in any danger.

If she gives a one word reply or says nothing, just does a polite half smile and looks around like she's trying to plan her exit, bad sign. If she said something to you first, really good sign.

7893,ponchoacademy,"See, that's exactly what I'm talking about, people who jump to the most insane conclusion without even taking a moment to ask what it means.

Friends said I should tell guys right away because it's a huge potential deal breaker. At first I did and every time guys just assumed the worst and made a quick exit. I decided that instead, I would take the time to get to know a guy first to decide if I think I can trust him, so he can get to know me, but definitely before there's a commitment.

That works a lot better... They know me at least enough to genuinely care to understand. For the most part. There is one guy who after nearly 6mths together, when I told him he said he no longer felt safe with me... What if I try to stab him in his sleep. A huge what the actual F moment. We'd been seeing each other 2-3 days a week for months, we'd been in arguments, he knew I could not stand yelling, was hyper aware and that when I'm upset and anxious I shut down and go numb. He'd already witnessed how I get affected, and I was telling him with the expectation I could explain those behaviors were due to my PTSD. But I didn't get the chance to. I remember asking him, after knowing me all this time what about me makes him think I'm violent. He admitted he can't see me being that way, but he doesn't want to take the chance. We were over, butI emailed him resources that explained what it actually is. He must've thought about it and realized he overreacted in a big way, but the irony is I no longer felt safe around him. Just thinking about it now is making my stomach knot up. 

Anyway, even with knowing and trying to understand guys decide they just don't want it in their life. Which is fine... At least they listened. But anyone who jumps to thinking it means they are in danger has issues of their own that you don't need in your life.

When my daughter was that age, before introducing them, I mentioned him to her, just said that when I go out for for dinner, its with this really nice guy xyz and asked her if shed like to meet him sometime.  She was down for it and so I told her he was super excited to meet her too.

the first meeting was at a playground. I felt like that would give her the most control over how much she interacted with him.  So we would just chill and talk, and when she felt like it would run up to tell me something, then run off to play again.  He thought she was sweet, but worried she didnt to talk to him...just as he said that, she ran up and said she needs him to do something.  The playground had a little house thing, with wooden fruits and vegetables.  She wanted him to ""wash"" the vegetables in the sink and the whole time she was like oh! good job! you are good at this!  He was over the moon. Being in a situation where she could choose whether or not she wanted to be around him, and warm up to him in her own time really helped I think.

After the meeting I touched bases to see what she thinks of him and asked if shed want to see him again. We did a lot of meetings at playgrounds, the park, out for ice cream...pretty much keeping any meetings to no more than 2 hours and I always touched bases with her afterwards to see how she felt about it.  I did not bring him to spend time with us in our home until theyd seen each other about 4 or 5 times.  Just like how I needed some time to get to know him in neutral locations, I gave her time to get to know him before bringing him into our personal space.  I made dinner, and we watched one of her Disney movies.

One day she asked me if he was my bf, and when I said yes she just giggled like crazy and that was that...it was all good :)  

As for sleeping over..I am pretty strict on that...he never slept over at my place until we moved in together.  The only guys shes ever seen me come out of a bedroom with is him, the guy I was married to, an the guy I nearly married. I was very careful about making sure a guy was a serious part of our lives on that front.

Shes an adult now, but as shes gotten older, the pattern has pretty much remained the same...date for about 4-6 months to get to know him first, give her a heads up when Im thinking of introducing them, go to a place where she can control how much she is around him, (like now Im thinking of it being at a museum for a new exhibit we're all pretty interested in) keep lines of communication open to see what she thinks of him, etc.",1571870401,f4xykjl,t3_dm03pt,t5_2r6jl

But even then, I dont think how much someone contributes to the home make it more or less their home..it is shared equally regardless, which is why Im having a hard time wrapping my head around sharing a home together but if I buy food you cant have any of it.

I think the idea to add her food to the normal grocery bill is a really awesome idea actually...!!!  My nephew gives his parents whatever amount they agreed to for expenses, and there are certain things they buy that they know he wants.  No dietary restrictions...hes just a really picky eater.  If they end up eating something of his, they just replace it to make sure it there when he wants it.   Also, hes sometimes buys things and since he already paid his agreed on share, they make sure to pay him back for it.  Its not all on him to buy his own food or all on them to buy theirs, and that goes for just how they treat each other in general.

That avoids the whole banning people in their own home thing.  I think thats the part of it all that I have a really hard time with. Maybe they shouldnt have used the word banned...Im totally hooked up on that.",1571862906,f4x6luc,t1_f4wxyct,t5_2xhvq
7903,ponchoacademy,"Well..to be fair she said he was no longer allowed to eat any of their food...but the reason this whole thing started was because they noticed someone had eaten some of their food. If that wasnt a problem to them until after the dad blew up, they wouldn't have wanted to find out who ate it and why to begin with.

If they had been upfront that they dont want the parents to eat any of their food, they should have said so.  But okay, maybe they just assumed the dad would know not to eat the cheese or only in that moment realized they prefer not to share their food...  Once finding out it happened, they could have just asked him to buy more or asked him if he can not eat it because its a pain to get to the store to buy it.  Instead they said its not fair he eat anything she buys.

I woudlnt go as far as calling the dad lazy and passing on burdens though...the situation is annoying for all involved, but shes almost 30 and the parents are likely helping them out financially big time by letting them stay at home, her dad presumably worked to support his family and provide the home all these years and if he was so insufferable, she wouldnt still be at home with them.  Huge sweeping blanket thing to say about peek into someones life because they ate their kids cheese and got upset over her reaction to it.

btw, I love cheese as much as the next person, but they would not have starved from not eating it.  They wouldnt be contributing to the grocery bill if the parents werent buying food that they could eat, and there are plenty of options.  Just that there are certain things she likes to have as a substitute for the things they can not have.

7904,ponchoacademy,"Full disclosure, my daughter probably pays for closer to 80% of our grocery bill.  Meanwhile, I pay for the rent, light, utilities, phone internet and all the household supplies.

It would never occur to me to decide what who can use what based on the percentage one contributes. We share a home together and regardless of how much either of us pays, its equally our home.  

But, if kiddo pointed out she pays 80% of the grocery bill and its not fair I had some of something in the fridge, then yeah it would then be a case of...well, since you brought it up...yes lets talk about fairness and equal share.

It would be one thing if he ate all the cheese and left her none...that would have been inconsiderate and cruel considering her restrictions, but that its unfair of him to have had any at all because he didnt pay for it...",1571859907,f4wuxcl,t1_f4wmvbf,t5_2xhvq
7905,ponchoacademy,"Yeah, we definitely have different perspectives on this.  Its a married couple, not roommates who split up finances between them in an even percentage.  If they are in the realm of average, I doubt the parents are making their kid pay 1/3 of all the household expenses in some effort to keep things fair. That entire concept of making their kid live that way is probably not even on the parents radar because they want to help their kid out by letting them stay at home and just contribute financially in whatever way they can afford to. So I can see how being told he cant have any food he didnt pay for himself and he should go buy his own would throw him off guard.

I dont know..I guess Im just thinking of how it would make me feel, I would be pretty hurt by that and start to wonder if we've reached the point where she needs to be on her own. My kid is 22, but I can imagine that at 29, OP needs some independence, control over her space and things and should look into getting her own place. There is a comfort in knowing that how you leave something is exactly how it will be when you return to it when you have your own space.  

This would be an interesting thing to get an update on...now that her dad knows how they feel, but I kinda do hope that they get some idea of how it mustve made the dad feel to be told that.",1571859042,f4wr97q,t1_f4wgtj4,t5_2xhvq

I didnt see anything about the dad taking food without ever replacing it. He pays the majority of the grocery bill and shares the food he buys with her. Considering they were surprised the dad got upset when they let him know its not fair he eat any of of the food they buy, it sounds like this is the first time this is coming up and figuring out how to deal with it.

And yeah, I do think it sucks to tell the dad not to eat any food he didnt buy himself instead of just ask them to replace it, knowing they only pay 1/3 into the family grocery bill and he sharing the food he buys with them.",1571855394,f4wfifa,t1_f4wa93c,t5_2xhvq
7907,ponchoacademy,"Doesnt seem like its an accident though, he knew it was her cheese, he just didnt know she would not want to share it with him.  The ban was actually already in place in her head...he was only just now finding about it.

Excellent point that she pays 1/3 the bill and her parents pay the other 2/3.  Since they pay for the majority of the food, its fair to assume that they often pick up stuff from the store and put it in the fridge to share with her.  She picked up food, put it in the fridge and then tells him its not fair of him to eat anything she buys when he can go to the store and buy his own food.

Then is really surprised with how he reacted to that and then told him he cant eat any of her food unless hes willing to pay extra for it.  When hes already paying 2/3 of the grocery bill that he shares with her. Id be upset too if my daughter told me that..I wouldnt flip out and yell over it, but it definitely would be a punch in the gut.

Theres nothing wrong with asking him to make sure and replace food she needs for her diet if he has any of it.  But a one way ban on food sharing is pretty messed up.",1571854322,f4wcdjp,t1_f4w3oak,t5_2xhvq

When my daughter was very young she she had some stomach issues, drs kept saying it she either had a stomach flu or that was reacting to her formula.  She wasnt getting better and I was trying all sorts of things figuring Id find a formula that agrees with her.  We took her to urgent care one night and after examining her, he suggested making an appointment with a cardiologist, and she had her examination there.

He figured it might be a heart murmur thing, super common in babies and nothing to worry about...besides her having stomach issues, she was totally fine in every other way.  I did not feel good about it though, after having taken her to urgent care so many times because of her stomach, I really wanted him to come with me. He assured me I was just being a worried mom, its just an appt to talk to the dr about the results. So, I went with her to the appt and he went to work.

When the nurse said the dr was ready for me, she walked me not to an examination room, but to a huge conference room...there were about 15 doctors around the table with my my daughters EKGs, cat scans, all that projected on the wall.  I find out she was born with a rare heart defect and those other drs were interested in listening to her heart so that they could know what it sounds like.  I also find out her organs were in the process of shutting down (explained all her stomach problems) and she would require a procedure to be done immediately. And the dr he recommended to do the procedure was in a hospital that was in another state so we'd have to go there for it.

As soon as the appt was over, I went across the street to a payphone to try and call my husband but he was out in the field...I completely broke down crying and they ended up putting me on the phone with his LT, who was the one who ended up having to hear what I just went through.  By the time I got home my husband was already there..his LT had him pulled out of the field and told him... I dont care if your kid has a drs appointment, dentist appointment or shes getting her hair cut, from now on I expect you to be there and then told him to go home and be there for his wife and kid.

You just never know, but for sure...I still remember how absolutely terrified to be completely alone and without him when I got the news she could die.",1571851804,f4w4tzt,t3_dm0h7c,t5_2xhvq
7909,ponchoacademy,"WSHE..Sheeeeeee's only rock and roll!

I mostly listened to the radio and would make mix tapes of songs recorded off it.  Metallica comes to mind...its still the highlight of my teen years to tune in and by chance, they were doing an interview with my favorite band. I felt like I was right there at the station with them y'all!",1571850394,f4w0pb1,t3_dlusq0,t5_2qh1i
7910,ponchoacademy,"NTA and I dont agree with the comments from people saying you should at least be dishing the details of who you date either. Not only didnt I want people in and out of my daughters life, she didnt need to know the name or any detail about guys I dated.

Its only when I reached the point where I decided he was someone I wanted to include in my life and knew for sure that its time for them to meet that I would personalize him to her and say who he is, which would generally be around the 4-6 month mark, and then within the next few weeks would introduce them to each other. 

My kid is in her 20s now and while Im more open about who Im dating now that shes an adult, I still dont introduce her to someone before taking the time to get to know them first...which still takes about 4-6mths.  Jeez, I dont even think about introducing a guy to my friends unless we've been seeing each other at least 3 months or so.",1571848893,f4vwowl,t3_dlzlgb,t5_2xhvq
7911,ponchoacademy,"I started casually dating as soon as we filed for a divorce, but by this time, we were in different countries and I hadnt seen him for a year, so the divorce itself was just a matter of paperwork and Id already had a year of coming to terms with it the marriage was over.

The first few guys I dated were just to get out and have someone to spend time with.  Even though I was over him, divorce is still a loss and I needed time to get over that before I was ready for an actual relationship, which took me about another 3-4 months.

From the other side, I have dated people who are divorced and it left me being wary and want to avoid dating anyone whod been divorced less than a year. Its like, the rebound relationship that is 10x worse than being with someone after a breakup.  At first they seem like they are ready to move forward, but then things creep in like the fear of jumping into a relationship right out of marriage, or wanting to quickly use me as a replacement wife because deep down they just didnt want to be alone, and going through the first anniversary they arent spending with the ex, that one is a killer cause emotions they didnt realize they had just burst over.

Marriage is huge, and the time for healing is important.  While it made them feel awesome to be with me, it made me feel awful when they finally started to face their feelings and start contemplating all their life choices.  When it came down to it...I was the distraction they needed to escape and avoid grieving the end of the marriage and I was hurt in the end every time.",1571847573,f4vtitm,t3_dlve2v,t5_2qipv
7912,ponchoacademy,"Ive read through the comments and know that this will be some unpopular thoughts Im having..but here goes. He saw available food and made himself some lunch.  That you are just now telling him hes banned from eating any of your food kind of makes me think sharing your food isnt something you all discussed til now.

My reaction would be different if he ate all the cheese and bread you had knowing you need something to eat considering your dietary restrictions.  I dont know how restrictive your diet is, but if at any time theres food or drink in the fridge that you do consume and he didnt see an issue sharing with you, it probably didnt occur to him you dont feel the same way about him.

Like, just from my perspective, my daughter has a dairy sensitivity, nothing as serious as celiac, but bad enough that she buys certain foods for herself to avoid stomach issues, and Ive totally used her almond milk in coffee or to make cereal when I run out of mine.  I just make sure not to use up all of it and she often asks me to pick some up for her if shes running low.

So, from that point of view is why Im saying instead of your initial reaction to just tell him its not fair to eat any of your food and hes banned, maybe instead it would have been good to say hey that stuff is a lot more expensive and the only cheese I can have and ask him to just replace whatever he eats.

So Im feeling like ESH.  I understand your frustration, you spent your money on something and have a medical condition. But you didnt make it clear he cant have any food you buy, he wasnt aware thats how you felt about sharing things with him.  I can see why he would be hurt and get defensive, especially if he wouldnt hesitate to share with you.  That he said youre being picky about food and there was plenty left, I didnt take that to mean you are being picky about what you eat, but picky about who gets to eat it since there was plenty left for you to have.  

That he blew up and started shouting was out of line, its one thing to be upset, another to lose control over yourself like that and not just try and have a conversation about it.  And then coming back around to demand an apology instead of trying to actually talk about what happened. Hes the parent here and even if he is hurt, should be trying to understand whats going on here.",1571846105,f4vpxef,t3_dlxwmw,t5_2xhvq
7913,ponchoacademy,"I really feel for you.  My situation is not the same, but I can relate to some of the things you shared.  I was married, but when I divorced 20yrs ago, I assumed I had my whole life ahead of me to marry, have the family I wanted, see what it feels like to say Im pregnant and it be a good thing, have a guy with me through my pregnancy and raising a family together.  Having been raised by a single mom and how that affected me, I wanted my daughter to have the family life I really needed but didnt have. Now that my daughter is grown, the chance to provide that is gone. 

At this point, I would not feel good about starting over again. I just dont think it would be fair for her to see me get married and start a family, to see the younger sibling experience a better life than she did...she is amazing and deserves so much more than a father who didnt want to be around and the years of struggling in a single parent household.  And also, it was hard enough to do it by myself at a young age, I do not want to take any risk in ending up a single mother again at my age.  

A friend of mine got married, had her baby at 42 with a guy who was 46, and it was both their first marriage and child.  They are incredibly happy together and so it does happen. There are people out there who  are in the same situation you are who for whatever reason was not able to start a famliy until much later in life, and able to find someone to do that with. A few years ago, I was dating a guy in his early 50's who never had kids that I considered starting a life and family with.  

I think the thing about views in here is that, there arent a lot of posts by the people who have the lives we want.  This is datingoverforty afterall, so the scale tips at more posts about frustrations. And in general, people share posts about things they are not happy with...the ones out there living their best life who would give you the most hope to hear about arent online writing about it.",1571838703,f4v97jd,t1_f4v1xrg,t5_su6ij

7915,ponchoacademy,"I dont understand though, I shouldnt make it a thing for people to associate me with making plans? Why is that a negative thing?

I find when someone says, Ill call you sometime, or lets get together next week...it rarely happens, its just forgotten about because, life, and we're forever saying we really need to get together sometime.  When I make a point to give an actual date and time, it gives them a chance to go for it or pick a time better for them, and we've now actually made time for each other.

Btw, Im not arguing, just really curious....it could just be you dont like the idea of making plans. My friends and I have crazy schedules but genuinely do like spending time together...so doing this instead of keeping it vague has helped big time.  And yeah, even with people I dont know...like if Im going on a date or meeting someone new, instead of just asking if theyre free this weekend, Ill say are you free Saturday around 3.  And find that leads to actually meeting up instead of wondering when/if we'll actually meet sometime that weekend (usually not)",1571807342,f4uebvf,t1_f4ud8bt,t5_2qh1i

Ive been dating on and off for 20 years now...no exaggeration to say over those years Iv been on several dozen first dates that led to horror stories, wtf's, hilarious dates and one that had me questioning all my life choices that led to that moment lol  Ive gone through phases where Im focused on trying to find someone, and long stretches where I took a break from it all. 

Just trying to offer up some encouragement that its not a unicorn, the guy who is right for you isnt a fantasy. Just keep putting in the effort and something will eventually come out of it.  Yeah, even after all this time I still feel that way.

7918,ponchoacademy,"Yeah, I was in a different type of sales... I wasn't in telemarketing or consumer sales, I dealt with retailers. I never sold something I didnt actually believe in.  The best business is repeat business and you cant do good business if youre selling a crap product.

But yeah, it is a very common, if not basic sales technique.  A good salesperson will learn how to decide what will work best for their customer to build a long term relationship while also quickly pick up on the best way to talk to them to close the sale.  If a salesperson is annoying customers, they're in the wrong line of work and/or peddling crap wares.

I know having been in sales that people have a really bad feeling about them...but the thing is, pretty much everything you see on store shelves from grocery stores, to department stores to local community bookstores stock their shelves with purchases made by several different salespeople, like I was.  And they trust them to be able to guide them on what their consumers will want to buy.  And thats just that one little sector of sales that I was involved in. Theres medical and pharmaceutical sales, software sales, military sales blah blah blah all making sure the right products get into the right hands :)

Not to brag but...I was pretty good at what I did.  But..my kid grew up with me and knows me from every single angle..she knows when Im using psychological tricks on her, which sucks for me lol",1571801911,f4u8e4d,t1_f4u59c6,t5_2qh1i

As for the guy who has been single for a month, not sure if that means his divorce finalized a month ago, or he stopped seeing someone a month ago? Hard to tell why him being single is bad without more context.

But yeah, even so...thats just 4 guys.  I cant imagine, for instance, wanting to buy a dress for an event, taking the first 4 dresses off the rack, realizing they are not the right style for me and deciding there just arent any decent dresses out there and all the good ones are in some other womans closet.

I would look through the whole rack, heck I might even go to another store and go through that whole rack to find what Im looking for.  Finding the person Id like to spend my life with means a lot more to me than a dress, so yeah, if Im willing to put in the effort to find a dress to wear one night, Im definitely willing to put in the effort to find the man Id like to share my life with.

But yeah, Ive met a few guy on Tinder who werent ready for a relationship but liked the idea of having someone to go out and do things with and were upfront about that.  If someone seems really awesome, Ive been totally down for that.  Even if you only meet them once or it turns out to be an ongoing thing, just that moment getting out, having something to do and look forward to is a good thing.  Its also great to have the company of someone to go to places and do things that you may not want to do by yourself. And just getting out is how you'll also meet and get to know other people too.

I wouldnt discount your married friends btw...especially with the holidays coming up, there will be plenty of great opportunities to invite them over for dinner or drinks, and let them know if they know anyone who is spending the holiday/weekend/ what have you alone to go ahead and invite them too.

In my personal life, I dont ask...would you like to meet up sometime next week? I would ask, How does Thurday at 8 sound?  That feels like a real plan, and if that time doesnt work, theyre more likely to suggest a different time or day rather than back out altogether.

Ive also tried it with my daugher..instead of asking her if shed like to cook, ask her if shes cooking the chicken or pasta?  It took her no time at all to figure out what I was doing and snap back with...I think you should make the chicken, not really in the mood for pasta tonight.

However, this would have been an excellent time to actually talk to her, find out why shes friends with him, discuss what their friendship is about, and have another talk about the types of friends she makes online, along with reminders in how to make the right decisions about the friends she chooses to add and the importance of age appropriate friendships.

The whole point being to teach her the skills to make good decisions, not swoop in and make her decisions for her.  At this point, she probably wont be interested in talking about the friendship with you for you to understand what was going on. If anything inappropriate was happening, you wont know about it because she'll want to avoid your reaction towards her after your reaction towards just knowing this person existed.  But...it is something to keep in mind in the future, to instead of just react, to actually open the lines of communication so that she will comfortable making you aware of the people shes interacting with.

When kiddo first started going online, I knew that it also opened up the possibility of her meeting others online and made the conscious decision how I would handle her making friends online when it happens.  We talked about online dangers, and every so often Id casually tap the table on what shes up to.  Because I didnt make it a big deal, she didnt think it was a big deal to tell me...there were times when she met someone older than her, and I did the advice I gave you up above.  There were times when people asked her questions like what I told her to look out for..like trying to get personal information, or asking intimate questions...and I knew about it because she would randomly say, oh hey remember xyz I told you about, yeah, he got wierd wanting to know what school I go to.  Ugh I blocked that creep.  

And yeah, it felt a lot better that she was aware and made the decision that was not acceptable for herself, rather than me having to do it for her.  I want her to be able to take care of herself..and when interacting with others, having the skills to not put up with inappropriate behavior is key.

On a much lighter note, there are friends of hers, her age, that she met online, who she has been friends with for going on 10 yeas now...at one point we were going to be close to where one of them were, and they were trying to arrange to meet by asking if his mom could drive him and we could all have lunch together.  So even with knowing each other so long, both kids recognized the possibly dangers and wanted the parents with them to meet.

If that is indeed the case, it sounds like you are very quickly romanticizing the idea of what a guy is like an seeing longer term potential before you even know them well enough.  Both guys are reacting to you the same way, which kind of gives me the hunch that your super excited eagerness for your future holds is coming through loud and clear. Both guys have told you within just a few dates that they want to slow things own.

I think that you really should take that to heart, and slow things down.  There's nothing at all wrong with casually dating, but if you instantly feel strong connections and start envisioning your lives together before actually getting to know a guy, that can definitely be a problem, and totally is a turn off that will cause a guy to need some space.

About this particular guy, theres nothing you can do to make sure he doesnt see you as a friend.  The fact that hes already letting you know hes considering you as just a friend pretty much seals that deal. No one who has an romantic interest in another person would even suggest friendship.  Hes paving the way for letting you down easy.

As you are dating, instead of thinking is he the one and actually getting excited about a future with a guy you barely know, take dating as an opportunity to get to know him and decide if hes someone youd like to see again.

I really dont get that, the moment someone shows up its going to be clear they misrepresented themselves, and looking straight at the first of what are probably many lies is plenty enough reason not to go for a second date...if even to go through with the first.

I once had a date with a guy, luckily, on my way there was an emergency at home, but I called him up, explained the situation and suggested we meet up just quick enough to say hi and because I didnt want him to think I was just flaking out on him.

I pulled up next to his car, I got out, then he got out to meet me..okay so, Im 5'10..he mustve said hes at least 6' because I usually would wear flats to a date if a guy was shorter than that and I was wearing heels that day. This guy was 5'5..maybe. Thats being very generous.  And though I dont think he lied about his age, the pics of him were of him in younger, less haggard days.

It wasnt common sense to me to read between the lines and assume she was moving men into the house..thats really not a common thing that single mothers do.  In fact, thats a very disturbing thing especially considering shes drawn to abusive men.  

For the sake of the children and her ability to to make better decisions for them and her life, her feelings do matter...its pretty important that get her anxiety under control, understand why her feelings are driving her to make bad choices so that she is capable of being a better mother.  True CPS and abusive guys wont care about her feelings, and I get that you prefer the tough love approach.  Going to a professional who will care about her feelings and help her sort through them will definitely be a step towards doing something about her anxiety, feelings of self worth and get her on track to be more mentally capable of making decisions from place other than fear and familiarity.  

I appreciate that youve taken the time have this conversation, even though the whole thing really bothers you. You're pissed off and I know it comes from a place of caring about your friend and for lack of a much better way to put this, sick of seeing her screw up her life and just want her to knock it off and take care of her kids so that they can all live a better life.  I keep wanting to reach out because, besides the whole moving guys in thing, I can relate to a lot of what you said about her and I really hope that you put some thought into encouraging her to get professional help.

7931,ponchoacademy,"&gt; I'll say it one last time. What OP recommended is the very same process you went through.

Indeed, and I clearly said that process did not help me. I took the advice to stop looking, work on myself and let love find me. I focused completely on myself and my daughter and 6 years later when I did decide to try looking again, I was in the same position I was 6 years earlier as far as the type of guy I would get involved with.  It was clear that it takes a lot more than simply working on myself.

&gt; And you show it here again. You can't solve the problem in the process while being in the process.

Im not contradicting myself at all, your point of view perhaps, but not mine. I dont believe you cant solve a problem in the process while being in the process. I didnt learn how to pay attention to and recognize red flags in the men I was choosing by avoiding the process of dating. 

In any case, there are two very distinct but related issues going on here...especially with the extra info the OP gave.  Theres the issue of her friends anxiety, and the revelation that shes actually moving guys into the home.  Im honestly really concerned theres a mental issue thing going on here. I suggested professional help and the reaction was yeah but she should just heed her advice, along with fuck it if she invalidates her friends feelings and how shes not going to sugar coat anything. I get the whole tough love thing, but considering this is someone who sounds like she actually needs professional help, I dont think that just doing what OP tells her to do will be enough to help solve her underlying problems.

The second issue which is related to the first is how she is drawn to abusive men.  Now, Im not saying she should date any and everyone or that she should jump into a relationship right now, Ive been super clear about it I recognize shes not able to make good decisions about men.  Understanding more about her anxiety and that shes moving guys into her home iwth her kids, its clear she needs to deal with the mental issues before she can even get to the core of why shes more comfortable with abusive men so that she can take the steps to break that pattern.",1571770216,f4rotmn,t1_f4rdyd0,t5_2xhvq

If they start to get hostile then I let it go.  Im just not interested in that way of communicating.  Its super rare that I'll persist..usually if it has something to do with dogs or kids, cause man, thats such a weak spot for me :)  But stuff like politics?

7935,ponchoacademy,"Oh I feel where youre coming from...for sure cats are a whole lot more independent than dogs are....they are perfectly fine with it if they can be left alone while dogs in general are happiest when they spending time with their people.

But yeah, that does also make for a huge difference in what its like to have a cat or a dog.  A dog person would not be just as happy with a cat and vice versa.

Dogs in general are super needy, mine displays that by being in ultimate heaven when the three of us are sitting on the couch together with him curled up between us.  If my daughter is in her room and Im in the livingroom, he will curl up in the hallway so that he can feel as close to both of us as possible.  

While pups can and do carry on and beg for attention, they can, and should be trained not to.  Its totally fine when my pup asks for love or playtime, he'll bring a toy over and put it in my lap. But if I move the toy aside...he knows okaaay..not playtime and go amuse himself instead.  That kind of is the perk of a dog and labs are perfect for this, they not only are pretty smart, they really really want to make you happy and can be trained to behave in whatever way you feel is appropriate.  

Still working on getting mine not to get excited and jump on people *grumble* but other than that, having a well trained dog definitely makes for a good home life.",1571763083,f4r5kpz,t1_f4qx4h3,t5_2xhvq

7937,ponchoacademy,"Yeah, I did not say she should jump into a relationship right now.  Still just completely ignoring everything I actually said and now making things up.  I also didnt imply that I know her better than you...I dont know her at all.  I only commented on the idea that you know whats good for her better than she does.  I think its fair to assume you have not known her longer than shes known herself or been more involved in experiencing her life than she has.

Also, I can only go by the information you give...you said your advice was to stop looking for love, work on herself and let love find her, and yeah from that information, thats pretty generic advice. Now that youve added you actually gave advice that does change the initial impression I had that you didnt put much thought into it. 

You also completely left out that she was moving guys into the house with her kids.  Thats a pretty big detail and quite a bit more major than just moving from one relationship to another as you initially said.  I guess the thing is, you have to remember, we only have what you tell us to go on.  Getting frustrated because Im basing my opinion and vote on that and not taking into consideration all these new things you didnt mention to begin with doesnt make sense.

Its still interesting to me that you are arguing you know what needs a mother has and still completely disregard any validity of what someone actually in that position is feeling.  Acknowledging that being a single mother might actually be a difficult and scary position to be in does not at all mean jump into a relationship. The desire to provide a stable family unit that includes a father figure is not as flippant as just needing a man. With the additional info you gave, it is much clearer just how bad her anxiety is and also just how bad the decisions she is making are.  Personally, I wouldnt just say she needs to work on herself because she does not seem to have the capacity or the emotional tools it takes to come to the realization of her self worth and be able to make better choices by herself.

I would suggest instead that she get professional help, for her sake and her children's sake. I did it, and having someone who is trained to validate how I feel while also guiding me to get to the root of why I was feeling that way, which in turn was leading me to make the decisions I was making was a tremendous help.  What on the surface may have seemed like just making crappy decisions about this one particular thing, actually went a lot deeper than that. No matter how well you think you know her, there may well be things that went on her life life before you came along that started her down this path of being drawn to abusive men.  The anxiety and this level of what sounds like self destruction might the result of something deeper she needs to get a handle of before she can work on fixing things.

And...please dont even take what Im saying about her having things in her life you dont know about as a knock to your friendship and how well you believe to know her.  My best friend of 25 years was completely unaware of a lot of the hardest things I had to deal with, both when we were kids and as adults. She knew darn near everything, but, not every single detail.  No matter how close you are to someone or how well you know them, you truly wont be as intimately knowledgeable about or be able to actually understand exactly how they feel.  Being there for her,  being supportive is a good thing, but I really do think that she needs someone who is trained in handling this sort of thing to help her.",1571761933,f4r34ox,t1_f4qvlw6,t5_2xhvq

My coworkers who make more than me have talked about how they dont put the max into 401k cause they have student loans to pay, and most of them live with a roommate.  Not saying getting a degree is a bad thing, they went the much preferred route, its definitely easier to get a job in our field with one.

Gotta love the 40+ yo guys with those Instagram filters to make them look like a dog or whatever animals.  I guess they are doing their best ""Whats up fellow kids?"" impression thinking it will make them attractive to younger women.

When every single pic is a different angle of them in bed...just super close up pics of their face and pillow.  I imagine those guys are bedridden. 

On a related note, when every pic is a selfie, especially if they are all in the car or in bed, I just wonder if he has any friends, ever goes out and does anything besides be in his car and bed.

The ones where every single picture is of them bungee jumping, sky diving, rock climbing, those mud marathon things...Never really sure if they are just showing off what they feel makes them look like they live an exciting life, or weeding out anyone who wouldnt be interested in doing all those things non-stop too.

All your other points are spot on, guys do those things too.  Especially the group photo thing. Its always so annoying to see the pic of two guys, go wow ok hes attractive, then next few pics are group pics or taken from so far away you can tell who he is, then finally a pic of just him and you realize..oh, hes not the attractive guy from the first pic, hes the other one.

7945,ponchoacademy,"I'll be serious and probably a huge debbie downer, but it would be to ask him why he didnt answer my prayers or at least give me a reason to stop asking.

My father died when I was a baby, and I grew up in an incredibly abusive religious home, so for a long time there I did believe.  I was maybe around 7 or 8 when I started praying for him to let me be with my father.  Pretty much every night this is what I prayed for, and many days I would wake up and cry because I had to be here for another day.

I did the polite request, I did the asking if he can make certain things stop happening, I did the asking for a friend I could talk to and not be alone, but mostly I asked to be with my dad.  At some point, I realized nothing was ever going to change...I was incredibly sad at the idea that god was watching, letting things happen, and choosing not to do anything to help me, that he didnt care about me, and I preferred to believe instead that there wasnt a being who would be so cruel.  I stopped praying, I stopped believing, that was that and my life continued on the way it was many more years.

It actually wasnt til I was much older that I even fully understood the gravity of what I was praying for.  The realization of being a little girl who felt completely alone and in so much pain I wanted to die, absolutely gutted me.

So yeah, if it turns out there is a god and I got the chance to ask him anything, I would want to know why. While I still dont believe there is one, lets just say there is, I cannot imagine any sort of explanation or words of comfort that would help me understand why it was necessary I experienced the things I did or how he allows all the depravity that exists in the world.",1571742813,f4ptyb0,t3_dlfyge,t5_2qh1i

Ive also heard (I hear a lot of things eh? lol) that gettng the first job is the hardest, and looking for a job when you already have one is infinitely easier than looking when you dont. But that once you get that second job, make sure youve put a lot more thought into things that youve learned are important to you in a company and team so that you can stay there for at least 2 years before thinking of moving on to develop that trust that you arent setting a pattern for job hopping.

We were just laying there in silence, holding hands looking at the stars and I was thinking how perfect everything in that moment was...and then suddenly there was a huge sound, flash of blinding light and a plane came swooping in to land right over us...then another one right behind it.

I completely freaked out and was so excited, he was cracking up so hard enjoying my reaction while trying to keep laying down watch them come in over us...it was the coolest thing EVER to lay there and have them landing so close.

No idea if it was military plans or private planes or what...(too small for commercial planes) but he found out there would be flights coming in that night and thought it would be a cool surprise to take me out there to see it up close.

7952,ponchoacademy,"I feel where youre coming from...during the worst of my depression, I came off as incredibly happy.  When I was around others, I was ""on"" was cracking jokes, fun to be around, was a great time..and then I would go home and not move off my couch for several days.  I didnt genuinely experience any real emotions, the sadness I did feel was mostly in feeling like a horrible mother for not being able to function and be there 100% for my daughter, and all the ways she picked up the slack.  Any attempt to talk to friends led to getting a ton of motivational poster texts and encouragement to take charge of my happiness.  (Add that to the list of what not to do)

During this time I hit a critical low, didnt leave my home for almost 2 months, ended up going to the hospital (I didnt do anything, I just could recognize I seriously needed help), getting therapy and thats when I was diagnosed with CPTSD and clinical depression.  When I tried to reach out, someone who was a very close friend told me theres no way, Im the happiest person she knows and theres nothing wrong with me.  I emailed another friend  explaining what I was dealing with and she didnt acknowledge it...just replied about some fight she had with her mom and zomg how annoying she is.  (can add both of these reactions to what not to do...)

I then stopped talking to everyone for 2 years.  Just went to therapy and focused on trying to get a handle on myself.  I do genuinely feel happiness now...though I do also still feel moments of nothingness. There are actually moments where Ive had so many good moments I forget this is even a thing and when it hits me, I do feel sadness to get that reminder that this is something I will always have to deal with.

As crappy as that might seem on the surface, its actually a really good thing, because for long stretches during my life, I felt like this nothingness is all I would ever feel, and that I would never actually feel real joy again. But with therapy, and working on myself, I have had my moments.  Ive been dealing with this over 20 years, about 10 years now since my diagnosis, so I hope you can find some ray of hope in all this twisted rubble I just shared that there are glimmers in there somewhere, and that in time and with help and therapy, life can have its good moments.",1571732397,f4pig2a,t1_f4ph90y,t5_2qh1i
7953,ponchoacademy,"Oh for sure, when I first got my dog, I crate trained him (thats a thing, you say it like crates are a bad thing but its just a part of training, which dogs do need to be trained).  I would leave him alone for a couple hours then come back and let him out, take him for a walk and give him love..then upped the time to make sure he was comfortable.  It took about 3 days total.  Then we did the reverse, and would leave him out for a couple hours then upped the time.

All in all, the whole process took about a month before we were sure he would not have accidents in the house and not ruin anything...and since then hes been totally free to roam the house when were gone. He has a chair by the window that he spends quite a bit of time looking outside of, a bed in the hallway between our bedrooms, and his crate is in the dining room.  His crate is his safe space which he goes into and sleeps quite often, but he also gets put in there if someone is going to do work on the house or we have company over and he wont stop jumping on them (still working on that)

But yeah, your expectation a dog should not need crate training and is expected to just know and just be trusted is not reasonable..its a pretty common thing to train your dog.  Im not saying there is zero responsibility involved, I just think that the idea that to own a dog means you cannot have a job and must stay home with them 24/7 because they require your full attention, so her fiance will be burdened with this level of care for the dog since hes home is not a reasonable argument.",1571729862,f4pgubu,t1_f4pge20,t5_2xhvq

When she left her country to come to America, the family my sister was staying at the time demanded she take her kid with her.  A couple years after that she meets my dad, he already had many kids. She assumed he was done, and was devastated to find out he wanted more. Many arguments later...I came along.  Then he was suddenly killed.

So...now she was stuck with two kids she never wanted to begin with. And she reminded me of this pretty much every day of my life til she kicked me out, that her life would have been better without me and she never wanted me, yadda yadda.  Cant say that happiness was a part of either of our lives...in any capacity.

The only reason I had decided I didnt want kids was because I felt that considering my only experience of what a mother is like, I would suck at it. Then surprise...! And it turned out, my desire to give my daughter a better life than I had made me a pretty darn good mother.

It would get heated, there were times she or I said things the other didnt like, and moments where I was on one side of the couch sipping my wine and she was on the other end sipping hers, both of us fuming over whatever was said.

Even if we had a, I cant talk to you right now moment, we were both taking the time to process what the other said and and had that trust that we could, and would continue the conversation after a few minutes.  And you know.it really could just be me talking about and cherishing that I had a friend like that, we didnt take it personally when either of us needed to just stop talking and inwardly curse the other one out, mull, think thinks over..whatever. In those moments of silence we were still there for each other and after a few minutes wed be back to talking again.

I get that shes hopping from guy to guy, and I actually have been there. It doesnt seems like shes reaching the point of rushing into marriage though, just rushing into dating one terrible guy after another.  Been there, done that.  Which is why my friend actually helping me focus on why I kept choosing a particular kind of guy helped a lot more with how I was making decisions helped rather than telling me to just stop looking altogether.  Simply not dating for so many years did nothing for changing the type of guy I was drawn to...understanding why I was doing it and being aware of when I was doing it is what made a huge difference in the type of guys I started to date instead.

I absolutely dont support not looking and would never give the same advice OP did because having been there and followed that advice for nearly 6 years which at the end of, I went right back to dating like I always did, I wouldnt do that to someone else.  I know not looking doesnt work to get to the core of or solve the underlying problem of figuring out how to not choose a terrible guy.

Wouldn't even be able to explain to 12yo me why, because though I know the technical reason, I don't fully understand it from a logical perspective.

Also, we're in our 40s here! It's not like in our 20s and even 30s where the future was forever away. 50s and 60s is around the corner, and if you want someone in your life through all the fun that comes with supporting day to day life, medical issues, retiring and spending your days and vacationing with, don't feel guilty about looking for that.

Thing is... While you two should back each other up, you should also be in agreement over punishments. That's something to discuss and agree on together, not for her to decide everything then just tell you what to do. She can only make unilateral decisions in her own house, not in yours.

It doesn't help that so many guys I come across lie about their height.

Its an undescribable feeling to know had we had left one day earlier or the attack happened one day later.......  Our luggage was in the dining room, he was having a morning coffee while reading emails and had CNN on as usual. I was trying to pep talk myself into getting out of bed when I hear him start cursing and he sounded scared af. When I ran out there he couldn't even talk, just staring at the tv and a moment later they announced there was a second plane.

The reality of it all hasn't even sunk in yet till both our phones started blowing up. Friends and family knew we were going to NYC and go to the towers, so we were on the phone all day. Even people I barely talked to buy knew cause I posted on FB about my trip were calling and already in tears when they finally got through to talk to me.

It was a highly emotional day, and I still feel panicked when 9/11 comes around even though I was no where near it. No one has a right to tell anyone how something affects them. Just because someone has it worse, doesn't mean what you feel is invalid and means nothing.

Problem with the idea that dating ugly guys thinking they'll feel lucky to be with you is that... They start to feel pretty confident in their ability to get the pretty girl and want to ride that wave. Or women who turned them down before are suddenly wondering what they have to offer that he's with someone who is pretty and start coming on to him, and now he's getting all this attention he's not used to and wants to enjoy it.

So even though looks aren't a big deal to me, alarms go off if a guy says he can't believe someone so pretty would be interested in him, or just keeps telling me how beautiful I am. I much prefer an even match where we just look good together.",1572366458,f5przpe,t3_dojwau,t5_xaiot

Came across a lot of short guys who are like, whatever, everyone is taller than me. Was seeing a guy who said being an extra 2-3"" if I wear heels don't matter. He's going to look short next to anyone no matter what so it's not a big deal.

I was seeing a guy who lived 25miles from me and he wanted to take me to see the waterfalls in his neighborhood. He offered to drive, but crazy since that's an hour roundtrip just to get me and go right back where he started from, so I got a car off Turro, and it cost around $40 for 24hrs. 

I guess to me the thing is, if someone is self sufficient they're functioning without a car or someone to drive then everywhere. If they're not selfish and interested in seeing you, they're going to put effort in and contribute to the relationship whether or not they have a car. If a guy without a car is a jerk, he'd still be a jerk even if he had one.

FYI... Not trying to make you start dating guys without a car, just giving another perspective. I also see the irony in it that even though I only buy what I need and don't judge a guy based on his possessions, I tend to always end up with guys who like the nicest must expensive ""toys"" they can afford even though I could care less about the stuff they can buy.

There was one guy who got annoyed with me because there was an accident on the freeway and I got lost trying to take a back way to his house. He said after all these months I should know how to get to his place and not be late. I lost it and told him after all these months I doubt he can even remember where I live because he'd been to my neighborhood two times. 

I don't have a car now and that affects no one because Im self sufficient. If it affects someone else's life because they need someone who drives to them and for them, then that's a problem I can't help them with.",1572318972,f5oidnr,t1_f5nvemm,t5_su6ij

I don't have a car, but I live in walking distance of a couple grocery stores, but if I get a lot of groceries, I can take the bus and I commute to work by bus. When I go out of town, I take the rail to the airport. Now I do have my license, so when I go shopping at Ikea, I rent a uhaul van. When I go on roadtrips I rent a car. If I just need a car for a day, I get one from Turro.  Uber for everything else. 

I put it in my profile that I don't have a car but do drive and rent a car if needed. I know for some guys it's a big deal, so if me not owning a car I'd a deal breaker, I'm upfront. But def not going to buy something so expensive just to park it in my driveway for the couple times a month it would be convenient to drive or just to impress someone.

I've been seeing a guy for 6 months now and besides picking me up for a date, he hasn't driven me anywhere. And it's not every time... Sometimes it's just more convenient for me to Uber or take the bus and meet him.

There was a local situation where someone was calling and killing escorts. The police put out a notice promising that anyone who comes forward with information will not be charged by admitting prostitution, they're sole intent was to find and catch the killer. After a second woman believed to be connected came up, women became really scared and started talking. They were able to connect a dozen or so cases of assault to the same guy and were able to catch him based on the women who could give a description.

A secondary thing that happened is others took advantage of the offer to not be persecuted and took their chance contacting the police, and they got enough tips on a couple of sex trafficking rings they weren't aware of to go after them.

You'd think Id at least get a lot done with all that time, but I'm completely useless... It's agonizing when my brain won't shut up, and as time goes on the sounds and hallucinations kick in. Then I become afraid to sleep.

It sounds so real, very hard and deliberate. Or if I do start falling asleep, it sounds like someone is whispering my name, or I'll hear sounds like someone moving about the house, but my daughter is not home. 

Lack of sleep turns the brain into such an asshole. But when I'm stressed and my insomnia kicks in harder than usual, I can't help it. Once my anxiety kicks in, I'm not getting any sleep at all. I'm scared to be awake and scared to fall asleep. Therapy and meds did not help at all... Even prescription sleeping pills did nothing.

After 2 stillborns, 2 fertilization attempts and 6 miscarriages, it's not fair to put the entire blame of the father's reaction in hearing the sister is pregnant first, without at all considering that just maybe after all those incredibly difficult experiences she's been through, hes grown to be cautious about getting excited over her having a baby.

Even according to OP, the issue isn't that the sister announced hers first, it was that she perceives it as having stole her thunder. The thunder was already likely stolen by 12yrs of seeing his daughter be in pain and struggle. He has no idea if this time will be different.

Just because she's 5mths along doesn't mean there's zero chance there can be any complications and he should be over the moon. The odds are much lower yes, it's a time to breathe easy and be hopeful. But it's unreasonable for everyone to just forget a 12 year history of difficulties with multiple pregnancies.

As time goes on and the baby continues to be healthy, then the excitement will build up and grow till the father is bursting with excitement. And if competition is really that important here, take heart that your baby will be born before the one the sister is pregnant with. Your one miracle baby will probably still be so the rage bringing him joy by the time her nth baby is born.

I don't like thinking of things in that way, but yeah, if being center stage and not having another baby still your thunder is off importance.

That  your sister told him first doesn't make her TA. It wasn't on your mind to ask her just like it wasn't on her mind to not tell him anything until you do.

Maybe he's actively open to being in a relationship, just wants to date casually but wouldn't be opposed to a relationship eventually, is casually dating and sleeping with several women and not interested in relationships anytime soon, or is a confirmed bachelor who has zero interest in ever being in a relationship.

That's a personal problem, and it shows. Sounds like he can't attract any of the women he's interested in, and frustrated that when a woman finally looks his way it's one he doesn't want.

So he doesn't want a woman who takes care of herself, dresses well, and from the interactions he describes, has a great sense of humor and is confident. Got it.

Personally, I get to know someone for a few months, and when things are getting serious then I start including them in my personal life. By then, my friends and family are just excited to meet this person I've mentioned and interested to get to know them too. 

Any new person in the life of a close one is up to scrutiny, and the more unusual a pairing is, the more they will wonder if that's the right person for you. But if they've already seen the way you light up when you really about them and have been excited to meet them too, it's a lot harder to have something negative to say.

Also, can you step back and say, okay I can see why they say that. I mean like, is age the only issue? Or is she also in a completely different stage of life, or with totally different interests. Or are the two of you in track and have a lot of things in common to connect over? When it comes to family and friends, the biggest question is... But why them? If it's not apparent and they are totally confused what you two see in each other, they're going to be concerned and age difference is a pretty good scapegoat to blame the overall feeling on.

With both of my exes the initial reaction was, wow he's super old... But I see why you like him. Not sure what his side may have said to him, they all just really liked me and would say it was great to see him so happy. The 15yr difference guy was teased for robbing the cradle, then would joke I'm probably more mature than he is (they were right actually.. Hence why he's an ex now) but yeah generally speaking, those close to us are just looking out but if they see that you have a good thing going, they'll feel a lot better about it.",1573254073,f6xobgd,t1_f6xmeg2,t5_su6ij

Believing you are special enough to make men prefer to pay instead of get it for free has nothing to do with your self esteem. I wasn't berating you or trying to make it personal like that.

I was just trying to explain why a man would pay and that is insanely common. There's nothing special about this and you're not playing them as you believe... You're offering a service many women offer that many many men are willing to pay for. That's it. Nothing deep or between the lines or about you personally.

I heard less crap over my relationship with the 25yr gap crazily enough, probably because we were so genuinely happy together and obviously in love. There were quite a few dirty looks, but also quite a few comments that's we were a beautiful couple. 

If you're feeling awkward and worried about what people think, then regardless of what your differences are, that you care so much what other people think means you're not comfortable with it within yourself, and that's going to cause you more problems than society will.",1573252390,f6xm0hf,t3_dtm5oy,t5_su6ij

I mean I get it, you want to feel like you're doing something extraordinary, but there are tens of thousands of women doing the same things you are are and getting paid for it as well. There's a reason there are guys who still pay for phone sex to this day. It fits into their fetish narrative. 

Maybe seeing a bunch of other guys post about a girl they like and reading her responses to other men on Reddit isn't their cup of tea, they want to pretend in their head she's all theirs and he's actually special to her. Maybe they have a findom fetish and paying for it is part of the excitement.

At the end of the day, they require a service and you're providing it. If you weren't, they'd be going to one of the other thousands of women who are providing it. Like you said, they choose to pay.

He went all out for himself and the total came to around 50. I only know this cause he freaked out over it... My portion was maybe $10. Like dude, if you knew you were broke, why not thank your lucky stars I happened to get the cheapest thing and save face by getting something cheap too?

I just sat there and stared at him, cause I wasn't about to save him. He went to an atm, came back and said he didn't have the funds then went off on how expensive dating is. He ended up calling a friend who brought him some money to pay the bill. 

Quite honestly, I was so pissed off at this point I couldn't drive (anxiety fun, when I'm mad my entire body trembles and there's no way I can get behind the wheel) but I said I need a drink and we went to a place I knew around the corner. I ordered and gave my card to the bartender, told him I was only having one so close me out, and the guy stood there for a moment just kind of staring at me then says he thought I'd get him one too since I know he doesn't have any money. I just stared right back at him. Didn't say a word.

The bartender just looked from me to him with a huge smile on his face...he made my drink, the guy hung about awkwardly for a bit then said he was going to call it a night. 

Man, I don't miss being in my 20s. Can't even imagine that happening now, and if it did I would've just walked the moment he started talking about how expensive dating is over my $10 food bill. Eff that nonsense.",1573250576,f6xj1wt,t3_dtb1iz,t5_xaiot
8009,ponchoacademy,"Why? Because you're accessible.

Watching a porn of some woman who was paid to do a scene x years ago and probably looks nothing like that now isn't the same as looking at pics and vids of someone self producing content who they can actually contact and possibly request custom content from.

This creates an added element of illusion that you value them in some way, because they know their money is going into your pocket and they are directly financially supporting your lifestyle and if they write you, you're personally aware of their existence.

In short, spending money on you makes them feel important and gets them off. They know they're just a customer, but hope springs eternal that they're special, not like the other guys thinking they pay the most are your biggest fan and you'll actually care about them for it.

It fits into their fetish narrative. You're not taking advantage of a guy by providing him the service he's looking for.

And you're not the only girl he's purchasing from. While waiting for new content from you, he's got other fav girls in rotation he's buying content from too. He's completely aware this is all a transaction, even if for a moment he can suspend logic and pretend there's more to it than that while he gets off on it.",1573249115,f6xgiq9,t1_f6xd1o0,t5_xaiot

If a guy offers to buy me something I casually mentioned, I may tell him no need.

I'm looking for guys that fall in the middle category... They are the thoughtful ones who genuinely are interested in my happiness. The first and last type of guys are just doing it for show and hands down, are the type who will stop once they've got me and feel like they don't have to do things like that anymore.

The good thing is you're aware it's toxic.

8013,ponchoacademy,"I don't know how to link to it, but my comment about the guys with play money is in the top thread in the Becky vs Dreamgirl post.

I'll add the opposite works too. When a guy is absolutely crazy about you and you refuse to let him pay for or buy something for you, if the only thing of value is in his wallet, it completely throws him off and he doesn't know what to do with himself.

Especially if money is all he has to offer, it's really interesting to see how he reacts when he literally has nothing else going for him. Was seeing a guy who on our second date gave me jewelry, on our third date he wanted to get my car repaired and take me shopping to buy Christmas gifts for my daughter. I told him no...I was dressed up to go on a date, not sit in a car repair shop and spend the evening at toys r us. 

He completely lost it, lectured me on how when a man is trying to do nice things for me and spend money on me I should appreciate it, he's trying to show he cares. I told him he can show he cares by taking me to dinner because I'm hungry. He spent the whole meal complaining about how women are upset about guys who don't do enough and now I'm not satisfied with him trying to do everything he can. Plus went off on his ex wife, issues with crazy exes, all that fun stuff... It was very enlightening. 

After what I was sure was obviously a horrible last date, when he dropped me off at home he started talking about how I could come to his place next time for dinner, that he'd love to show me his house, it's big enough for my daughter and I too and maybe I'd like to live there someday. I couldn't get out of his car fast enough.

Had to block him because he started berating me with texts and voicemail that I don't know a good thing when I see it and the good life I'm throwing away. Over a year later I was going through my filtered emails and saw that for months he sent me YouTube videos of love songs that he said made him think of me.

I was there... When I was married my husband cheated on me. We reconciled and things were good on a certain level, but my trust was damaged. Then he cheated again... Was still trying to make things work because time invested, I take my vows seriously blah blah blah. But my trust was even less and I refused to have sex without a condom anymore, but then just didn't want him to touch me at all.

Still kept trying to make things work, but I couldn't stand him touching me in any way and I couldn't even sleep in the same bed with him anymore. No surprise, he cheated yet again and we got divorced.

The shame isn't on you, it's on him treating you this way. This group is about bringing awareness to things guys can and will do and how to protect ourselves from being in these kinds of situations.

I stayed with my ex about 3 years after the first time he cheated... Not only did I not save my marriage by trying to work things out with a guy who physically repulsed me and who I couldn't trust, I lost a fair amount of my dignity in the process. During that time he treated me worse and worse knowing I was staying with him even though I wasn't getting my needs met and he wasn't being a loyal husband. My self esteem was through the floor and he knew it, otherwise I wouldn't have stayed and put up with him.

You deserve better than that, you deserve a man you can trust, who treats you well, who wouldn't put you in this situation to begin with. Your husband is the one who should be ashamed of himself.",1573239705,f6x1dka,t1_f6wxpsw,t5_xaiot

I've done stuff like teach myself decorative cupcake baking, get on Duolingo to try and learn a new language, was painting for awhile there. I'm always trying to learn to figure out something new that I look forward to and dedicate time to. Or read a book, take a day trip somewhere, even if by yourself.

But there are still decent guys out there, and online is still the top way plenty of people who don't have time to date look for someone.

 If you're mostly interested in meeting guys in tech, get involved in your local tech community...

If I visit a guys place and it's a wreck, not only does he have no pride in his home or shame for having me see it that way, he cares very little about what kind of impression he giving me. Even worse if he left it that way expecting I'll clean up for him. 

I've never done actual chores like laundry or cleaning, but I used to do little things like wash dishes if a guy cooked for me. Years ago I was seeing a guy who made me dinner and afterwards when I offered to do dishes he said I'm not his maid, but I can be a bartender if I'd like and make us drinks while he cleans up. It occurred to me I'd never invite someone over and expect them to clean up for me.

So yeah, I just expect the same courtesy that I offer to a guest in my home. Quite frankly, I'd be mortified if a guy felt it was necessary to do my laundry or clean my kitchen.

Guys who weren't necessarily trying to be in a relationship, but hey this feels good for now, and after some time.  Yeah, you're great but I still don't want a relationship.

That wasn't on them, it was on me for continuing to stay with someone who didn't want the same thing I did, but me hoping they would change their mind. 

Another thing is, you sound great on paper, but what about your personality? You didn't mention anything about what type of person you are or what your interests, passion and hobbies are. Those are pretty important... I've been on dates with plenty of guys who check the boxes, but trying to hold a conversation was tough, we had nothing to laugh about or relate on, he worked and went home and... That's it. The idea of spending the rest of my life as a homebody watching tv every night with nothing to talk about was enough for me to tap out, no matter how nice and handsome as successful the guy is.

So yeah, not saying you need to change, there are lots of people who will like to share the life you enjoy with you as want the same, just that lifestyle differences/interests count for a lot even though you check all the basic stuff, and also, making sure that when you do choose someone, they share the same values and goals you do.",1573173517,f6v0pkh,t3_dt64qe,t5_su6ij

I called him, he dropped me off, I delivered kiddo by myself and had no visitors. Called when we were going to be discharged and he dropped us off. I walked into my home alone with kiddo, looked at her in my arms and said, okay it's just you and me. Let's do this.

All of any fears I had were due to the unknown. I didn't know what to expect or if I could handle it but everything ended up being just fine. I guess the thing is, I had no choice but to make it work, so I just did my best and went for it.

It was tough... There were a lot of times I cried in frustration and exhaustion. But oh man kiddo was so forgiving. There were times I fell asleep while feeding her, woke up to her looking at me like...wtf mom? with milk all over her face. Which honestly was kind of funny in hindsight. I put a lot of pressure on myself to ""do everything and do everything right"" which burned me out... In reality she just needed to be clean, fed and loved.  And if I messed up or did something silly, she wasn't going to give me crap about it... Not like she had any idea of how I could be doing xyz better so no judgment there.

Back then internet wasn't a thing like it is now, so I was subscribed to 3 parenting magazines, had the ""what you should know"" baby book that was popular at the time, and I studied and followed those as my parenting advice. And that was kind of it!

When she was one, I did marry for 4 years, but he was always deployed so wasn't home most of the time. Beyond that it has been just the two of us. She's in her 20s now and an incredible awesome person. I'm completely amazed considering every step of the way I had no idea wtf I was doing and I didn't really have anyone to help me.

The fear is a good thing though and totally normal, even for people with a supportive partner and a huge family ready to help, being a parent is scary no matter what cause it's a huge responsibly that you don't want to mess up. So don't feel like that means there's something wrong with you, feel bad about how scared you are, or if the unknown, or in your ability to do this. It's a normal and healthy fear.

While I can look back and see small things, I'm still baffled how he managed to keep several lives going, in different countries for 5 years.

Two things came out of that for me, there's no way any guy can tell me he doesn't have time for me. I know better... Anyone can make time if they want to.

And the second one, it's way too easy to rationalize behavior as a signal things are going well. From meeting family to the time spent together to how much he spends...

Nope...he texted to say hi.

If Im wearing all black, then I'll wear something totally different like red underwear, which indeed does pop and makes a noticeable difference when the clothes come off :)

When I was younger, I pretty much always wore black, and one day while shopping for something to wear for a date, my kid who was 4 at the time picked out a bright red blouse with HUGE roses all over it. I was like, not no but F no.  She insisted it was super pretty, and I was like UGHHHH okay, and I bought and wore it.  I got compliments the entire night!!

Now, while I think her reaction was completely over the top about your job being more important and all that, I do get where shes coming from, I really do.

I work in a male dominated field, they all have wives/babysitters at home to handle any issues with the kids. If we have to work late or have things to do, the very last thing they need to worry about is being home.  We have a lady on our team who has a kid and is also pregnant, and while no one makes an issue of it, its still very clear that when her kid is sick, she needs to be home.  When planning events they mentioned happy hour after work, and she brought up it needs to be during work hours cause she has to go home after work, and also shes pregnant so there needs to be something other than alcohol.

Even though no one is saying anything negative, I can still see the frustration for her to know that accomodations have to be made/things are different because shes a mother.  And I will admit, I have felt thankful that my kid is older and can take care of herself because if we last minute need to work late, I can without issues.  When you constantly have to prove that having a family wont impede your ability to do your job as well as everyone else who also has a family but their wifes are handling it for them, its stressful af. Even if it is self induced stress.  I think she took that stress out on you, in the midst of what was probably a big presentation where she could prove her value, she would instead need to go home because she has to take care of her child.  

Thats not your fault, its not even the situation since you both equally take care of the child, but how it will come off at work and how people will percieve her at work to have to dip out on what to them was a big deal, probably is what caused her all this anxiety.

But...no youre NTA.  Her personal issues with how she is being percieved/wants to be perceieved at work have nothing to do with you.  And you literally saved a life so, theres that.",1573077743,f6qhzo7,t3_dsjvv9,t5_2xhvq

I appreciated that he trusted me to drive his car. He had picked me up at home, we spent the weekend together, he had to work so I used his car to drop him off, get some stuff done, then pick him back up again.  And I got his car detailed too which he loved.

Thing is...he had damaged or crashed every car he owned since I knew him. On our first date the entire side of his car was damaged from driving too close to a wall, and he crashed the next 3 cars he owned in the 5 years I knew him.  He ran into a pole about 2 days after getting a brand new car once.  And the reason his car was in the shop was because he damaged that one too.  So yeah...no.

He doesn't belittle her for her faith and she doesn't try to shut him down either. They let the kids decide, if they wanted to go to church with Mom they could, if they didn't, that was fine too. They grew up with both viewpoints and were free to decide for themselves. One of their kids is atheist and the other isn't. 

I'm atheist and raised kiddo as a single mom but still allowed her to decide. I didn't raise her to just blindly follow and be like me, thinking for herself is a huge deal to me. So when she asked about religion I shared factual info about what they believe as well as my own beliefs. We sat down together and read about Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism. She was invited and went to services with friends who were Baptist and LDS. She was totally free to research and learn about any faith and religion and she came to her own conclusions.

It comes down to not just expecting him to respect you, but you need to be willing to respect he has his point of view as well. Your kid might lean towards one way or another, or decide on neither and be of a different faith entirely.

8054,ponchoacademy,"There's sexual chemistry and emotional chemistry. Not to forget biological chemistry.

Sexual chemistry is just that feeling of wanting to get that person naked. Ever walk by someone and without even saying a word you're like, yeah I would do dirty things with them. That's sexual chemistry.  

Emotional chemistry is when someone just feels right, as you get to know them you have a great rapport, you feel like you get where the other is coming from and you just feel like there's a possibility for a great connection. Whether it's a sexual partner or the beginning of a great friendship, the emotional chemistry is there.

Then there's the biological chemistry. We literally give off certain scents that we unconsciously pick up on and can turn us onto or off of a person even though we can't put our finger on why. Like someone could be attractive and seem great but you just don't feel anything beyond, yeah they're cool... Or even, I don't like that person, no reason why...I just don't want to be around them. Meanwhile someone can be not quite your type physically or even be interesting yet you feel drawn to them and youre baffled why them?! That's biology on some deep primal level going, hey if you and this person have kids they have a good shot at being healthy and strong! Gee thanks primal instincts, you're no help at all.

Biological chemistry is kind of a jerk because it can draw you to people who are no good on an emotional or sexual level. But then so is sexual chemistry cause it can have people convinced this is the one, when all it is really is infatuation. Emotional chemistry is cool, just that it's harder to come by since that takes time to develop.

I'm leaving a ton out and putting my own skewed perspective in, but basically.. chemistry is complex. 

If you feel nothing at all for it around someone, have never felt off or never just felt good around a person, have never been attracted to or turned off by a person, have never felt connected to a person, then yeah you've never felt any chemistry. But unless there's a medical/mental thing going on here, I reckon you have felt something at some point.",1572976618,f6mprrj,t3_ds0poz,t5_su6ij

I'm too on guard looking for red flags and on alert for any bad behaviors that I want to avoid to get caught up in that innocence of youth when I couldn't even imagine someone so dreamy being anything but who they say they are.

That feeling comes later... As I get to know and start trusting someone, and my guard starts to drop, then I get that familiar feeling I got when I would pass by the cute guy in HS. I've been seeing a guy several months now, and lately, in those few seconds right before I see him I get butterflies. Over time the chemistry builds at about the same rate my wall shrinks. Sometimes he'll just look at me thoughtfully and smile, and I'll feel giddy and smile too...I don't know wtf I'm smiling about, I just feel amazing is all. But that took months.... On the first date I was giving him side eye trying to decide if I even want to see him again.

So yeah, it's not a problem that you're not feeling instant chemistry, it's that you're not a kid anymore, you know what's out there and you're no longer wearing your heart on your sleeve for anyone to grab and do whatever they want with it.

My socioemotional health is not dependant on whether or not I'm in a romantic/sexual relationship. And I can't imagine feeling like I can't function if I don't have a man. While I didn't date, I did decide to start making friends. Sometimes weeks, or even months would go by because I was working two jobs, exhausted, and while I wasn't able to be in a relationship, having friends to pick up the phone and talk or to every once in awhile go to bbqs and picnics which my daughter could come to too was great and fit within my limited time and finances.

I guess (and not saying it's you... Just people in general) it's so often considered the end of overs life and ability to do anything once they have kids. I never really felt that way... Though I made sacrifices, I don't regret any of it. Kiddo made my life better, doing my best for her ended up helping me get a better life than if I were trying to live my life in spite of being a mom. I know how it feels to know a parent thinks their life would've been better, they would've met someone, they would've had more freedom if only this kid wasn't in the way, and I know that personally, I wanted my kid to get more out of life than that.

I think at the end of the day, all any of us can do is the best with what we've got. I really hope that things pick up for you soon and I think it will. A friend of mine who is a single dad had a similar situation in that he had a hard time finding work. We met right after he got his degree, both of us were pretty broke and desperately looking for work. After several months of job hunting he went back for his master's. By a complete stroke of chance, we ended up working at the same company around the same time. Both of us making around 3-4x what we made when we met 3 years ago.

I had my daughter at 19, still don't have my degree (though now that she's going to college I'm planning to get mine now), but incrementally over the years, life got better bit by bit and yeah now it was all totally worth it. So don't feel defensive like you need to prove yourself, you don't. Especially considering you have your degree you are a million steps ahead of where I was in my 20s and will get to the point I'm at long before I got here. 

So I'm not saying you're not going your best. I'm just responding to your idea about just being alone for the next 15yrs and letting you know it doesn't have to be that way. There's no way in 15 years your life will be exactly what it is today. It will continue to improve and as it does, you'll start being able to do things you weren't able to before.

I don't regret making her secondary to finding a man. Im not saying this guy isn't trying to get his life in order, I'm saying get ones life in order -before- involving someone in their life and in their child's life. 

Being a parent is a responsibility. And while it's trying at times, it's not the end of the world. I viewed kiddo as inspiration to bust my butt, be as decent a role model as I could and I wanted to make sure she has a better life than I did. That was my priority, not dating. When I could date, I did. When I couldn't, I didn't. Was I lonely and upset about stuff at times? Often. Do I wish I could go back and go on more dates and spend more time finding a guy instead of be where I am now and be able to send kiddo to college and help her out financially and take back all the free time I spent with her developing a great relationship?

8067,ponchoacademy,"Sounds like a high intensity whirlwind relationship that burned out as fast as it took off. Meeting the kids and acting like a family that quickly and spending all your time together is not a great sign.

When a guy says he needs space, it usually means he wants to break up and it's an easy let down while he starts fading away. So to hear it, in his mind it means it's over.  I wouldn't doubt if he falls fast and hard and rushes to get the kids involved while being suffocating is a pattern for him and he just figured another woman has had enough. In another month he'll be introducing his kids to the next love of his life.

Communication is not really that great if he just assumed it was over and moved on. That he did it so quickly also would make me think he was infatuated, but not invested to any level that he would be concerned about the relationship enough to want to understand what's going on.

Besides all that, you're sick, and that he can't even care enough about you to understand you aren't feeling well and kept wanting all your attention and to be a priority over getting better and just dip because of that is pretty selfish. You're just not feeling well now, what if you have a serious medical issue down the line, will he cut loose because you don't have the strength and energy to entertain him?

The point of dating is to get to know someone to decide if this is someone you want to bring into your life, especially when kids are involved. That he is putting his desire for companionship over his responsibility as a parent is telling.

People are not ready to date for a variety of reasons, be it emotional, financial, or they just need to get thier life together first.

I wasn't in any shape to be in a relationship, had just gotten out of a terrible one, was more focused on getting my life back together and just wanted someone to have fun with. As much as we liked each other, we just never had romantic feelings for each other and eventually agreed we would back off sexually but remain friends if the other meet someone else, which is what happened.

My point is... Just because he enjoys being with you and the sex is great doesn't mean you have a future together. If he wanted you in that way, you wouldn't be a fwb. If you're genuinely satisfied with the way things are and the prospect of it never becoming more than what you have now, then it's all good. But if you're developing feelings for a guy who doesn't want a relationship with you, then might be time to step back. I'm not getting intense satisfaction vibe though, you're saying the words but seems like you want more than hes willing to offer. You want to be a couple and he wants a fwb.

From my experience, it's a conscious effort to make this an ongoing conversation. When I went on a date where a guy behaved inappropriately, I'd tell her what happened (details as age appropriate) and why it's not something to put up with and that I won't be seeing him again.

If something came up on the news, or she mentioned something at school, we'd discuss it, his to handle being in that situation, and what she can do to handle herself with respect.

When the song Blurred Lines came out, I was bursting with pride when she angrily asked me if I heard it, and sat me down to Google the lyrics, tearing it apart line by line how disrespectful it is to women.

Hey whole life I've taken her out for dinner, I didn't have much but it meant a lot to me to share experiences together. I couldn't afford to get her much but if I knew she really wanted something I'd save up and do everything I could to provide it. And I told her, don't ever let some guy say he can't afford to take you out or do nice things for you.  Everyone can afford effort and you're with it.

On her first date, the guy asked her where she'd like to go for dinner and she unapologetically chose her favorite restaurant. Not fast food. After dinner when he tried to kiss her, she felt zero obligation to and told him that age had a nice time but does not want to kiss him. Honestly, even after everything I taught her, I was still floored and was all woooah!!! And then what happened?! Lol She said he looked really disappointed, but she gave him a, I'm dead serious don't try me look, he thanked her for the date and that was that.

That she had no concept of not allowing anyone to disrespect her, she has no issues with what she is or is not worth. Any red flag and she hopes out. She also knows the importance of doing things with finesse... While she won't appear weak, she is not aggressive either. She's seen from my experience how a guy can get when his ego is bruised, I've been stalked and guys have gotten violent, so while she won't stick around, she handles things in a way to get away with as little drama as possible.

Meeting the family/the kids means nothing. Some people introduce their kids to everyone and they know to most people, meeting the family means it's serious, so they do that as a manipulation tactic.

I felt so betrayed and her response was, I don't know what kind of relationship you have... My son has never been monogamous so I figured you knew he had girlfriends. Okay lady.

8103,ponchoacademy,"My kid was against physical touch from day one. I remember getting all the advice not to hold my baby too much and thinking, no way I'm going to give them all the love they need!! Yeah, kiddo would get so mad. Her idea of love was, you can stand right over there I'm cool chilling in my crib.

So even though personal boundaries for kids wasnt really a thing people considered back then, I was very firm on it no kisses, hugs, holding her etc unless she reached for someone and if she retreated from anyone, times up. 

I shot down the idea anyone had a right to touch my kid in any way that made her uncomfortable. When she got older I taught her to say goodbye and wave, and as a teen  she started doing the half hug to people she's close to. Nowadays, my sister, her best friend and I are the only people she will reach out to hug. 

NTA. Forcing a kid, or anyone really, to kiss and hug someone when they don't want to and are uncomfortable with it would be rude and disrespectful. Not to mention it's teaching them they should allow people to do whatever they want to their bodies regardless of how it makes them feel. Pretty dangerous territory. It's possible to be courteous and say goodbye with manners that don't include kissing. Adults manage to do that, kids should be allowed to too.",1573667452,f7ewp8g,t3_dvp9un,t5_2xhvq

Of course he doesn't care about her. If he genuinely felt anything for her and was actually unhappy in his marriage, he would've had enough respect for her and his wife to end his marriage, then start a relationship with her. 

By not doing that and carrying on with the affair, he clearly demonstrated that he had no respect for commitment, meaning what he's doing with her, he would eventually do to #2 even if he did eventually leave his wife for her.

She started out focused on what was affecting me currently... She'd ask his my week went, if anything happened and then would ask really thoughtful questions to help me understand what set off my anxiety or depressive moods. She explained things like ruminating and how that was making my insomnia worse, taught me how to recognize I was about to sink and what coping and grounding techniques to try.

Once I was kinda getting a handle on what was happening in my life now, I started warming up to discussing things from my past. She diagnosed me,  helped connect the dots, explained medically how those things affected my brain, body chemistry and being able to understand what was going on and along with coping techniques she helped make me feel a lot less hopeless and I started feeling better than I ever had.

If he starts to treat her in a way she doesn't deserve, she will leave. At no point will she let him think she is going to put up with him as opposed to share her life with him.

Yeah some people date because they're looking for someone to have kids with but relationships aren't just about that, and can not be about that at all... Above all its about finding a companion and a guy should be motivated to continue to be a good man to a woman if he hopes will stick around and spend the rest of her life with him.",1573488370,f78999i,t1_f785qc5,t5_xaiot

8143,ponchoacademy,"Alright so I'm going to say... When I had a car, I expected a guy to at least have that too. I moved to a city with great transportation and chose my home in an area where theres grocery store, shopping, and restaurants in walking distance specifically to go car free. Every once in awhile I entertain the idea of getting a car, but traffic is so bad here, an Uber to work takes about an hour while the bus takes 40m (dedicated bus lanes) and I have no desire to sit in traffic everyday. I'd rather zone out and listen to podcasts.

Now that I'm car free though, I definitely would take issue with someone who is car free and couldn't function without one. When I smoked and someone would say they quit smoking but would like to bum one of me, I'd say you didn't quit smoking, you quit buying your own. That's what these guys I'm hearing about sound like, they didn't go car free they're just trying to find someone to bum rides from.

I commute to work by bus. It's no big deal to take an Uber to/from dates...I anyway don't want them to know where I live even we first meet. When I was moving in and doing big Ikea trips, I rented a uhaul for a day. When I go on road trips I rent a car. I've been seeing a guy a few months now and I haven't needed him to drive me anywhere. He's picked me up for dates, but that's it. Today going to pull my, I'm a girl so not expected to pick him up for dates card... But if I were a guy or hey, just among friends I'd have no problem renting a car for a day. My transportation budget is about $100/mth... So much less than having a car that I can swing getting a car to drive every once in awhile.

If someone is using you for a car, then even if they had a car they'd be taking advantage in another way.

8144,ponchoacademy,"Once while having the STD talk with a guy, he was shocked I made it to my 40s and never had an STD. Honestly, considering one of my exes cheated on me and admitted he didn't use protection with any of them I'm shocked too, but in the wow I'm lucky way, not in a I'm a weirdo way like that guy was looking at me like. I didn't even want to know his sexual history after that because when that vibe, I wasn't interested anymore.

The risks are out there, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with minimizing your exposure to avoid getting herpes or anything else. Just because most STDs are curable, doesn't mean I'm going to stop using condoms. I just looked it up and herpes is one of only 4 STDs that are not curable yet treatable (hep c, hiv, and hpv are the other 3). If I can avoid having a lifelong disease that I'm going to need medical care and medication for the rest of my life to manage it, yeah of course I'll do my best to.

Now that doesn't mean I look down on anyone with an incurable disease. It could've happened through no fault of their own. But just because they have it or is common to have, doesn't mean I should stop caring about protection or taking precautions. 

I do kiss on the first date, but not if they have any visible sores or anything to make me take pause. So yeah, I'm taking a risk but the risk is much less if there isn't an active outbreak and (knock on wood) no issues yet. Even though I use a condom, I still have sex with the lights on so I can see what I'm dealing with... And I totally have said hey, tell me about this if I see something amiss. 

So yeah, there's no 100%, I know I'm fortunate, but I do try to at least minimize my exposure. Also along with regular checkups, I also get tested ate every sexual partner for peace of mind.",1573475140,f77tk3h,t3_dufej9,t5_xaiot

Not even putting him down for it actually, just that it would be lost effort to practice on someone who you already know isn't at the stage of thier life you want them to be at. And being in a different stage of life, they're going to go into dating and how they treat women differently as well.

If you want a guy who is going to be able to take you out, pay for dinner, be able to travel, what have you...this guy likely won't be able to afford it even if just for himself moreless to treat you to it. Id also wonder if a guy at that age and still bartending is even thinking about his future. Like at any age, if he's working on his degree or something to improve his situation and has potential, thats one thing. But if that's his endgame, no way.

I'd advise against lowering your standards to spend any time or energy on a guy you already know you're not interested in fur whatever reason though. Whatever time you give him is taking away from time you could be meeting/spending time with someone who actually like. 

Every potential you date is practice. Practice cutting guys off the moment you see a red flag or incompatibility. Practice listening to your gut feeling. Practice being selective so that with each guy you get closer to what you do want.",1573473195,f77rz4b,t3_dumcpe,t5_xaiot

8150,ponchoacademy,"NTA... I grew up poor and had a rough time as a single mom, after bad experiences of my own I just avoided situations where kiddo needed money to do things with friends. However, in time she made friends who their parents were kind enough to insist kiddo was welcome and they took care of her because they didn't want her to be left out.

On the flip, whenever I did take kiddo and her friends out, as the person inviting them, I was prepared to pay for them. Sometimes kids brought money, sometimes they didn't. But in my care they were my responsibility.

You weren't prepared for that and spoke with her discretely, totally fine. She responded with entitlement and rudeness. While I appreciated other parents taking care of kiddo so she could participate, it was nothing I expected or demanded. Unless/until we established that kind of agreement, I either sent her with money or didn't send her at all. She probably was embarrassed and lashed out, but seriously, terrible way to handle it.

I think in future though be understanding that not all families have money to spare, even if it's just movies and a pizza. Maybe plan things at your place, or go to free family events like an afternoon at the musuem on family day etc (which is what I did with kiddo and her friends and they loved it... From elementary age to high school, they loved musuem day lol) or just be prepared for it that there may be a kid there who won't have the money.",1573408566,f74vfp0,t3_du77t6,t5_2xhvq

I didn't even date guys in my 20s when I was in my 20s, but it definitely shocked me that they were still coming after me. I'm literally old enough to be their mother! FML.

I think a lot of it is not only taking care of myself, but also confidence and just being more comfortable with myself. Guys on the other hand, I think are a lot more confident when they're younger and feel more self conscious as they age. Ironic because media makes a big deal out of women fighting the aging process, but I've met so many guys who are insecure because they aren't solid muscle with a full head of hair attracting young women anymore. While women's taste in men matures, men are stuck in their youth and really trying to compete with men 20+years younger than them.

Btw, I've never had issues with guys who have ED in their 40s and up. Many frustrating and frustrated guys in their 30s though.

First few dates are an introduction.. Where are they from, what are their goals in life, what kind of relationship are they looking for, what sort of things do you have in common..

There's a saying, when you first meet someone, you're meeting their representative. Until you get involved in someone's life and see how they are around friends and family, how they handle stress, what they live like, how they treat people you're just taking their word for it that they are a great guy. It's important to spend enough time getting to know someone to see if thier actions match their words.

The only other guy I lived with did all the laundry and we had a maid, though day to day we both tidied up after ourselves.

I guess being exposed to a guy like that when I was younger kinda made me see a guy being on top of household cleaning as the norm and the type of guy I gravitate towards.

I can't imagine being in that situation, writing that my friend was offered a position at company they've been wanting to with at for years, and deciding they owe it to me to decline it and lose that opportunity. I want to see my friends succeed, and being pissed off at them for getting ahead in life because it's inconvenient for me would be a pretty crappy way to treat a friend.

Your friend is an AH for not being upfront that he was interviewing at other companies and for taking the job knowing he would leave once he got an offer. It's different when it's just some random job, but that you, his friend, was involved in helping him get the job he should've had the consideration to not take it knowing he would move on once his job hunting efforts started paying off.

At the end of the day though, even though I'd be mad at the situation and the bind I'm in at work, I wouldn't get mad at a friend knowing full well theyve wanted to work at this company for years and expect them to blow that off to make me happy.

Taking the good with the bad, I can admit I didn't know it all. I never felt like no one could tell me anything I don't already know and I had nothing to learn. Sometimes there was good advice in there that helped, and the stuff I didn't agree with I just tossed into my mental trash bin.

There are varying levels of depression, and I'm very sure that doing these things are really helpful to get people out of a rut or feeling sad, but when you're dealing with serious depression, these things are like trying to pay a $1k rent with a dollar a week.

I've had moments where I couldn't get out of bed, period. Even getting up to go to the bathroom was not happening... Never hit the point of urgency though since I barely drank anything and would go days without eating. 

It took hitting the very bottom before I realized I needed help and made a phych appt. Even that took me about a week to mentally prepare myself to make a phone call, and I almost didn't go because the idea of having to get clean, dressed and leave me home after do many months made my anxiety went through the roof.

It took therapy and meds to help me be able to start functioning, and also to be able to see the signs of when I'm slipping into a hole and do something about it so that I don't get as bad as I did. My depression doesn't make me feel sad, it makes me feel nothing so thinking happy thoughts doesn't help. It's not due to external stuff, so changing my environment, going out, taking a shower, going through the motions of being normal, that doesn't help either.

What helped is getting professional medical help.  If you have a headache you can treat yourself with some Motrin and it'll get better, but that Motrin isn't going to help if you have a tumor. So for anyone feeling bad because just making yourself get up and feel better isn't working, don't... There are some things we can't just take care of by ourselves, but once you get the help you need, then you'll be on a better path and then these things you can do yourself will come into play to help maintain your mental health.",1574445586,f8bug5s,t3_dzypl1,t5_2qh1i

If she went out after school, she'd let me know whose house she was at and around when she'll be home. If they decided to go somewhere she'd send a quick text to update me.

Likewise, if I go on a date I'd let her know where I'm having dinner and around when I figure I'll be home. If I'm running late I'll shoot a quick message because she's always waited up to make sure I got home safe.

I didn't need to track her because we respect each other. She knew how worried she'd be if anything happened and she had no idea where I was and didn't want me to feel that way either.

A lot of my projects started out as a generic tutorials, but then I kept adding new features just from thinking... It would be cool if it could do xyz and learning what I need to make it do that.

Something I realized interviewing here is pretty much everyone has Amazon, Google or Microsoft on their resume, so every company here can be picky. This city is full of talent and experience.

I also found that smaller companies are not the ones giving new devs a chance. They have smaller teams so every person needs to hit the ground running and generally don't have the resources in place to train a new dev. I couldn't get an interview with any of the smaller companies, start ups just ignored me. It was the top N who I got interviews with and one of them hired me based on potential.

The longer you're with someone, the more prone one is to rationalize how much has been invested in the relationship, and esp with marriage, the hassle of leaving.

Same as if the dominant woman offers to go dutch and the submissive woman expects he'll pay. 

Being submissive or dominant is a personality trait, and has little to do with confidence to assert yourself.

While a submissive woman may be likely to offer dutch because she's a pick me girl, a dominant woman may want it because it gives her the feeling of control and letting him pay would make her feel like he's taking care of her, or doesn't want to feel like she owes him anything.

While a dominant woman may expect he pay because she wants a man who will scramble at her feet to appease her (the wording sounds bad, but I mean wants to be treated like a queen which isn't bad at all), a submissive woman may expect he pay because she's traditional and wants a man who fits gender roles and will take care of her.

Though the motivation behind it may be different based on someone's personality, the end result is the same.

8222,ponchoacademy,"You didn't really mention anything you've said to her, what her feelings are about you dating or this guy in particular. That's what I'm curious about.

Before an introduction, I would talk to my daughter about the guy and ask her if she's ready to meet him. Afterwards, we'd do a recap, I'd ask what she thought of him and if she'd be willing to see him again to make sure she's comfortable around him.

I grew up with a single mom and hyper aware of how difficult it is to have to be around some guy I can't stand, that creeps me out, that makes me feel uncomfortable and I'm forced to anyway because my mom is trying to do the family vibe. I wanted my mom to date, but involving me in that when the guy made me feel awful, yet not taking into consideration how I feel about it or even ask, or even listen when I said I don't want to, made me feel like I didn't matter and he was more important than I was. Eventually I didn't like like any guy she dated just because I knew my feelings wouldn't matter anyway and I'm going to have to play family regardless. 

So with my daughter, I was very clear with her, she's my family and we're a package deal. It doesn't matter how much I'm into a guy, if she has a bad feeling around him, I'm not going to force her to spend time with him and I'm going to take that into consideration as I date someone. I don't do insta family either. Just like how it takes me time to decide if I like a guy and spend more time with him as I get to know him, I extend the same courtesy to my daughter to slowly integrate him into her life as she gets more comfortable around him.

For the most part, her attitude is, if you like him I'll give him a chance, because she's secure in the knowledge that she matters in all this. When she says she doesn't want to be around someone and acts anxious about it, I hit the brakes and find out what's going on. No relationship with some guy is worth weakening the relationship with my daughter, and I keep lines of communication open because I care how she feels.

8231,ponchoacademy,"It's not a matter of the job you have or how much you have in the bank, but whether or not someone can see themselves being comfortable living that life.

I could see it if you are a vagabond in the true sense of the word, driving all over the country, adventure on the road. I've seen some beautiful modified vans outfitted with custom sized furniture and all the amenities for full time travel, though they tend to be just big enough to be comfortable for one and it's hard to date since they're never in one place that long, unless they meet someone else who also lives on the road full time and they caravan.

On the other hand, if youve parked your van somewhere and just living in it while rooted in one city for work, with a mattress in the back, your stuff in a bunch of bins and privacy curtains taped in, that's not an adventure, it's a means to an end to sacrifice comfort in exchange for saving as much money as possible.

I would have no problem with a guy who travels full time on the road because I love travel and adventure, and to see someone living the dream would be pretty exciting as opposed to a guy who just lives in a van cause it's the cheapest way to live.

For short term flings and casual relationships I guess would be fine, since if she doesn't want to have sex in a van you can just go to get place. But for something long term, she will wonder how she's supposed to fit in your life.",1573857385,f7m9gkn,t3_dwvcm4,t5_su6ij

8234,ponchoacademy,"No prob on the links, I just grabbed a few, though I grew up in FL and knew that there was recent history of the sugarcane company still using slaves to work the fields. I do think that when slaves are not told that they are in fact free, and the same tactics of entrapment, abuse and rape are used to keep them in line, then it's not really slavery in the modern, I slave away at work to pay my bills kind of way.

When someone is sufficiently secluded, cannot read or write, was born into this life that thier parents and the parents before them lived, with no idea there is another way of life or that there is freedom out there...and slave owners who aren't suddenly going to get behind the rights of what they consider property, suffer financial loss and lose the family business out of the kindness of their hearts, It's not too crazy to see how this can happen. 

In the early 1900's, these are people who were upholding tradition with the idea they had a right to their property. People don't just stop doing things when it becomes illegal, they find ways to keep doing whatever it is they want to do... And the attitudes towards people of color took an incredibly long time to change, even to this day in 2019 there are people who still don't believe we're equal.

I grew up in the 80s in a little podunk city in FL, there wasn't even a high school, it was in the next city over, and I was the only black kid in my preschool and elementary. If I told you what both kids and adults said and did to me, you'd say no way. A lot of weird stuff happens in secluded areas where people aren't and don't care to be exposed to opening their minds to a different way of thinking and manner of treating people.

Today I can joke that I grew up ""Where the hills have eyes"" but for real, believe it or not, things were still pretty screwed up for slaves for quite awhile even after they were supposed to be freed, and I'm pretty sure in another 100 years people will look back on our modern day in complete disbelief that after 150 years, race relations was still an ongoing issue.

That's not true. Pretty much no men under the age of 30 want to actually commit to one woman, unless she's far more attractive than him and then he commits reluctantly in order to get steady sex. 


For women under 30, pretty much all men are offering the exact same thing. If literally ALL women were offering you sex with no commitment, which ones would you fuck? And before you say women should just not have sex, that isn't realistic because human beings enjoy sex.


The difference between the man and the woman in your scenarios is that the man who's fucking around in his youth could probably enter into decent relationship if he **chose** to. Because women are mostly looking for relationships, but men aren't offering them. Not even the ugly ones. That's why the stable, boring guy is still single in his 30s or 40s.

For instance, female ""hypergamy"". Does it exist? Sure, in some women it does. It exists because women are the ones who have a lot to lose when it comes to reproduction. It's natural to want your offspring to have a father that can provide. Is it a rule? No. Most women in today's world are NOT looking for a man who makes way more money than them. 


The male version of hypergamy, which is men wanting a partner far more attractive and younger than them, is way more common than female hypergamy. 


Also, ""the wall"". Most people look their best between the ages of 18 to 35. A woman's looks don't just suddenly plummet at 30. They don't suddenly plummet at any time. HUMANS in general age gradually. Period. Men do not age like wine, and neither do women.

b) Finding a good man gets dramatically harder as women get older, because men care enormously about a woman's looks.

I like how they basically just admit that men are shallow and will probably cheat on you as soon as you're older than 30 and have had kids, but we're still supposed to be chasing after them like they're a prize. 

&gt;e) {and this is the big one}, if you're a heterosexual woman, you may well be desperately unhappy if you're unable to find a man and have kids. Certainly some women (and indeed men) are cut out for the solo lifestyle, but I'm almost certain it's a minority. So if you're straight and well-adjusted, **you probably should take *what men want* into consideration, just as men take *what women want* into consideration** when planning their lives.


Lmao no they fucking don't. If they did, they'd quit being lazy porn addicted misogynists. Also since men want 18-23 year olds, how can women just magically stay at that age forever? Lol. 


&gt;We don't really discuss any of this as a society. I see the same advice being given to girls time and time again - pursue power, pursue money, be sexually liberated, don't settle - and I frankly think it's not conducive to happiness for women. Actually, I think it's probably decent advice for men (for whom money, power, and age aren't obstacles to finding a partner), but we're just giving the same advice to girls without accounting for the fact that they, unfortunately, are subject to male preferences - which are different to women's.


This whole comment is making me want to puke. 


&gt;TLDR: We give the same advice to girls that we used to for boys, without regard for their different needs. I think these women have been misled by our educational and cultural system, and they're desperately unhappy because of it.

9310,totitiganiisuntgunoi,"&gt;A high value man doesn‚Äôt care about spending money on you. 

Actually I would put it a different way, a high value man *does* care in the sense that he feels glad to be providing for you and happy to make your life a bit better. In fact truly high value men will go out of your way to make experiences especially nice and interesting and to make you feel really special as you deserve to feel. At that point simply paying for the dates is just a no-brainer.

On the flipside, I agree that is is nothing short of embarrassing when men are such scrooges or so broke to date that they can't even do the floor level decency of paying for the date they took you out on. Sadly though some of these men are so far gone that they don't even feel embarrassment. In these cases, I actually think a small dose of shaming (while keeping you safe of course) is sometimes good medicine. If they dare ask you to pay you can look them squarely in the eye and say: ""do I really look like the kind of woman to pay for my own date."" If you don't like such confrontation you can communicate the message over text as well. Of course, simply blocking such pieces of trash is also fine since many of these man-children will refuse to learn no matter how patiently women may try to teach them basic manners.",1574776205,f8sblp8,t1_f8sa0kg,t5_xaiot

The lesson here of course is that men by and large are not just trash today, but have also been trash in the past and will also be trash in the future. While social conditioning has a role, toxic masculinity and immaturity are hardwired in the vast majority of men. It's for this reason that women's selection plays such an important role.

If you have neither one of these qualities, this is a recipe for long term unhappiness.

However you should try to get these answers in a seamless natural way, without making it seem like an interview. Watch not only his answers, but also his behavior.

So for example, somewhere in the conversation you can ask about his job/education and his future professional goals. That should be a direct clue to how much money is making now and how much he may earn in the future. But also watch what he does. Did he pick a nice place for both of you to enjoy a good meal? Does he pay for everything without even flinching? You want to make sure that he is not just capable of providing, but is happy to do so.

With regard to the second point, you can even gauge that before the date. Did he seem responsive to your messages at a reasonable pace. Did he take the initiative to make plans with you? After the date, does he follow up and suggest future high quality dates in a reasonably short time frame.

The last point is of course the easiest one to address since the chitchat flows most easily about things a person is passionate about. So there just feel free to go through a laundry list of hobbies, music/book interests, etc., to look for common ground.",1574448849,f8bzel5,t3_e054ex,t5_xaiot

In any case, I think this is a situation where OP is not likely to get good answers by asking internet strangers who are not familiar with the detailed dynamics of their relationship. I think it would be a much course of action to have a calm and frank conversation with his partner, including about the possibility of a prenup if he seeks reassurance.",1574105539,f7z5brg,t1_f7ymdau,t5_2r0cn
9355,totitiganiisuntgunoi,"In general I think that prenups make sense when there is a huge disparity in wealth upon marriage. Having said that too many people have somewhat misguided ideas about how they work in practice. A good and reasonable prenup will aim to protect both parties in a marriage. So for example for the wealthier party (the man in this case), a good prenup should make clear how much of the property and wealth he brings in would remain his alone. At the same time, a good prenup should also recognize that the woman can jeopardize her financial stability by entering into a marriage if this may lead her to have to take a larger burden of housework and potentially to have children. As a result, good prenups will also have reasonable stipulations about how the woman will be protected in case of a divorce, ideally on a sliding scale that would take into account the length of the relationship and whether there are children. Finally when it comes to income *during* the marriage, that naturally is treated as joint marital income. 

If you frame the discussion in these terms, you are much more likely to get a response that may put both of you on the same page and reassure you. Financial issues are one of the most common roots of problems in relationships, but you can avoid many of these problems if only you are willing to talk about these matters openly and honestly.",1574102383,f7yxywr,t1_f7ymy5l,t5_2r0cn
9356,totitiganiisuntgunoi,"My personal preference is something like the personality version of ""speak softly but carry a big stick."" In general I like my personality to be feminine and kind. But that does not mean that I am malleable. In life and relationships I don't just expect but demand:

1. At work I expect competitive pay for the value I provide and recognition of my work.
2. I expect basic respect from everyone, period. Any person who cannot do that gets cut out.
3. In relationships I expect the man to pay for all dates and the majority of shared expenses. But I am NOT looking for a man who thinks that his responsibility to provide somehow makes him my superior.

9357,totitiganiisuntgunoi,"A lot of these articles are kind of clickbaity as in realities studies are somewhat mixed about how the happiness of married women compares with the happiness of unmarried women. However if you look at the data more closely, you actually find more agreement about specific parts that are actually more useful to think about such as

1. Women who report a high level of satisfaction in the marriage are definitely likelier to be happier overall compared to the population at large.
2. A large source of unhappiness in marriage comes from women shouldering an overwhelming burden in terms of house work and child rearing.
3. Financial issues are often a key driving force to unhappiness

For me the takeaway of these studies is not that marriage is inevitably losing proposition for women. Quite the opposite in fact, a good marriage can enrich women's lives and make both partner better and happier overall. However for women to benefit from marriage they need men who can and are willing to provide for them, respect them, and share domestic responsibilities in an equitable fashion.",1574096021,f7yj4i5,t3_dy4nyl,t5_xaiot

As a result he uses you for emotional validation, distressing you in the process, while having no intention of giving back.

9361,totitiganiisuntgunoi,"Exactly, which is why it's so important in my opinion to date multiple men. Especially after coming out of a bad relationship too many women fall for a guy who is simply nice to them, nothing more. All of a sudden they start chasing him because he is such a great guy when in reality all he does is *the bare minimum* to not be a piece of shit. 

But ladies, you don't just deserve the bare minimum, you are queens who deserve the best. So date multiple men but be super picky. Those men who fail to even show don't treat you with basic respect, refuse to take your time seriously, don't invest time and resources into high quality dates and are unwilling to foot the bill every single time, they are low value garbage and should be discarded ASAP like the trash that they are. 

With the other men that are at least worthy of your time, move slowly and deliberately and try to steel your heart in the early stages of courtship. Force yourself to minimize your feelings and critically assess which of the decent men you are seeing can offer you the most in terms of what you are looking for in a partner and in life. ONLY then decide to really start reciprocating and starting to commit more with your time and affection. And even then, always, always remember that you still have other options and if the relationship does not fully satisfy you, it's always possible to say NEXT and find a man who is truly worthy of you.",1574009593,f7u1555,t1_f7tt32f,t5_xaiot

If a man lacks respect for women (either consciously or unconciously) and then gets his ideas of sex based on porn consumption, it can create very unhealthy expectations or in worse case scenarios a dangerous man.

I'm sorry to be harsh, but I think this is the kind of ""wishful thinking the sidebar warns against, because it is neither realistic nor helpful for a community that is about being your best. Can you in all honesty say that [this woman](https://i.imgur.com/LzbzhsS.jpg) or [this woman](https://i.imgur.com/yLarXVR.jpg) is at least a 7/10 and pretty to boot? If so I would say that scale is worse than useless.

The goal should be for every woman to be the best she can. Taking care of your mind but also your body by abstaining from hard drugs, excessive alcohol, and staying fit is a key part of that. Likewise using the right makeup and well-fitting clothes are other strategies that can enhance your value and make you stand out from the crowd. No, not every woman at this moment is in a shape that is really beautiful or has the best chance of attracting high value men. And if you are complacent that won't change.

9374,totitiganiisuntgunoi,"This advice can apply equally to women looking for relationships. Depending on what I am looking for at the moment, I divide the men looking to date me into two groups 1) those I am seriously interested in and 2) people I am willing to go on a date if the offer is good enough. 

The first group I only focus on when I am seriously looking for a serious relationship. In that case I still expect them to pay for the date and make it worth my time. However if I really like the guy I am not going to be super picky about the restaurant we go to let's say.

The second group on the other hand, is a transient cloud of rotating guys I keep at an arm's length. These are people who I think I might enjoy a good meal with but have little interest in seriously dating. In the case of these men I will only accept to meet if the place they pick is sufficiently good that I am enticed to risk being bored for a couple of hours in exchange for some great food. In most cases, I won't see these guys past a second date or so and will then allow a new men to fill the ranks into the rotation so that I always have candidates ready to go when I'm in the mood to try a nice restaurant when I'm bored.",1573776479,f7jffnm,t3_dwh21b,t5_xaiot

Sadly, I think it would be dangerous for young women to think that the same will be true for them. In most cases if you start out dating a guy who's working in a grocery store in his mid twenties, he will still be working in a grocery store in this thirties and onwards. Unless you want to end up with a dustie down the road, I think it's a much better strategy to only date people who already have financial resources, or are clearly a step away (e.g. a person wrapping up law school). 

I think the sidebar puts it best, especially in the early stages of dating we have to be ruthless in evaluating men. In this sense, starting a relationship with a man who is not financially secure and cannot even begin to take care of you is in most cases a bad bet. It's an especially poor choice when you consider that if you really are a high value woman, then there are throngs of high value men who are ready to treat you like the queen you are right now!",1573758178,f7iei8r,t1_f7i5i09,t5_xaiot

To me investing in potential is a losing proposition. You can pour your time and energy (or even money lol) while they are growing as a person, only to have them throw you away once they make it.

Even if there is not initial physical attraction between the parties, lust can eventually develop from the emotional connection. Firm boundaries must be asserted when men and women are friends and one or both of the parties wish to remain friends. 

Many wives and girlfriends would be uncomfortable with their partners having very close female friends. The same holds true for husbands/boyfriends. 

I much prefer platonic female friends. I can bond with them on a much deeper level than male friends because it does not open up any romantic doors (as a straight woman).

9502,trouble_,"&gt;A few months into us dating I had a feeling that things were off but I couldn't put my finger on it

You need to learn to listen to your gut. When you find yourself feeling off it's often a sign to slow down and take inventory

&gt;his relationship with his ex girlfriend was fire and that he wanted to take her around the world and that didn't come naturally with me. He said he was only giving me 50% of his efforts and that I would be shocked to see how he was when he was with his ex.

This is where you should have left. This means he didn't take your relationship seriously. You do not deserve to be second banana

&gt;he often thought that I needed to be with a loser boyfriend

Wtf??? That makes my blood boil.

&gt;all he wants to do is relax and not think that his girlfriend wants to grab his dick every 2 seconds

Your needs are valid and important. Anybody that doesn't respect them can kick rocks

&gt;why can't he give me the same effort that he gave her

Because he didn't have respect for you. That's nothing to do with you and everything to do with him

&gt;I began going above and beyond for him, putting him first and me last

This is the opposite reaction you should have had. He did not deserveto be rewarded for treating you poorly

&gt;always wanted him to do the 'little things' for me

Listen to a person's actions

&gt;We broke up with him stating that my insecurities were making him feel trapped and that he wants to be with a confident woman

He was doing everything to destroy your confidence

&gt;I've never blamed myself so much for the failure of a relationship. I thought I was going to marry this man

You dated a jerk. There's a lot of jerks out there and maybe you didn't know how to look for red flags. That's not necessarily your fault. However you need to use this as a learning opportunity. Fool me once shame on you... Fool me twice shame on me.

&gt;I want him back

No you do not. Repeat after me. No you do not want him back

&gt;no one wants to hear about my break-up anymore

They have probably been saying all the things i am and are feeling like a broken record. You absolutely need to let it go. Move forward in your life.

&gt;My ex is not a horrible guy, he's going to make someone incredibly happy one day and it sucks that it's not me

You dodged a lifetime of misery. It's a shame it lasted as long as it did because it's wrecked your self esteem. He's not a good person. A good person doesn't treat people the way he did. His next victim will likely be in for similar treatment.

&gt;he made me so unbelievably happy

When?? Everything you described sounds miserable.

&gt; I feel a constant emptiness in my heart

That's any breakup. It's normal. It will pass. And this is why it's important to choose your partner carefully next time.

&gt;am terrified to ever get into another relationship in case I ruin it again

You didn't ruin the last one. You were mistreated and taken advantage of. I cannot stress this enough that next time you need to be careful. Don't rush into anything. Don't let just anybody into your heart without vetting them carefully. Educate yourself on the red flags in emotionally and physically abusive relationships. Learn how to enforce your boundaries.

&gt;Exactly. She should not be. If he is *politely* asking if she can chip in, should she play a bitch? A poor woman?

I can only speak for myself. If a man asked me politely i would chip in because i wouldn't want to make him feel bad. But i probably would not want to go on a date with him again. I would feel he thought i wasn't worth the effort.

Sure if she respects him she will chip in but it won't make her feel wanted
