I have to admit that I did peruse TRP when it was new.  I found it manipulative, but I did see why certain men were drawn to it and I actually liked the self-improvement aspects. That's why I really find it hard to understand why men (and some women) on reddit have this deep, visceral hatred for the sub, instead of trying to understand our perspective. Dating is different for men and women. We take different risks when we date, and generally we have different goals, relating both to our biology and societal expectations. 

What I find mind-blowing is that it seems like the FDS tenet most guys have a problem with is ""he should pay for the date(s)."" I haven't been on many dates, but I can tell you - every single guy I went out with has paid for me. I offered every single time and literally not one took me up on the offer - LVM or HVM, ""Chads"" or ""betas"". Every man wanted to pay. It's a customary part of dating. If one guy chooses not to do it, he stands out like a sore thumb to the women he dates. 

What's more concerning though - is when guys on reddit will post something related to our desire to be be treated well or better by men and they call us entitled, saying in the same breath we're ""spinsters"" or ""delusional 5s."" It's disappointing because don't we deserve kindness and respect, regardless of what we look like? Does a woman who is a 5 not deserve equal treatment in a relationship compared to a 10? Does an older woman not deserve respect compared to a younger one? Rhetorical questions, because of course not. Not in the world we live in. 

One of my posts on here was cross-posted to a certain male-centric sub. They chose to focus on our discussion that average or below average men can't get casual sex easily and have to offer something else - whether it's a relationship/commitment, or something monetary or resource-related - instead of just their physical appearance to get sex. THAT'S what they were most upset about. That they couldn't get casual, ""free"" sex as easily as Chad. That they had to perform the horrifying task of emotional labor or sexual exclusivity before we let them fuck us. It's just disappointing that they don't want to put in the effort to be more attractive or desirable to women. I would say that most of the women here would probably be more than happy with a kind, attentive ""beta"" (who took care of himself and put in effort) than a fuckboy Chad, but they don't like to believe that shit. Like 80% of the posts here are about leaving your fuckboy in 2019. How do they not see that FDSers are LITERALLY LEAVING CHADS? Instead of rising up to a better, more desirable man, they just choose to whine about FDS.",45932,I find it really disappointing that this sub is so hated on Reddit,0,,

My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. I love him a lot and want to marry him one day, but sometimes I feel like he just doesn’t know how to treat me properly. 

He is supportive, caring and treats me well. However he does things, and doesn’t do things, that I feel like are a result of me being his first girlfriend. 

1. He never compliments me ever. The only time he’s told me I “look beautiful” is when we first started dating. 

2. When I try to get emotional with him he kind of ignores/dances around the subject. Recently we took the 5-Love-Languages quiz and learned what we respond to. I told him how I’ve been actively doing actions that match his top two and he ignored that message. 

3. He does immature things sometimes like blows my spot up in public saying things like “she does this” or “She never does that” around mutual friends. Most recent immature thing is we were at a bar and I bent over to grab something and he pushed my head towards his penis as if asking for head. But we were at a bar...

4. He has made inappropriate comments to my friends telling one “You could eat my hotdog” and “Is that what you guys wear to the gym” referencing girls being essentially naked on a tv screen. 

5. Seems reluctant to trying/doing intimate things like watching porn together and just talking to each other. Grated we’ve been together a long time so sometimes it’s hard to have a conversation because we know everything about each other already. 

Now collectively this probably sounds so shitty and you want to say “break up with him” but I’m genuinely curious if anyone has ever been in a similar circumstance and found a remedy to the situation or have any ideas for me to bring these feelings up in the nicest way possible. Should I look into couples therapy? Does he just have intimacy issues? It’s hard for him to be vulnerable. I almost want to tell him “I need more emotionally from you or else.” I just genuinely feel like he doesn’t actively try to make me feel special but I actively try to learn new things/keep the relationship spicy. Another thought I have often is “If he did this to any other girl they would leave him” or like I find myself thinking I wish he would treat me like I’m a new girl he would like to impress. All advice welcome.",45914,"I feel like because I’m my boyfriends first girlfriend, he doesn’t know how to treat me. (Together for 5 years)",0,,

I saw this man at work and thought I wanted him inside me, so I texted him asking him to a bar and we did it that night. To be fair I wasn't looking for a real relationship, but over the course of a few months we became very close and fell in love. Things are very serious now, we live together and are exclusive.

I acted like a total pickmeisha to get him to this level (he asked me to move in at least, not vice versa), but maybe a slightly ""noble"" pickmeisha? I learned how to cook so I could show him that I was wife material, but I also feel like more of a well rounded adult now that I can cook things that don't come in a box with directions. I quit my occasional drug use and stopped drinking to show him that I was responsible and cared about my health. Most of the things I did improved my life in the process and made me a more HVW.

Luckily, I already had the avoiding LVM part of FDS down before discovering it. My boyfriend isn't perfect but I would say he is fairly high value. He is generous, sensitive, hardworking, loyal, and very attractive. Only complaint is that he doesn't do much housework, but we do have an agreement that I will be doing more than half until my new job starts and we will do 50/50 from then on out.

However, I still feel uneasy knowing that I used such bad tactics to get to this point and may have set a bad precedent.

Or sometimes, in conversation, it seems as though, males, and even some females, do not see the importance or depth of what you have to offer.

Do not be afraid of coming off a bit stand offish, a bit bold to conserve your energy and peace. There will be topics and conversation points that are practically set up to exploit us and we must learn to recognize them: by knowing ourselves, taking that seriously, and knowing those around us.

Always be aware of your interests, your likes and dislikes and boundaries. Never tolerate a crossed boundary, so long as you act on it at the right time. Know what you are willing to discuss and what doesn’t fly. See yourself in a realistic way to ultimately put your best self forward. 

Honestly, while not compromising your integral sweetness or humility, learn to conceal and share those things with those already trusted, and don’t be afraid of putting on a straight face, not being an emotional scapegoat, not laughing at dumb jokes, I don’t think it’s funny. lol

Seriously, next time someone’s acting like too much of an ass for your mood at the time or just blatantly not taking you seriously, just look at them dead in the eye, kinda like they just farted out loud with no regard, and say nothing. They will 99% of the time listen to themselves blow out of steam and hear how stupid they sound and probably look. It’s basic psychology. Also, learn how to just walk the fuck away in mid sentence. Learn to read others so well, you can diffuse a interaction as soon as it starts. Why waste time? 

Basically, be a bit of a bitch when necessary and learn not to question it so much. Don’t be over the top, but don’t live your life stifled or scripted. Be you. Keep your beauty and love. Just reserve it. Take the space you need. You’re doing something big with it.",45826,Take yourself seriously and let it show that you’re serious,0,,

Do you think a man asking that early means he’s LV and not relationship-minded? Or do you think it’s just their reaction to the “no” that matters, and that it’s possible they want a relationship but are interested in having sex early on because relationship-minded men still want sex/want to make sure there is sexual compatibility.

I had/ have this idea that if you want something, you should pursue it wholeheartedly. But that's not incompatible with FDS. More on that later. 

A former FWB once told me if a woman ever came on to you, you should go for it because otherwise it's an opportunity for sex that goes wasted. This was a gut who had a constant rotation of partners and was still bitter about getting rejected at times. I was at peak Pickmeisha back then and I've learned my lesson since. 

In this point of my life I was active on dating apps, sending first messages and scouring every profile I could for some sliver of compatibility. I worked too damn hard for a woman on OKC and had little to show for it. My desperation probably showed in my messages. Oh well. 

The one ""success"" I had was with a different FWB (see a pattern?) Who flat out told me he didn't want anything serious and I stupidly thought by hanging around and being nice I could change his mind. We'd talk a lot, and not just about sex. He was an extreme introvert and I helped encourage him to overcome his shyness. He did... and found himself a new girlfriend and disappeared. Not a new story. 

Looking back I've noticed that for the most part, the men in my life who treated me best (including my current partner) were the ones who pursued me. The ones I approached weren't really into me but were more than happy for the attention while they kept their options open. 

On ""go after what you want,"" I still believe in that. But my wants now aren't the same as they were in my early twenties. Back then I just wanted someone. Now the bar is much higher. If you want someone who pursues and treats you like a queen, you're not going to find that by chasing fuckboys online and wondering why they haven't asked you out yet.

Lost a friend over a LVM. 

I went on two dates with a LVM. Now let me state where I went wrong first: 

I made the mistake of offering to pay for dinner on our second date because we talked about equality and going dutch. Ladies, I know. Never again will I do that. Trust me my standards have changed drastically.

Now onto him. When I proposed paying for dinner he said he was fine with it with a smile, but when the time came he took the check. I reminded him our agreement, he got visibly upset and said no. I didn’t like that because despite my mistake, what he said he would do didnt line up with his actions. I promise it wasn’t a power move on my part. 

He and I decided we wouldn’t see each other again, and I told her my reasoning was for what I just stated above. She then told me I was being unreasonable and made all sorts of excuses for him. Even “he could have had a neurological moment!” ?????

This ended up being a 6 hour argument about MY standards and it all happened during the first night of my birthday trip. And it was just me and her. I learned another lesson and I will never engage in combat like that ever again about what makes me feel safe and comfortable. 

During that unnecessarily long argument, she decided to bring up a conversation we had in the middle of our planning session weeks prior. I’m surprised while she tells me that when we were talking about what I wanted in a partner how I was being outrageous then. 

What did I tell her?

“I’m working on attracting a partner who can take charge of their healing. A person who can recognize when they’re needing help and not internalize it all but see asking for help as a form of strength. I know he exists, because I’m doing that work.“

“I’m doing well for myself now, but I still have more goals I plan on achieving. My dreams will be supported and I’ll support his, and I will have a partner who is financially secure. Even if he doesn’t love where he is now, he doesn’t blame the world for his current circumstances and is working toward that goal.”

Her: Dont you think you’re being too high-maintenance?

She hated all that and even told me my “men are trash” mindset is unhealthy. I was so confused because not only did I think that was a common sentiment among women, but also she said the same shit about men/is still in a long-standing dead end relationship that she was always asking me advice about/and had the nerve the next day for us to meet up with her gay best friend (he was such a sweetheart) and talk to him about trash men and say men were trash!!!!



When she called me HM, I took it as an insult then, but being high-maintenance doesn’t mean you’re just an unrealistic bitch. I’m a bitch with my emotional boundaries in order. I’ve been thriving since dropping that satellite of judgment. People can stay mad or catch up and get with the program they envy so much. Sis was projecting HARD, and when our mutual friend told me what he thought about her actions, I felt loved and he was proud of me for how far I had come and for sticking to my standards because I wasn’t hurting anyone. &lt;&lt;&lt; keep those friends! 

Grieve the losses of these friendships, or even create space and distance for you to determine when you decide to associate with them again. 

It didn’t feel great to lose a friend I had known for almost a decade, but I worked through that pain and let time heal that wound. I can now wish her well without wanting to tell her what I really felt. I can even let go of the fact that she cancelled the following friendsgiving afterwards because of me (mutal friend confessed this) and for the fact that she never returned the shoes she borrowed from me at the end of our trip. And lemme tell you, I could hold a helluva grudge. But it’s the anger and guilt that ages you. I’m staying well slept and moisturized!

I’ve made affirmations that I only permit my gravitaional pull to accept people who do the internal work or else they will be expelled from my spaces of abundance. You have to champion for you especially when others try to cut your head to feel taller. Not for 6 hours though lol!",45714,Drop ppl who tell you to endure a LVM,0,,

Nice handbags consists not only of good design but good quality( high grade leather and construction).  Not only looks in men but their personality matters equally also.

“Dear Men.
We miss you.
Deeply.
When women gather together in circles, we tell stories of how much we long for you. Crave you. Pray for you to rise and meet us here. We mourn your missing presence. In our childhoods. In the homes we’ve built without you. In our beds.
We hold hands and beg God to set you free from whatever keeps you from standing at our sides. Right here.
Here In intimacy.
In integrity.
In wholeness.
In freedom.
The places where you are caught in dishonesty, shame, fear, addiction, we grieve and rage over.
We see your pain and we see your power.
We miss you.
We love you.
We can’t wait for you to come Home.

For the men who have, thank you so much. Please call your brothers, start men’s circles, show them the manuals. Tell them of what you gave up. Of your brokenness and acceptance. Of what it truly means to take up the mantle of protector. Please. There aren’t enough fathers, resources and leaders for men to sit at the feet of.
The women have tried. We can’t do it. The restoration must come from within the Masculine. The Feminine cannot mother grown men into wholeness. We cannot strap men to our backs and walk.
We tried.
We bow out. Not gracefully. But in mournful acceptance nonetheless.
And we will wait for you to burst free from the shackles patriarchy has placed on you.
We pray.
We pray.
We pray.
For the Great Remembrance.

Luckily, I can't stay on for too long without a login pop up prompt from instagram which I no longer have.

Just now I was checking out a brand and then found myself on an infliencers page who listed herself as a ""bonus mom to 4 boys"" she had no bio kids of her own (yet?) I recall my Instagram scrolling days and seeing a lot of this ""bonus mom"" stuff. In some cases, it was a mixture of blended families where both partners entered the relationship with children or where it was reversed and the man was a step father to his partners child. 

In most cases I saw bonus mom plastered on many ladies bio. Hardly every saw ""bonus dad"" in the case of step fathers as in it was not listed in their bio or they simple did not word it like that. 

I've equally seen ""bonus mom"" in bios where woman had no biological children of their own with their partner or if they did they were either expecting (mom to be) or would literally list the ages (ie: bonus mom to two twin 5 y/o girls and mom to 6 mo boy) either way I noticed women were the first to tell you they're ""bonus moms"" and give ALL the details.

I know that blended families are a real thing! I know that for many reasons some women may not be able to have biological children and either adopt or accept their partners children as their own...etc

Still, I feel like there is some underlying conditioning in there. Or maybe these ladies are genuinely proud to be moms! Which can absolutely be the case.

# Photos

**Wardrobe:** Wear white or solid bright colours.

**Expression:** Smile, leave the duckface for Instagram.

**Communication:** Make sure your pictures aren’t just about looking good. They need to tell your story.

**Picture 1:** a great head shot with eye contact (think of magazine covers)  
**Picture 2:** travel/you doing something out of the ordinary (full body if possible)  
**Picture 3:** you doing something normal that you love (eating, hanging with friends, painting, reading, etc. . . .)  
**Picture 4:** a group shot, because it communicates a lot about who you are, including your height.  
**Picture 5:** your choice (you with an animal, you at a wedding, a professional pic of you, etc.)  
**Picture 6:** Your weed-out photo. If there is something that is an intrinsic part of you that is going to be a make-or-break for others, put it here to save yourself time. (Do you smoke? Are you heavy into politics?)

After you have selected your six photos ask yourself: Can someone come up with three questions per photo? If so, move on to your “about me.”

# About me

This is a place to give someone a taste of you. This is *not* your biography, so keep it short (fewer than two hundred words) but not too short because that shows low investment. Your “about me” should be regarded as a conversation starter. Here are some rules of thumb:

***Do***

* Make statements that invite people to start a discussion with you (*I was born in Cali and know where to get the absolute best carnitas)*.
* Invite people to ask a question (*Ask me about my second photo . . .*).
* Show your favourite thing about your personality.

***Do not***

* List your criteria (*must be tall, university educated and love animals*).
* List your weed-out criteria (*Looking for a hookup? Don’t waste my time!*). First, sleazy people don’t *read* on dating apps so you’re wasting your time and second, when we tell people what we don’t want, we indicate what we’ve already had and we tend to come across as bitter.
* Just put a link to your Instagram. If you’re too lazy to write something, what makes you think people won’t be too lazy to open an entirely different app to get to know you?

# Crafting the First Message

(I know this isn't strictly FDS, but is worth knowing for the few of us that liked making the first move, myself included)

**Make it meaningful**

Look at a profile and comment on something specific that you like or have a question about. Saying “hey” in a first message is almost equivalent to saying nothing—in fact, the vast majority of “hey” messages never get a response at all.

**Make your first message brief, but not short**

Messages with the best chance of a reply are between 40 and 100 characters long (again, saying “hey” twenty times isn’t going to cut it). Something like, “I see you went to Paris, what was your favourite café?” should suffice.",45673,How to Make Your Best Dating Profile,0,,

I considered posting this on one of the black women subs here but I had a feeling it would not be well received. Keep in mind this comes from a place of love and I’m thinking about the grand scheme of things. 

Many black women are joining the mob of women who have decided they’re done putting up with losers and low effort behavior in the dating world, and I am so glad. Something that I feel needs to be said is, if activism is a huge part of your personality you’re going to have to let it go. Politics and activism are not first date conversation or things that should be the focal point of your dating and social media profiles. One of the main reasons why social media is so cool is because it gives you the chance to showcase your uniqueness and your hobbies. 

Men are always watching. They’re always looking around for cute women to follow online. Imagine a man coming across your Instagram and all he sees is BLACK LIVES MATTER FUCK TRUMP POLICE SHOT ANOTHER BLACK PERSON AMERIKKKA BLACK PANTHER PARTY REVOLUTION REPARATIONS, along with you constantly going back and forth arguing with people. Nothing about your hobbies and barely any cute pictures of you out on the town living your best life. Just you arguing back and forth with randoms over whatever breaking news just came out. “Black twitter” does this aaaaall day long. They sit around all day rehashing the same topics and they’re not even getting paid. Nothing about this is alluring, playful, fun, cute, sexy, inviting, or constructive.

You do not exist to craft your whole life and your whole personality around being an activist. 

certain dating apps give you the option to list your political party. If you do choose to list it which is fine, simply choose liberal or conservative or whatever, and leave it at that. You dont need to include a long paragraph about your politics in your dating profile. Men don’t care, will just view you as combative and a a possible source of stress to their lives, and will simply swipe left and move on. Also, something I have seen black women mention and poke fun at is how black men often have a photo of them around a bunch of nonblack people on their dating profile as a signal to nonblack women that they’re open to dating outside of their race. As corny and stupid as it may seem, it obviously works and that’s why they do it. There are plenty of nonblack men who are open to dating black women but black women have the reputation of being solely interested in black men. Many don’t want to bother to approach for this reason. Do exactly what black men do lol. Try putting up one photo of you in a diverse space. Maybe you got invited to some sort of event or a birthday party and and there were people of all races there. Have someone take a cute picture of you while you’re there and post it. If you notice you get more attention with a certain hairstyle when online or when you’re out and about, wear that hairstyle so you can get what you want. This is about getting what you truly want. Don’t take it personally. 

Part of expanding your dating options and your social circle means understanding that it’s ok to get acquainted with people who disagree with you on certain topics. I don’t even agree with my own family on a lot of political and social topics. Doesn’t stop me from calling them, visiting them, and coming to thanksgiving dinner to get my plate. 

**value your connections over everything.** you don’t need to share the same views about immigration with someone in order for them to be useful to you. It’s not your problem. Again, this is controversial I know. Most people don’t bring up heavy topics like this when they first meet and they’re mingling/networking, because it doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things and when it comes to what they’re trying to accomplish. Be selfish and think about your goal.

You do not have to keep the entire black community in mind when you date. You’re an individual capable of vetting people in whatever way you see fit.",45621,This is a message to black women from a black woman: It is critical that you learn how to play the game and leave the heavy activism out of your long term dating strategy.,0,,

Chances are, they're up in everybody's inbox, adding all kinds of women and it's what you don't see that's going to leave you confused or puzzled. 

Some guys are better at hiding it. They keep all of their rotation private. The open ones have hundreds of women on their friends list and give them free validation by commenting &amp; liking up &amp; heart reacting to their pics. The private ones will hide their friends list and keep in the DMs.

You don't want to be his favorite target. This is where their online love bombing comes in. It's their tactic, it's their strategy. To inundate you with messages, compliments, heart reacts, meme likes, etc. Blowing up your inbox. 

Then they do the push-pull, hot and cold. And it leaves you wondering...why is he acting all distant ? Or he might slow fade or ghost you. It's a habit of theirs to chase after multiple women. And he most likely has a favorite he gives preference to over the others. But that's not what you see...what you're experiencing is him ""acting disinterested"" or ""cold."" All the reason to let him go. What's going on behind the scenes is his lineup of potential women for him to use for sex, validation, ego or other reasons. They pretty much rinse and repeat.

Sometimes it's just a numbers game to them. The more options they feel they can get, the better. Eventually I think the favorite gets knocked off the pedestal and gets the same fate as the others while he searches for a new favorite. 

Sometimes the acting distant is just him talking to other women and he's placed you as lower priority. Sometimes he's really not that into you and he's just bored. Either way, cut him loose.",47757,Don't be his (lvm) favorite &amp; what you aren't seeing...,0,,

# AITA for telling my mother that I was more likely to kill her then help her

📷

This is a throwaway. Quick background- my mother had an affair with my partner and then she married him. He then cheated on her and left her. She then took him back and was diagnosed with breast cancer. He couldn’t deal with it and left her again for another woman. I haven’t seen or spoken to my mother in 10 years.

My aunt recently had a massive party for her 60 birthday and begged me to fly out and attend. My mother was there and she tried to talk to me. I had already made it clear that she shouldn’t speak to me but she pushed and tried to have a conversation several times at the beginning of the party. Luckily I was the successful in avoiding her for the rest of the party but at the end when everyone was going home, she found her moment.

While I was outside waiting for my aunt and uncle(I was their designated driver) my mother saw it as her moment to talk to me. She came over and was apologising for betraying me and being a terrible mother etc. She said I should find it in my heart to forgive her because she was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer and that she needs someone to take care of her. I told her I knew and that Auntie had told me all about her diagnosis. I told her- I am sorry you are ill but I will not be there for you. She kept pushing and cried about how she felt terrible for all that happend but that she really needed me so out of frustration I told her that I was more likely to kill her then help her and that I would have been more devastated and supporting if she were my mother but my mother died when she betrayed me.

Some other family and friends in the parking lot heard me saying that. They felt it was outline, unnecessary and an asshole move.

Was it an asshole move?

I've been following this community for a while and it changed how I view relationship, men, dating (trust that I am not alone in this transformation!). Currently I am single and actively dating. I am in a confusing situation and looking for your insights and feedback.  

Context: not super long ago I dated someone. He comes from a good family, never worked super hard any day in his life, and has very high IQ and EQ, charismatic. He is super into spirituality - a very charming person. He also wants open relationships. My stand was idk if poly was for me, but I am open to try. We had our fun, but towards the end of the relationship, he made out with someone else in a party that I was also in. I was hurt, asked to talk about boundary, which he refused, saying ""not blaming you but your presence made me feel constrained"", and polyamory is ""replacing strong ties with weak ties"". 

We then stopped talking. Not an abrupt breakup, but we gradually stopped contacting. Then in a month or two, he started to see my friend, she is stunning, playful, high IQ and EQ, and into open relationship.  It was hard for me, but I have actively healing myself (through meditation, exploring my interests, confirming my core values, etc.), and it's been fine.  Last night I ran into them, they moved in together, and officially in a relationship (open or not, that I don't know). In a second I felt those moments of hurt and confusion swallowed me alive, and I had to run away. 

Now, I have learned from that relationship (I may as well get something out of it too, right?). I have established my own set of values, and have been doing a good job sticking to them while OLD/dating IRL. I love myself, and feel so effing grateful to be alive in this messy but beautiful world. But I feel hurt, and can't help but think I was ""a weaker tie replaced"", ""less attractive"", and ""used and disposed"". I know these thoughts aren't doing anything, but they bubble up some time, and I feel scared and useless, honestly. 

How would you approach the healing process, ladies? Thank you so, so much. 

 TL;DR: I got hurt from an open relationship, and am not sure how to heal from the trauma. Thoughts?",47385,Thoughts about healing from past relationships?,0,,

Haven’t finished January yet but I’ve certainly been tested quite a few times already but have maintained my boundaries.   In 17 days, I’ve:

Succinctly told the last guy I dated in 2019 that I not only am not interested in seeing him again, but that a friendship also didn’t make sense given our complete lack of common interests/social circle. 

Stood as a witness in my friend’s divorce hearing and told the story, without shame, of how I went on a date with whom I didn’t initially realize was her POS (now stbx) husband.  And in doing so, also confidently thwarted her attorney’s attempts to shame me for using Tinder because it’s “clearly a hookup site”. Fuck that noise.  

Finally told a dude who’s been bugging me to fuck off.  

Drove 40 minutes home in the rain at 1 am after a first date that went swimmingly well and never heard from the guy again.  My guess is that he’s mad that I rebuffed his offer to spend the night but is too ashamed to say that’s why.  Fuck that dude. 

Went to my first singles’ Meetup after 2 years being on the app.  Didn’t meet anyone of interest, so I left my “interest card” blank instead of writing down the best there was to offer.  Instead, got asked for my number by a cute, successful guy 18 years my junior.  Also got a message on the app from another attendee. 

Said no for the first time to my 2+ year FWB whom I’ve finally accepted as a LVM unworthy of being a FWB.  This, to me, is the biggest win of all.  I used to literally cry over this man.  Needless to say, he was shocked and rather put out.  

I’ve been putting a lot of effort into developing a couple side hustles, and have been having a blast seeing the funds add upon my account.    Less effort into OLD and more time meeting people IRL and proving to myself that I’m the catch my friends say I am!

Can’t wait to see what the rest of the year will hold, though I hope it will be success based on sticking to the promises I’ve made to myself.",47349,Sticking to my goals 🤛🏻,0,,

He's everything i'm looking in a man (so far)! he pays for everything and takes me on 70$-120$ dates (most guys split the bill or took me to McDonald's!), well educated and in the middle of his master's degree, has a job, has a driving license and a car, 6'2 and very fit and attractive, always compliments me (not lovebombing) and yesterday i introduced him to my family (hope it's not too early, i didn't post him anywhere yet. I post at 3-4 months) and they loved him, he was so polite. No female friends or female 'best friend' and no ex in his life. He likes animals and not a picky eater.

I like him a lot but i still keep my heart closed so it won't hurt that much (just disappoint) if stuff doesn't work out in a few weeks for whatever reason.

Honestly it's not even the only HVM i met, i also met another one about a few months ago and it just didn't work out because i wasn't emotionally available at that time.

For YEARS i was dating around without seeing any HVM (men i dated for a while would either have big potential but not HVM or be LVM lite, not fuckboys but def put in half-effort, will pay for dates and take me places but i always had to plan, they could never think of any place to take me and some more LVM lite signs), so many men that took me on bullsh\*t dates and going-dutch or taking me to a walk in the park.

Pickmeisha: A woman who likes cutting off her own wings and let other people either put wings on her, or drag her out with the other person's wings. Pickmeisha always self-sabotages themselves just because they want to REMAIN in that INNER-CHILD who wants to remain in her nest. 

Pickmeisha may have had an overbearing parents who undermines her autonomy by shouting, demeaning, belittling, or shaming her in public growing up. That said parent may have been pickmeisha once and still am, and the mask of being an adult with a salary and a kid can mask that even more.

Remember this phrase: ""People doesn't want to be true, they want to be right.""

That's pride, and we should cultivate it. 

Pickmeisha has an obviously available hole for any LVM to see and ""take a dip"". Most men in their 20s are LVM who still needs to build up their fortunes. And they love dabbling on pickmeisha because they see an opening, opening that can be widened further, and just take and take and get away with it.

&amp;#x200B;

So when I was in my mid twenties there was this guy I was fooling around with. Yes, I was THAT girl who fooled around with a dude behind his gf's back. I was not that into him but I was lonely and he was paying attention to me. We were FWB's off and on for awhile. There was another guy I was totally obsessed with who had ghosted me and moved away after we had been having sex for a couple of months. I was head over heels for this total fuckboy but I knew he'd never give me a chance. So I found a FWB, who I'll call Carl in this post.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually Carl broke up with his gf because she had moved out of state for university. We started hanging out more and more and having a lot of sex. I didn't really have any feelings for Carl.  was just lonely and needed something to keep my mind off of the guy who had broken my heart.  After a few months of hanging out with him he eventually asked me ""So are you my gf now? Becuase my mom has been asking questions"" (he was younger than me). I paused for a moment and finally said ""Well, no. I don't really feel that way about you."" or something along those lines.  After a few months I started to bond with Carl a lot. We would watch star trek, listen to a lot of music together, go places together, go to parties.  Eventually I started developing feelings for Carl. So one day I finally said ""You know how you were asking if I'm your gf? Do you want to make it official?"" He said yes and we became a couple (yet he never actually changed his status on facebook 9\_9 huge red flag). he started introducing me as his gf, i started meeting his family, the whole nine yards. It was a full blown relationship that lasted about a year.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time I was also a Libby Libfem. I would watch porn with him and we started doing a lot of crazy sexual shit, like having sex out in public in the car and other insanely trashy shit.  I mean a lot of it was pretty hot and we didn't visually violate anyone, but thinking back on it, its clear i didn't have healthy priorities in terms of sex. I was also a nudist (thats a whole other INSANE story).  Anyway, about midway between the relationship Carl had been making plans to study abroad in Germany. He finally admitted this to me claiming that this had always been his dream. I wasn't taking the relationship too seriously because I was still in love with the other fuckboy, so I basically encouraged Carl to follow his dreams, even though it did hurt a little bit.  We did have a lot of fun together.  

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually the date was getting closer and one day out of the blue Carl asked me ""Hey, so theres this website where people have sex for tips. I was wondering if you'd be interested in something like that"".  My stomach dropped and I felt this combination of a sense of dread, disgust, anger, etc but I couldn't quite articulate what the issue was... after all we had been watching porn together. what was the big deal? why was I so angry?  In that moment it hit me that this person didn't really love me or care about me. He viewed me as a means to an end.  He didn't care about my reputation or the fact that he would be sharing me with other men. He viewed me as a sexual vending machine or a business proposition. I realized that I had enabled his viewing me in that manner by enabling his porn addiction.  My previous view on porn was that it was no big deal. I didn't see an issue with it. I didn't even know porn addiction was a problem in society. I just viewed it as something adults watch sometimes. What I realized years later is that despite how sexually available I made myself to this person, despite all the new and exciting sexual adventures we were going on, I still wasn't enough for this person.  He would watch porn when I wasn't around.  Porn was always in the background of his life, even with me there to give him anything he wanted.  And by not seeing an issue with it I basically implicitly sent him the message that I was for sale too.

&amp;#x200B;

Years later I was talking with my sister about it and she said something along the lines of ""It sounds like he wanted to use you to save money for his trip to Germany"". It finally hit me that she was right... that was probably the case.

&amp;#x200B;

About a week before he left I went to check on his okcupid profile. We hadn't had the breakup conversation yet, but I had a sneaking suspicion that he was just going abroad to fuck European women and that studying abroad was not so much his dream as much as it was his goal to simply fuck foreign women.  Just as I suspected, his profile was turned back on, his availability was set to single and his location was updated to Stuttgart.  He hadn't even had the decency to wait until he got there to start looking... We were laying in bed a couple of nights before he left and he finally asked me ""So are we going to stay together long distance and pick up where we left off when I come back?"" Basically he was asking ""So can I fuck other women while I'm gone and you'll wait around for me?"" I responded ""We can't stay together if you're going to be on okcupid looking for other women."" He went silent after that because he realized he was caught.

&amp;#x200B;

The last time we had sex was a few days before he left. The condom slipped off and I had to go get Plan B at Planned Parenthood. I was really scared, especially because he was leaving. He assured me that no matter what he would help me ""take care of the situation"" ie abort it.  I felt really insulted. Why just assume I want to get rid of it? I want to prevent the pregnancy but not necessarily get rid of it if I did end up pregnant... I didn't bother starting an argument about it. That night I was feeling really tired from taking the pill and he insisted we go to a going away party. I sat there alone most of the night asleep in a chair because the pill totally knocked me out. Meanwhile he was having fun with his friends and expected me to drive him home after.  It was really inconsiderate, but again, I was trying to be supportive of his dreams... meanwhile it seemed like my life was about to be wrecked.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to remain friends with him after we broke up and he left. We would chat on skype the first couple of weeks he was there. He would tell me all about Germany and how great it was and how he was learning the language really easily. he added me to his global adventures facebook group where he would update about his travels for his friends and family.  As he got happier I got progressively sadder. i realized how meaningless I was to him.  He easily discarded me (Because I sent him the message from the beginning that this was perfectly acceptable) and I was nothing to him. The final straw was when he wanted to chat on skype and at the end of the conversation he asked to see me naked... I was so disgusted, confused and horrified that I told him I had to go and ended the call.  I realized in that moment that I would still never be anything more to him than a sexual object and porn fantasy, not a human being with dreams and ambitions and feelings.  Even though we were broken up and he was actively seeking other women, he still expected me to be sexually available to him.  I looked over at the mirror where there was a picture of us kissing. I grabbed it off the mirror and ripped it up and threw it in the trash.  I went on facebook and removed myself from his travels group and deleted him from all my contacts everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks later he sent me another email about all his glorious travels and how much fun he was having (but the bars were boring, probably because the women wouldn't fuck him).  I responded ""To be honest, I don't want to hear about what a great time you're having in Germany when I could have been pregnant and you left me.""  I didn't hear from him again after that for awhile.  The next email was another couple months later. He sent me a message saying how he was thinking of me because he heard a song by MGMT (my favorite band).  I looked at the date and it was sent on his birthday. my birthday was literally a few days before and he hadn't bothered to message or email me at all. He didn't think about sending me any birthday messages. But when his birthday rolled around the next week suddenly he was thinking of me and wanted attention. I responded with ""happy birthday &gt;\_&gt;"" and didn't hear from him again until February about a week after valentines day saying he cared about me and missed me.  I figured he probably couldn't find a date (guess those German women just weren't panning out for him XD).  So I sent him this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmUqP6yhza8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmUqP6yhza8)

&amp;#x200B;

No response after that.  After he got back from Germany he made one final attempt to have a political discussion with me through email. When I told him revolution is necessary to overthrow the capitalist class and that I didn't appreciate how he objectified me in our relationship and that I had a new bf, he suddenly became indignant and said we had nothing more to discuss because he didn't realize I ""advocated for violence"" lmao Like learn materialist analysis bro.  it seemed like he never read any of the philosophical texts I recommended to him. He just assumed shit about me. I didn't bother responding to him.

&amp;#x200B;

He's since married and now has a son.  This next generation of boys is gonna be total shit.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Anyway, the moral of the story is, if you don't value yourself (the way I didn't), they won't value you. I basically gave him permission to treat me as disposable because I made myself available to him the way I did. I had no real boundaries. I thought I was getting the benefit from FWB, but in reality I was just sending him the message that I was a free prostitute and later that he could literally make money off of me as my pimp online.  So now I am very anti-porn and anti-fwb needless to say.",49052,"It's not ""Empowering"" and it never benefits you: my ex tried to pimp me out online",0,,

He invited me back to his home, and I initially went because he didn’t give off any bad vibes. We both decided that we weren’t looking for anything serious, and thus we had a great time. BUT, we didn’t hook up because we smoked weed so we just held a long conversation over the course of the 3 hours we spent together. It was nice but I had hoped for some action. 

Right before I leave, he says, and I quote: “We should do this again.” 

Me knowing how this works, and knowing how a male’s brains work, I reply “maybe.” I know he’s not 100% genuine when he says it, and I don’t wanna get my hopes up. 

Fast forward 2 weeks, we haven’t really talked since our first encounter. I’m going through my camera roll and I see a photo of me and some guy from like, 3 years ago. It was taken while I was out with friends and I was pretty hammered but I remember meeting this guy and taking a selfie with him. We met outside the club and it was just around the time we were leaving, but somehow we struck up a conversation and then took the photo. 

Guess who that guy was? That’s right, the Tinder guy. I was shocked to say the least. 

So I send the photo to him and I’m like is this you or am I hallucinating? He replies yes???

The following conversation goes like this:

Me: Fuck, that’s weird, I thought I was hallucinating?

Him: Yeah, that’s weird, where was the photo taken?

Me: 2017, I remember we talked about your gloves and I think we were at ______. Can you remember anything?

Him: Yeah hahahaha it was at this club, you were with a lightskinned friend? 

Me: Yeah lol you wouldn’t stop talking about Australia and I was pretty drunk idk why I remember all of this

Him: Haha yeah I was gonna travel there sometime, thats funny. 


then he follows up with this message:

I hooked up with your friend. She gave me her number and I was gonna call her but I forgot to save it. Thought she was cute. What’s her insta? 

AND HERE’S THE THING

he NEVER hooked up with her that night because we were glued to each other’s asses that night. also I called her and she SWEARS she never hooked up with him because thats NOT her type.

He’s lying to throw me off, but he doesn’t have the balls to say it like it is. And he thinks he’s doing ME a FAVOR by doing this. Is this negging? Or is he just fucking stupid?",49052,Is this negging?,0,,

I also tell myself that I can’t control what happens to me when I met or meet these guys but I can control my reactions

I don’t remember the user who reminded me. I will tag you. I am sorry. Also, sorry if this isn’t well organized. 

First: saving sex for marriage is NOT a strategy. It’s a personal decision. People make this decision for a variety of reasons, but most of them will cite religious reasons. It is NOT a “manipulation tactic” where you bribe a man for sex in order to gain commitment as some Redditors pretend. It’s 2020. A guy can break up with you and go on tinder if he feels so desperate to have premarital sex. 

Saving sex for marriage is a filter. What are we filtering for? Men with similar values (eg shared faith), men who are serious about marriage, men who believe sex should be based on love and intimacy and not on biological urges, and men who will respect physical boundaries. 

I just am up front about saving sex for marriage. I say it early on. I don’t think any man has directly been scared off from me being straight up about it. However, I don’t go on tinder. I have had men be infatuated with me before and it hasn’t seemed to stop them from liking me. 

I don’t attract as many men because I am not open. But the men I do at least present a more civilized and kind exterior. I think I attract fewer higher quality men rather than lots of lower quality men. 

Finally, avoiding premarital sex is an easy way to focus on WHO you are dating rather than the physical aspects and the hormones that come with it. You’re able to see a person for who they truly are without being dick-no-tized and feeling attached and emotional because you had sex.",49040,On saving sex for marriage,0,,

I like brown makeup looks in particular for a serious ""don't f\*\*\* with me"" yet professional look. Eyes with a light amount of soft dark eyeshadow as ""liner,"" mascara, groomed brows, contoured cheekbones and a matte medium brown lippie. Sometimes I go for a deep brick matte red, too.   
 

If I want to go softer and more femme (but still powerful) I go for a smoky cat eye (think Jane Fonda from the 60s) or a full smoky with a pretty frosted nude/soft pink lip.   
 

Sometimes, if I want to be casual I put blush on the apples/centers of my cheeks, but these days I do more of a ""swiping up"" (like the 80s) for a more sculpted look.

I've been thinking about how mass media is constantly encouranging pick-me behaviour in women and normalizing LVM (even making them cute or funny). So I wish we could talk about examples of this in popular books, songs, movies and tv shows that come to mind. After FDS I actually feel uneasy watching some depictions of women in series and movies and even ads.

There are sooo many but some that I can think of off the top of my head:

- I love Lana del Rey but she is the ultimate Pickmeisha (at least in her songs), often singing about being the ride or die girl, suffering because of an absolutely LVM (addicted, cheater, emotionally unavailable, old), being a side chick, etc.

- Friends: Monica proposing to Chandler (I know their relationship wasn't bad but this particular moment is pick-me behaviour).

- 50 Shades of Grey: doesn't need explanation.

- Comedy movies where a beautiful girl in her 20s falls for an ugly, broke, rude older man (maybe even unemployed and socially awkward).

I guess I’m looking to see if any other women feel this way or have advice.

Ever since I was kid I knew my biracialness was a big part of my identity because it was ALWAYS the first thing people noticed. I look very mixed/ambiguous so its not uncommon for complete strangers to stop me and ask about my ethnic make up. 

When it comes to dating, being biracial is often a focal point for men. Men approach me with racially charged compliments and will tell me shit like “you’re so exotic looking!” “you have the best of both worlds” “half asian &amp; half white girls are so hot!” 

It’s exhausting and honestly insulting when men COMPLIMENT MY FUCKING RACE  WHICH IS SOMETHING I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER. You never hear guys telling a white girl hot it is that she’s white. Like wtf.

I want to go into some detail of what I’ve learned and experienced in the hopes that I can help other women to not suffer from the mistakes I have made.  I want to distinguish some differences in lvms. They are not all the same:

Average Fuckboy:  This is your typical low IQ, badly raised male who will do and say anything to get you in to bed and cares little to nothing about you. His behavior stems from a lack of connection to intelligence and emotional maturity. He mostly isn’t a violent or emotional person. He’s just looking to coast through life while making as little effort as possible and he has zero concern over the damage he causes, as long as he’s comfortable. 

This is an empty life. Your average fuckboy is a lost soul roaming the earth seeking to feed the emptiness within himself. He’s lost for sure, but mostly harmless in the sense that he’s too lost in his own world to get involved with you enough for his damaged self to rupture into jealousy and violence. 

The ADHD male:
This one is so complicated. Their brains are wired differently. Adhd men lack the ability to care for the day to day details of every day life. They are sensory seekers who are impulsive and lack the ability to come to terms with responsibilities. They are time blind and they have a hard time getting attached to anyone or anything

If you’ve been with an adhd male (a true adhd male, because most of us have some form of adhd) you’ll know that he’s the guy that is always late, a little disheveled. He has a hard time connecting on an emotional level and he can only focus his attention on certain things, things that are interesting to him. 

If he’s ADHD he most likely didn’t get the support he needed for his condition (most schools do not provide for the needs of these complicated individuals, especially the boys) and he grew up disconnected.  They can often end up as drug addicts and have had trouble with the law

This is difficult for me to reconcile with because my son is ADHD and I work hard on giving him the tools he needs to overcome his disability. I don’t want my beautiful, sweet boy to become a LVM

Know this. There is no excuse for LVM behavior in an ADHD male. The ADHD male will want you to be his mommy but if he does the work he will have tools to become self sufficient and it’s possible for him to be an LVM

The avoidant attached male:

This is a fuckboy that doesn’t even know he’s a fuckboy. He might be sweet, kind and generous, but he grew up in an environment that made him detached from his emotions. An example would be a son who grew up with a mother who never gave him affection and a father who never showed him how to be a man. He may have been abused. There are many other variants in childhood history, I’m just mentioning the former as an example.

He is incapable of establishing a true connection with another person and when he gets close to someone it feels like he can’t breathe, so he cuts and runs, much to the shock and surprise of his heartbroken partner because everything seemed to be going well before that. 

You know the avoidant attached male as the guy you dated who you grew close to quickly and you both became attached and inseparable almost immediately, then, all of the sudden you get a “I can’t do this anymore, sorry” text, or he just ghosts

Know this, there’s no excuse for this. A HVM will recognize his downfalls and seek therapy. They will work to overcome their issues

And the worst of all:

The narcissist/ sociopath

This LVM is the most dangerous of all because not only can he break your heart and crush your soul, he can be violent and he has little to no empathy

You may have been with this type of man. The signs are:

Lovebombing. He immediately makes you feel like the most beautiful woman in the world and he never leaves your side. The connection between you both is intoxicating. He feels like the love of your life

Lies, inconsistencies. He isn’t who he makes himself out to be. This type of male might claim to be rich but you later find out he has nothing and he might even be preying on you for financial security 

He mirrors you. Think of the guy who seems to be interested in all of the same things you are and he is in awe of everything you do because you are “just like him!”

He future fakes you. He’s constantly telling you how he can’t wait to marry you, buy you a car, take care of you etc etc, yet he does nothing to make steps towards those plans

He isn’t close to his family and has no or very few friends. All of his exes are nuts and if he has kids, he rarely sees them

He’s jealous and possessive 

He can be violent and abusive

There are many more signs. Google “signs of a narcissist if you want to learn more 

These are dangerous men and you need to run fast and run far. They are capable of killing you. I’m not kidding

I’m sorry for the wall of text but I think we should learn as much as we can about the men who are capable of hurting us. Protect yourselves ladies. Don’t let yourselves be drawn into men that are capable of breaking you. It’s just not worth it. If you are co-dependent (look that up if you don’t know what it means) work on yourself and get therapy. Seal up your gaps so that LVMS can’t penetrate them. Once you are strong and whole, they’ll be unable to do anything to induce you to be drawn into their sphere. In fact, they won’t even approach you because once you heal, you will only attract what you are. You are a queen. You are worthy. You are perfect 

PS: There’s so much more. I’ve only scratched the surface. The different ways a male can become a LVM are so much more than what I’ve described above. Please add to this if you have more ideas. Let’s protect one another and prevent our sisters from the suffering we have endured to the best of our abilities.",48997,Distinguishing the details in fuckboys and lvms.

Broadly, it means marrying or relationshitting with a man that doesn't ""check all your boxes"". The media leads us to think women have been picky over superficial things so we 86 men who have the wrong colored hair, weird mannerisms, or aren't gainfully employed, or men we aren't physically attracted to at first.

I propose that settling often means ignoring big red flags in order to achieve the ""dream"" of marriage and kids. 

Red flags such as :

1. No physical attraction. Too many women fall into this. Attraction can't be negotiated. If you marry someone you aren't attracted to, you are going into a dead bedroom. You might not care, but he will. 
2. Social awkwardness. You will end up embarrassed by him and resentful that you can't be proud of your husband and bring him places. 
3 . LACK of gainful employment. This isn't someone that will be able to contirubt to a better future for you both. 
4. Poor hygiene. That kills attraction fast
5. LACK of communication skills. Too many men can't communicate regardin relationship issues and instead get defensive, or just ignore the situation. You will end up feeling neglected and unheard. 
6. Mental illness. Mentally ill people make terrible partners unless they control it day in and day out. Men are terriblr.at doing this. 

The point is that there is a difference between settling and ignoring Red flags. Often, there is not",48994,"So let's talk about ""settling""!",0,,

\---   \*\*TL;DR;\*\* : My husband of 20 years left me after he finished med  school. We have 4 kids together and even though I'm nice to him, he  treats me poorly and seems resented towards me. How can he be mad if he  was the one leaving? what should I do if my goal is that my kids have a  nice relationship with him?

This is my first post here and I think it could be therapeutic so  it's a long. My English is not perfect so you'll find grammar mistakes,  sorry.

I am coming out from a very dark place, if it wasn't for my 4 kids I think I wouldn't be here.

I married my ex in Argentina 22 years ago, he is American and he was  working there as a missionary in my church. We married, had our first  child and after the church went into crisis and split up, he told me  that we needed to move to USA. It was hard to move here because I really  liked my life in Argentina and I love my family but I did it and I fell  in love with America.

My ex husband changed jobs a lot, he seemed unhappy with every job he  had. Once he told me he was jealous of me because I had a job I loved,  I'm a visual artist and I was doing very well at that time selling my  artwork at festivals and galleries around town, so I told him to follow  his dream job and I will be there supporting him. We had 4 kids and when  he told me he wanted to go to med school I got scared but I was  supportive (you can't have a job when you study medicine)

We moved to Virginia from Texas because he was accepted to only one  school and it was in Virginia. It was a huge change for the whole  family. I did jobs just to survive like childcare at my house since the  art scene in VA is very different. He was gone all the time and at the  end of his school year he left for 7 months, coming only once a month,  for out of state rotations.

Because most of the out of state rotations were not mandatory, my  kids and I resented his absence. My kids begun to act up, fighting all  the time, treating him very poorly also. I had an argument with him when  he told me that he was applying for Neurosurgery in California. I told  him for the first time no. I didn't want Neurosurgery (7 years of  residency at very low pay) and I didn't want to move to California. He  signed up anyways.

The day after he came from his last out of state rotation (almost 2  years ago) and a month before his graduation from med school, he sat me  down and told me that he didn't love me anymore. I tried to convince him  to go to marriage counseling but he stopped after the second meeting.  surprisingly he got the residency in California as a neurosurgeon and he  asked me to move there with him, not as a couple but separated. I told  him I didn't want to move to California and my kids begged me to go back  to Texas and that's what I did.

He dropped me off in Texas with $300 and kicked me out of all banking  accounts. My father in law helped me to buy a house and paid for the  remainder of what I owed of my car (my father in law loves me like a  daughter) My ex got upset in the beginning because he said I was using  his inheritance. but I had to pay the mortgage anyways, is not that he  paid the house in full.

Even though he acted like a jerk, I thought about my kids and how  much I want them to have a good relationship with their father so he  comes to visit every other month and stays here with us. He calls my  phone to talk to the kids and I do my best to make my kids to talk to  him (they don't want to talk to him that much) I even pick him up from  the airport.

I have a clean conscience about how I treated him. I treat him well  even when he is a jerk but he seems mad a me. When he calls he always  throw jabs at me. If he talks to me, he always tries to guilt me with  something. He criticizes the house every time he comes, like ""hey, why  didn't you put shelves in the kids rooms"" ""you need to clean the gutters  more often"" ""when was the last time you changed the filter?"" ""why is  the ice crusher not working?"" ""you gained too much weight, you will get  diabetes"" he also makes fun of me when I say I'm a single mom of 4 as if  I'm using it to make people feel sorry for me.

When he told me ""you should look for a boyfriend so our 8 year old  son has a male figure in his life"" I told him, ""I don't have time and  who is going to want to date a single mother of 4? and you son has a  dad"" he told me I was making excuses and I should move on.

Why is he doing that?? I don't understand why he is treating me like  that after all I did for him. He was the one who left me! I know he was  sad when I said I wasn't going to California but I gave him warning  BEFORE he applied and who can expect his ex to follow him around and  move to an area she doesn't like and has no friends??

It's like regular dating but you get paid!). I was horrified to see that several of the men that I have gone on dates with from OLD were on there! I was like, fuck, I could have gotten paid for those dates? 😂 I'm actually glad I didn't meet them that way because it sets up a fucked up power dynamic, which is the sad lesson I learned from trying it. Oh, getting paid for sex? Very cool... not. Thank you libfeminism and of course LVM for the lifelong trauma.  No amount of $ will ever be worth the damage that was done to me or cover 1% of the cost of therapy I need to recover from that experience.

Anyway, regarding those dudes, I was able to weed them out as LVM on my own from OLD. But I would have been able to identify them as LVM *faster* if I had been able to see them on seeking arrangements first. Now I keep my seeking arrangments account in case I ever decide to use OLD dating to check if they're on there. If they are, boy-bye!

Side note, it's depressing how many men use seeking arrangements. There are endless gross old men on there, married usually, with their age limit set to ""18-30"". When I searched for sugar mommies, there were TWELVE profiles in a 500 mile range. People who blog about that shit are always like, ""sugar daddies and mommies..."" No. It's only old men who are trying to use their money to exploit young broke women and cheat on their wives. I'm so fucking over it.

This turned into a rant but I hope you enjoyed this tip.

I’ll be hitting an age landmark this year but I’ve been told by friends and acquaintances who’ve seen my past pics or known me from a decade ago: that I still have amazing skin, hair / figure (apart from two very fine wrinkles from smiling).

I take very good care of my skin, health and fitness. I’m not trying to paint a picture of being a super model or anything of the sort. But I fucking try my hardest to keep what I got! 

I’ve decided to increase my age range on Tinder to see what’s out there according to my new decade. OH.MY.GOD. Just no guys over 30!

My observations in a nutshell:

- Beer bellies. LOTS OF BEER BELLIES
- Man boobs!
- Ugly pubic hair beards. Poor grooming 
- Yellow teeth from smoking and coffee etc 
- HATFISH! Receding hairlines or baldness covered under a ‘cleverly’ placed hat
- The ugliest guy in the group pics, ANY TIME a guy puts up pics of him in groups for the first few photos or just with a great looking friend - it’s always going to be the ugliest friend. Why men have no shame when doing this I’ll never understand
- No sense of style 
- Bad skin, BRO you should look 55 at 35! 
- Photos clearly taken one 2012 as their main profile pic 
- 0 effort put into their profiles. No bio, nothing or worse aSK mE!
- UGLY tattoos (tattoos are great but not when you got one while you were drunk)
- NOT posting a PICTURE of themselves or face, rather wanting to get your personal details to send you their ugly ass picture. In their bio you’ll always see written: I Pr0MiSE iM n0T uGLY hAHa! Like bitch if you weren’t ugly then you’d post a picture of yourself for everyone to see lol
- Very bad profiles generally 

CHANGE your tinder from M looking for F. WOMEN BY FAR are better looking. They’re all make the best of what they were given. The thing is women have taken care of themselves from their teenage years because of the unfair societal expectations. FROM WHEN WE ARE INNOCENT CHILDREN! 

Ladies, what I’m saying is that women look good at any age, we age better than men and we’re fed LIES that we are going to hit a ‘wall’. A myth made up by LVM. If you think you’re not enough, please I can assure you that you are! Don’t let these beer belly dudes tell you otherwise.

Don’t feel bad for judging these guys either. These LVM are the same guys who will look at any woman and say she doesn’t have ‘biG enuf booBs’ or ‘tOO fat.’ Meanwhile they have 0 to offer and are hiding the fact that they are deadbeat dads....ugly dead beat dads.

Don’t ever let these kind of guys ever tell you to lose weight or wear more or less make up etc. Don’t let them hurt your self esteem when they aren’t kind shit. Don’t put up with it! Call them out!",48955,Fact: OLD apps have confirmed that men age badly,0,,

My father is an extremely vile and cruel LVM. He and my mother's marriage was hell on hotwheels and long before they divorced I already concluded that he is a shitty person. I haven't seen or spoken to him in about 5 years and frankly dont know what he's doing, where he is at or anything and dont care to. I'll never see or speak to him again.

My mother is remarried to another LVM unfortunately. Anyway, I'm grown so I don't care about him and he didn't raise me or anything. But I really don't like him and act cordial for my moms sake. 

My question is during early stages of dating when family comes up. I feel like if I say ""I don't have a relationship with my father"" it'll come across as desperate and like I have daddy issues or that the guy will secretly judge me for it. Even if I bring up my ""step father"" there's not much to say other than ""my mom is remarried"" of course I'll just say I get along fine with my moms husband and won't mention that I don't like him or anything.

So, how to go about this?",48952,"My father is not in my life, how do I diffuse being seen as someone with daddy issues?",0,,

I only attempt to date HVM, but of course this is the standard for LVM as well. I’ve had so many men ask me this question after a few dates (take into consideration that they have never had any sort of sexual interaction with me, this is all about personality): “I can’t tell whether you’re dominant or submissive. What are you?” 

My response is always: “What do you think?” as I stare at them (a slight smirk on my face). And I have had this same response over and over: “Oh, you’re dominant.” This is always followed by complete and utter submission to anything I ask them to do. The question was almost always asked after they tried and FAILED to: 1. Make me laugh/react however they thought I would to something they said, 2. Make me do something that they asked me to do (something stupid like try on a new outfit or dance), or 3. Tried to make a move on me. It’s honestly like these men are just puppies I am crate training.

Have you had any instances where the guys just flat out ask you if you’re the leader/dominant person in the relationship? It can’t just be me. I feel like these scrubs are dominance testing me to see if I will bend to their will. When I don’t, they want me to be their queen, which I deny. I don’t want to be queen to a bunch of losers.

I actually ""knew"" him off tinder a few months prior, we chatted daily for weeks, tried to get him out for a date but he was too busy and seemed too busy to chat as well, conversation waned until he just stopped replying.

I'm quite an anxious person when it comes to dating and rejection so I felt like I needed to unmatch him to get it out of my system.

Then we matched on Bumble surprisingly, I must have swiped him ages ago, and the same thing has happened again, only we have actually met up twice now. Both times nice, we slept together on the 2nd date which was very good but both dates were so stressful for me in the run up. He only confirmed around 2 hours before I was supposed to meet him. He is really bad at organising, he says, but to me it comes off extremely inconsiderate. Like it's a Friday night and you're telling me you ""maybe"" will meet me for a drink. Same thing has happened again, messaging constantly for weeks, and now replies are less and less frequent

Anyway over Christmas conversation dwindled until again, no messages. I messaged on NYE to which I've got no reply. *insert I know he could be busy comment* but I'm anxiously looking at his profile and I keep seeing that his location is updating all the time, which you have to go onto the app for it to do? I can't tell if he is just bullsh*tting me. He's said in person the last time we met he wanted to see me again but then why would he ignore my message after 3 days. 

I just hate feeling like this, and like I've repeated my mistakes of getting lead on on a different platform. I want to unmatch to stop myself from checking his location because I know it's bad for my mental health but then I'm worried that I'll come across as a bitch or that it's all just an overreaction and I'll have cut communication entirely. We haven't exchanged numbers also, a bit off?

I'm just weighing up the pros and cons of cutting communication and don't know what to do. I like him when I'm with him which is why I'm so conflicted, but hate every other aspect about how communicating with him makes me feel.",44328,Should I just unmatch?,0,,

https://psiloveyou.xyz/to-the-women-who-repeatedly-attract-broken-emotionally-unavailable-or-addicted-men-1d3fccc22da8

If you find yourself chasing after those types of men, you may be subconsciously re-enacting and attempting to fix your relationship with the parent/caretaker/guardian whom who you felt you had to ""chase after."" You must be consciously aware of this to break out of that pattern (which is something FDS is very good at doing) and stop repeating it or you continue to suffer more. It took a somewhat traumatic experience for me to finally awaken so I hope this helps someone out.

Don't chase. Don't wonder why a certain guy won't approach or chase after you...don't question if you're good enough. You're attracted to that for a reason. You DO NOT need their validation ,their attention, their ""love"", etc. This is a toxic pattern but you have complete and total control overcoming it! Recognize it and put an end to it.

- heavy use of social media such as Instagram, Snapchat or Twitter 
I absolutely avoid dating guys who uses online too much projecting false identity  and follow online models 

- not self sustainable ( still relying financially on parents) 

- pretentious ( this is personal, but I don’t like guys who’s into designer brands or too into clothes or cars)

- Caring so much about his looks 

- has history of abusing (physically or emotionally) his partner

- porn addict 

- clumsy or messy 

- doesn’t invest in oneself ( doesn’t read books or workout ) 

- doesn’t plan dates and instead ask you to plan acting like he’s respecting you when not. This guy is just too lazy to do anything 

- spend his free time just being couch potato

- has low emotional EQ and only cares about himself 

- thinks that money can do everything 

- also this is personal, but I tend to stay away from guys who’s short or ugly. It’s very rare for a short guy to have healthy ego and self esteem.

We, the average and taller girls got less lucky, not because of our height (which is gorgeous, i used to want to be taller and then i wanted to be shorter, now i'm okay with my height and embracing it since i am taller than at least 25% of the men in my country, no im not joking). We got more unlucky because we get shamed more for our height and for our height preferences, honestly even shorter women get shamed for wanting a very tall man, why should short women get the short men? why are they supposed to be 'satisfied' with them? we don't want them, ya'll pickmeishas can have your 5'7 men.

You can be 5' and want a 6'2 and you can be 5'9 and want a 5'9 or be a 5'3 and want a 6'. it's all acceptable. What's not acceptable is shaming people for it. Why shame women into dating men that their height does not attract them?

Why is liking someone's height or rejecting someone for their height is more shallow than rejecting someone for being tall, flat chested, too 'old'? men reject women for literally anything possible but we dare to set one preference and they go NUTS because of course, we should accept everyone and let everyone have a free access into our pussy. Would they also tell their 5'8 gorgeous daughter to date an ugly balding man who's 5'5? doubt it. They don't want the women who are close to them (mom, aunt, daughter, sister) to settle for less, they want us to settle because we're strangers to them. Don't take dating tips from men, they're just trying to make sure their fellas get to pump (and dump) more of us.

I had this argument with a pickmeisha friend who's 5'1.5, dates a 6'1 (and brags about his height) and asking me why i won't give short men who are 5'5-5'8 the time of the day...do i owe them something? do i know them? their height does not attract me, i don't care.

And before any man messages me or comments here about how we, the women, who caused his height complex. Deal with it, go to a therapist. You think men never made women feel ugly, old, fat, too short or too tall? they did.",44294,Short pickmeishas who shame taller women who want taller men,0,,

As I was dancing I tried to make an eyecontact with him. didn't happen.

got infront of his eyes when I reached for my sweater that was on the table that he and his friend was standing next to. hoped he would see me and ask me for a dance. didn't happen.

the party was ending towards the end so I say ""fuck it"" and went up to him and asked him for a dance. he said yes! so we danced but he was really shy. I was the one who closed the gap between us. that made him gain courage and he hugged me really close to himself and didn't grope my butt or breasts he just held me and kissed me. oh and he caressed my back. do you want another cringy part? I whispered into his ears he could grab my butt if he wanted to bc that's what I was used to, fortunately he just laughed it off.

so at the end of the party I part my ways with him, before that we added each other on facebook, and he says ""I hope we can meet again"". that made me so happy and hopeful. 

few days later we talk on facebook messenger and in the beginning of the 1st conversation he stated he wasn't looking for a relationship. I got butthurt and in a passive aggressive way I told him another time he shouldn't say ""I hope we can meet again"" if he didn't want to get a girl's hopes up. which he agreed with and said he was sorry. 

somehow we worked it out and actually talked casually a few times. but often it would take him days to reply to me. he claimed it was bc of work. another cringy ex pickmeisha move from me: instead of letting him go I went with the ""cool girl"" approach and asked him if he wanted a one night stand. which he agreed to. and we talked about the details for a little bit but life got in the way so we didn't have sex yet. actually he didn't really push for the offer.

so as you can see I did everything wrong. 

currently we don't talk. but during our past casual conversations it turned out that at the time he didn't want to get into a relationship bc he was moving away from his parents.

but I changed since we met. I lost weight, got a better haircut, look better overall and mentally I grew thanks to FDS. now I know what to do with a man when it comes to talking/dating.

I know FDS says if a man wants to make time for you, he will, no matter what. but FDS also says that a man will date/marry a woman when he is ready, it's not about the woman herself but the timing. 

I feel like if I waited and kept talking with him until he moved out from his parents maybe he would have asked me out? 

so let's say he is fine in life right now. let's say he is looking for a relationship. is there anything I can do to fix this? or did I forever ruin my image in his eyes as a pickmeisha? is there a way I could be a HVW in his eyes?

should I write to him?",44285,pickmeisha behaviour ruined my chances with a guy who is probably HVM. can I do something about it?,0,,

A decision I regret daily, if not more frequently than that. At this point I'm not looking for a serious relationship as I'm moving in a few months but I'm also not completely disregarding going on dates as I think ""monk mode"" is silly. I'm also upfront about the fact that I'm leaving but still open to meeting people and seeing what happens. It's more psychological experiment than *looking for my soulmate*.

I say all that to say, the amount of guys who are just looking for casual sex is astounding. Not even just on tinder, but also on the other apps that are more geared towards relationships. For every genuine guy who starts a conversation, there's 20 guys who hit you with the ""wyd"", ""u up"", ""what are u looking 4?"" and various other bullshit that just means, ""I want to fuck"" (double points for the dudes who literally just say ""I want to fuck"" as their conversation starter, those absolute kings). 

I made a post yesterday about how in Ali Wong's new book, she talks about men paying for the **first date** is a sign of effort and an indication of interest and is only fair since we go through extra efforts to be presentable in society. Nobody ever said ""he has to pay for literally every interaction, ever, for the rest of time."" I don't believe that and I definitely didn't say it. That being said, the PickMes and the men hit the post and my inbox with a bunch of whinging bullshit about *gold digging sluts* and ""*but my boyfriend and I split everything and he totally respects me and almost never cheats""*. Like, ok, congrats. That's not what I'm talking about. 

I'll say it again, paying for dates is a **sign of effort**. In the same way that I show up with my hair done, nails done, wearing expensive perfume, wearing non-Walmart branded attire, after getting my body lasered and my eyebrows waxed and the million other shitty things we have to do to be presentable as women. Do men have to put in effort to look good? Kinda. Maybe a decent shirt, real pants if we're lucky, a haircut every few months. But they could also ask out the girls who choose to do none of that effort and they can sit around in sweatpants looking like trash together and pay for the KFC bucket split between them while they watch hentai. Whatever, low effort shit. 

But I'm getting off topic. Women are ***dragged*** for wanting a man to show **effort**. Open doors, buy the first dinner, make actual plans in advance and communicate those plans effectively. These are not huge things. In fact, the fact that these things are even negotiable would be laughable 10 years, but dating is dead so here we are. Women are equally dragged if we ***don't*** put in effort. Our looks are a public commodity, open for ridicule if we don't maintain high physical standards for ourselves.

Which gets me back to my recent OLD experience. Why is it perfectly acceptable, expected, and totally OK for random dudes to degrade me, attempt to use me for sex, ask me to put my bodily safety at risk, so they can masturbate with my body? Why is the state of dating such that I get 10x more propositions for ""NSA FWB fun"" than I do an actual, sit-down, look-each-other-in-the-eyes, honest-to-goodness, conversation date? This is some stone cold bullshit. And mens' appearance isn't nearly as closely scrutinized and gatekept for date-ability. 

And don't talk to me about ""well you're asking for it, you're on *apps.""* This is a strawman. Everyone is on apps. Doctors. Lawyers. My roommate. Acting like women are *asking for it* because they're on tinder is so fucking stupid I literally can't even. 

I had a convo with a guy on tinder yesterday. He said ""can you ditch work for an hour and come fuck?"" I truly do not understand if men understand **how work, works** or the logistical ridiculousness of this question because I have heard it, no joke, 3 times in the last two weeks. I told him, ""I don't have sex with strangers."" and he said ""I respect that, I don't either"". Fucking *lol*. He asked, ""will you make an exception for me?"" and I said ""why would I put my safety at risk for your enjoyment?"" and he said, verbatim, ""well I guess I should become a not stranger"".

We want effort. Men want to put in ***literally the least amount of effort possible.*** If we start out meeting them ""halfway"", it'll be mere days before he's expecting you to be okay with the *lowest* effort. Not just in ""who pays for dates"", in everything. You'll stop **going on dates** and start ""hanging out"". He'll shower less. He'll start expecting you to cook and clean more. He'll stop trying in bed. If you allow a man to take an inch, they'll take the whole fucking mile and then lose respect for you for giving anything at all. He'll say ""*you've changed*!"" because you regressed to the slums with him. The reality is, he wants *you* to put in effort, not him. If you think I'm exaggerating, you just... haven't met men? 

Men are pragmatic in their approach to relationships. ""I want sex for the least amount of effort because it makes me feel good. I don't respect girls that give me sex easily because if she sleeps with me for no effort, she's sleeping with anyone for no effort and why should I value her time and body if she doesn't? To get sex, I have to try exactly ***this*** much and put forth ***this much time and energy****.""* And don't be confused, guys will shit test you. They'll see if they can slack on being reliable, dressing well, putting in the work, and they'll calibrate their effort accordingly, which is why we have to hold ourselves to rigorous standards an expect the same of the people we allow into our lives (and bodies). 

If you think I'm wrong, please start giving those low effort men your precious time. Start sleeping with people who haven't earned it. Devalue yourself to learn the very expensive lesson that you don't mean shit to someone that thinks **buying dinner is too much. Going on dates is too much commitment.** Or learn from the collective mistakes of the women in this sub and realize that having high standards is the only way to maintain your integrity and self respect. Your standards and self-worth will be the only thing standing between you and a thousand men who see you as absolutely nothing but cheap recreation.",44235,Let's talk about the hypocrisy.,1,,

This reminds me of just about any other cult out there. It's sad that something like yoga, prayer, mindfulness, healing, and meditation was co-opted by males and used as a weapon to attack women patients or students out in the open. We need our own healing spaces. We need our own meditation lineages. I personally follow Ali Kamenova yoga only now. No more Ashtanga for me. I just don't trust male teachers anymore. I once went to an Ashtanga studio by a certified Ashtanga teacher (from the Pattabhi Jois academy), and he could not keep his hands off me. He didn't even know my name. He didn't know my health history or if I had any injuries. Every single posture he kept touching me. I did not invite his help, nor did I need it! In his sick mind, simply rolling out my mat was consent. I never went back there again. I really hope more women speak up about what is happening and that more women teachers and leaders join the yoga, healing, therapy, and massage disciplines. Healing disciplines are one of the last places where safe, consented, healing touch exists.

Personally I intend to be more aware and support women doctors, healers, etc... only. The risk of trusting males in these environments where we must let down our guards to heal is just not worth it. Meditating on this topic of males in the healing community abusing power, it is surprising me how much this has happened to me, and I thought my experiences were few. They are actually many, as I'm sure your experiences are.",44218,"Female-Led Yoga, Womanist, Humanist Yoga Alternatives, Meditation and Healing Alternatives",0,,

I want a baby and to start a family but nobody to start it with and feel like I’m at the end of my window. 

I’m coming newly from a failed long term 14 year marriage with a LVM and am 35 this year. I know it will take me at least a couple of years to find a HVM making me 37. Sure there are some people who have had no problems conceiving later in life but I do have some medical issues that could potentially be healed but that will also take a couple of years, still making me around 37.

Part of me wants to wait, knowing that most men and especially the ones that will be available in my age bracket might not have kids or not want a woman with kids (is this true??). Ideally I want a man without kids too. But part of me also wants to say fuck it, get my shit together and try for a biological sperm donor baby while single and not wait for a man to start a family. But I know that most men would probably not want to date a pregnant woman haha, so I’d have to wait until after having the baby to date. How much of the dating market will I realistically lose if I have a child and am a single mom at 35?

Should I wait a few years at 35 years old to find a HVM or am I taking a chance? Has anybody else been in this position before? And do I have any other options?

Here is what I said: “Hi (insert name)! 8:30 works for me. It looks like that bar is on the outskirts of the city. Happy to meet if there’s a bar in a more central location that you have in mind/want to try”

Then he suggested another bar that’s more convenient. Not sure if there’s a better approach though and curious what you all do. 

(Note: I’m well aware that FDS doesn’t endorse drink dates. I subscribe to 95% of FDS philosophy and strategy but for a number of reasons, personally prefer going out for 1-2 drinks on the first date and doing dinner/something nicer on the second date if there’s a potential fit. I’m specifically asking about what you’d say if the location isn’t to your liking, not any other aspect.)",44109,How do you respond when a guy suggests an inconvenient date spot?,0,,

&amp;nbsp;

 Some think it’s better to just ghost the guy and not tip him off to the red flag you saw. Therefore, when he meets the next girl it will still be glaringly obvious and she’ll be able to see it and protect herself. Telling men what’s wrong with them might just help them be better manipulators. 

&amp;nbsp;

Personally, I’m a fan of the brutal one-liner then block. Most of the time when I do this it’s because the person was being outrageous on the date, cat fishing, entitled or overly sexual and I like to bring their ego and gross entitlement back down to reality.

&amp;nbsp;

Something like. “You sound like you have a lot of drama still going on in your life and I’m not interested in taking on additional baggage- sorry” BLOCK. 

&amp;nbsp;

Or 

&amp;nbsp;

“ Your hairline is much further back than in your pictures. You could have posted an accurate photo and not wasted both of our time.. ” BLOCK. 

&amp;nbsp;

Or “you like to hear yourself talk and I don’t”. BLOCK. 

&amp;nbsp;

I ESPECIALLY like to do this if the guy tries to hookup and ask me for sex then I brutally critique his appearance as to why I would never have sex with him and he probably shouldn’t have had the confidence or audacity to even ask.

They lied about their name or work place, from a call center worker he becomes a CEO of a not known company that you can't find on google. Those men, the liars who don't spare details about their very fake richness but won't pick up the phone after 7 because some emergency happens. Those who often lead a double life. I noticed these man have a very similar pattern somewhat:

&amp;#x200B;

**They will not spend money on you**

After watching almost 20 episodes, all those men had a very common habit of not paying. They will ask you on a 'romantic' date that will be a picnic in the park or wine and dine on the beach or a walk in the park but never a restaurant and if it will be a restaurant they will not pay. How can they pay for your meal if they spin plates and lie to 5 other women or more? make it harder to lie to you, use you and manipulate you. Your time IS money and in that case it should be the meal. Watch how he forgets his wallet or something happened and that's why he can't pay for your meal...not because he's simply broke or dating many other women.

**They will often mention that they have money or that they're rich and often mention assets (3 apartments, a big house, a yacht) yet you never saw a single one**

If they're so rich and so successful...why would they brag yet never show you proof? where's his fancy sports car and why is he always renovating his apartment? it's too good to be true. Many men would know that it seems fake and show you a proof, otherwise they wouldn't brag if they want to keep their richness 'lowkey'.

**Unavailable on weekends or most weekdays**

If you're that busy why would you try to date if you can't even make time to shoot me a simple text? they're with their wife and kids on the weekends, not a fishing trip with rich friends. I promise.

They will sometimes use 2 phones, turn around the phone when someone sends a text so you wouldn't see who it is. They will most likely cancel dates or somewhat get flaky and ask to meet up later at night and his place or your place. They will mostly text you late at night.

**They will not introduce you to family**

Their family knows who they really are and unless his family are a psychopath pack that come together like a beer pack, they will *not* be a part of it and most of the times they will cut the man off. Their family mostly does *not* play along so if you've been official and you hasn't seen his parents it's because he's either married, lying about who he is or you're the side-chick.

**They will ask you for small amounts of money**

It will start with 5$ gas money and then 20$ for a gift and they always promise you they'll pay you back but never do, if you leave your wallet and return and you have money missing, don't give a man the benefit of the doubt. He stole it. I thought the man was rich, how come he needs 5$ if he has a yacht? it simply does not add up. They want to leech off you and take as much advantage as you can.

**Their life is 'full' of tragedies**

They want to make you feel pity and empathy, they want you to feel bad for them. Sometimes you have to stop and ask yourself ""did his parents really have cancer while his dead wife had his \*also\* dead baby while his grandmother is in the hospital?"" sure, sometimes people have a very sad life story but sometimes it's just too sad to be true. If you have doubts use google, see if his grandfather really is hospitalized at this specific hospital, google up his parents names, try to find their facebook, etc.

**They will seek vulnerable victims**

If you tell a man ""I just broke up with my boyfriend"" or ""I'm going through something"" and he's a psychotic catfish or a manipulative man, he will use it. He will be so nice and kind to you, lovebomb you and then tell you how he gave everything to you and how he was there for you when no one else was.

**They will refuse to take any pictures**

They will not take any pictures with you because ""It ruins the moment"" or whatever bullshit excuse they might give you and if they do take a picture...he will not post it anywhere. It's a big red flag.

**They reveal too much too fast about their life yet act secretive about small stuff later on**

They will tell you their whole family died within 2 days of talking but not tell you where he been last night after 2 years of dating. They're secretive about the wrong stuff but too open about other stuff. They will make you feel guilty for even asking and act as if you don't trust them when really, they don't trust you.

**They will give you false promises and hopes**

They will tell you how they want to marry *you*, include *you* in their future, want to have kids with *you* but never have any solid plans. They just want to keep you around. They will also say ""I love you"" without even meeting you.

&amp;#x200B;

This can apply to any guy regardless if he's catfishing or just a liar. Google up his place of work, google up his name, find info. Don't give anyone the benefit of the doubt.",44051,How to know if he's catfishing or lying to you,0,,

I had an ex who kept telling me that I'm crazy and psycho or calling me I'm sensitive or overreacting that when I was telling him he's being too close with his female friend. Well, they say women's instinct is always right and it was.

He never admitted and since my ex and I was long distance and I never met her in person nor his school friends, but lot of evidence were indicating that he obviously had feelings for her, while he was looking down on me and making comments about my appearance constantly. he was liking her instagram posts as soon as it was uploaded, go wherever she suggested (even when I was visiting only for week but when I suggested, he'd always refuse to go and if we did go on a date I planned, he constantly complained - even on the last day of my visit he flaked telling me that he got stomachabe from the fancy bbq place I took the previous day), and other things... when I suggested him to goto therapist or talk to her  and his close female friend was studying psychiatry in University College London, he completely took out what he've done to me (emotional abuse) and rather talked only about his childhood abuse, and it couldn't get worse than this. After this I enrolled for masters course but due to going through severe PTSD, and stress because of his emotional abuse I had to withdraw.

And I know in my head that he's the one with the issue and problems, but it really tore my self esteem down.

so, are you personally fine with your boyfriend having close female friends? I'm from Japan and we have a saying that as long as there is night and drinks, women and men can't be friends. also lot of the times if women and men are close as a friends its because one of them has feeling for one another. After this experience, my no.1 pet peeves is guys having close female friends and no matter how I fancy other things about him, I'd rather save myself from the future distress. I always tell myself never will I ever date a guy who has close female friends.

and If I do come across one, or my future bf will be doing what my ex did to me, I told myself that I'll mirror him exactly. I'd make close guy friend and constantly hang out with him and making my bf go crazy on his own.

Oh and…lemme clarify. I’m apathetic about this personally or used to be (no, didn't date around--was focusing on myself until I found an exception). Ended up meeting a sweet, cute man my age that pays autonomously anyway despite me never asking and he’s my fiancé now anyway. Buuuuut…I woulda lived without it. It’s just…really nice and he doesn’t want me to worry. So now it feels normal and for the first time in my life someday I might actually want to have a child--granted in 10 years the marriage still goes strong. I didn't at all expect this (this was my fun best friend, we just talked for many months and hundreds of hours before he confessed), yet this has surprisingly made me feel genuinely safe and not pressured that I always would have to work and take care of the house and child. The option now exists. 

Only a few years ago it was normal in society for men to pay for dates. Yet I’ve seen dudes out there screeching about how psychopathic and love-destroying it is (LOL). 

Let’s see why a man paying for a date is fairer than it seems…

* Women objectively face more of the worst risks of dating more often in the short and long term (pregnancy is life-annihilating); and men are gifted with having to worry mostly just about money. You’re meeting a stranger; you don’t know what’ll happen. Most men probably have “fuck or duck” on their minds. Hell, a man who pays then expects sex on the first few weeks is a gigantic red flag—which is great for us to see so we can dump him
* Apparently women have a “time frame” to get this shit done and so their youth and time is valuable and precious 
* Women usually spend 100-1000$s on their looks a year and a ton of emotional, mental, and physical labor maintaining them in multiple ways, while men mostly spend peanuts and sometimes work out
* Dolling up also takes a ton of time; time is money
* (Crudely) shows initiative and investment on the part of the man which is actually a lot more important for women to look for. I’d say the man who pays more on average cares more (not always); research usually shows the same

Oh. And my favoritest: 

*  Hhem. So. Lemme get this right. You ask out a girl on a date, exhibiting the typical blatant gender traditions, want to show her a good time and impress her probably waste her time, spend gas money…and…you just want to pay half? 

I guess that’s fine. Plenty of decent dudes buy into it, sure, but I honestly don’t think it’s that crazy to prefer the tradition frame, weighing what women have to do and sacrifice.

I think more intuition can be used to judge payers versus 50/50ers (both can be bad or good), though I feel like if you want men to pay and feel reluctant, then…you might as well just be forthright instead. It does the men who aren’t into that a favor too. Better be honest up front then get pissed at them later for being cheap - which is what often happens - but for whatever reason this seems to inspire extreme outrage in men instead. TOTALLY makes logical sense. 

There seems to be this really…bent push for extreme centrism and equality between the genders in “all” ways. A willful refusal to understand that in some ways things are just unfair, and…I’ll be honest…*just not worth it to a lot of women if they have to break even on everything (because in nature things aren't equal, there's far different risks).* I don’t actually think the world can even compute egalitarianism yet in a wholesome, good way. And even then it won’t always be perfect, because Biology is unfair as hell, and so are gender relations. 

Why is this so complicated to understand? I'm not saying men are obligated to pay for everything or should be held 100% accountable for the severe depravity and flippantness of many of their peers, but some things are just quite easy to do.

My first instinct was ""WTF,"" but maybe I'm just out of touch. We had not met. This is the second time we chatted on the app. 

Him: Can you cook?

Me: Well enough to feed myself. LOL

Him: What about me?

Me: What about you?

Him: Cooking for me.

Me: LOL. I don't even know whether or not I am interested in you yet. Are you looking for a mommy or a partner?

I promise.

Here is my facorite rule:

THE THREE MONTH RULE

When you first meet a man you intend on dating, there's always a honeymoon phase. This where the three month rule Congress in. The first 3 months is no sex, no titles. You can go on dates, and you can set your own limits sexually, but no penetration. This does a few things. When you tell him, if he tries to fight it, he's not in it for you, sweetie. Also, there is things that need to happen when during these 3 months - one being, you meet his parents. If they live in another state, you may have an exception, but his parents should know about you with out you nagging about it. You should discuss both of your idea's of the future and see if they are compatible. (Why waste time with a man who doesn't know what he wants? And how can you know he wants you there?)

This book changed my dating perspective and the way I went about dating. I stopped wasting time on guys who weren't trying to see me, and set my bar high for the kind of man I'd want my kids to look up to. I changed the rules a bit; mine was no sex, no titles. If we do have sex in that time frame, it'll be a one night stand and you can take your shit when you leave. This puts him in charge of the situation. He makes the choice. (I'd like to note that it took a lot for me to go on a date with someone, so this wasn't an open invitation to every male I met.) 

With that said, I'll call myself the hypocrite. Two weeks into dating my husband, I BEGGED for him to f*ck me while we were fooling around one night. I swear, he stopped what he was doing and asked me 3 times of I was sure, and then asked me if he could still come back if he did. I stopped. I had never had this happen before. Most men gave in with in the first 3 months and we moved on. I asked him what would happen if I told him my rule still applied and he told me we would be stopping right here. While he wanted to go further, he wanted me more. I made the descision that it was okay. After we were done, he asked again if he could stay. We've been together for almost 6 years, happily married with 2 kids. 

Here's my point, you set your standards. You decide when and what and for how long. He can take it or leave it; because while that one guy thinks you're a lot, another man will see your worth and will want all of you.

For example, I matched with a guy online and he asked me to get drinks and a pizza with him. I was choosing healthier lower carb options plus I’m gluten intolerant so I have to watch how much bread I eat. I told him that I prefer to eat healthier and if they had salad options that would be fine with me. He replied saying that it’s okay to cheat on my diet and that I already look great in my pictures. When I said I was gluten intolerant he questioned if that was really true or if I was just making excuses not to go out with him. I said, you know what, we’re not on the same page so I don’t think this is going to work out and I’d rather not waste your time. I moved on. Next.

     My point is, if he’s not willing to work with you or make compromises when setting up the first date, that is a major red flag. We should never do anything we don’t feel comfortable with just to make him happy. Also, never be ashamed of choosing healthier options or letting them know you have a specific diet you’re following. It does not mean you are stuck up or picky. You are doing what’s best for you. Don’t forget that you also have needs and that you should never feel like you have to change yourself just to make a man happy. You are worthy of someone who is understanding and will respect you.",45539,Don’t be ashamed to tell him your dietary needs when having dinner,0,,

Energetic poverty? I don’t know her...

A dating strategy that has secured my relationship boundaries and saved so much time (works for all relationship types from friends to family to work btw) : 

“Can I emotionally or energetically afford to engage with this person?” 

“Have they earned/afforded my time or energy? Or more of my time/energy?” 

“Can I afford to spend my time or energy doing this activity? With them?”

Your gut answers this immediately and without fail! So is it fatigue or enthusiasm? And then attempt to KNOW WHY (for either answer) so you can communicate effectively and safely. 

Sometimes you have to consider what your ~exchange rate~ has looked like in the past and if you’ve assigned it ANY value in the first place. If you’re worth it, shamelessly proclaim your worth. Respect everything about you, what you know you can offer, and don’t punish yourself if you still feel the instinct to accommodate the undeserving. Practice makes perfect.

Don’t hesitate to tell yourself you love you today!",45539,"Time/Energy is currency, period.",0,,

For this reason, you should be weary of LVM into rough sex, BDSM, and the like. His contempt towards women usually doesn't stop there.

Here are some red flag fetishes. Watch out if you meet a LVM into

* gainers (force feeding women to gain weight)
* BDSM
* 50 Shades of Gray
* ethnic fetishization
* step-sibling porn
* large age gaps
* into artificial enhancements like breast implants, butt implants, lingerie, and **lip filler**
* latex/leather fetish
* rough sex/jackhammering
* doesn't kiss
* thinks deepthroating is normal
* thinks having sex in a car is normal
* talks about ""squiriting"", making women ""squirt"" 
* teacher/student roleplay
* has a signature move he thinks works on every woman in the universe (generalizes women)
* slapping, choking, spitting, violence of any kind.
* wants to come on your face or in your mouth
* weird preoccupation with his own semen
* is into sleeping/drunk sex (this is rape)
* preoccupation with blowjobs
* anal sex
* prefers taking an inactive role and you doing all the work (usually an indication of low energy and low effort)
* thinks giving oral sex is gross
* into threesomes/orgies
* preoccupation with lesbian porn (thinks of women as sex objects)
* into voyeurism, exhibitionism, public flashing and groping in public 
* would rather sext than put effort into courting
* believes the porn look can exist in real life

**Bonus: If he doesn't understand how periods, STDs, condoms, sexual health, or pregnancy work, drop him now and never look back.**

* All of these themes involve the domination, objectification, degradation, and subordination of women. Try to find a man who is crazy about giving you pleasure, giving you head, and ***making love*** if you can. 
* Even better if he says ""making love"" instead of ""fucking"". Someone old fashioned and who truly loves you is going to be a better partner than someone who is **pornsick or self-describes as kinky, adventurous, out-there or wild. These are code words for ""I enjoy degrading women and calling it a part of my sexuality because it's socially acceptable that way"".**  
* If he isn't about to get pegged or swallow his own semen, why would *you* do it? LVM **get off when they see women doing things they would consider humiliating for a man to do.** Fuck that, prioritize your own pleasure in bed. and don't do anything you don't want do. That's what the vast majority of men do anyway, while giving no shits as to whether the woman orgasms. 

LVM these days are out here in whole-ass relationships just jackhammering their gfs who think they're in love and think that their bfs are just subpar lovers, instead of seeing the LVM are literally not serious about them. 

These LVM say ""I love you"" while refusing to reciprocate head and doing a five minute jackhammer sesh with the gf every night. **Do they really love their gfs? No. They're with them for convenience sake and get off on degrading them in the bedroom.** Why else wouldn't they care if their gf orgasms? It's a fake-ass relationship for his convenience**. Men find it preferable to be with a placeholder or starter gf rather than be single for the convenient sex.** 

**It is a lie and a myth that sex is more emotional for women than men. Men are extremely influenced by their emotions.** A man who is in love with you and gives a shit about you is a completely different experience from one who sees you as a sex object is lukewarm about you. Take a  moment to consider, is he really shit in bed? Or is he not even into me and **half-assing  the rest of the relationship too? His laziness, selfishness, and lack of effort in bed are usually symptoms of a much bigger issue in the relationship, not just a sign that he is shit in bed.** 

You can definitely gauge how a man really feels about you through how he treats you in the bedroom. Nothing can make up for being treated with genuine passion and love. There is a difference, you can tell who is looking to spin plates and ""pump and dump"" and who is looking to LTR you by how they are intimately. You can even sense an impending breakup when your bf starts getting lax about pleasing you. 

 feel free to add to this list if I've missed anything.

Secondly, they like to act as if women want lavish expensive dinners every date or something when it's not the case. It's about a man showing they're able to put on the effort and thought. HVM are not low effort men.

It can be a dinner at an affordable restaurant, taking the woman for a picnic, taking the woman to an exhibition, to a hike in a beautiful place. There are lots of ideas that aren't even that expensive that show care and thought.

""Netflix and chill"" at their place or theirs, car dates (lmao wtf?) or late night dates at bars are not it, at least not in the beginning stages of dating at all.

What NOT to do with LVM*

My personal boundary was pushed recently. I’m trying to get back into going out, meeting people talking and generally having a good time by overcoming my anxiety and reluctance. I had dinner with a guy and he was not quite what I was used to—being open straightaway and discussing his dating life. I said okay, some people like sharing and commiserating over bad date experiences. We had a good enough time that we went for coffee after dinner and kept getting to know each other. He mentioned that he was a hugger. RED FLAG. He also blurted out that he can’t have sex with anyone he’s not emotionally connected to. RED FLAG. At the end of the night he did hug me and I was stiff. I just wasn’t comfortable with hugging strangers. 

Texting later, and subsequently nearly every night, he kept being open and discussing his previous exes and using language to express his displease at what they’d done. RED FLAG. I told as much that I didn’t relate my life journey through the lens of how any of past exes were horrible. I try to understand my behavior and response to what happened within any relationship. Bringing up how one did me wrong is unhelpful IMHO. Also, I said I hadn’t made a complete opinion on whether I liked him. We needed to find out more about one another. 

This guy related his personal journey to accepting himself to me and encouraged me to discuss myself more intimately. Like what makes me tick and my rules for living and whatnot. RED FLAG. He admitted I gave him pause being slow to open up after I told him that HE gave me pause by continuing to talk about his relationships with others flippantly. Despite this, we found common ground on self discovery and acceptance of ourselves. He claimed he was at a level of being able to see himself in his mind and work things out via drug experimentation. Higher plane shit. RED FLAG. Most of his ramblings made sense, but I asked open-ended questions for him to elaborate. Still evaluated if I could deal with his openness. You know where that went. Therapist mode activated. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;Last night we got into it over an incident from Saturday night. My new hobby thing was nearby where he was with a meetup group. I’d said earlier I needed hugs and he told me we could hang out after his group thing* Fresh from almost panicking at my new hobby, I really didn’t want to join the group but see him quickly to say hi. He hugged the shit outta me from behind and insisted I go and meet his friends. I said I wasn’t in the mood and he got upset and persisted. My fight or flight mode was activated so I left when he returned to finish up with friends. We went back and back forth texting with him finally calling me, saying I was letting my anxiety win and hanging up on me. Then he texted sorry and agreed to go find a place for us to talk. I felt guilty for saying no and heeding myself over not being ready to meet his friends. 

*This group thing was for depressed and recovering depressed and anxious people. 

During our talk, he proceeded to cry a grand total of six times. Why? Because he saw his scared old self in me who was full anxiety. And he was “emotional”. Y’all he was high. I did not coddle him or fall into that lazy trap. Clearly he was manipulating me to feel bad about not letting him disregard my boundary.  This was ten o’clock at night, I was tired af. 

He insisted on walking me to my transportation home. Fine. A friend calls to ask where he is and if he wanted to go to a bar. The guy talks shit about me being cowardly in a joking way, pulls me in to hug me, gets annoyed that I step back. I tell him I was offended and conflicted because he’s a stranger trying push up on me. On the way to my train he stops to hug me repeatedly and assure me that it’s okay to do that (it’s not even been ten or so days we’ve started talking).

What he was angry about which caused him to deride me through text was that I reminded him of his ex(he kept using her name to describe my actions). She did this just like I did. She wasn’t happy about that just like me. Told him I was not her and to stop trying to punish me for whatever she did. He slipped and called me by her name I think. By that time, I was letting him go on while I was doing something else. I gray rocked him. ‘We can talk when you’re not upset. Let’s talk tomorrow.’ Oh my gawd. He sent me some websites on how not to ‘feed the bad wolf’ aka negativity, transcend like him through getting high, and said “give it a day” to learn to speak his emotional language. 

TL;DR. Ladies, if a guy starts talking about his exes, excuse yourself and disengage. He’s going to unload his drama and want you to fix or play along recreating that drama.

What do you believe the solution is for yourself whenever asked?
- Being honest?
- Lying?
- Or telling him it's none of his business?

So like a year ago, I met this guy who had been trying to take me out. We went out on what I’ll call a group “date,” after which I wasn’t interested and told him I didn’t want to go on a second date. Anyway, he pursued me on and off for a year. A year later, i finally said why not. I was in a very different place at the time of the first date.


Anyway we went on two dates and I really enjoyed the first one, second one was whatever. He had exhibited some behavior in between that I thought was a little immature, not toward me, but in discussing other things. Anyway I told him I just wanted to be friends but we work out together so I see him.  We’ve never kissed or done anything during the dates we went on.

So I’m the past time since that happened, he’s grown on me and I let him know I’m open to see where things go, to which he agreed. I want to continue to build a friendship first. The only thing is...

One of the strongest indicators that a man is high-value and genuinely interested in you long-term, is how he treats you when he takes you out on dates, and this is something you can only observe when you're with the person in person. 

If you're talking to someone long-distance, you haven't the slightest clue how he actually is in real life or how he intends to treat you on dates. This is the biggest problem. He also is able to relax his efforts from a distance, as al**l he has to do is text or call or facetime you for a bit to maintain the relationship**. Being in a different city, state, or country, allows a man to take it easy and be relaxed with his effort. 

Also, his time is unaccounted for in a LDR. You cannot know if he is spinning plates, actually has a steady gf or wife, etc. if you are only speaking/texting at certain times. You are as real to him as a phone app is when you're long-distance. All he sees are your texts and emails. You're basically a virtual gf, and he doesn't even have to take you out. It's a win-win-win all around for the attention-seeking man who likes the ego boost you provide him from a distance. 

For this reason, I advise against LDRs or starting a relationship with someone you've never met who lives far away. LDRs  can work in the rare case the man is high-effort and high-value to his core. This kind of HVM in a LDR isn't going to let distance get in the way of treating you properly, wooing you, and courting you. He is going to send you flowers, gifts, handwritten letters, etc. He is going to be available for you and fulfill your emotional needs. He has a plan on how to live near each other in the future He is going to make time to fly out to see you, or fly you out to see him (on his dime).

Talking on the phone and consistent texting means so much less than what women think it means. What counts is how he treats you on dates. You need to observe his natural male instinct to pursue and whether he has empathy and high-value qualities or not  By participating in a LDR, you are usually lowering your standards. Your needs can rarely be met when the person is as real to you as a phone app. 

If you've been speaking to someone months and months, and it's going nowhere, you're wasting your time. Remember, a **HVM proposes within six months and actively pursues you**

Ladies this stuff works!! Summary of our dates below.

&amp;#x200B;

Initial date lacked chemistry, but he paid for dinner and walked me to my car.  When the bill came I made no move to take it; it was important to set a precedent. 

Second date - sparks flew. He paid for dinner and drinks, walked me to my car, and politely kissed me goodnight. 

We texted a lot over the holidays, and he hinted at meeting up; he was willing to drive 5 hrs and meet up with me (we were both in CA)! 

Third date on NYE, he introduced me to his long-time friend group. They were good people and he made sure I enjoyed myself.  I'm also the first girl he has introduced to his friends, so this was a big deal for him too. He additionally paid for dinner and all our ubers, and did not make a move on me. 

Fourth date; I initiated sex, mostly because of his sexual alignment; and he has been extremely clear that he will never cross boundaries and **always** waits for women to make the move due to this. He is EXTREMELY generous in bed, more so than any partner I've come across.  I'm also someone who firmly believes giving in a sexual setting is very much reflective of how a person acts day-to-day. 

Since 1/1 we've spent literally 48 hours in 5 days with each other.    He is incredibly smart, driven, kind, stylish, and generous.  He's so far paid for every meal and outing.  He very much meets all the characteristics of a HVM (linked below, in case anyone needs it) and has constantly expressed interest in looking for something **serious/marriage,** ***with me****.*  He's also understanding of my personal reasons for not wanting to be exclusive just yet, and is willing to wait and continue to impress me while I figure my shit out.  Overall an amazing guy, thank you so much FDS.

Im a huuuge crystal/mineral lover, (bf/fiancee is aware of this) I have a box of some Ive collected like ruby, garnet, sapphire, etc., so this is really disappointing to me. I havent said anything to him yet, but he still thinks the diamond is real.. But I should add that he did say its only a promise ring, he's going to save up and he will upgrade and get a better ring for me at a future date, because I *did* tell him that I wanted gold but he got silver anyway and I immediately brought that up, so Ive already complained about the ring once to him as it is.. Now my question to you all is, do I express my dislike for the 'SIM DIA' (😒) or would that be too ungrateful? Should I just bite the bullet and wear it?

1) this is important for later: I was in the tech field. He was a school teacher with a degree in literature and wrote poetry. So I would call him a poet. *You write poetry, you’re an artist and a poet is how I see it and I don’t care how much of an amateur you consider yourself. I told him, I had two degrees and was working on my Masters. One was a BA. I also informed him how I was an artist since childhood and that I wrote romance and fantasy stories for years. Therefore, I call myself an artist and a writer. 

During our second date, he felt the need to be proud of our differences and this opposites attract bullshit. I looked at him funny before he started firing off his reasons cause he was white and I’m not lol. I was the first black woman he’d dated. Ugh. He pointed it out anyways :/ but didn’t linger on it. Instead, he ended up saying one of the most insulting things I had ever heard in my life:

As he looks away with stars in his eyes, he gushes, “...I’m an artist and you’re... a tech person.” Eh?!

Because two out of my three degrees were in IT and my title at work???? I explained on the first date, in simple terms, how I was basically a digital artist and that everyone in the office came to me for artistic direction which was one reason I was hired lol. Idk why I didn’t just end the date there.

2) The next day after this second date (that was admittedly fun after that aforementioned nonsense) he calls me on the phone to break things off . HE ASKS,  “you’re strong right?” I say yes but I didn’t understand what he meant so I asked him to clarify. He merely repeated himself to then emphasize that him cutting things off with me will then hurt me less than it’s hurting him. Lol okay. Ever been so confused you’re rendered speechless? 

3) After he is freaking out about telling me he doesn’t think we should see each other anymore, he (I’m legit laughing as I type this shit out) asks me another question: “Is there anything you can say to me to help me get through THIS?”

Now, I’m extremely maternal despite having no children. I’m one of the pillars of my family and ppl come to me for advice all the time/I get punished for being honest or repeateding exactly what was said to me back to them so they can hear themselves. I’m that person. So I’ve made too many mistakes of having little to no boundaries throughout my life (I’m sure you already picked that up) ... until this man-child asked me that VERY question. 

I remember so clearly how I wasn’t angry. I was suspiciously calm and I surprised myself when I replied softly, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what to say to you.” 

It was amazing because I knew myself to always find something to say to comfort someone who is in pain. Even if it was pain they shared with me before but didn’t want to learn their lesson yet. But I felt supported by idk the universe and I immediately took away MY LESSON from his antics and it was that I AM CAPABLE of lettingmy guard down with someone. Despite the predatory circumstances, I emotionally upgraded, right then and there! I didn’t know I could, and even though he was a piece of shit since the beginning, I knew our short interaction was for me at that moment more than for him. 

That man-child had soooooo many other issues that I would never tolerate now. Eg: putting his coat on the café floor. Not on the back of his chair... the floor.

Anyways, it took me months to finally reveal anger towards him (in private). I don’t think I could afford to feel anymore pain without suffering really bad consequences health-wise. 2016 was a tough fucking year. My ex boss of was a bully and I was still working through that trauma despite finally quitting, at the beginning of the year a child I knew died a day before their birthday and they were my first funeral, and another man-child (just before this LVM) I was confiding treated me so poorly for 10 months while I was so vulnerable from work and that death.

I’ve been working on myself so much and though I went through more ridiculous encounters (I even saw him
later at a mutual friends bday party but we didn’t speak) I kept learning how all these losses are massive gains. I have an autoimmune disease that I needed to get under control so if I wanted to literally survive I had to start identifying why I would let any LV PERSON come into my life and abuse any resources or gifts I have. I attracted a LOT of broken folks who wanted someone else to fix them instead of taking a deep dive into their projections for themselves. Still attract them. Back then I was soooo willing to heal everybody else but me! Ew!

Instead of being accessible at all times, I religiously use “No.” as a complete sentence. 

For him to believe he could step on my neck and ask me to breathe life into him at the same time let me know that I was extremely powerful. The unmitigated gall. Think about all the times people have done this to you. Probably happened 10 minutes ago because women are groomed to always create space for others even if it requires erasing yourself entirely. That’s a lot of reprogramming of the mind to work through but it’s worth every effort. To tell that idiot I would not provide for him felt like the most amazing feeling in the world. I charged up vs experiencing that sacrificial drain. I put up a boundary and sort of have to thank that LVM for how badly he treated me. I wish it didn’t take that moment to shamelessly confirm I’m worth way more than that, but it is what it is.

Need some encouragements? Here you go: 

-Not long after, I stopped identifying as an empath and started calling myself a “pathfinder” because you can exercise the choice to let someone tap into what you have to offer. “I choose which way I will go in this moment.”

-Preservation is a key survival trait!
(I’ve been on an incredible upswing in the last few months, I am happy with who I’ve become and chuckle at the fact that his now girlfriend looks almost identical to me even down to my hairstyle he spoke negatively of I had when I met him.)

-2020 is going to be cute for all of us who have been doing and are willing to do more of that ugly, uncomfortable internal work. Beauty is one of our only commodities, huh? Well, get ugly ladies! You’re valuable regardless of what you find or how the world treats you. 

-Don’t be afraid to lose friends, lovers, or even family over setting standards for yourself, and practice confirming what is true about you. Phew! 

-Once you learn how people react to you knowing what you won’t stand for, they start shaking. Let ‘em quake! *stay safe tho*

-History is a great teacher, but don’t be a habitual time traveler! Being present is important for your health! Don’t bleed all over people who didn’t cut you.

-As habitual creatures we are capable of breaking old patterns to create new ones. You can do it, and you can’t convince me otherwise. ;)

-No more of “I wish”/“I hope”. Know what you ARE and know the sold as the impossible IS POSSIBLE. Speak on it as though it is already in your life such as love. Fall in love with yourself and learn what your daily balances of give and take can feel like. Try to stop saying “I can’t” towards the things you dream of. 

-Listen to your needs, and learn how to listen to your fears because you can’t be brave unless you know fear. 

-Be a fool, take a leap and make mistakes. And distinguish between “mistakes” and “patterns”.

-see a therapist/professional if you can because lemme tell you... when a professional spells YOU out, the wheels really start turning as do your fortunes. Knowledge is powah!

-if possible, be vulnerable with trusted comrades because despite the level you’re at on your healing journey, you still have to deal with this world as a human lol

-empty and fill your cup when you want to and be a cheerleader for the deserving!

I have more, but maybe I’ll do a different cheerleading post elsewhere. I’m excited for 2020, and I hope any of what I said was able to help or remind someone of their personal strengths.

Sincerely,
The lady who was officially tired of being tired.",45307,What I learned from dating a LVM,0,,

A year later, I (37f) am 11 months into a wonderful relationship with a top-shelf USDA Prime man. Here’s the breakdown of things I did right, and ways I didn’t follow FDS.

Things I did right:
* My life was awesome. I was very happy, with friends, an interesting job and career, financially secure, exercised daily, had hobbies that took up all my free time
* I had high self-esteem. I knew that meeting the right person is a numbers game, and that I deserved the best. I wanted someone who would be very excited about me, who would think I’m the bees’ knees, the cat’s meow
* I set a goal of going on 50 dates in the year
* I used Tinder
* Keep chit chat on the app to a minimum, the “getting to know” each other is for in-person dates. Don’t chat for weeks without meeting up, that’s a waste of time. The 50 date goal is 1 date per week - that forces momentum
* Dates were scheduled at times and locations which were convenient to me
* I dated 2 guys at the same time. My 1st choice was scheduling dates at a rate of 1 per week, so I went on dates with the other one. Would have added a 3rd if there was room in my calendar. This is so critical! Honestly that 2nd guy was great too, and I’m really glad I dated him. It allowed me to tolerate the slower-than-desired pace of the 1st relationship. He truly had to compete for my time
* I waited for him to initiate conversations and to invite me on dates. After 4 dates/invites, I did 1 ask of “Do you want to get together on Thurs?” This way, he continued to lead and pursue 
* I was not available all the time. A few times he asked for a date last minute (tonight) - once I said “yes”, a few times I said “no” because I was out of town. My life was busy enough to require scheduling in advance 
* When a job promotion came up in 2-3 months into our dating which requires me to move across country, I moved on a dime. I did not consider altering my life’s course for him
* Consistently kept my frame: I am more important to me than he is
* No discussions of future, or feelings, or our relationship until he told me he was in love with me 5 months in

Things in which I diverged from FDS:
* I asked him on the 1st date through Tinder. The first meetup isn’t a real date imo.  Match with a guy, initiate the conversation, ask him out, it doesn’t matter, it’s just faster and more effective. I did that in 10 mins on Sunday, date was set for Monday 
* We had sex on the 2nd date. HOWEVER, this is what I always do. I have sex for my own pleasure, and very selfishly. I accept oral sex, I do not give. It doesn’t change my feelings for the guy, it doesn’t make me tender or permissive or attached to him. Men can sense that. Getting to sex is by no means “arriving”. It’s important to evaluate the quality of sex and the effort he puts into it as part of the relationship
* I asked to split the bill on the 1st date. It was at a restaurant that he chose, I was hungry and wanted to order excessively. I may be wrong, but for me, asking to split the bill is also a test of how easy-going he is - some men don’t respond well to that at all. He paid for all subsequent dates
* I ignored what FDS calls red flags: his profession (military), single status (very recently divorced with a small child), timing of dates (Mon/Tues for the first 2 months, due to the custody schedule)  — however, I paid attention to what he did, what he said, and how he treated me — and he was impeccably attentive, responsive, caring, and intelligent 

As a result, I have a relationship where:
* For half a year, he would fly 6 hours across the country to see me every 3 weeks
* He is happy to pay for most of our time together even though I make marginally more money and have lower expenses
* I do zero emotional labor. He is fully self sufficient, and provides emotional support to me instead 
* I do zero household work. Even when he visited me in my apartment, he would clean my apartment and do my laundry. He is happy to do chores for me that I dislike 
* He is a match for me intellectually and spiritually. I can’t tell which one of us is smarter than the other 
* Sex is totally targeted to my pleasure
* He is happy to spend all his time hanging out with me, my friends, my hobbies, my family. He is charismatic and very likable. My father loves him
* He’s good-looking, five years younger than me, and in great shape with six pack abs",45293,My 2019 New Year’s resolution was to go on 50 dates,0,,

Since following this sub I’ve implemented a lot of things from here into my marriage. My husband started out as a HVM, he would pay for everything and plan dates etc etc. After we got married I found out he was enmeshed with his mother and had a history of objectifying women and (teens and above, he is in his early 40s) that stemmed from lack of female contact from his adolescence (due to his mother not allowing girls in) and from a past porn addiction and other abuse as a child. I would constantly fight with him and it wasn’t until I started using FDS principles (unknowingly) that things have started to change.

I put my foot down and packed all of my belongings. I made him chose his mother or me (she is very awful, toxic, racist and trying to end our marriage so going no contact was the only way to go). He chose me and did therapy. He is now no longer enmeshed and has not been in contact with her for years. (If anyone else is having mother-in-law problems please check out the JustnoMIL reddit. 

Then the porn addiction from the past issues came into light soon after as a symptom of this. We argued for many months and he tried to gaslight me into thinking how he thought was normal. “That’s just how men are” kind of thing. I knew it wasn’t and I once again packed my bags. He had once again chosen the therapy route and is working on it with hopeful progress. 

This brings me to where we are today. I waited many months before sleeping with him when I met him and he admitted to me that if I had slept with sooner, that he would have had less respect for me (I always knew it was true!). I also put down boundaries that I was not having sex with him until this issue is fully healed from symptoms of the porn addiction. I told him once he is healed then we can start as if it’s a new relationship as there is a lot of damage done. I let him know once he’s healed that we won’t be having sex for at least 6 months and that he must make amends to me (for other stuff related to that). I also straight up told him that he would have to spend at least $10k (we’re broke right now so it’s a lot of money for us) before I would consider having sex with him. My price is high 😂 and I get a LOT of attention from men so I wouldn’t have any problems if we broke up. Judge me if you will. He genuinely agreed to all of it, told me I’m worth it and that he wouldn’t do that for any other woman because he believes I have more value than other women because I’m essentially not a pickmisha. 

I know some people would just tell me to dump him, and not be so blunt with my expectations but we have been together for over a decade and besides the issues he has that stem from childhood he is great in every other way. And the principles I have been instilling have been working. 

I know that mental health issues that stem from childhood, especially ones that stem from this sort of thing would be permanent. He could very well not be able to heal. But because of FDS principles I was able to set up boundaries, and for now they are working. And in the meantime I’m working on levelling up myself. If for some reason it doesn’t work out, I know I’m good, and I know FDS will be there for me for my “dating journey.”",46653,FDS works in marriages too,0,,

And im just like... What are they seeing that im not? But anyway....


It got me thinking about the ideology of MGTOW and redpill and the deep, depraved hatred for women that is promoted there. They casually discuss abusing women, they brigade threads together (whenever a thread is posted by a single mom for example they crosspost and mock it), they incite cruelty, they exploit and sexualize minors, they take over subs (for example the subreddit ""unpopularopinion"" is their personal swamp now, they have all these disgusting satellite subs like ""thewall"" where the entire point is to bully, hate, and pick apart women. and its spreading and getting worse. they bleed into real life, we're all aware of the sociopathic shit that those men do in the wild after being indoctrinated online. From my view it's a truly dangerous culture bubbling up. Young men are susceptible to manipulation, and lots of young socially awkward men come to reddit. Its easy to see how they can get sucked in to the toxic culture here.

**I know this sounds dramatic but terrorist groups indoctrinate each other online.** People were hesitant to acknowledge incels as being budding terrorists. And look what has happened in the past few years with that mess. 

In additon to all that, I thought reddit had rules about ban evasion? So why arent they doing anything about the obvious traffic of banned incels that clearly flocked to redpill/mgtow etc? I dont get how reddit admins can justify those subs. Menslib is just one example of a great sub for men. If men truly want advice and support to become better people there are options for them. No one is becoming better from mgtow etc.

Reddit sprang into action and have been so consistent about banning fat hate type subs (which is admirable) but theyre ok with women hating subs?? Does mgtow and redpill give reddit a lot of traffic or something? Are they afraid of shutting them down for fear of losing precious basement dwelling degenerate neckbeard incel types that make up so much of reddit?? Thats gotta be it, right? They must have demographic stats that we don't see. But does any one have any information or experience with sub banning? Can someone explain to me why some subs get banned while others get celebrated? Is it personal? As in, do reddit admins participate in redpill themselves or something??",46648,"Seriously tho, how is it that MGTOW, redpill etc haven't been banned?",0,,

What do all of the above have in common? A false sense of demand, scarcity as they call it. Men like to use this strategy in hopes you will take the bait. LVM tried to use this strategy on me many times before I started analyzing the routine.

Here are some examples:

A guy I went on a few dates (met through a mutual friend) with started to answer his phone and put it on loudspeaker. Before this he told me a sob story about the love of his life breaking up with him and him almost killing himself via alcohol. His fromer ""crazy"" girlfriend started crying about how much she misses him and they needed to get together again. He looked at me with a smirk ""I told her to stop calling."" I asked him why didn't he just block her, but he said she sometimes called from a different number anyway. Why did you answer your phone then? ""I just wanted you to hear."" I looked at him and said "" she'll love you more than I ever will, I don't feel like going out with you anymore"" I paid for the food and left. Later he called me saying he'll kill himself I hung up and he kept calling. He tried to invite himself over to my house but I told him no, and if he threatened too kill himself again I'll send the cops over for a check-up. I changed my number after that. 
Last time I checked he hasn't looked himself and suckered some poor girl into fwb. He tried to message me on an app I forgot to block him on.

Second story

I knew this guy since middle school, and we would hangout with a small group of nerds like us (no longer part of the group, got weeded out cuz I didn't want to duck any of them). Anyway this guy always came to me for advice and we always hung out. I always made sure to pay my share. Eventually we became adults and started hanging out less, cool. We would still talk via  videogames. He asked for advice on dating a chick, and I gave it to him. After we stopped talking all together, cuz we wouldn't respond to our old school group chat (5 of us). One day I got a call from a mutual friend telling me ""did you tell Yugi congratulations?"" (Congratulations?) ""Yah he got married."" (Yugi? He didn't tell me, I thought we were friends). Later I got a message in my DMS asking for a job for his then wife, after not telling me he was married five weeks ago. Now he only messages me if he wants favors.  Naw bro, I ain't about that life.

I got more but I got frustrated. I'm going to listen to Lil Kim. Feel free to add on the comments.",46647,Male friendship? The value of supply and demand and how men try to create false scarcity,0,,

I have posted this in another group, but someone suggested i post this here!

Anyway,  as the title suggests, i don't know what i am doing wrong. I have been  single for 3 and a half years. My last relationship was very toxic and  totally changed me as a person. Not getting into it as thats a whole  post in itself, however i was left feeling like an soulless vessel and i  was lost. I understand the first year or two of being single was trying  to figure myself out again, but nowadays i just feel like guys only see  me as sex. They commit to a few dates and then as soon as they get what  they want, i get ghosted. This may come down to my choice of men,  however there is a certain type of man who would match my personality  type. I don't want to wear the pants, but i also don't want to be able  to run all over my SO.. i need a challenge and someone who will  challenge me, not someone who will fall at my feet and give me  everything i want for nothing.

I  am not what society classes as 'unnattractive', if i were rate myself  honestly i would say i was 7/7.5 out of 10, I am intelligent and down to  earth, i have a dry and sarcastic sense of humour however know when it  is appropriate, i am low maintenance - dont wear much makeup, dont dye  my hair or get fake nails/fake tan, i have blue eyes, brown hair,  glasses and fair skin with an hourglass figure and i am chill in the  sense of if someone does something i don't agree with i am rational and  will always try and see things from their point of view which determines  my reaction.

I don't want this  post to be an 'awh give me sympathy' post and i am fully aware i should  be lucky enough to even be asked out on dates, however its just  frustrating feeling like i am doing everything right and getting shut  down.

I gain alot of attention  specifically from men in relationships which i HATE. I have never  entertained the conversation and always shut it down as soon as i find  out. I did call on guy out on it however because i was curious. I asked  him why he is wanting me when his girlfriend was a solid 10 and he  responded with 'because i know you would be able to satisfy me better  sexually than she does' but i have NEVER been suggestive towards him so i  got really upset about that. I feel like people misinterpret my  confidence for flirtiness or see my confidence as a 'daydream' for what i  would be like in bed.

I am just  confused and wondering if anyone has any suggestions as to what i should  be doing differently? Thanks in advance for any advice or constructive  criticism!",46649,I (24F) dont know what i am doing wrong to take things to the next level..,0,,

Since Nate does identify with being a straight male, and Jeffree is extremely feminine and agrees with Nates orientation I figured I’d try to make a post here. 

please tell me someone thought about FDS while watching that breakup video? 

 Jeffree started dating Nate when they both had nothing, and Jeffree was the breadwinner who went on to create a 7-figure net worth within 5 years.  Nate starts checking out of being a partner  in the world Jeffree built about a few months ago, and ended it this week. For years issues about side girls in Nates DMs plagued their relationship as well but Jeffree always publicly defended him.  Jump back to the present, where there is now a video of Jeffree alone in his new 15 million dollar dream home he has to live in alone crying about not waking up to the love of his life.

The scale of this breakup sort of reminds me of Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott. 
Men in their true masculine will never bow to life as an accessory or dependent.

Sometimes, this comes from a very healthy place of personal growth and betterment. Women who want to be more confident, more healthy, more financially stable, more educated, etc. Sometimes, though, it seems to take a darker turn, and women feel like they have to change their appearance, their interests, their entire lives, or who they fundamentally are, to be ""worthy"" of a man who doesn't treat them like garbage. 

There's a cultural idea of a HVW - an IG model-esque high-class urbanite in a high-powered white-collar job. That idea does not come from this sub. That comes from social influences that have told you that's the only way to be a woman of value. TV and movies and instagram have given you that image. And I'm here to tell you that it is wrong. Those women have value - there are plenty of them on this sub - and so do you. They are queens, and so are you. You have value, just the way you are. 

The best version of you, the high-value version of you, is unique to you. Being high value isn't about whether or not you know how to contour or look good in a wrap dress. It isn't about how much money you make, what your job title is, or what level of education you achieved. It isn't about your sexual past. 

Being high-value is about knowing your worth. It's almost a tautology - you become high-value by knowing that you are already high-value. You have something unique to offer this world and any man lucky enough to share it with you. You improve the lives of the people around you - with your humor, your intelligence, your kindness, your hard work, your spirituality, your creativity, your generosity, with whatever makes you, *you*.

So here's a shout out to all the tomboys, the hippies, the women who work ""dirty"" jobs, the single moms, the sex industry survivors, the country girls, the former pick-mes, the dropouts, the trauma and abuse survivors, and every woman who has ever felt like she doesn't ""measure up."" No woman deserves the way LVM treat us. We *all* deserve love, respect, loyalty, and equality. No woman was put on this earth to be a man's fuckmommy.  Take control of your life. Be the best version of you. Demand better. This sub is for you, too.",46642,"For every woman who thinks she ""doesn't deserve"" a high value man.",0,,

Booked reservations at a lovely restaurant..respectful..we share a lot of values and seem quite compatible. Second date planned as soon as the first ended. 

He texted today saying his friend had a bereavement and he had to travel out of town for the funeral and support his friend so had to cancel our date. When I said that's fine and sent my condolences he apologised and went a bit quiet. Later he asked if we could meet for a drink that night before he left though it would be quite late in the evening. I hesitated to agree and told him it's a bit short notice as I've had a busy day and may be tired in the evening. I also didnt want to come off as being readily available. But after a couple of hours I figured he had a good reason to  cancel the initial date and I didn't want to wait over a week to see him again, we had a good vibe. I said I would meet him that evening before he left. 

He then texted saying he thinks he is being selfish to drag me out tonight when I am tired and he would rather date 2 be a fun evening rather than him being in a sad mood because of the bereavement. I didn't know how to react so I just said ""Ok"". I want to tell him that I don't enjoy the push and pull, he cancelled our initial second date and now cancels the plan he rescheduled at short notice. I feel like a puppet and it's frustrated me.

As I'm sure many of you can imagine this brought low quality men to me like moths to a flame and I would bend over backwards to please them. [TW] Was raped 3 times between the ages of 19-21 Figures the first guy willing to be in a relationship with me would be a drunken decade older than me vapid loser. I was 22 and he was 31. As per my mother's conditioning I valued his feelings over my own well being and am now paying the price. We were together 3 years. The last year he became increasingly nasty to me. Name calling, wall punching, screaming at me who refused to stand up for myself and never instigated a fight or fought back. Pissed on our dishes in the sink that we used to make our food to punish me for washing them wrong. To top it off turned out to be cheating with a younger girl who he left me for.

This all went down a few months ago. I'm broken and recovering and am furious that I was so blind to see abuse as love. BUT I'm growing up and growing a spine. 

This is a small little blip compared to the backstory but I'm so happy with myself for my response. Boy in my friend group makes it clear he likes me. 

Reason #1 I'm proud is I don't really give a fuck. Before my relationship any attention a man showed me I immediately reciprocated and wanted their approval. This guy seems cool but gives me fuckboy vibes so I proceed with caution and agree to meet and hang out.

Reason #2 I'm proud is I stood up for myself! The dude started saying how we were going to cuddle/basically telling me I was going to spend the night and I replied telling him I wasn't comfortable agreeing to be touched or stay the night before I got there. He replies saying it was a ""joke"" (Sure, Jan).

Reason #3 is I apparently have a spine! I was pretty turned off by our convo thus far but hadn't written the dude off yet. I was having a bad day already and was not up to entertain a man and realized going for the hang out would be more of a chore than fun for me with the mood I was in so I texted him letting him know I was backing out for the evening because I wasn't feeling it. 

He gets all pissy and asks ""what he did"" as if my not feeling it isn't a good enough reason. I'm proud most of all because I still have no issue with any of this. I'm fine with him being mad or feeling rejected. It's not my problem and for the first time in my life I DON'T CARE!

He can be mad and in his feelings and I have no desire to please him. 3 years ago I would have fallen for his complaining/projecting onto me and gone over to make sure he knew it was me not him... but I'm just shook that I'm FINE. I FEEL GOOD ABOUT VALUING ME OVER HIS FEELINGS.",46605,Proud of myself.,0,,

And the plot thickens. I spoke to the guy I'm seeing yesterday on the phone. (After a couple days of doing my own thing, going out with friends, not texting him etc.)  We chatted about our day, and I eventually told him how I feel as far as the effort level in the relationship, feeling wanted, etc.  He explained that he was kind of in a funk etc. Ok fine whatever. He kind of glossed over it, and he asked if I would come over later. He was also being really supportive about the job thing, which I really appreciated. (As I mentioned in the last post, I got fired a few days ago so I've felt like crap.) 🙄 I left the conversation feeling good about things, and I did go over to see him later in the afternoon.

We went shopping for a bit, then went and got groceries and talked about making food - breakfast and dinner the next day, etc. So we got ingredients for that stuff.  We went back to his place and watched a movie, then got take out. We had great conversation as usual, and we talked about things we wanted to do together this summer, etc.  When it was time for bed, I was being pretty suggestive and I started escalating our usual cuddle routine lol. He didn't seem into it so I asked him if he wanted me to stop, and he blurts out, ""I don't feel any sexual desire right now at all."" Ummm ok... He goes on to say that he's been feeling this way recently, and that he thinks it's because he's started drinking less and processing the break up with his ex, etc. So he's been kind of down, and he doesn't feel sexual attraction to anyone, he definitely finds me attractive, and he doesn't want me to think it's my fault, etc.

So I absorb this for a sec and then I get up to get some water and go to the bathroom. I cannot STAND getting rejected sexually - it really crushes me.  So I come back and he says, ""I hope you don't hate me,"" and he continues to explain that he likes doing things with me, and says something about ""friendship"", ahhh!  And he asks me to be patient with him, because he wants to be able to let himself feel happy but he's basically shutting off his emotions right now. Hmm. We talk a bit more and go to sleep. The next morning we get up and he's not really talking to me and I feel very awkward obviously. 

So eventually I go get my coat and stuff and say I'm going to leave. He seems shocked/hurt and asks why. I don't really remember what I said but I did say that I figured he had things to do etc. He goes, ""Well I guess I'll figure something out.. "" and he seems pissed/sad. I ask him if he's mad and he says no. I go outside and my car is frozen solid so I start it and go back in and tell him that I'm going to let it warm up.  He starts cleaning and stuff and ignores me. I try to make small talk and he shuts it down. Then he comes in and says my car should be warmed up by now. I said, I know. I'm standing there, and I feel bad that I somehow made him feel bad and maybe I overreacted. I asked if he wanted to do something today and he said no. I said, well can we at least talk? And he says no, you need to leave. I ask why and he says, I just want you to leave. I say, what did I do? He says, nothing - but you need to get the hell out of my house. 😳 At this point, I'm stunned, and I leave. 

I'm pretty numb at this point, but also really pissed at the way I was treated, when I don't feel I did anything wrong. As I explained in the other post, I've done nothing but give in this relationship, and he obviously doesn't give a shit about me, nor does he recognize any of my effort.

I don't want to let this drag on.  I don't want to accept any apology that might come.  I haven't been on any of the apps for months because I've been so happy being with him, and I don't think I'm ready to jump back in for awhile. I just feel hurt and used, and I have zero faith in the male species at this point.  Fuck all of this!",46606,Annnnd I'm spiraling. Help me get a grip!,0,,

I just saw a show about mothers trying to find a fitting partner for their sons. I absolutely hated it. While I could laugh about that type of show in the past, now that I am confronted with literal manbabies more often, I despise how those mothers are actually just trying to find someone to do their sons laundry and housework. This isn't how women should be treating each other!

I get that being a mother is really hard and that these women probably just gave in at one point, because their babies didn't turn out the way they wanted them to. But searching for a woman to put into this misery is wrong in my opinion.

Literally all of the men in this show say that they don't care about the looks of a woman, she should be ""nice and caring"". It's obvious, that they don't really want a real partner at 35+, but rather someone to do the housework, make them food and playing with their probably porn-sick, limp peepee. Most of those guys look like they shower once a week and don't know what a toothbrush is. It's disgusting as hell!

I absolutely LOVE that this subreddit exists and less and less women let LVM use them. I cringe hard, when I think about all the pick-me's who think that the men in the show are worth their time. 

Don't ever let loneliness manipulate you into playing maid for a LVM. Don't be his second mother! Even if you are a mother, don't let your son USE you. If he doesn't do his laundry, it's literally HIS problem. If he doesn't cook, HE will starve and it's not on you! Women are NOT slaves to males!

They communicate mostly through snapchat, have only been on two real dates (one that she paid for at a place that was within walking distance of his house) and he'll often ask her to come over at 2 am after he's been out clubbing or drinking.

She came to the conclusion that she needs to start seeing other people. I tell her that's a great idea! Don't throw all your eggs in one basket! Her response is to start berating me and being needlessly mean when all I did was try to be supportive.

She would never do this to the guy who's stringing her along. The shittier he treats her, the more hoops she's willing to jump through. But with friends? Catty. Rude. Mean. I can't take it anymore. The further I get in my leveling up journey, the more I recognize people I no longer want in my life.",46595,Has anyone noticed their pick-me friends hold the guys they're dating to a different standard?,0,,

Fairly nice looking, owns his own home, drives, decent job, ambitious, lots of hobbies and (I thought) very polite and complimentary. He lives a couple of hours away so he said he'd get an air B&amp;B so he doesn't have to worry about driving back that night. 

So it came up in conversation what the plan is and he said ""I was thinking watch some movies and have a few drinks"". I was completely confused what he even meant then he explained he meant for this all the happen at whatever place he ends up getting for the night. 

I made it known I wasn't overly comfortable with that and he very quickly apologised and said he just thought since we've both spoke about liking our own company or being a bit socially awkward and that I love films so much it'd be a good idea (lol I know) 

Because other than this one slip up I thought maybe it wasn't worth writing him off because of it since he retracted it really quickly and said we can do something else, I posted in this sub asking what I should do and you all (obviously) said to be done with him (thankfully). 

I'd pretty much come to the conclusion on my own not to go out with him, and was ready to say no whenever we next spoke. However he didn't message me after that. 

I didn't really care because I wasn't very invested anyway, but I was ranting to my mum about how if he was just interested in sex surely he doesn't need to drive 2 hours and get a hotel for the night and can find someone local. Then mum said ""maybe he's a predator or a rapist so he doesn't do it too close to home"". 

Then he posted a trail of Snapchat stories of saved videos he's posted on tik tok, and something about them just really gave me the sveevies about him.

I finally left the house!! after splitting in September, one incident where I could have died, countless abuse and some instances where he lost control, I am finally out of that shitshow.

How much of a shit show? He flew in his ex from another country while I was away for Christmas and told me when I got back “Yeah, she was here but ya know what? I don’t actually want her anymore”... my only reaction being “umm I don’t care”. And he stole my cat, which he will probably rehome anyway.

Anyway, police had to be involved that morning as he wouldn’t let me exit the house. I ended up locking myself in the bathroom. Then he tried to say that I could leave, just not without the cat. Bc he knows I wouldn’t do that. Well... I had to. And now I’m kinda sad about it. My cat was dope. And I know I don’t have enough energy to go through courts for her. And even if I did, he’d abandon it and say she got lost. I just feel done.

For the satisfying part: went out, tired as hell on earth but I looked bomb! I was dancing away and suddenly he’s in the club. I was livid! But danced away. Then my girls wanted to go to a second club. Guess who shows up and looks furious to see me in there as well? The Fuckhead! I honestly felt so good.

Also I'm on mobile so forgive my formatting!

I was with an abusive asshole for over 3 years now. I've lost jobs, friends and even family because of him. My self esteem plummeted and I felt as if I deserved it. He constantly made me feel like crap because I've had partners before him. He wouldn't believe me when I told him that I was a virgin. I really think sex is something I'll only ever have with my husband. Of course I've dated before but I've never been foolish enough to sleep with anyone.

He would constantly compare me with his exes, female friends etc and I would feel extremely hideous. He convinced me no one else would want me and I'd die alone. At that time, I felt like that would be the end of the world for me. Not anymore though.

I found this sub when it had a little under 25k subscribers and was really blown away by you awesome ladies! I would literally check it every day and it honestly boosted my self esteem so much :) I read every day about how you take care of yourselves and how you're all so hardworking and have amazing jobs. It inspired so much that I'm going back to school/uni to get my bachelor's in psychology. I quit half way because ex bf would say how it's such a useless degree and whatnot.

I'm now happy and healthy and single. I don't plan on dating for a few years because I want to work on myself and my career. I dumped my bf and moved back in with my mother who had tears of joy in her eyes. She knew I'd make the right call sooner or later.

I just want to say thank you to every single one of you girls that posted here. You gave me a new sense of hope and the strength to stand up for myself.

When I finally had enough back in 2015 I kicked him out and didn’t recognize who I was anymore. We’d broken up many times, he’d move out with a friend or back to his moms but always came back. This time felt different for me emotionally. I was FED UP. Shortly after he moved out I learned he actually moved in with a girl he had met on POF. I was able to log into his account and read through their messages. I did the math, he had know her for exactly A WEEK when he moved in. I’ve never been so grateful for a pick me in my life. I’ve been through a lot of shit with him since  but ultimately it lead to me move to another city and disappeared after the courts wouldn’t grant another restraining order after the first one expired. I have not seen him or responded to any texts they’ve sent since Aug 2017. His gf text me from new numbers every few months. One time she event text me on Mother’s Day to tell me what a terrible
Mother I was for keeping my kids from him. 

In the last few weeks I’ve been having some weird dreams due to quitting smoking weed. He’s popped up in a few of these and it’s always the same scenario.  I allow him back in the kids life, he founds out where we live and turns into the monster he was before. It’s taken awhile for me to feel comfortable again but I’ll never shake this fear. So today when I saw his email pop up I was paralyzed for a few minutes. The only thing his email said was “How are my babies?”.  I do not plan to reply. I honestly don’t know what I’d do if he actually started the proper legal proceedings to gain visitation. I don’t think he’d ever actually put in the work to do this. He didn’t work the entire time we were together and I imagine he’s not doing much better now. 

Even with all the ways this made me feel today I still see so much progress in myself. In the past when I’d receive a random message it would ruin my whole day. I use to have anxiety and severe depression leading up to holidays worried they’d try and contact me. Not today.

It was quite busy, and we asked to share a section with a couple who were sitting across from each other on opposite sofas. There were four of us and two of them. After a little while, the woman noticed my guy colleagues were standing, so she asked if we'd be more comfortable if they moved to one couch and let us have the other couch.   
This woman is beautiful and has this warmth I felt as kindness. We all started talking. She seems very interesting. He, on the other hand, was sort of mysterious. He looks like a model and didn't seem as warm as his date. 

After a bit of chitchat, my colleague randomly asked 'so how did you guys meet?' They both looked at each other awkward and said 'errmmm, it's our first date, we met tonight'. My colleagues and I were sort of embarrassed and tried to excuse ourselves. They said it was fine. Of course, by this point, my group was pretty wasted. My older colleague said 'Oh man, the last time I went on a first date was 18 years ago and she's now my wife, but I do remember how exciting first dates are'. 

He immediately exclaimed 'WELL, I'M NOT READY FOR THAT!'

He also immediately regretted it. The woman tried to play it off and pretended like she was going to get up and leave. We all laughed uncomfortably. 

Then, the waiter came by with the bill for a signature, he gave it to the man. He awkwardly pointed to his date. She signed for it. 

Somehow, the topic of restaurant recommendations came up because we were visiting from out of town. There was a recommendation the woman suggested, and we all agreed it looked like a good option. So, the guy said 'I think it'll be an excellent second date option then', and he looked over to her smiling. She uncomfortably said 'as long as he pays for it' and laughed nervously.

At this point, the FDS in me started to boil, and I had to say something. I was sitting next to the woman, I turned to her and asked 'Wait, he didn't pay for your drinks tonight?' She said 'Well, we've been here for about five hours. He got the first round, and I got the second. We've been taking turns paying. You know, modern dating, right?'

Oh gals, I felt for her. I really did. Here is this beautiful woman who seems to be very kind and cultured on a date with this hot man who is certainly fuckboy level and possibly a LVM. 

Our interactions were short because we got another table, thankfully. Before we left, I leaned over and said to her 'Girl, let him pay. You deserve it 100%'. She smiled nervously. 

I don't know what happened after that. A few hours later, we didn't see them when we left.

When I broke up with my exes, my mood gets high and low, and I sabotage myself because I did not know how to cope. Well, I know what to do, but the pain of losing someone makes me feel that something died inside. It is the worse feeling, but I think it is manageable.

Emotionally shifting in thinking of hoping for the best after the break up, or hyping up the break up did nothing for me but delusion of positive thinking without OUTPUT. 

Love is a drug, so be careful where you meet somebody. When you lose somebody, you will go back where you met, until you decide to stop the ignorance.

Sex is a drug, even sex text will get you hooked. Even porn will get you hooked. Do not let yourself fall into these traps. The moment you feel like a wet chicken, it means it is not good for you.

Do think about how you will live your life in the long run, not these romantic fiasco. It gets scary to dive within one romance to another. Especially when you have bad coping mechanisms.

Your childhood trauma could also affect your relationships, I have narcissitic parents who gaslighted me with anger and then left me to lick my wounds. They provided no emotional support when I was frightened and nervous about the major milestones in my life, even the hardest emotions and how to deal with them. They pride their seductive prowress, and their looks.

It left me feel lost and confused growing up, so I purposedly looked for emotional support outside home. With that pickmeisha characteristics, I had relationships with men that provided emotional comfort even if I did not want any physical relations with them.

Love was sex for me, and it let me feel cheap. The emotional unavailability of my parents left me looking for seduction, because it's the closest pattern I knew growing up. 

But I have decided to fix myself first mentally, and emotionally by learning about healthy coping and responding, because I keep in mind the consequences of falling into traps.

Love is a good emotion, but you have to be well-rounded when you accept and give it. Using ""love"" to deal with your real life pains tarnishes the quality of it, and it may cause you to lie to yourself and your partner just to have someone by your side. That simple lie will multiply and break you, lies break people, truth builds people.",47304,Love. Sex. Convenience. All are drugs.,0,,

I realize I'm not everyone's cup of tea, but it makes no sense to me when a man says ""you're wonderful/amazing/etc."" (completely unprompted) then doesn't reach out. Scenario in my newbie stages of FDS: You go on the date, smile, laugh and have a good time. He pays, hugs you goodbye (with a bit of lingering) then sends you a few texts before bed. You say you had a great time but refrain from gushing. Then, during the 24 hours after, crickets.   
 

""He's Just Not That Into You"" rings true as always, but why lie? Why tell a girl she is amazing and wonderful then just leave her scratching her head after she gives you space to text first? I have heard guys do this looking for hookups, but they seem not to be looking for that nor did they act rude/sexual.   
 

 I have not chased any guys down or asked them out, which I feel happy about. I'm actively straightening my crown everytime my brain goes numb from these experiences. Like yeah, I know I'm wonderful (lol) but why act like you want to see me again of your own volition when you don't?Literally right now the only guys talking to me are ones I have not met yet (including one with plans this weekend).",47293,But Why Do They Say That?,0,,

I've recently discovered this sub and I love it even though I'm starting to hate men.

I'm 25 y.o. finishing my masters and I've been single for about two years now. I have been very satisfied with my love life so far although I have lately found it hard to find someone worth my time. I often meet guys and get asked out but we just don't match so I cut it off. 

 About two months ago I met through mutual friends a really nice guy during a group hangout. We talked for a while (nothing too romantic- just favorites, common interests, jokes etc). I really liked him and felt there was chemistry there, but didn't pursue anything further. He is close friends with a friend of mine and I saw traits in him that I liked that I discovered both from talking to him and from hearing what others said about him.

The next day, he added me on Facebook and we have been texting ever since. We've had both interesting and fun discussions and I've texted him first like once or twice? (ugh) I like talking to him and I like that there was rapport. He kept a healthy amount of texting without coming off too strong or being too aloof. He is focused and career driven and expressed his interest in me in a nice way. I find tiring though that even though he has mentioned a few times we should go out, asked me about places I like etc he hasn't set a date yet. I've agreed that I would like to go out with him as well so there's clarity on that, and no way in hell I am gonna nag him into setting an actual date. But as I said, just talking through messenger has gotten really tiring for me. I would just rather he outright rejects me even if it hurts than just keep chatting and never meeting face to face. I've gone out on other dates during these months and (*allow me to exaggerate a bit*) I have had a better time during a chat with him -tragic I know. As a result, when he texted me yesterday I started overthinking it, forgot to answer, then texted him back this morning and now he is not talking to me lol *now that I think about it he may ghost me so there's no point in writing this...oooops.*

From what I know through him and our common friends, he broke off a very serious relationship about six months ago and he has not dating or pursuing anyone else since (unless it's all lies, you never know).

I don't know how to handle this because what I reaaaally wanna do is be sentimental and confront him and be like **YOOOO WTF ?!** or block him, which both make me look like a psycho BUT I also kinda don't wanna cut ties?! He's just not that into me? Hell I don't know.

Besides the fact that I feel a little lonely these days, another negative consequence is that I do not have ""abundance mentality"" AT ALL when it comes to men (especially since I am looking for one who also doesn't want children).

I have gone through a year of very sudden, hard yet ultimately positive change. I have realized a lot of things about my childhood, my actions throughout life, and why I was such a doormat who felt like I could never fit in. On one side, I’m so glad to be going through this emotional puberty, on the other, it has made me deeply depressed (though I am working through that now and it’s mostly caused by these realizations). I’m 28 and feel like I’m just now growing up.

I need to get this off my chest and hopefully connect with those who have experienced similar from their own families. This is a big reason why FDS has helped me immensely, and I’m so grateful to have found this community.

Every man in my family is sexist save for an uncle who doesn’t live near me. My dad extremely so. Due to circumstances this past year, I have had to move back home to save money – I’m currently changing careers and needed the break for my mental health (my last job was…it was not good) and the time to study. My mom is a very kind, wonderful woman. But, she’s a doormat who exudes pickme attitudes. My dad is a slight narcissist, I wouldn’t say full blown, but definitely has some of the qualities.

Growing up, it was always “boys will be boys,” “women are only here to have babies and get married and serve men,” “women should know their place and be quiet and nice.” I didn’t realize the extent of the indoctrination until I moved back home as an adult. I have noticed that my dad can’t go one day without saying something extremely demeaning about women – or millennials, but mostly just women. Just like what I heard growing up – that we’re only good for cleaning and cooking and whatnot. But as a child, it didn’t really sink in.

Since I have a vagina, I’m expected to clean up after everyone and cook for everyone while my brothers (who have moved back home as adults for a couple stints but are now moved out), were never expected to know how to do anything household related. It’s treated as a joke that my brother can’t cook, only eats fast food, and never does dishes, so only eats off paper plates. My mom even mentioned one day that she’s worried about him living on his own and that she has considered looking up those mail-order bride sites, i.e. slave sites for lonely men (in a joking manner but… not really). My brother is 30 years old and can barely take care of himself.

I’ve come to realize how damaging these attitudes have been to me and how deeply they have affected my life. When you are a child and your father pretty much tells you that you are worthless with his jokes, demeanor, and actions, you keep that in your heart and your mind your whole life. I’m just now unraveling from it. I have also realized that holding onto these attitudes has made me chase men who weren’t good people. I am now horrified by these beliefs and don’t put up with men who show even a hint of these qualities.

To drive home the messages my dad has given me – even from childhood – I noticed a very small yet very telling action over the summer (and throughout my entire stay at my parents’ but that’s beside the point). Even as an adult woman, I’m still treated as worthless or not even thought of at all. Our family went to a baseball game, and I had got up to use the bathroom. When I came back, I tried getting back to my seat through the aisle, but my dad wouldn’t move his legs to let me get by – he acted like I wasn’t even there. I also don’t know if this was some weird dominating move? I had to almost climb over him and I almost fell on him simply because he couldn’t take 1 second to be respectful and move his legs so I could pass comfortably. I know this is just a small thing, but it was humiliating and also kind of creeped me out, and it’s one small thing amongst a sea of thousands that have given me the message: Worthless. It’s the small things that pile and really break you – the constant jokes, the disrespect for even little things.

My brothers have the same mindset as my dad. It doesn’t help that one had sexually propositioned me when I was 13 (he’s not around anymore), while I constantly catch my other brother staring at me whenever he’s around. Even my nephew, who was visiting over Christmas break, took a long drawn-out sniff of my hair when he hugged me goodbye.  I hate being around the men in my family. All of them.

Anyway, not to spew all my daddy issues to the world, but I’ve been thinking of these things and how they have shaped my mind over the course of my whole life. Men, if you’re reading this, treat your daughters like human beings.

The energy in my family’s home is so heavy, I’ve decided to leave for the week – I can’t really afford the stay, but my mental health is worth not being here. Unfortunately I won’t be able to move out for a few months, but I’ve been doing a lot of house and pet sitting to get away – which doesn’t cost any rent and actually pays – while also finding the cheapest AirBnBs or motels to stay in when I occasionally mentally can’t take the suffocation.",47290,Growing up in a sexist household made me the ultimate pickmeisha.,0,,

I think aside from our intuition, getting better/higher self esteem is crucial when dating. (Which I love FDS for)

But many of the instances where I ended up in an unsavory situation with a shady guy, could have been avoided if I had higher self esteem. I actually think if I had self esteem, I wouldn't have fallen prey to those dudes. Sometimes our low self esteem comes from family that abused us, or a former partner, or being bullied, etc. And you have a higher threshold for emotional pain versus regular people. Sometimes our caregivers have primed us to fulfill their needs and ignore ours. Or they have filled out heads with a lot of negative things in order to make us do what they want.

And of course, scarcity and being lonely/alone is another big factor. I began isolating myself because I got tired of people but then it went too far and any dude that approached me I would ""give a chance"" when I really wasn't into them. And I even gave myself over to someone that was totally undeserving of any form of love or affection possibly. But it seemed like a pond in the middle of the Sahara desert. Like I've needed it for so long, I was willing to sacrifice of all of my standards due to my low self esteem and lack of quality options. 

You have to be aware of your current situation and your mental health, too. So remember to take care of yourselves body &amp; mind.",47285,"Get better self esteem, be aware of scarcity mindset/low quality options",0,,

I think social skills are endangered and we’ve normalised a way of living which is very detached and emotionally irresponsible in general. 

Some things I’ve noticed are people not knowing basic facts about eachother. Two friends of mine who are flat mates with eachother (both early twenties). They’ve lived together for two years going on three and they didn’t know of eachothers siblings. They’re close friends and live with two other close friends in a house. 


A girlfriend of mine was dating a guy at college for two years. Pretty soon into dating she realised he never ate and never had food and was severely underweight and malnourished. She asked him very superficially about it and he answered superficially. After she broke up she told me the story. From what I gathered his very wealthy parents were actually abusing him by depriving him of resources (access to student loan etc, travel money) and he had to pay his way through college. (For people who argue it is normal - it’s not. It’s close to impossible to get through university without support if you’re listed as coming from a high income household). She never probed into it, and it was just an elephant in the room. 

This might not seem like anything to do with dating directly, but it’s everything to do with emotional responsibility, intimacy, and friendship which is necessary in any successful relationship. 

I feel like I meet so many people who do not understand how trust and intimacy is built. I would say: put yourself in another person’s shoes, but if you don’t have a good grasp on what healthy relationships and healthy paces are, then that advice isn’t so helpful. 

I also think as a side note, people’s inability to make real connections is actually part of a wider social crisis. There’s too much of an attitude that “none of this is my problem” and “I won’t get involved if it doesn’t serve me”. It’s great to be independent but also your social interactions are a waste of time if your constantly guarded/stingy with your energy and time. It’s better to learn how to pace yourself in a healthy way. So finally to get to my point - yes there is widespread detachment in our culture which makes it harder to build meaningful relationships. 

While the general sentiment here is that excessive Male sympathy is against the sub rules, I think it’s more important to strip back your role in relation to whoever it was you were dating (male or female). Statistically, in any failed relationship, they most likely were trash - insensitive, takers, selfish, dishonest and irresponsible. But on the flip side we really have to break down why we tolerate this behaviour. 

From what I’ve seen, it’s primarily because people think they have found intimacy with the person, because in relation to their friendships it feels just as deep. But if you’ve grown used to having absent, critical, manipulative or unsupportive friends, then it’s easy to end up dating a douchebag. 

In other cases, people tolerate bs because they’re too superficial and don’t have life goals for themselves. They get obsessed with the idea of  what they could do together/mutual friends/how they would look together/what benefits they could pick up from the other person’s life, instead of it could be mutually beneficial. 

People seem to tell their failed dating stories as:
“I was too kind” 
“too giving” 
“too in love” - basically trying to frame your flaws into misplaced strengths. It might sound harsh  but it’s likely they’re actually serious vices, and it’s more like:  

“I’m naive and I people please. I will totally disregard my moral codes and fundamental values if that is what it takes to be liked”.

“I might be overstepping someone else’s boundaries by trying to make them change their mind, through excessive unreciprocated giving and uncalled for presence. I put all my eggs in one basket because there is only one basket since I have not cultivated intimacy in the platonic areas of my life”. 

“My self esteem is dependent on what I do instead of who I am. I love how the other person makes me feel when I’m with them, but I don’t love who they are. I like making them happy more because I feel a sense of validation or approval, and less because I’m invested in their happiness and growth.”",47269,You need friendship and social skills to date successfully,0,,

He is an honest, loyal person who cares very much about women and combatting the ways in which they are marginalized. Unfortunately, as a white man, his lack of lived experiences on the other side of the line of privilege showed up last night when I began venting about problems with sEx PoSiTivE culture and pornography. We've been together five months and this is the first time I've really gotten up on a soapbox about my views. It shocked me and made me sad, and now I feel a little awkward. I will not back down on my views. It just made me realize that I need a better repertoire around the following subject so that men don't feel personally attacked the minute I start educating them;

Over the past week, I've begun participating in dating-advice-type subs when I see young people (mainly women) coming to reddit with an upsetting dilemma: their partner wants them to fuck other men, and either to watch the act or to get involved in it as well. Their (usually male) partner insists he loves his girlfriend and just wants to see her pleasured. He ensures her that he wont take additional liberties with other women as a result, but she's afraid it's a gateway behavior. She also doesn't understand how someone who claims to love her could want such a thing. I was once in this position, which quickly turned very sinister. It enveloped my ""relationship"" with an abusive man for several years, destroyed my self esteem, and left me with genuine PTSD.

Last night I brought up porn sickness to my boyfriend, whose sex life has, by and large, been much more vanilla than mine. We were talking about the qualities of the millennial generation, and I commented that we were the first generation to grow up with what I call ""all-you-can-eat free porn"". This shaped our sexual worldview immensely. Now we have an endless supply of men on our hands who think porn is an accurate representation of what sex should be. They push for more and more taboo acts as they become numb to the most recent fetish they blew a load to. 

As a former Pickmeisha, I once participated in NSFW subs where I posted lots of smut and got lots of likes (it was my abusive ex's idea-- he wanted me to make more money \[on top of my well paying full time job\] so we could do more fun things, and he thought it was hot when I acted like a slut). I showed some of my old posts to my current partner a couple months into our relationship and he thought it was hot. We even made a couple of videos together. 

Last night I told him I was re-considering performative sexuality. I said that I no longer feel inspired to appeal to the male gaze. I don't feel good playing into men's faulty perceptions of what women like just to get some attention. I want to stop contributing to the problem. 

He supported me in whatever I want to do, but he didn't take my side. He said he thinks people should be able to express themselves without shame as long as no one is getting hurt. I admitted that, in my relationship with him (which is safe), it has been fun to let down my guard and play into some taboos (because it has), and this made me second guess myself in the moment. Now, as I think about it, I realize that my issue is about playing into a worldview that harms an entire population. 

TLDR; As a man who grew up watching porn, I could sense that my boyfriend felt a bit attacked by my remarks about porn-sickness, and possibly even nervous about where my change in perspective is going to lead. He admitted that he agrees, men are generally pretty gross, but I don't think I really got through to him about the porn thing. How can I re-visit this concept with him and help him to see the light?",47270,"Former pickmeista enraged by the growing cuckold/hot-wife movement on Reddit, inadvertently discovers disappointing shortcoming in my feminist boyfriend's worldview",0,,

# My side of what my husband posted to get us both help.

📷

My husband made a post 5 days ago that is titled Wife finally decided to take things seriously. Need ways to make initiating easier for her.

So...I wanna put my side of the story out so maybe the BOTH of us can get help. We have a 3 year old, 1 year old, and I found out I was pregnant with baby #3 three weeks before our youngests 1st birthday. With baby #1 I suffered from postpartum depression. With baby #2 I did not suffer from postpartum depression but I have suffered with PTSD. Backstory of why I suffer from ptsd: With baby #1 I developed severe preeclampsia during my pregnancy and had to be induced early(I was 20 years old). Baby #2 nothing too severe just gestational hypertension and was induced at 37 weeks. But...3 weeks after baby #2 I was having severe complications and wound up developing a blood clot in my lungs. When I was first admitted I was just put on a regular hospital floor and started on heparin. The very next morning my body had started shutting down I couldn’t even walk to the bathroom I crawled. They did EKG and it showed signs of heart attack and they said my organs were shutting down. So they took my 3 week old baby away from me who I hadn’t been away from, we were having a successful breastfeeding journey which I didn’t have with my first, so I could be put in the ICU because I was literally dying. I was gray in color. I’ve suffered through ptsd with this with no one to talk to. He doesn’t get the mental health stuff and usually just dismisses me. When I found out I was pregnant I wasn’t even a year postpartum and wasn’t even a year since this happened. I was by no means ready to get pregnant and this pregnancy so far has literally been a ball of stress and multiple high risk/specialist appointments to keep me and baby safe. He says this started a few years ago. Probably started around the time I started with my postpartum depression. We also stopped spending alone time together after having kids. Whether that means going out to eat, going to see a movie, or just staying in and cooking together/playing a video game(something he enjoys) or watching something on tv...but also without expecting/pushing sex in return. Sex in our house is an expectation from him all the time. It’s pressured. We’ve gone out/spent time alone but it is very very very rare. Now that I’ve opened up about what I want he says it sounds like you just want me to spend money on you/buy you when all I’m asking is for quality alone time together with no kids. Or he says how do I know if I do all of this for you you’re going to do what I want for you or vice versa? We work separate schedules so we don’t see each other as much and I understand that. I told him I feel distant and I feel closer to people I work with than I do him.

I never said I wasn’t in the wrong with the not having sex part I KNOW I am. I’m also a survivor of sexual abuse and I deal with being self conscious especially after having 2 kids and now pregnant again. It’s not that I don’t want to work on it it’s I don’t know how and I feel I’m always dismissed on my feelings about things. I’ve been to counseling for the sexual abuse but counseling doesn’t make those things disappear. It’s always going to be there. Also...sex isn’t the most comfortable/enjoyable when I’m pregnant and I’m not exactly sure why. I want help for the BOTH of us and that’s why I feel it’s necessary for both sides of the story to be recognized/heard. He feels one way about one thing and I feel one way about another. We both need to find a happy medium but it seems impossible...if you read my side thank you as I know it’s long!

I also commented this on his post but don’t really know how reddit works.

I noticed, as a side effect, I had zero problems with being hurt by or manipulated by men. In fact, I had the opposite, men would easily get emotionally attached to me. 

I don’t recommend being overly stoic or aloof because A) life is not logical, and human situations can not be solved with pure logic and rationality {you need to trust your gut and think emotionally often to be intelligent and successful}and B) life loses its vibrancy when you’ve taught yourself not to hurt or care about anything. But...a little aloofness in terms of dating/dealing with men will do you a lot of favors. 

I’ve toned down my aloofness and am back to living life passionately, but I still practice aloofness. Men will often try to make you jealous, or make you “compete” for his attention. Don’t fall for that shit. If he pulls this test once, shut down your emotional responses. It’s a form of manipulation that’s better off not allowing yourself the emotional investment towards. If he continues to pull tests like this, walk away.",47259,On practicing aloofness.,0,,

I have wanted to write this for a while but I didn't want to deal with people saying I'm ""victim blaming"", because I'm not, but I finally decided ""fuck it, I'm writing it anyway"".

I'm not much of a drinker. I'll probably have *a beer* every other month or so. I don't try and stay away from it, but I don't seek it out and frankly I work too much to really drink, but that's besides the point. One day a couple of years ago, I was in a bad place. Coming out of a nasty breakup, dealing with some personal drama and feelings of inadequacy, I ended up drinking. And I mean, *drinking.* What wouldn't have been much for another person had me absolutely floored. At some point a guy I had been very casually dating (we had barely kissed) ended up coming to my house.

I don't remember inviting him (I'm actually not sure I did), I barely remember him getting there, before the rest of the night goes black. I wake up the next day with the unpleasant evidence of some rough, unprotected sex -- sex I didn't remember or consent to. My roommate later told me that she pulled him aside when he first got there and told him she'd never seen me like this, and I wasn't in a state to do anything, which he told her he understood and would be a gentleman. He wasn't.

When I woke up the next day, he was gone. I had no memories of what happened, just the physical signs and a vague sense of uneasiness and embarrassment. Later I was talking to a friend of mine about what happened and she said, almost nonchalantly, ""I think you were assaulted."" I hadn't thought of it that way before she mentioned it because I was the ultimate Pick Me and almost never factored my feelings into any relationship situation, but after she said that it made my uneasiness make sense.

I didn't agree to have sex. I **never** would have agreed to unsafe sex, or the level of roughness that obviously took place. I didn't remember it, couldn't account for it, and was humiliated by it. I never spoke to him again (and he never reached out to me either). Obviously what he did was wrong, and believe without a doubt that I was assaulted that day.

**But here's the honest truth, ladies:** being drunk has no place in dating. We should never, ever, ever drop our guards around men, particularly ones we barely know. There is almost zero situation that is enhanced (in a relationship or otherwise) with the infusion of alcohol. Safety-wise, charm-wise, connection-wise.

Rapists are predators, and drugs and alcohol do 95% of the work for them. I don't mean to be a downer, but it's the sad reality. Not only does being inebriated make you extraordinarily vulnerable, it allows bad men to make bad choices and redirect the blame to you. And how can you argue, if you weren't cognizant enough communicate clearly? Alcohol blurs the lines of consent and it will not be in your favor.

So, my sage advice from a dumb bitch who has made this mistake: don't drink &amp; date. Don't put your safety at risk ""just to take the edge off"". Don't allow someone to prove whether or not they're a ""good guy"" at the risk of your bodily safety. If you do drink, **have one** and then cut yourself off. Don't let anyone convince you or ply you with alcohol (major blood red flag right there btw). If he's not interesting enough sober, he's not for you, sis.

I don't blame myself for what happened to me, but I do take ownership of the situation I put myself in, and have committed to never making the same mistake again. And I'm one of the lucky ones. It could have gone much, much worse and I don't hope that for any of us.",47236,PSA: Control your alcohol.,0,,

I went on my first date since learning about FDS and overall, I feel like I did a 4/10. The PickMeisha side kept coming up as eager attentiveness so I had to remember to calm down and stay posed. However, I did a good job at deflecting his repeated asks for the skeletons in my closet. 


One thing that’s not sitting right with me is that he took the scenic route in exposing his sobriety to me. Let me explain:


1. An hour before the date, I get the text “I hope they have good food...☺️”. And I’m like, ya sure, “Me too!”.


2. As we put in our order for food, he asks for water. He makes a comment about how he’s trying to drink more water as a NY resolution. I’m thrown off by his decision (after all, we were at a fancy cocktail bar) but I decide to go with water too. 


3. I grab a vintage cocktail book that’s laying nearby and tell him that I’m going to flip to a page and it’ll be his favorite mixed drink. I land on a rum cocktail and ask “do you like rum?”  He says, “I’ve never tried it”. Confusion sets in. He explains that he’s sober and says something about all the clues he’s left. 


We talk for a few minutes. He says he has a family history of alcoholism so he’s never touched the stuff. I don’t care that he’s sober but I need to address this sneaky way of revealing it to me. He didn’t lie but he did a good job of covering up his sobriety until I point-blank asked him about alcohol. This leaves me with heightened skepticism and lack of trust. Especially since he was priming our interaction since the first text of the evening (men are strategic and I’m not gonna pretend like “I hope they have good food” text wasn’t part of the plan). 



Do you have any advice on how to address it? Is it even worth it to go on a second date? Was there anything I could’ve done better?


Thanks in advance, happy to provide more info.

It is the proactive FDS way to evaluate your relationship progression regularly. You need to make sure what's going on in your life aligns with your 5-yr-plan and vision of how you want to be treated by a partner. You've read the handbook, so you know your standards, right? This should make your job weeding losers out much easier. Journaling and taking notes of each date and each convo can help you a lot too. 

The more you let your mind give him the benefit of the doubt and ignore micro-red-flags, the worse off you will be. It is easy to block out little negs and digs and believe the best in people. **You need to override that impulse and write down exactly what happened in a notebook instead.** 

You need to be keeping notes in your phone or in an actual paper journal. What to include? The dates he's taken you on. What he's said to you. Does he keep his promises or not? Are things moving along to your liking, or is he stalling commitment?  Are you happy? What is your dominant emotion in this relationship?

You need to take stock just as you would sit down and plan your budget, financial goals, and educational goals. The biggest myth society has ever cajoled us into believing is that dating \* happens \* to us. That you wait around for a prince. That you go with the flow. Nah. You need to be actively making sure you only associate with people who treat you the way you want to be treated. You need to be picky and selective, and not settle for the first shmuck who gives you attention. This is how you get what you want out of your dating life. You observe how he's been treating you, how you've been feeling, and whether it aligns with how you see your life going. You strategize. You make sure that you're getting what you want out of your dating life. You have the same foresight and confidence with it as you do with planning your career. You can't just let love happen to you, only women who end up with LVM do that. 

Trust me. Strategize. Keep a journal. Take notes of how your interactions with men are going. This will change your life. Try it for a month.

When you're having conversations with a guy, I also want you to write down every 

\-neg he makes

\-every condescending comment

\-every ""joke"" that was mean-spirited but he pretended it was a joke

\-every put-down

\-every time he didn't respond to you with the encouragement, support, and love you deserve and you yourself would give a loved one.

This is very important. **The mind blacks out trauma and hurtful comments. And then in hindsight, you're like, oh fuck, all those comments and all those red flags, how could I have been so foolish?**

**This is why you need to start keeping notes. Don't fool yourself or play yourself.**

I recently had a conversation with a negging asshole. In the moment, I didn't realize the extent of the disrespect and wasn't prepared to confront them. But after processing, here's what I realized he said

\-He thinks he is smarter than I am, made an indirect neg, bragged about himself and his legendary intellect 

\-He thinks I should be available at his beck and call and respond immediately to texts as if I have nothing better to do in life. **Was presented as a ""joke"", but the entitlement is real**  

\-He thinks that mentioning how many girls want him is a normal and acceptable social comment to make

I am taking notes, and I won't forget. The time to stop letting shit slide is now. None of y'all should be letting these kinds of comments slide. Why? **They are the red flags that you will be kicking yourself for ignoring in the future. Those jokes? They mean them. Truth is masked by humor.** 

YOU CANNOT GIVE A PERSON THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. 

**BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING, ""I AM GOING TO DELIBERATELY IGNORE RED FLAGS AND PLAY MYSELF.""**

TAKE NOTES. KEEP A JOURNAL. 

If some of you would have kept a journal about your LVM ex, it would've been easier to realize how trash he is. Would've went something like this.

January: He is so great, took me out, super kind and loving

February: not as much effort as last month

March: Seems to pick fights with me for no good reason

April: The last time I felt happy was January

May: We broke up and made up again and now everything is great!!!

June: I have never been so depressed

In the heat of the moment, it is hard to see what is going on. But you can't tell me that any woman in her right mind, when confronted with a pattern, in her own writing, is not going to leave a LVM once she sees the pattern. By March or April she would've left upon reading her notes. Irl, without having notes or looking back objectively, when you're in the moment, it is easier to have your time wasted well into July and September and overlook all of the little moments.

No matter how much you love to travel, just don’t do it. Even if you have tons of money, or you work from home and you can just bring your laptop with you and work there, don’t ever do it!

He can come to you, or pay for your trip. Don’t ever pay for your own plane ticket or hotel/AirBNB and ask for days off work when traveling to meet up with a guy.

There are only two exceptions to this rule: If you’re meeting him in a place that you would be happily willing to travel to by yourself, and you have enough free time and disposable income where it won’t mess up your life too much.

That way if things don’t work out, at least you got a fun solo vacation out of it.

But even then, it’s still not a great idea. Even your #1 dream vacation spot in the world might be hard to enjoy if you just got your heart broken.

The other exception is if he pays for all your transportation and lodging, and you’ve already spent enough time together in person to know that he’s safe.

I’ve made this mistake THREE times and I will never let it happen again.

(By the way, I’m American and thank God all these incidents were trips within the US. So at least I wasn’t paying for expensive international flights.)

These are the stories in detail. Learn from my mistakes.

Strike #1: In 2015, I flew to Denver, Colorado to meet up with a guy I met through an online forum. Not Reddit, but something like it. I was 23, he was 19. At the time, I was a recent college grad and I was doing well at my commissioned sales job, and I had this crazy idea that I wanted to be sort of like a sugar mama for a younger guy, but that’s a story for another post. Thank God I grew out of that cringe-y Pickmeisha phase.

Anyway. We’d been texting every day for a few months and we were Facebook friends and we’d video chatted, so I knew he was a real person and probably safe.

He picked me up from the airport and the first thing we did was go to his parents’ house to hookup. He was uglier in person and very socially awkward, so it wasn’t even good sex. And he refused to kiss me because he “just didn’t like kissing.” But he seemed nice enough otherwise so I went along with it.

Then we went to the mall and just walked around, but neither of us bought anything. We hooked up again in his car after that, and then he told me he got called in to work early the next morning, so I just went back to my hotel room alone.

I spent the next day exploring downtown Denver by myself and then I went home the following day since it was only a two-day trip. This day was WAY more fun compared to the previous day.

I wasn’t really hurt by his actions since I’d lost all interest in him like 10 minutes after I arrived, but I felt like I’d wasted a lot of time and money on a really lame and unattractive guy. We stopped talking once I got home.

Strike #2: I flew to Denver again in 2017 to meet up with a guy I was casually dating long-distance. We used to live in the same city and we went on a few really amazing dates there, but he unfortunately had to move once he got a new job and we stayed in touch. Unlike the last guy, he was really hot.

We weren’t “official” because of the long distance, but I definitely had feelings for him and couldn’t wait to see him.

A week before my trip, he ghosted me. It was very strange because we’d been texting every day before that. This worried me, but eventually I got a hold of him and got confirmation that he still wanted me to come, so I figured I was good.

I took the city bus to his apartment after I’d arrived and the first thing we did was have sex. We’d had sex before and I even brought sexy lingerie with me, so I was excited. At least it was good sex.

Then his uncle came over and we watched sports and ordered Chinese takeout. He got called in to work the next morning too, so I spent the following day watching Netflix on his couch and walking around downtown Denver by myself again.

When he got off work, he was “too tired and stressed” to take me on any of the date activities we’d talked about beforehand. I was pissed, but I tried to be understanding.

When I confronted him the next morning about how I was upset because I’d spent money on a plane ticket and took time off work to come see him, he lectured me for being too selfish. He said I was a bad person because I wasn’t sympathetic to his situation and cared more about my trip being ruined.

A few hours later, he kicked me out and I spent the remainder of my trip at an old friend’s place. I deleted his number and removed him from all social media. I never heard from him again.

Strike #3: September 2019, about two months before I found this sub. My ex (who was my boyfriend at the time) wanted to move back to his hometown of Atlanta for six months to help his family with some things. Both of us were working from home, so he wanted me to come with him and he found us a temporary place to live together.

I’d never been to Atlanta, so I figured it would be a fun opportunity to enjoy a new city for a bit. And since we were an official exclusive couple, I figured this time things would go better.

I was totally wrong.

He broke up with me less than 48 hours after I arrived because he thought I was too messy and apparently he was a bigger clean freak than I thought.

He literally went out to lunch with his mom without inviting me to join them, and then texted me a long letter full of complaints about my living habits. And he bought me a surprise plane ticket home. No advance warning whatsoever.

I’d never felt so hurt in my entire life.

I tried to tell him that he was overreacting and I was willing to work on being less messy, but he stuck by his decision.

I even worked super hard to be cleaner over the next few days leading up to my flight home, hoping he’d notice my efforts and change his mind, but nope. He didn’t.

We tried remaining friends after I got home, but he stopped texting me as soon as he got a new girlfriend.

Sorry that was super long, but the moral of the story is that spending your hard-earned money to travel for a guy is one of the STUPIDEST things you can ever do and it will most likely end terribly. Even if you’re in an “official” relationship with him.

Just learn from my mistakes and don’t do it!

One bombshell is that I now realize my ex was probably porn sick. His story is unique from some of the other stories shared on here, because our shared culture and religion prohibits pre-marital sex. This makes it difficult to test if a guy can perform normally sexually before marriage.

Before I started dating my ex, he was previously married two times. When I first met him, he told me that his second marriage ended because he had erectile disfunction and his wife left him after five months because he basically couldn’t consummate the marriage. He blamed the ED on psychological issues, stemming from a huge fight that happened between both sides of the family the day of the wedding. He shared this with me in our second conversation, so I felt he was being honest. He brought it up, so why would a guy be so vulnerable early on if he isn’t trustworthy (of course, I now know this is a tactic guys do). I did research on ED and found that stress and psychological issues could cause it, so I thought nothing else of it.

I did not really think much about this topic for months. We were not having sex because of our culture and faith, so I couldn’t test things out. We began getting very serious and talking marriage even. Sometimes during our conversations, we would talk dirty. He ALWAYS talked about wanting to do it in the shower and going down on me (should have realized the shower thing was probably from porn). Eventually, we let our guards down a bit and got somewhat physical. Even though we did not go all the way, he was not aroused at all by me. No physical reaction, getting hard, etc. He also had a blank stare on his face anytime we would get intimate, and would look off into space seemingly. It’s like he wasn’t there with me. I thought it was odd, but pushed it out of my mind.

Eventually, we broke up for unrelated reasons. I think back now and realized I dodged a huge bullet. I can’t believe I almost got engaged to someone whose previous marriage possibly/likely ended due to porn sickness. I loved him so much, that it completely blinded me to what was right in front of my face.

so basically my story is that i recently blocked a guy i was talking to for a couple of months and i realllly thought there was something there (at first). 
he was really sweet and always giving me compliments in the dms but on his twitter page (he’s pretty big), he’d always bash women all the time and call them “e-coochie”. obviously i was fucking conflicted lol bc who am i to be with a guy like this? clearly i could be next of the girls he embarrasses and cusses out for no reason. so i usually brought up his tweets to him and would ask him why he would say this to someone and who gave him the right to. he’d say, “you’re just triggered and you’re a diehard feminist, don’t worry.” 
also around that time he started to ask me dumb questions like “would you want your husband to eat you out?” and i would say, “uh yeah lol, a girl’s got needs too” he would reply by saying, “nooo, i think that’s submissive for a guy to do that.. but my wife still has to suck my dick.” that was when i was like wtf is wrong with this dude lmfoaoaaoao
then came the time where he’d try to call me out in group chats for no reason just to bait me out and after a while i really just got tired of it all.

Not one of these men ever tried to date me or mentioned having a relationship with me or even tried to lead me on to make me think they wanted to have a relationship. Because they didn't. They only wanted sex.

But then I had a big life change and decided that I really did want a relationship. I started telling men that I was looking for a relationship on the first date, when they asked me. Lo and behold suddenly every man that I went on a date with wanted a relationship too! And dumb me I thought ""Wow! That's interesting, what a change!"" 

For a while I didn't think much more of it. But I realized fairly quickly that none of them were actually serious. They were just telling me what I wanted to hear. All just for sex. 

They cheated, they went out looking for other women on the weekends at clubs, they were nasty, abusive and selfish, they would only see me on weeknights...

And that's the story of how I learned to never tell a man what I'm looking for. Always make him go first. Always make him pay. And never have sex with him until at least 2 months. And if he doesn't perform sexually and put significant effort into making you feel safe, comfortable, desired, respected, and thoroughly pleasured then he doesn't give a shit about you.

The goal is not to generalise or say that ALL males in these categories should be avoided. These things are not red flags per se, but since they contain a high ratio of LVM, you should at least be prepared to have your time wasted when swiping on them.

I'll start with students. What value can students add to your life? They are typically broke, young, and into hookup culture. Broke and hookup culture speak for itself; young means they are less mature than we are/were in their age and they are too caught up in their own feelings to take responsibility for someone else's. They are great as friends, especially if they're smart and passionate about their major.

The second category is musicians. Tend to be self-absorbed, having giant egos along with mental issues and treating you as a free therapist. And broke. 

Feel free to add to the list! What kind of appearance traits do LVM have? What groups do they like to attribute themselves to (woke, traveler, nomad)?",48407,Let's create a list of the professions/hobbies/appearance traits/other categories with the highest ratio of LVM!,0,,

I'm 25 and have been in 2 long term relationships for the past 6 years, so when I recently started dating again (and utilising OLD apps for the first time) I've felt a bit lost. 

I'm currently seeing this really handsome, forthcoming and affectionate HVM and I want to make sure I'm doing everything right. I can already tell he likes me a lot but because we're both pretty introverted, independent, and almost loner type people I'm afraid of coming off as too strong and desperate. He did tell me that in the past he would usually be the one breaking things off when girls become too attached and demand things like marriage or his undivided attention. 
On the other hand though he is definitely starting to look for someone to settle down with and start a family, even though he's still only 25 as well. 

One major green flag is that he describes himself as more conservative and family oriented, as well as both our sets of parents still being happily married. (Unlike my ex's parents who were never married and didn't stay together for long, which might've contributed to us not working out)

In the beginning (about 3 weeks ago) we texted more sporadically, albeit consistently in-between dates (2 dates per week). Now it's pretty much every day at least 2 or 3 sets of messages in an ongoing conversation, and I try to wait at least half an hour, if not a couple hours in-between. 

The truth is, I'm on my phone pretty much all day anyway, or at least have it near me when I actually do go out, but absolutely don't want to seem too available.

But it's just how it seems. 

Anecdotal but there are three exes in my life that I've been truly in love with and consider to be good people. All three had women in their lives who were VERY influencial on them

The first, had an awesome mom. I'm talking not normal level awesome. Like once in a lifetime deeply beautiful in every way, funny charming lovely person sort of awesome. After getting to know her I realized that all the things I loved about HIM we're qualities from his mom (the charming, unique way they'd carry themselves, the identical sense of humor, the same philosophical ideologies, the same mannerisms, I mean it was uncanny...) I liked her more than him.

Next guy had an older sister who passed away a few years before i had met him. He had the most interesting tastes in things. The music he exposed me to, the art he kept, the private spots in nature. Everything was so different and interesting and amazing. As silly as it sounds his sense of taste is what made fall so hard for him. Anyway I pretty quickly found out that all of those things were things his sister had exposed him to and i mean EVERYTHING. I had never met her but she had the most fall-in-lovable tastes in things. He was such an interesting and fun person, which he himself attributed to his sister. And from what I saw, I believe it. 

My last bf had married in high school and they split in their 20s. I never met her when he and I were together but I just met her recently and what do you know....she is awesome lol same story...in retrospect I now feel like a lot of his more interesting perspectives, hobbies and tastes originated with her. 

On the flip side, the men I've dated who were absolute TRASH happened to have bad women in their lives....manipulative mothers, women (mom's/exes) that babied them, female ""best friends"" who ""just don't get along with women"", etc etc etc 

I grew up hearing that I should pay attention to a guys DAD bc he will end up like his dad. But now I'm like...idk. that seems like outdated misleading advice. Right??? I kind of think you should look at the women in his life. Who has the biggest female role in his life? His mom? Sister? Aunt? Gram? What is she like? what kind of person is she/what type of guidance does she give him?

But maybe I'm wrong? Does anyone here pay close attention to a guy's mom/female figures in his life? I just feel like women have a way of shaping men.",48370,The best men seem to have good women in their lives/upbringing,0,,

I’ve dated a fabulous guy for about 6 weeks. Letting myself be treated by being taken on dates. Avoided doing wifey shit like cooking for him - mind you he still got to eat my cooking when it was in a group setting. He chased me. It was lovely. 

However, on the last 2 or so weeks I felt like I stopped getting to know him. Like I had hit the bottom of his personality and I was wondering if he was right. Well, turns out he was also questioning if it was right. He came over tonight to break things off in person. He cried because he didn’t want to but knew it was best. He said he respected my time and me as a person and didn’t think it would be fair to drag dating on. 

6 weeks on the dot. Like the FDS handbook says, 6 weeks they know. I do think he is HVM because he did not push my boundaries. When I said ‘no’ he stopped. 

There is a part of me that is hanging onto the idea that I should have cooked for him. That I should have been more sexually active with him. That I should have calmed my personality down. But I know none of that would have made the outcome any different, only delay it. 

This is a new kind of uncomfortable. I’m not scared. I’m not diminished. I’m sad and disheartened. I want to blame myself for not being enough. But I am enough. So much so he could see it and knew he wasn’t my fish and exited himself.  

Now I know this uncomfortable. Now I know what it’s like to date without faux intimacy. Now I know what it’s like to be at the end of something and not feel used up and discarded. I am sad, disheartened, and plan ol’ bummed. But I am not less than I was before. I did not debase myself or my values. I’m stronger now. I will do it again. I will find my fish. He will know it. I will not only be reeling him in, he will be swimming towards me.",48361,FDS works and I’m bummed,0,,

I’ll be hitting an age landmark this year but I’ve been told by friends and acquaintances who’ve seen my past pics or known me from a decade ago: that I still have amazing skin, hair / figure (apart from two very fine wrinkles from smiling). One friend who I hadn’t seen in over a year invited me to a party since she was back in my city for a month. She took one look at me and was shocked, she said I looked so well and it took her aback! 

I take very good care of my skin, health and fitness. Meaning I invest time and money! I’m taking in personal training soon on top of my evening work out classes that I take. I’m not trying to paint a picture of being a super model or anything of the sort. But I fucking try my hardest to keep what I got!

I’ve decided to increase my age range on Tinder to see what’s out there according to my new decade. OH.MY.GOD. Just no guys over 30!

My observations in a nutshell:

- Beer bellies. LOTS OF BEER BELLIES

- Man boobs!

- Ugly pubic hair beards. Poor grooming 

- Yellow teeth from smoking and coffee etc 

- HATFISH! Receding hairlines or baldness covered under a ‘cleverly’ placed hat

- The ugliest guy in the group pics, ANY TIME a guy puts up pics of him in groups for the first few photos or just with a great looking friend - it’s always going to be the ugliest friend. Why men have no shame when doing this I’ll never understand

- No sense of style 

- Bad skin, BRO you should look 55 at 35! 

- Photos clearly taken one 2012 as their main profile pic 

- 0 effort put into their profiles. No bio, nothing or worse aSK mE!

- UGLY tattoos (tattoos are great but not when you got one while you were drunk)

- NOT posting a PICTURE of themselves or face, rather wanting to get your personal details to send you their ugly ass picture. In their bio you’ll always see written: I Pr0MiSE iM n0T uGLY hAHa! Like bitch if you weren’t ugly then you’d post a picture of yourself for everyone to see lol

- Very bad profiles generally 

- Using their pets as there main photo to hook you. Like that poor pet is your crutch on OLD. I always joke that they’re holding these pets hostage 😂

CHANGE your tinder from M looking for F. WOMEN BY FAR are better looking. They’re all hot af and make what they were given work for them! The thing is women have taken care of themselves from their teenage years because of the unfair societal expectations. FROM WHEN WE ARE INNOCENT CHILDREN! 

Ladies, what I’m saying is that women look good at any age, we age better than men and we’re fed LIES that we are going to hit a ‘wall’. A myth made up by LVM. If you think you’re not enough, please I can assure you that you are! Don’t let these beer belly fuckheads tell you otherwise.

Don’t feel bad for judging these guys either. These LVM are the same guys who will look at any woman and say she doesn’t have ‘biG enuf booBs’ or ‘tOO fat.’ Meanwhile they have 0 to offer and are hiding the fact that they are deadbeat dads....ugly dead beat dads.

At the end, he asked to hang out again this weekend, and I said yes. This morning he texts me inviting me to a concert tonight. I politely declined because I already had plans, but said that I was free tomorrow if he wanted to do something then. 

He replied saying that would work, and then added, ""Any ideas?""

Although I am new to FDS, I have always preferred when guys take the lead in planning dates (until a more stable relationship has formed). To me, it almost feels like it sets the tone that the guy is pursuing me, and implies that he is responsible for paying for the date. I also just feel a certain degree of anxiety about the idea of having to choose the activity without really knowing the guy too well. 

But do you guys think that this situation is unique because I turned down his original proposition? Should I, in this situation, go ahead with suggesting a date idea (I am thinking brunch or dinner, for no other reason than there's a restaurant I'd like to check out) or bounce the ball back into his court?

And I am a straight male. My gender has some very significant behavioural problems, that is an unavoidable truth. And I'd say from the rates of suicide amonst men that on the whole, we dont like ourselves very much right now either, so at least that feeling is mutual. 

I understand that a lot of the women on here have gone through abuse, and so I am still not sure that me posting is appropriate, but if I were in control of a male only space I would admit women when possible, so I hope the mods will hear me out on this.  


This sub, or one like it, needs to exist in a non-gendered fashion. I understand that a lot of you have either been mistreated or dissapointed by men, and I apologise for that in whatever capacity I have to speak for every man. But fundamentally without having open lines of communication how are we ever going to fix this problem? Fundamentally, as a species we cant splinter off into two gender groups, which increasingly feels like what is happening. This worries me. I wouldnt say most of my male friends (including myself) purposefully dissapoint our partners, and I dont know any abusers, but dissapoint we have.   


I guess what I'm saying is, would a stance of ""We will ban any male posts which are not directly soliciting advice on how to improve"" be any better? I get that it is still effort on your guys part to explain, but the changing will be effort on our part.   


As you say, there is an epidemic of low value behaviour amongst men (and some women I would argue), then it is surely important to fix this, and I cant see how we do that without doing it together.

I’ve put myself out there more, and have met a lot of guys (not difficult cuz I’m pretty damn good looking), but not ONE of them is even fucking decent, or even compares to my crush (I will refer to him as “my crush” for the rest of this post)

For example, the second guy, after our meal, which was going great, looked at me and deadass said “Is this the part where we go back to my place and fuck?” And every guy since has been like that (with the exception of my crush). It’s only sex, it’s only nudes, it’s only what will get their tiny dicks hard. 

Now, back to my crush (I go into detail on him in my last post), he’s so sweet, he’s caring, he’s respectful, he has an extremely high moral compass, and he’s hot as fuck and cute, and I basically wanted to have sex with him at least, and he said no over, and over, and over again. Cuz it “wasn’t his style.” Some of you said you think he might be gay or asexual. I asked him and he said no. Him turning me down for sex isn’t what makes him an asshole.

The date from my last post was a bust, but I'm not going to let one shitty experience deter me, so I got back in the saddle and went on a date with a different man.

He's age appropriate, intelligent, has a good job, and carries a conversation very well. On our first date, we went to a casual restaurant/lounge, where we sat and talked for 5 hours! We only had 2 drinks over the whole night, and it was great. I once apologized for rambling a lot and he said ""don't be sorry - you're not rambling, you're articulating."" When I went on a rant about all the ways the Eragon movie sucked, he wasn't saying anything. When I trailed off, he had this big grin on his face and said ""you're so cute, you know that, right?"" 

We've been talking for 3 weeks now, I even went to his house for movies after our second date to a cute little burger place and he hasn't made a single dirty joke, made a pass at me, or done anything besides cuddle me and kiss me once. He's witty and handsome, and when we talk, it's a real conversation where he listens to me and asks me questions about my thoughts.

We have no solid plans for a third date but he said he wants to see me again. I have no idea how to proceed. He knows I have no interest in hookups or casual sex. I think this has real potential but I'm worried I'm going to set myself up for heartache. How should I proceed? I'm focusing on my own hobbies and life, focusing on my friendships, maintaining myself, but I can't seem to shake my old mindset that if I don't make all the moves first, then I'll never get another date.

It's stressing me out. What can I do to take my mind off this guy so I don't lose myself in daydreams about what could be?",48911,"Second post here - third date coming up soon, he makes me feel giddy and tingly",0,,

I discovered erotica online when I first started masturbating as a pre-teen. This is also when my self-esteem was probably lowest in my life. The erotica I read for years was BDSM, power dynamics, women being humiliated. Two decades later, thinking about this kind of scenario is still the ONLY way I am able to orgasm. One time 8 years ago, I came by focusing on the sensation, but it took over an hour and a lot of concentration.

This has been absolutely disastrous in my dating life. Despite being popular in porn, in reality guys are actually super turned off by this behavior in women. Like sure they'll come, but they lose all respect for me when they see that humiliation makes me come, and how thirsty I act in bed. It is a curse.

My friends and my therapist are libfem, so they're like, ""Just embrace it! It's normal! BDSM is valid!"" But I agree with FDS that having this kink does so much damage to me. It literally conditions me to be attracted to LVM, men who want to use me rather than love me. Which, of course, has gotten me into some really bad situations. The reality never lives up to the fantasy. And I always feel shame after I orgasm.

Mostly these days I don't masturbate. When I do, I try to turn myself on in other ways or just feel the sensation, but I inevitably turn to these thoughts to finish.

Have any of you been able to shift your sexuality and overcome your kink? I literally have no idea how to have a healthy sexuality. I feel like I might never have a healthy relationship because of this issue.",48910,Have any of you gotten over your BDSM kink?,0,,

I happen to work on a college campus and do a lot of walking around. I generally keep my headphones in because I like music. Occasionally, someone will indicate for me to take them out to interact for very legitimate reasons: need directions, tell me my backpack is open (thank you kind strangers), etc... So, yes, I will take my headphones out if someone asks. If you read my past post, you'll note I specifically mentioned guys trying to chat me up over my big sun hat. Both times this happened they made me take out my ear buds to do so (the most irritating part). I never told you how I got rid of them, though. OUT WEIRD THEM. Ex:

AF: The alpha male thing is often misunderstood. Most people imagine this dominating, overbearing bully that has to have their way. A true alpha is a leader. They know when action is required and also when to observe silently. An alpha has the confidence to allow hisself to be vulnerable rather than egotistical. They fiercely protect their loved ones. As far as the bedroom is concerned, an alpha reads their partner and provides them with the maximum amount of pleasure possible.

Since I joined this sub, I have noticed myself paying more attention to complimenting and lifting up women around me, appreciating more the frickin awesome things they do and resourcefulness and mental power they possess and usually themselves do not even register because of the internalized humility and tendency to put themselves down. I'm also following a FB group that is dedicated to collecting and acknowledging examples of how men constantly get undeserved praise for doing the bare minimum in terms of ""how to human"", like there is a whole segment of media coverage about men who, for instance, braid their daughters' hair, as if women wouldn't do that and thousand things more without anyone noticing all the time.

So lately I'm trying to pay more attention to highlight and praise women for any kinds of things that get them through this mess and struggle called life (just as here in this sub we praise and support each other for such things as leveling up, setting our boundaries and repelling LVM). When women around me tell about their day or their daily struggles, I notice there is always space for complimenting them. ""Wow, it was so great of you to think about that!"" ""That was a really smart idea!"" Even and perhaps especially when they talk about their failures, it is important to acknowledge their courage and wit to risk and try to do the particular thing. 

And what is interesting - I find that by doing that I also start to notice more things about myself that I should feel good and even proud of. 

So thank you sisters who realized we needed this sub and created it - your insight, compassion and mind are tremendously remarkable and you have helped so many women with this!

So anyways, lately I've been feeling really bad about my sexual past. For starters I'm 21F but every guy I've had sex with has been 30-50 (maybe even older since I think some of them lied about their age) and all of these sexual experiences happened when I was 20 (only one happened when I was 21). In total, I've had penetrative sex with 16 guys; some were sugar daddies (about 5) and others were not. Some of these experiences (about 7 of them) were just one-time hookups and the others were more than one time things. I met most of these men from dating apps and I just want to forget they ever happened/wish them away. Plus, I hate that my ""body count"" is so high.

What sucks is that when I was foolishly sleeping around, I thought having sex with these people meant that they would be obsessed with me (stupid, I know). Sure some of the guys ended up saying ""I love you"" after I had sex with them but I still feel really stupid. Plus, most of these guys were unattractive and after sleeping with them I could tell they felt like hot shit. I look back at it now and think ""Wow, you had sex with *him*?"" After sex with every one of these guys I experienced deep regret but still, I didn't stop until after meeting one guy who I started a long term relationship with. He basically showed me that sex isn't always the default (but he turned out to be an asshole too since he punched me). I really started to feel stupid though after looking on forums and subreddits like this one and seeing that what I experienced was not normal. Overall, I feel used and like I was taken advantage of.

I'm sorry if this post makes no sense or whatever. And I apologize if this isn't the subreddit for it. I was just looking for support and maybe advice on how to get over my deep regrets?",48862,"21f, Feeling bad about sexual history",0,,

She taught my sister and I to never second guess our value and that we should never rely on a guy to take care of ourselves. Along those lines our mother taught us many lessons, but one that sticks out to me that seems to be controversial to this sub reddit is that my mother often stood for going Dutch when paying for the bills, such as with movies or dinner. A woman in her mind is just as capable of paying for herself as any man. 

Now I am fairly new to this subreddit. I found it after my boyfriend broke up with me a couple weeks ago. The breakUp left me feeling worthless because I gave so much of myself and it wasn’t enough. A few of my friends found him to behave in a very expectant manner that I was to “take care of him” (like his mom still does even tho he’s 21). But when I’d ask for support in return it was like I was asking for too much from him. 

So, the advice that I have read on this subreddit has been incredibly enlightening for me as it’s helping me to understand some red flags from my previous relationship and helping me to move on. 

My only contemplation in all of this is that I always found that out of respect I paid for generally half of the things my bf and I did and he’d pay for the other half. So my questions is why so many of you ladies have such a strong stance on the guy paying? I’m not necessarily opposed, it’s just that I feel guilty for a guy having to pay all the time or that I’m taking advantage of him. I’d like my man to feel respected but I’m still struggling to allocate where this whole “pay the bills” standard should sit in my expectations. 

Any and all advice is very much appreciated.",48851,Opinions on Why HVM Should Pay?,0,,

If we are reposting and getting outraged (or even amused) around things they say about women or FDS, couldn't it be argued that we too are obsessed with *them*? 

On the one hand, it's useful to see revealed some of the warped thinking out there. But on the other hand, shouldn't we be filtering some of it, to protect our sanity and energies? It's one thing to discuss stuff from r/relationships or any of the other mainstream subs. It's another to go looking in MGTOW and bringing back the weird things you found.

* Visual chemistry + perceived challenge  + perceived value + connection = long lasting attraction
* Let dating be a natural part of your lifestyle, and not this separate, intimidating thing. You can't just fake an exciting/fun/busy lifestyle, you actually have to live it.
* A guy must be evaluated by his qualities re: *what he does for you* \- don't look at any other aspects of his life and confuse them for relationship material if he hasn't shown this toward you or done anything special regarding you.
* Let him *earn* your commitment by investing in you - supporting you, making an effort, treating you well. Then reward him for it. MEN DON'T VALUE WHAT THEY DIDN'T EARN
* You need to be sure that you are getting what you need from him, and he needs to be sure that what he's getting from you couldn't come from anyone else.
* Don't get wrapped up in romance just because you want to be in a relationship. Never settle. Never ignore red flags or assume someone will change. Make sure EARLY ON that your priorities align and you share the same values.
* If it ends- Don't look at it as if it's the end of the world.  Realize that he didn't live up to your values and standards, he was not your soulmate, he was not ultimately right for you. Allow yourself to be open to finding the next person, and learn/grow from the experience
* Men typically don't settle down because they convince themselves that they're not ready, they haven't fully experienced life yet, and having a girlfriend/wife is going to change everything. It's the perceived freedom that he's giving up. They often have this fantasy life of being single, then end up realizing it's not as great as they thought.
* However - other men are able to understand that having a committed relationship does not mean the death of great sex/adventure - instead, it enhances this. Having a wife/girlfriend allows him to have great sex on a regular basis, having someone who will support and understand him, and be his companion on great adventures and experiences.
* Even though you can't change someone's personality or character, you can change his emotional associations and his perceptions of how his wants/needs can be met within a relationship. BUT, you can't do this merely by convincing him - he has to come to the decision on his own, via learning by your actions.
* Know that a high value woman doesn't have to make a case for her own desirability. He has to come to the conclusion on his own. He has to feel that life with you is better than life without you, and the more he puts into it, the more benefits he'll reap.
* He needs to know that you aren't desperate for a man, and you're happy with your life already (you don't need a man in order to feel content and validated with yourself because you already are).
* You cannot make him a top priority too soon or put all your plans on hold for him. You can express a desire to spend time with him, but don't drop everything to be with him!
* You can't let him feel like he's living his life while you're just sitting around waiting to hear from him. Continue to build your own lifestyle and and don't let him feel that he can take as much time as he wants making an effort toward you because you're just waiting for him.
* Realize you can't jump the gun and rush into a relationship. NEVER assume exclusivity without talking about it and never prematurely focus on one person or obligate yourself to someone who hasn't earned it.
* Ask: is he setting aside enough time for me? Does he make an effort to involve me in his life on a regular basis? Is he confiding in me? Does he enjoy doing simple things together and not just coming over at 10 pm? 
* If a guy hits you up for a late night booty call or asks for sex in a disrespectful way, turn him down but don't get angry - either state your boundaries or ignore him altogether. *(Note: Not that I don't think that fuckboys should be called out. But I personally think that it's kind of a waste of time and energy to get angry and curse them out.)*
* ASSESS AND INVEST BASED ON WHAT YOU SEE, NOT WHAT YOU HOPE FOR
* If a guy says, ""I'm not looking for a relationship right now/I don't want anything serious"", then don't get upset or argue with him, he'll probably just think he was right to not want one. Simply calmly make your boundaries known and he can either follow them or not. Then let him come back to you, and if he does, then make him follow your terms... if he says ""let's go out on Friday"", offer for Saturday, etc. 
   * Once he says that he doesn't want a relationship, PLACE HIM ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR LIST OF PRIORITIES. Treat him more casually, and show him that he can't have the benefits of a relationship without the commitment.",43784,"Notes from ""Get the Guy"" by Matthew Hussey",0,,

We were talking about a recent theatre trip (The Crucible) when a really interesting exchange came up

Me: After the play ended we both had so much to say about it, we talked for the whole hour journey home

Friend’s Grandmother: It’s funny, that play made me break up with a boyfriend back in the 50s. We came out afterwards and I wanted to talk to him about all the themes and emotions, but he was apathetic and unresponsive. I asked what he had made of it and he said “I don’t know, it was a good play”. I knew I couldn’t be with a man who had nothing to say about that and wasn’t interested in what I had to say

Friend’s Mother: I broke up with an old boyfriend for the opposite reason. He said he liked movie dates because if you go to a movie you have something to talk about afterwards. Every date we went on was to see a movie and I realised that meant he wasn’t interested in talking to me or getting to know me, he just wanted company. 

Friend’s female, college age cousin: (amused) My Boyfriend loves talking about movies after but he says I’m difficult because I’ve started looking things like whether the female characters are given time or whether they’re kind of token sex/ comfort for the dudes. He says I make everything into a feminist thing so he hates talking about movies with me hahaha

F’s Grandmother: Why are you with him if he hates talking to you? 

It was such a fucking powerful statement and she did not blink about it. Cousin tried to laugh it off but you could see that internal cog-turning moment of huh he’s a dick",43778,LVM and Movie Dates,0,,

He did it in a respectful way so that wasn’t the problem, I didn’t match with him for other reasons. 

But it did remind me that as women we get blamed for being single and often told we are being too choosy. It’s a really mainstream idea that women who have a long list of requirements are never going to get what they want, or that they’re being unrealistic. 

Here’s why that is a massive load of bullshit, and what’s more, it’s just a METAPHYSICAL FACT of the UNIVERSE that they list of what you want will ALWAYS be shorter than the list of what you don’t want. 

Firstly, there are unlimited ways in which a potential partner can be wrong for you. But when we boil it down, there are actually only a few ways in which they need to be right for you. We all basically wanted to be respected, treated kindly, and loved and supported by someone who we find physically attractive. That’s more or less it for most people, right?

And secondly, remember that we are only looking for one man. ONE! (Assuming you’re looking for a life partner). You know when you’re online shopping and there are thousands and thousands of results? Well how do you find what you want?
Filter! Filter! Filter. This is our version of the numbers game. PUAs hit on anyone because a small percentage of the time they get lucky. We as HVMs play the opposite numbers game.

I grew up in a family that didn’t have much, and my mum was not that interested in anything like a sense of personal style or feminine things - she was just under pressure trying to raise a family and work full time, didn’t have time to focus on herself. So I grew up not quite looking after myself, didn’t learn anything about personal self care (like skin care or how to take good care of my hair), makeup, or sense of style. I didn’t grow up with a sense of what it meant to be a woman and how to embrace my womanliness! 

I feel like that is somewhat missing from my sense of self and I’d love to embrace it more. I’m pretty interested in self development, and this January I’m aiming to develop my own personal philosophy and forge a greater sense of who I am - id like to include femininity in that, but I’ve realised that while I have plenty of resources on philosophy, I have none on femininity.

They act as if the minute you turn 30, you are an old, wrinkly lady. Since was was 30 considered old? If women are no longer attractive once they leave their 20s, why is MILF porn such a popular porn category? Why do they lust over actresses like Megan Fox, Mila Kunis, and Scarlett Johansson, who are all in their 30s? It's almost as if they say this shit to reassure themselves that these 20-year-olds who keep rejecting them and won't even look their way will be undesirable and worthless ten years down the line.

There is a study that determined that the average age women feel they have ''peaked'' in terms of confidence and physical appearance was 33-years-old. And many women I know have told me that they felt they were at their most attractive in their 30s. It's almost as if women don't actually need men telling them when they should feel at their ''peak''. 

A woman's value doesn't go down as she age, nor does a man's value go up as they age, either. Many have deluded themselves into believing that ''women age like milk'' and ''men age like wine'' when most men do NOT develop into some Brad Pitt 2.0 like they think they will. Most men do not age well at all. It is such a rarity for me to find a really attractive older man to the point where I get excited when I see one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;1)    ***Accept that some people have no conscience****.*   
&gt;  
&gt;2)    ***Always*** ***listen to your gut*** and prioritize what it tells you. “In a contest between your instincts and what is implied by the role a person has taken on – educator, doctor, leader, animal lover, policeman, humanist, parent – go with your instincts,” Stout urges.  
&gt;  
&gt;3)    ***Practice the “Rule of Threes*****”.** Three strikes = out. One lie, one promise broken, one neglected responsibility – it could be a misunderstanding. Two: could be a serious mistake. Three: you are now dealing with a liar, and deceit lies at the heart of a person with no conscience. Cut your losses immediately.  
&gt;  
&gt;4)    ***Question authority*****.** Heed your own anxieties and instincts. Especially around those who claim that by dominating others they are helping a greater good.  
&gt;  
&gt;5)    ***Suspect flattery*****.** Know the difference between compliments and flattery. Compliments usually feel good. Flattery feels like too much. **Know that sociopaths use flattery to manipulate.**  
&gt;  
&gt;6)    ***Re-define your definition of respect*****.** Discern between fear and respect. Sometimes the more we fear someone, the more we defer to them and offer them respect. **Just because someone causes you to fear does not mean they are worthy of your respect. Separate the two.**  
&gt;  
&gt;7)    ***Do not participate in intrigue*** – don’t play the game you’re being invited to play. Don’t compete with, or try to outsmart, or psychoanalyze, or even banter with a sociopath. **Your #1 goal is to protect yourself.**  
&gt;  
&gt;8)    ***Avoid*****.** The best way to protect yourself is to avoid all contact. Minimize or eliminate the sociopath from your life. Although sociopaths are great actors, and can feign hurt feelings, **know that they have no feelings to hurt – they are manipulating you.**  
&gt;  
&gt;9)    ***Question your tendency to pity too easily***. Evoking pity is a classic sociopathic tool. If you find yourself pitying someone who consistently hurts you or other people, chances are close to 100% that you are dealing with a sociopath. **Related to this: challenge your need to be polite in all situations.** Sociopaths take full advantage of our social reflexes. **Remember: “No.” is a complete sentence.**  
&gt;  
&gt;10)  ***Do not try to redeem the unredeemable*****.** Second (and third and fourth) chances are for those who have a conscience. You can’t control someone else’s behavior. Although another favorite sociopathic trick is to defer blame and make other’s take responsibility for their behavior, **“You owe me,” is another favorite phrase of the sociopath,** know that you are not at fault. Again, learn how to cut your losses quickly.  
&gt;  
&gt;11) ***No cover-ups*****.** Never agree, for any reason, to help conceal the true character of a sociopath. “’Please don’t tell,’ is the trademark plea of thieves, child abusers – and sociopaths,” writes Stout. Do not listen to this self-serving request. Others deserve to be warned more than the sociopath deserves to be protected.  
&gt;  
&gt;12) ***Defend your psyche***. Don’t let someone without a conscience try to convince you that people aren’t good. Know that most of us do, thankfully, posses a conscience, and can love.  
&gt;  
&gt;13)  ***Live well. It is the best revenge***.",43753,13 Rules for Avoiding Sociopaths,0,,

1. Are you sexually active? 
2. Is he a boyfriend? 
***3. Is he nice to you?***

The last question is key. She asks every woman if the boyfriend is nice to her to wake up those in LVM relationships. 

Any woman who is constantly stressed, steamrolled, gaslighted by her LVM partner cannot answer yes with a straight face. The direct question probably wakes a lot of women up to the fact that they’re not even being treated nicely in what’s supposed to be a voluntary relationship. They’re tired, mistreated, and forgot that ***they have the power to stop seeing the POS at any time.***

Last night, he blew her off 20 minutes before the NYE party we were attending because he said he couldn't trust himself around her friends (red flag she failed to tell us).  She was upset and started drinking.  She was upset and hadn't eaten, so she got drunk faster than she expected.

A few minutes before midnight, he showed up drunk and attempted to get her to leave with him.

I was completely sober and pulled him aside to explain that because she was drinking heavily and could not consent, we would not be letting her leave with a guy.  He became angry and said that ""if she doesn't leave with me, she'll never see me again and she will be so sorry.""

This guy is maybe a solid 6.5.  My friend has a low self esteem and doesn't realize she's hot, but she consistently pulls 8s and 9s with manners and great jobs.  I laughed in his face and assured him she won't regret anything.

He tried to go around me to grab her arm.
I calmly walked up to a group of strong looking guys at the next table and explained that a man was trying to take home my friend who was too drunk to consent.

One guy immediately said, ""He can't do that.  That's rape.""

They all went and stood, towering over this guy, and demanded he leave.  When he said he was calling an Uber, they stood and waited with him to make sure he left.  When my friend tried to leave with him, one of the guys helped her back to my table and offered to call us a ride so I could make sure she got home safely.

THIS IS WHAT REAL MEN DO.  They literally just stood there.  That was all it took to ensure a woman wasn't taken advantage of.

It’s so creepy when a guy actively pursues girls that are freshly 18. Many 18-year-olds are still finishing up high school. And they always use the law to justify their actions by saying its “legal” and “she’s an adult”. Shut up. These men know that they are just trying to fuck the youngest tail they legally can. If the age of consent were lowered to 13, these men would use the law as a justification to sleep with 13-year-olds. They have no moral limits. 

As a 21 y/o, I can’t ever imagine myself dating an 18-year-old even though I was only 18 three years ago. I have matured so much since then and gained so much life experience that when I see 18 year olds, I think of them as kids still. They look like kids and many of them still act like kids. So when I see a man in his 30s or 40s pursuing women in their late teens or early 20s (even mid-20s is gross) I think of him as predatory. Age isn’t JUST a number. It signifies maturity level and life experience. There will always be an unhealthy power dynamic in a relationship between a 40 y/o and 20 y/o. Many young women are still naive and lacking in important life experiences and relationships which makes them more susceptible to emotional manipulation by older men. Because a 40 year old man who is seeking out young women that are 18, 19, 20, etc. are doing so because no self-respecting woman their own age would ever touch them with a ten-foot pole. 

It’s normal for young women or girls to fantasize about sleeping with older men. I used to develop crushes on my male teachers. But usually these fantasies are just that—fantasies. Even if an 18 year old still fantasizes about older men, and even though in the eyes of the law she is deemed an adult, it’s still super creepy on the older man’s behalf to pursue her. There is NO reason for a man to date or fuck someone young enough to be his daughter. 

So say what you want about “it’s legal tho!!” and “they’re two consenting adults!!” If I’m in my 30s and I’m on a date with a guy my age, and he admits to me that he dates and/or sleeps with girls that are fresh out of high school...I will walk out the door faster than I can take my next breath.

I wanted to thank this sub for what it is. There are not many places on the internet (or anywhere, really) that tell it like it is. It seems every story, book, movie, comic or media piece lied to me. 

There are many websites that show men how to better abuse us, get the best of our body, of our mind, of our soul. The advice we most often get is made up of nothing but false platitudes that will benefit men. It will often do more damage unto us than protect us.

There are little female spaces that actually function for the sole benefits of women. 

What sites, book, podcasts, youtube channels, etc do you know that are actually beneficial to women? 
Anything from self-improvement, being good at adulting, finances, dating, charisma and so forth from the point of view of a woman and for her to be most benefited?

For example. a guy exaggerating about what he does for work and phrasing it in a way that makes it sound like he's super important and successful, but when you dig deeper you find out he's actually not that successful and makes a low income, he's just really good at exaggerating. Or a guy pretending to be more interesting than he is by claiming he has a particular interesting hobby, and then you find out that he's only done it once 3 years ago, which doesn't make it a hobby in my opinion. Another guy claimed to own his townhouse which impressed me as it was located in a pretty expensive area, and I later discovered he was just renting it.

Some thoughts I have:

There is no correlation between how nice someone dresses and his income. Anyone with a minimum wage job can get a credit card and buy a bunch of trendy brand name clothes. I wouldn't date a guy who dresses like a slob either, but wearing expensive clothes, jewelery, latest iphone, etc is no indicator of wealth or success.

An expensive car also says nothing about his success. With easy credit and long term loans, even someone with a low income can finance an expensive new car. Some people are simply willing to spend more of their income to look flashy than other people are. It says more about his priorities than his wealth. Or it could just be a lease. I would be more interested in how clean his car is, like does it have discarded fast food wrappers all over the floor and smell like a high school locker room.

Living in a nice place is harder to fraud, but still no guarantee of success. He could just be renting it (not that that's necessarily bad depending on the situation), or maybe his parents still pay his bills for him (whether you're willing to date a guy who's wealthy but inherited his wealth instead of earning it is a separate discussion altogether which I won't get into here).

I'm curious to hear others thoughts and experiences.",43718,Men frauding how successful they are,0,,

Whether this is scripted or not, I can believe that this shit probably happens irl anyway
In summary:
The woman pays for the man's ubers, food, gave him money when he was unemployed, helped him get a job, etc.
And what did she get in return?
The next chance a woman shows like 10% interest in him, he's ready to deny that theyre dating and try to hookup with the new girl
AND on top of that, deny that she helped him out financially and pretend that he was supporting her instead

Yall were correct in that but I did not realize I was in danger and there was a clock on it. 
I had a major surgery about 6 weeks ago and had planned to wait till I was fully healed to do the break up cause I know how they can go down and wanted to be able to defend myself if necessary.
On Saturday evening my BF sexually assaulted me after he came over when I said I didn't feel well and didn't want him at my house. 
I was and am on a lot of meds because of the surgery and pretty physically weak due to blood loss etc. I screamed NO and tried to get away but he is much bigger than me and nothing worked. He wouldn't leave after and kept telling me sorry . I am not supposed to drive in my state but I ran out to my car and drove to my brother's house. He kept calling me and texting saying that "" you never said no, I just thought you were tired"" ""you wouldn't remember because of the meds"" etc. Apparently he is so stupid he doesn't understand that being on pain killers and muscle relaxants doesn't wipe your memory. I checked myself into the Behavioral Access Center at my local hospital cause I couldn't stop crying and having panic attacks. I am now on more meds for the panic attacks and for sleep.

Male lurkers: This is the shit women have to worry about when they travel overseas and/or alone.

No, this is cultural misogyny. Believe women close to you when they say this is a risk. Call out other men when they show a mere whiff of apologism and ""cultural relativism"" for this bullshit. Sometimes you use ""worse"" incidents in other countries to excuse sexism in the Western world. Newsflash: it is all from the same problem. It's on you to speak up if you truly are a ""feminist"" and want to change the world for us and our sisters overseas. Don't whine when we refuse to meet you in a secluded place on a first date. It's not our problem if your feefees are hurt because we won't trust some dude we barely know. Think critically.   
 

Ladies: Please never apologize for your safety precautions on a date or wherever. This girl did absolutely nothing wrong, endured a trauma, was accused of lying, and now may be imprisoned.

So we've all had those guys on OLD. They're pushy, obnoxious, negging, disrespectful, or otherwise dropping red flags. But then there's the REALLY shitty ones, the ones that borderline insult you *while asking for sex.* The ones that are up front that they're cheating on their wives and just want a fuck toy. Yeah, you know the ones. The extra shitty ones.

My new favorite tactic for dealing with these guys is as follows:

**Step 1:** Identify the shit bag. At this point you *could* report &amp; unmatch. And often I will do this. But hear me out.

**Step 2:** Play along. Tell him you'll meet him at your house. DO NOT give him your phone number (though, why would you ever actually give someone your phone number? Rookie nonsense). Tell him you'll meet up with him but you don't want anything serious. Oh, and you're house sitting so he'll need to meet you there. It's in the next town over.

**Step 3:** Give him your address. Oh wait. No, it's not your address. It's the address of the McDonald's from the next town over, but with 1 digit changed (1150**6** Pacific Highway instead of 1150**8** Pacific Highway). This way it won't show him in searches but it will usually show up as the parking lot or somewhere random but nearby.

**Step 4:** Tell him you're getting sexy for him, and you can't wait to meet up. 

**Step 5:** When he's almost there, unmatch &amp; report him for being shitty. If enough people report him, his profile will get banned, which is always fun. But make sure you take a moment to laugh and laugh at what a gross idiot he is. 

**Optional Step 6:** Find their wives and send them screenshots. I have a burner Facebook page just for this purpose, and you better fucking believe I out every cheater I can. Usually their wives are fairly easy to find because men are stupid and put their names/snapchats/instagrams/jobs on their profile, and if you live in a smaller city this is typically pretty easy to do. All I know is, if my husband were fucking around and putting **my** safety at risk, I would want to know. I even helped a woman get out of an abusive relationship by reaching out to her. 

I've done this a handful of times and I guarantee it's *very* funny. 

**FAQ**

**Q:** That's shitty.

**A:** Not a question. Also, how is it shittier than unsolicited dick pics, negging, cheating, and all the other bullshit we put up with on OLD?

**Q:** Isn't that dangerous?

**A:** How? He knows nothing about you and you'll unmatch him before he can get big mad. Also if your profile is making you in any way traceable or trackable, that's no good and you need to fix that shit pronto.

**Q:** Aren't you just fighting fire with fire and making the world a worse place by harming the poor little man-boys?

**A:** lol no.",43712,My favorite OLD strategy for dealing with assholes,0,,

**THE TACTICS**

The author probably could have greatly condensed this list, as there's much overlap ... but here you go anyway.  For ease of reference, let's call Bob the manipulator and Sue the person being manipulated, although these genders could certainly be switched, depending on your context.

1. **Intermittent Reinforcement** - Bob pseudo-randomly applies positive reinforcement on a somewhat inconsistent basis, but only toward Sue's behaviors that suit Bob's interests.  He does not reward her every time; rather, his goal is to cause confusion so that she is left in a perpetual state of seeking his reinforcement without having secure knowledge on how to get it.  This is viewed by many psychologists as the most powerful manipulation tactic in existence, as it is the tactic most likely to create an addiction.  That addiction could be to Bob himself, or it could be to the rewards that he gives her - the object of the addiction doesn't matter so much as the fact that Bob is in control of that which motivates Sue.

2. **Negative Reinforcement** - Bob doesn't like the context of the relationship, so he acts in a way that is upsetting to Sue; but when Sue conforms her behavior, Bob stops his disruptive and upsetting behaviors.  This could be as simple as Bob withholding affection, time, etc. until Sue conforms her behaviors.  /u/BluepillProfessor had a post a while back on [*The Taming of the Shrew*](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriedredpill/comments/6rdlxj/the_taming_of_the_shrew_a_red_pill_analysis_xpost/), where Petruchio models this perfectly, engaging in bizarre and disruptive behaviors until his wife, Katharina, conforms.

3. **Backing Into an Emotional Corner** - Bob uses Sue's emotions as a scapegoat to pressure-flip.  For example, Bob screwed up and Sue calls him out on it.  Ignoring the issue, Bob accuses Sue of being overly emotional in the way she confronted him.  Sue is upset that Bob makes this accusation of her and gets defensive.  Bob yells back, ""I knew it, you're doing it again adn it's only going to get worse.  I won't talk to you while you're like this,"" and then leaves.  Sue's emotions have become the object of the argument instead of Bob's screw-up.

4. **Shifting the Focus** - This is akin to the last, but minus the emotional drama.  Sue believes Bob is having an affair and has found some supporting evidence.  Bob denies it then accuses Sue of not trusting him and invading his privacy, which he can prove definitively she has done, despite that Sue's ""evidence"" is not definitive, and therefore maintains the focus on Sue instead of himself, even if he really did cheat on her.

5. **Premature Disclosure** - Bob eyes Sue at the bar and wants to get in her pants.  Within a few minutes they're talking and far earlier than contextually appropriate, he starts spilling his guts about deep and personal information about his life, which causes Sue to feel emotionally connected and bonded to him, regardless of the truth of the information.  Bob has earned emotional leverage toward his goals with Sue, who otherwise has likely had a hard time finding a guy as ""sensitive"" as Bob to be so open about his life.

6. **Triangulation** - Bob is with Sue when he meets Amy.  Bob brings up Amy periodically and occasionally says things to Sue like, ""Amy said the same thing last week!""  Bob denies interest in Amy, but Sue can't help but feel she must compete with Amy for Bob's affection.  Bob may or may not actually be grooming Amy to replace Sue and inducing Sue to jealousy as his excuse to change the relationship when he's ready to move on.

7. **Blaming the Victim** - Bob is objectively at fault for his relationship with Sue going south.  Nevertheless, he spins a story that makes Sue look like the one at fault - and his story may be 100% true or predominantly false; it doesn't matter.  He shares this story with mutual friends and even Sue herself, leaving Sue without a support structure and wondering if she really is the one at fault after all.

8. **Indirect Insults** - Bob tells Sue that her dress is very ""slimming,"" causing Sue to believe she is otherwise overweight.  Bob tells sue that the sex was decent.  Bob suggests that Sue could be a better wife to him if she took some cooking classes.  Bob's not acting mean and Sue wasn't aware there were any problems, but Bob's comments reveal his negative perceptions of Sue in a way that would make her look like the ""bad guy"" if she reacted with negative emotion to his back-handed compliment.

9. **Insinuating Comments or Compliments** - To get her hamster spinning off-balance, after sex Bob says, ""Dang, girl, you'd make a great prostitute.""  Sue begins to wonder why Bob is thinking about prostitutes while having sex with her, what his sexual expectations are, how he knows so much about prostitutes, and just what he really thinks about her.  When questioned about it the next day, Bob has plausible deniability in saying, ""I just mean you were really good in the sack last night.""

10. **Guilt** - Bob says things to Sue like, ""I can't believe you'd even think I could lie to you!"" or ""How can you feel that way after all I've done for you?"" or ""Don't worry, I guess I'll manage somehow if you don't want to help"" or ""If you really loved me you would ___.""

11. **Shame** - Bob utilizes Sue's sense of self-worth and identity to affect her behavior.  For example, Sue doesn't want to watch the kids so Bob can go out with the guys, so Bob comments, ""What kind of a mother are you?""  This is most powerful when Bob comments about the things Sue self-identifies with most, such as her status as a mother as compared with her general good qualities of being empathetic or caring.  Although Intermittent Reinforcement is the most powerful tactic, this one is the most psychologically harmful and does have significant long-term effects.

12. **Empty Words** - Bob tells Sue what she wants to hear, but his actions are not consistent.  For example, Bob repeatedly physically assaults Sue, causing serious bodily harm.  He explains afterward, ""I only did it because of how much I love you.  You make me feel such intense passion - I could never have done that if I didn't have those strong feelings toward you.  I love you so much, and I'm so sorry!""  And then he repeats the process the next day.

13. **Crazymaking** - Bob said something that upset Sue.  Sue confronts Bob about it.  Bob denies it, even though he knows he said it.  He denies it so fervently that Sue believes she's going crazy for having believed he said it in the first place.

14. **Gaslighting** - Akin to the last, Bob directly attacks Sue's sanity when evaluating a perception she has that is not favorable to Bob's interests.  ""I don't know where you got that idea from.  It's all in your head.  You've always had a bad memory.  Are you crazy?  You're imagining things.""  For example, Bob tells a story, leaving out important details.  Sue relies on Bob's story and something bad happens because of the lack of information.  Bob claims to have told her what she needed to know in the first place and that it's her perception that is off, not his narrative.

15. **Minimizing** - Sue is upset about something Bob did.  Bob accuses her of blowing it out of proportion and that the issue is objectively not a big deal and it's her emotional state that's amplifying the problem, which he doesn't have to tolerate.

16. **The Silent Treatment** - Bob refuses to acknowledge Sue when her behavior is non-conforming to his expectations.

17. **Lying** - Bob provides false information or omits important information in order to get Sue to do something that advances his interests, often-times hiding the lie within a series of truths.

18. **Invalidation** - Sue expresses important aspects of how she is feeling about something, which expression is disaligned with Bob's interests.  Bob replies with phrases like, ""It could be worse"" or ""You shouldn't feel that way"" or ""Get over it"" or ""Stop taking things so personally"" or ""You've gotta be joking"" or ""I'm sure he didn't mean it that way"" or ""Every cloud has a silver lining.""  Rather than acknowledging the fact of how she is actually feeling, he's trying to change how she feels so that he doesn't have to deal with her feelings.

19. **Charm** - Bob sees Sue at the bar and wants to sleep with her.  His natural form of self-expression would not get the job done, so he hides his flaws and amplifies his better qualities in order to impress her.  He also distracts her from probing deeper into his internal emotional state and identity by utilizing a combination of positive attributes, usually involving humor, bravado, sympathy, and the like.

20. **Intentional Forgetting** - Bob didn't feel like doing something important.  Sue calls him out on it, explaining how it negatively affected her.  Bob acknowledges his failure, but minimizes or denies responsibility because he couldn't possibly have followed through with something he didn't remember needed done.

21. **Brandishing Anger, or ""Traumatic One-Trial Learning""** - For select topics that are important to him, if Sue brings it up, Bob erupts with volcanic anger and a grandiose emotional display that Sue never wants to deal with again.  As a result, Sue knows never to address that issue with Bob again.

22. **Scapegoating** - Beyond general victim blaming, Bob makes a repeated pattern of shifting his unwanted thoughts and problems onto Sue.  If Bob is feeling ashamed of his alcoholism and Sue is having a glass of wine at dinner, he may accuse her of being an alcoholic or of being the one to perpetuate his alcoholism by not being sensitive to his condition.

23. **Belittling** - Bob constantly rolls his eyes, scoffs, gives smug smiles, or uses sarcasm or a mocking tone when Sue tries to articulate otherwise intelligent things that Bob doesn't want to hear or deal with.

24. **Putting You On the Defensive** - Although blended with other tactics, Bob's interest here is simply to cause Sue to become off-balance so that she responds emotionally rather than logically, as Bob knows he may not prevail in his position in a logical conversation.  When sue reacts emotionally, he has a wide array of other tactics to utilize to redirect the conversation in his favor.

25. **Creating Fear** - Although fear is a common thread, Bob sometimes intentionally targets this emotion, specifically including the fear that Sue might lose him.  Given that he becomes the only means to alleviate that fear, this gives him an immense amount of power and control in the relationship.

26. **The Pity Play** - ""I am sure that if the devil existed, he would want us to feel very sorry for him"" (Martha Stout, *The Sociopath Next Door*).  Bob relays circumstances to Sue that portray him as the victim of great unfortunate circumstance, targeting Sue's conscience and eliciting her cooperation in Bob's interests.

27. **Rationalization** - Bob did something objectively wrong or subjectively inappropriate on a mass perception scale, but utilizes logical explanation to justify his behaviors so that Sue cannot hold it against him.  Examples include: ""I didn't do anything illegal, and if it was wrong there would be a law against it"" or ""Every man watches porn!  It's not just me"" or ""I'm sorry I hit you.  I just lost my mind for a minute because you pushed so many of my buttons.""  Sue desperately wants to understand Bob's behavior, and Bob is happy to help her do just that.

28. **Flattery** - Bob engages in a consistent pattern of making Sue feel good about herself when she's around him.  This feeling can be leveraged toward the advancement of a singular purpose he wants to engage in with Sue, or it can be used to foster a long-term dependence on Bob that makes it hard for Sue to escape or perceive him rationally because ""he's just so perfect all the time, except when ...""

29. **Love Bombing** - When utilizing flattery, Bob was engaging in consistent moderated behaviors to maintain a long-term dopamine association Sue has with him, but when love bombing he spikes those levels to intense proportions over a short period of time to accelerate the stages of the relationship rather quickly to a degree that Sue would do anything for Bob because of how intense she feels when around him.

30. **Trance and Hypnosis** - Bob learns to utilize ordinary daily experiences to focus Sue's attention into a hyper-concentrated state that can be utilized to advance her intrigue and dependence on Bob.  A common example is the ""psychopathic stare,"" like when Bob's at the bar staring at Sue and she notices, but he won't stop and she can't think of anything else except why that guy across the room keeps eyeing her that way, all other aspects of the surrounding environment being phased out in the process.  Hypnosis is when Bob has direct influence over Sue during her trance.  Trances and hypnosis lower psychological defenses, making a person more susceptible to suggestion and other manipulation tactics.

With everything I have going on, i am also very confident and sometimes finding a guy who thinks he can handle me is very hard. Im 21 and Based on how younger guys act immature and dumb I tend to date only older guys. 
Now, im seeing this 28 year old, he is supposed to be mature and grown but tonight I found out he might be a dumbass like all of them. We ve been talking for 3 months but I still didn’t feel like I was ready for anything. And he kept making crazy promises, tonight I went out with my girls to a club close to his house that he suggested, we get there and 10 minutes later he walks in. Im chill and cool and ready to say hi. When he walks up to a bar and starts rubbing and holding an older lady. I turn my head cos Im not a confrontational person. We make eye contact and im super mad but not showing instead im ignoring. Next thing I see is he is giving his number to another girl. 
Im kinda confused, two days ago he said he wanted commitment from me asap and I said I needed time and he said he was willing go wait now I see him in the club right in front of my eyes. I feel as though there is an explanation, but at the same time I feel as tho it makes sense. For the past three months his best friend has been trying to get with me as well, which was quite confusing. I never told him about it, bcos my mind told me that he knew. I feel like i have been played and now I just want help knowing what to do next, do I ignore his texts and move on and maybe give him a little piece of my mind or do I date his friend or do I just remove this toxic chapter out of my 2020 book?!",44835,Messy so messy,0,,

The way I see it, there’s a mutual agreement and understanding that I’m in it purely for the money and he’s in it for the sex and company. We are both using each other and benefiting from it.

I was fine with who I was before but I could see when I date guys, lot of times before they get to know me, they start making judgments and when I meet guys on tinder it always lasted short term.  I thought it was because of my weight and same thing when I joined seeking arrangement. I met around 15 guys there but none except 1-2 wanted arrangement with me.  But arrangement as in only bedroom fun. 
They say when you lost weight and look different the whole world treats you better, so I wanted to be better. I started working out and I lost 38lbs. 
Then I realized how different guys were towards me. I could get things more easily and guys who didn’t like me came crawling back to me. The guys who only saw me as fwb material started to see me more often. But ofc, is refuse them because I saw the other side of them. 
But also it taught me important lesson. If you want people to treat you nicer and better and have have variety of options available to you, you have to look your best self. As much as I like to deny it, it’s undeniable truth. 
And being on seeking really lowered my self esteem. Because I knew that I never could be the tall slim girl which every guy wants nor could I fit in the stereotypical asian. Guys would suggest amount according to their look scales and more often that not, they didn’t want to see me for the 2nd time. 

I wasn’t afraid of rejection anymore. Because if they did, i wouldn’t blame it on my weight. It’d be other things or more often it’s be their issue. But also due to me being overweight previously, it really made me open up my eyes to see the shadow side of men. 
They treat women who they think below their league as shit. After this experience, I appreciate guys good personality more. 
It’s definitely rude awakening for me. 
I once googled on dating advice and lot of times it’s guys asking they like the girls personality but not the looks, but also don’t want to hurt the girls feelings. And truth to be told, I’ve been in similar experience and I know how it feels to be ‘that’ girl. It destroys your entire self esteem. Also most guys end up choosing pretty girl over girl with personality. Because for guys, sex matters more than anything. If you see the girl that guys cheated on, and the compare the girl Thad he was with, the new girl is likely more pretty.  

That’s why after this experience, I wanted to put myself first. Because once I’m more confident in myself, I become more firm about my standards, so that I don’t get swept away by other people’s opinion.",44770,Simple change that changed my life,0,,

1.) I’m tired of being hit on by random stranger men everywhere I go. I feel like if they see a ring, they won’t try to talk to me and will stop staring. 
2.) Safety. If someone assumes I am with a man, there is less of a chance of being stalked, followed home, etc or anything else. I’m a bit paranoid but whatever, I don’t really care. 
3.) Starting my own business in a place where I don’t know as many people (relatively new city) means I will be out a bit more marketing myself. Looking my info up by name is easy- just like it is for literally anyone. I don’t want strangers assuming I’m alone or single. 

I feel a little ridiculous that I am resorting to this. But as someone who has been married before and is not now, I did NOT used to get hit on back then like I do now. I swear they look at my hand and think it gives them the right to tell me I’m beautiful or whatever else. I don’t like it. It’s sad that a ring makes me feel more safe and secure but it’s true. 

Just curious to see what you all think.

He took me to expensive restaurants, footed the bill, picked expensive bottles of wine, always made sure I got home safe and only kissed me for the first time on date 3. Except that his communication in between dates was virtually non existent. He would take over 48hours to reply to me. At first I didn’t mind, as he has a demanding job and I’m not a huge fan of txts if they’re not to arrange the next date. But he took a week to get back to me this time and had a lame apology about a work project. I replied that I had enjoyed getting to know him, that I thought he was a lovely guy but I was getting the impression we wanted different things out of dating. I wished him well and released him back into the wild. Zero response and came across his dating profile hours later. 
My takeaway from this is, I shouldn’t have even bothered the first time he didn’t txt me back in a reasonable time frame. When he would take days to reply, I got into a pattern of feeling anxious I was being ghosted and then relieved and grateful when I would finally get a response. I reread the handbook today, remembered he should feel seriously lucky he’s had the time of day from me, and have made a New Year’s resolution to be assertive about behaviour I don’t like from the beginning.

I thought I had left my pickmeisha behavior in the past when I ditched some toxic gal friends and swore off dating for a little over a year. I thought I grew so much spiritually, mentally and in my education and was ready to take on life's challenges and continue my winning streak with CONFIDENCE, HIGH STANDARDS AND HIGH SELF-ESTEEM. That's right when I got back out there in the dating pool and put all my eggs in one basket  for a fixer upper, LV, narcissistic, emotionally and potentially physically abusive man.  And let me tell you, you shoulda called me Joanna fucking Gaines the way I  was trying to put all the shiplap on that fucking relationship y'all. Trying to fix it, flip it, gut it and put in new hardwood, all of that!

First of all, I told him every single thing I was looking for in a man! EVERY THING! He of course pretended to be those things for nearly a year. Even within that year there was so much, SO MUCH that I ignored and made excuses for in my head. I thought I had been chosen by a sensitive man who just had some trouble times with his mom and that he was misunderstood by everyone around him. I thought that when he told me that his ex gf accused him of being abusive that she had a right to feel what she felt but when he began doubling down on the fact that he wasn't by giving examples of how he in fact was, I rearranged my LOUD SOUNDING RED FLAG ALARMS to low muffled sounds and told myself she was/must have been overexaggerating. 90% of our dates were walks in the park or through the city. Y'all I had to eventually start wearing sneakers just to stay comfortable for all the walking we did. DINNER OR LUNCH? DUTCH OR I PAID IN FULL. When we stayed at bed &amp; breakfast establishments we went DUTCH or I PAYED FOR THEM IN FULL. I PAID IN FULL FOR A BED &amp; BREAKFAST AND LUNCH FOR MY OWN BIRTHDAY Y'ALL! All the women friends he had that he wouldn't tell me much about? It was fine I wasn't the type to be a jealous bitch, lol what foolishness was that!! Y'all he'd visit his female friends and not tell me, take his phone in the bathroom ALWAYS and talk shit and or praise some of these same female friends. He was either using them or clearly wanted to fuck them. He expressed countless times that sometimes he still had urges from his 'old ways' I desperately pleaded that he either leave or decide he wants commitment INSTEAD OF JUST DUMPING HIS ASS FROM JUMP! He on more than one occasion said to me ""I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF I LIKE YOU FOR YOU OR IF ITS THE FACT THAT YOU STROKE MY EGO"" I laughed this off y'all! He showed me who he was and even covertly warned me PLENTY OF TIMES. BUT MY PICK ME ASS WANTED TO FEEL LOVED AND WANTED THAT  I THREW AWAY ALL OF MY VALUES, STANDARDS, SELF- RESPECT AND SO MUCH MORE  AND SETTLED FOR A CRUSTY ASPIRING ENTERTAINER WHO SLEPT IN A DIRTY SMELLY ROOM ON THE FLOOR IN HIS MAMA'S HOUSE. 

&amp;#x200B;

I lowered my standards for 2 years because I thought the breadcrumbs he was giving me was love. You know the love that you're supposed to ""make work"" aka settle for because you don't think you can do any better. I put my emotional health, sexual h ealth, physical health, financial wealth, time, energy, and being at risk for a broke man with a pipe dream who emotionally and mentally abused me, with the potential of physical abuse cuz I wanted to get chose. Also this was my FIRST ADULT RELATIONSHIP. 

It feels more than amazing to be re-established in my queendom and to focus on leveling up! Stay powerful and strong ladies and feel free to share any of your nightmarish experiences .",44516,What was your worst pickmeisha experience like with a LV ex?,0,,

I'm European and in my country you can get divorced on the spot if you'd agreed about splitting assets and child custody. You don't even need to go to court, just a notarized agreement will do -this law is rather new and is known as ""express divorce law"".

If you can't reach an agreement you serve your spouse the divorce papers and they have 20 days to make allegations. If they don't react I means that they've agreed to everything and that's it. If they do have allegations you both go to court to pledge your case and in 30 days tops the judge must give a verdict. Mind you, the judge only decides about child custody/support and marital assets, the divorce itself is automatically granted. 

You aren't asked the reasons why you have a divorce, the only legal requirement is to have been married for at least three months.

Reading Reddit, which is heavily American, I have the impression that getting divorced there is a clusterfuck that can drag for years (!!!). I understand that it depends on the specific state but in general, it sounds like a nightmare.

After our second anniversary together, I told him I can no longer put off marriage and will need to know if we would get engaged this year, in order to continue the relationship. 

His response was that he needs more time to think about it. I said that’s not good enough, took my things and left.

He cyberstalked me, and tried to interject himself in my work a few months later in order to get one-on-one facetime with me (we usually didn’t work on the same projects).

Eventually I resigned, as he made the job really painful for me, emotionally.

Well guess what? His visa was not renewed, his job was eliminated and he was forced to leave the country.

I know for a fact that he wanted to stay in this country permanently more than anything, and was working very hard on achieving a green card.

Had we been married, he would have been a full-fledged citizen.

I want to vent about the standards of females that they have for males. Which is... 0. And it pisses me off. Is it really what it takes not to beat a female?

My best friend has a  LVM bf for almost 10 years. She is 25 and he is 28. They never lived together because they did LDR and she studied for a long time to get her masters degree. Now, he's 28. He lives in an apartment his father owns and he sells goods in markets. His job is very summer-job like and it has no prospects of career growth. He works 4 days in a week. Sometimes he's off for a whole month to sell stuff in a different area. His hobbies is playing computer games. He constantly complains about his job, but isn't able to find another one.

Now, my friend has a STEM degree. When he realized that she could make more money if she did more courses in university, he was mad at her that she ""chose the easier way."" She still makes more than he does. The worst part is that when she comes to his apartment, she cleans and irons his t-shirts. He doesn't go to gym or cook properly. They almost don't go for walks or to restaurants. When she's with him, they ""play computer games, haha"" and they have sex maybe once when she comes over for a week. She doesn't want to pressure him, because she believes that he will come around. And also because she ""loves him."" That's what she says and I'm furious about it.

I honestly think that he was using her getting a degree to live sort of frat-life till his 28 years. Now she is going to move to his apartment and I just see how useless he is and how much she loves him still and she plans a family with him. I'm so mad that she is enabling this man-child who should grow up and get a proper career. I was with a LVM like this once and it lasted only for a year because I couldn't stand coming home from school and see him sitting at his computer, screaming because his game was lagging (he's engaged now, that poor girl.)

I'm angry that pickmeishas are enabling this behaviour. I mean, my friend is making more than her LVM bf and she will still cook for him and clean for him. Is that normal? I don't even know what to do with her. I'm not sure she knows it's love since she's with him since 15. I'd like to see her the light, but it's probably not possible.

He's attractive, attentive, funny, kind, polite. He's 25, older than me (22), seems pretty set in his life (in a good way) and I thought 'fuck it', and arranged a date with him. 

It was so wonderful, the entire thing. We had a great time, got on really well, he paid for all the drinks and the show we went to (even though I personally prefer to split, I'm not going to argue). We were together for about 5 hours total. 

On the way from the show to a pub, I mentioned that I was going to finish a film when I got home. 'Oh, won't I be a bit distracting?' He asked. I laughed and said I don't invite people back after a first date, it's a personal preference and I like to get to know someone better first.

I swear to god, STRAIGHT away he started trying to almost persuade me. 'Oh I understand but we've had such a great time, we get on so well, I feel so comfortable around you, I already know I want to see you again'

Dude I wouldn't fucking care if I knew you were the love of my life, you're still not coming back to my house.

I ignored it, we went to the pub, continued to have a great time and when I said I needed to go he insisted on us getting a taxi together, which at first I thought was sweet but then realised was a last ditch effort for me to invite him in. 

I don't get it, I'm not against casual sex, I'm not against sleeping with someone on the first date, I just personally don't want to anymore. I've have too many guys use me for sex and then vanish (good riddance, obviously) and I enjoy sex more when I know the person and don't feel shy or uncomfortable around them.

Plus I've only just got out of something that I thought was 'serious', so yeah I'm a bit apprehensive about sleeping with someone again.

UGH I don't know what I want this post to be, I just don't understand why a guy thinks a date is 'pointless' because they didn't laid at the end.

Awhile ago I was in a very bad place and I texted one of my exes asking for some financial support. Since I have always dated HVM this was no problem; they are always happy to help even after we break up. Unfortunately he couldn't help but he called up a friend. Said friend was about to drive to my city to get me a hotel room for a week+groceries+misc. items.

When I stopped answering my ex bf, his friend reached out to me and reassured me he didn't want to sleep with me and he wasn't expecting to be paid back. I explained to him that I hadn't been answering because my phone died and although I appreciated it, a family member was unexpectedly able to help me out. 

However, I really appreciated his generosity and kindness and we've been texting on and off since. This guy doesn't have a car but he has a job and he's saving up for one. He texted me asking if I'd like to go out on a date, made it clear he would be happy to pay, and apologized for not being able to pick me up. Told me I could pick any restaurant I wanted or I could have him plan it, whichever I preferred. 

I said yes. I understand this man isn't financially stable yet, and thus a liability until proven otherwise, but I would at least like to thank him in person before I move on. 

Girls, what do you think about this?

I would be lying if I said I'm not a little hopeful that the situation has potential. For instance, if I find out that he's a financially independent, working student, I would probably give him a chance if I liked him enough.",44373,"Going on a date with a low income, HVM?",0,,

2. Single/formerly single FDS ladies, how much time (hours per week) do you spend dating multiple men (plus getting ready for dates!)? I am truly busy and don’t have time to be dating a different guy each day. 

3. In the event I am nearing engagement, should I tell the guy my family on both sides has men who have emotionally/physically abused and/or cheated on the women they married? I’m -from a non-western culture where values matter a lot, and you marry a family, not a person. So this knowledge is important and hiding it isn’t considered the ‘right thing to do.’ I don’t want to be a liar. However, I’m worried revealing this would make him think it would affect our relationship, and that I accept LVM behavior because other women in my family did. I would also like for this hypothetical guy to be on good terms with my family, and how could he do that when he learns what has happened?

So I've been single for a few years, not for lack of trying. I'm in my late 20s and so tired of the endless tinder fuckboy cycle. Never meet any guys in person. I've been trying to embrace FDS mentality and not be a pickmeisha. I really like it so far and I've been trying to level up by going to the gym, eating healthy, embracing my hobbies. But one thing is getting me down: JEALOUSY, especially of my friends.

I feel like my friends are GORGEOUS and i'm just average. I know this stems from confidence issues, but what can I actually DO? My best friend has like 4 guys interested in her right now. Another best friend has a boyfriend and ALWAYS has interest from guys, she's had many boyfriends in the past. My roommate has an ex boyfriend that she actually dumped for LVM behaviour (yass queen) but he's model-gorgeous, still in love with her, and she also has like 5 guys after her. They literally have their pick of almost any man.

Then there's me. No interest from any guy except from one or two NEET losers. Single since 2016 after a three month disastrous relationship (I had another in between but I was so pickmeisha'd into believing it was real that I wouldn't even call it a relationship). Get matches only to be ghosted within a few minutes by Tinder slugs. How can I not be jealous of my friends? I really don't want to be. I want to empower and uplift other women, not see them as my competition. But I can't help but feel bitter that out of 50 guys, my friends would have 40 of them interested and I would have 2 or 3 of them I could weed through to find even a nugget of actual relationship potential, let alone HVM. No man has ever pursued me for a relationship. I pickmeisha'd my last two by asking THEM out (cringe).

You might be in a place in your life where you go along with LVM and their trifling behavior, but are so used to it and broken down by it, that you don't really know how to put an end to the cycle. You do not feel like you deserve better. A man paying for you? *Unspeakable*, you scoff. *Not me! I am not that entitled.* You've told yourself that good things don't happen to girls like you. You have bad luck. No one is going to treat you like a queen.

What's the solution?

Give yourself a different name to think of yourself with, or use your own, but **start thinking of yourself in third person**. I'm serious. I am going to use Jane Doe as an example in this post.

You aren't you anymore, you're Jane Doe. You need to commit to helping Jane Doe live her best life possible. Jane Doe is a go-getter and true FDS queen. She doesn't deserve this dumb, time-wasting shit you put her through. Every morning when you get up, you have to ask yourself, what is in Jane's best interest to do today? What would Jane like to do today? What goals are Jane and I about to accomplish? What can I do to help propel Jane forward in life? Make it your responsibility to help out (your new name). She deserves it. 

When your self-esteem and self-worth is so low, rock bottom, you need to do this to begin re-framing your mindset. If it is difficult to extend kindness to yourself, well, **you certainly can extend kindness to Jane, right? She's not you.** If it's easier for you to be kinder to strangers than to yourself, you need to start envisioning yourself as a stranger. 

Eventually, you'll see, Jane is you, and she's always been you. She's the you you would be if you would stop getting in your own way so much. She's the you you want to be, but feel too helpless to work towards. She is the you who  isn't bogged down by defeatist self-talk and who knows her worth, and she is who you would be if you started treating yourself better and believing you deserve good things. 

Soon enough, you'll transfer your self-love back to yourself and reattach it to your own name. You will see that you are the one who should be helping yourself propel forward in life. You will understand that it's ok to be selfish and take care of yourself the way you looked out for Jane/Your Name. You were taking care of Jane, but now you see that can take care of you too, and the world won't stop. 

**Tldr**\- if you feel worthless, have low self-esteem, have trouble feeling like you deserve excellent treatment-disassociate from yourself. Think of yourself in third person. See if it's easier to be nice to that girl than it is to be nice to you.

On OLD, I'm sure you all have come across low-value men who have tried to push you into meeting them quickly, meeting them tonight, meeting *right this very second.* They create a false sense of urgency to alarm you and distress you, and to trigger a scarcity-mindset reaction. You're supposed to think, *""oh no, I have to comply to his demands immediately or else I lose this man forever!""* When you're caught up in the moment, or a recovering pickmeisha, it's hard to see these tricks for what they really are- *manipulation tactics.* 

You, at no point, should ever feel rushed into anything. Not first dates. Not phone calls. Not sex. Not marriage. Not moving in together. **You** are the one who gets to decide when things happen in your life, and no one else. The LVM will try to dictate the pace, and it's up to you to ignore the fuck out of those feeble attempts. There is no rush to do anything at all, especially things you never wanted to do or set out to do.

Do you want to talk to him more him more before meeting? Totally a-ok. Do you want to date longer  before feeling comfortable enough to have sex with a new bf? Totally fine. Do you want to chill at home instead of go out, but a LVM keeps trying to force you to go out? Literally, just block his ass. Not only is dick abundant and low in value, but if the man cares about you, he is not going to have an issue with your boundaries or with waiting (for anything).

A few years ago, Real Housewife, Bethenny Frankel, promoted a philosophy of saying ""yes"" to everything. Her idea was, that some people are too closed off to new experiences and play it too safe. She advised women to start saying yes to everything.

In reality, we should be saying no a lot more. We, as women, should be honoring our own boundaries, a hell of a  lot more. **You are not a supporting actress in your life**, waiting for things to happen to her. No, you are a queen, and a boss ass bitch. **You are the one who sets the tone, the pace, and the precedent for all your relationships.** You are not someone who is about to get pressured and cajoled into doing ANYTHING you didn't set out to do.

If your boundaries are weak or permeable, I encourage you to get to the core of that issue before dealing with men. LVM are opportunists, and they are thrilled at the chance to take advantage of someone naive, trusting, and gullible. Don't fall for it.

YOU are the one who sets the pace. 

YOU are the one deciding when you're having sex for the first time with a HVM.

YOU are the one deciding when a date is convenient for you. You don't need to compromise if he won't compromise. Your time is not less valuable than his. Yes, even if he is a doctor, FDSers. His ""crazy hours"" amazingly don't seem to interfere in his 7-9pm Tinder swiping session that he is never late for. Stop bending over backwards for ""workaholics"".

YOU are the one who sets the pace.

Remain unbothered &amp; unpressured, ladies. Ignore a LVM's desperate attempts to get you to accommodate him and do what's convenient for HIM. Take a step back from the situation and rationally think about what's going on. Your boundaries and preferences are being stamped on, by a person who gives 0 shit about your comfort and your boundaries.

There is only one reasonable response to you expressing a boundary- and that is a man respecting it. Not pushing it, not sulking over it,  not crying over it, not throwing a temper tantrum, not launching into a lecture as to why you should change your mind, and definitely not trying to convince you otherwise. 

Y'all are queens and should be treated as such. Your opinions and boundaries are worthy of respect. Don't let a LVM trample on them. LVM have an easy time thinking of their wants, needs, and boundaries, and disregarding all of yours.

You must take a proactive approach and tell yourself, before every situation, how you want the exchange to go. Remind yourself what your boundaries are and what pace you're comfortable with. Start getting offended when your boundaries are ignored. Do not give the benefit of the doubt, *they know you're uncomfortable when they boundary-cross, they just don't give a shit.*

I was wondering if any of you have ever heard of Karezza or have done it before or do it currently with your HVM? I'll try to give a succinct explanation of what Karezza is for those you don't know and also provide some links at the  bottom for you to read :) So basically, Karezza is an absolute god send, and a way of having what IMO has been hands down the best goddamn sex I have \*EVER\* had in my life!! Seriously ladies, it's beyond all comprehension satisfying AF and my relationship with my HVM has never felt stronger or more connected and intimate :) Karezza (Italian for ""caress"") is a slow, tantric way of having sex (or really, making love) where, as quoted by one of the links I provided: ""the end goal of Karezza is not orgasm but increased closeness with your sexual partner. The emphasis of Karezza is not passion but love."" So basically, orgasms (okay, I know, I know, this is probably going to sound \*crazy\* but I swear I'm not insane) are taken entirely OFF the table, and you just...stop having the big O's when you have sex.

The reason for this is that when you orgasm, your brain produces a burst of dopamine (one of your two happy feel good chemicals) that give's you a pleasant, but ultimately very brief high where after it wears off, you end up crashing a little, and feeling kind of low. Instead, the orgasm is taken out of the equation, and instead Karezza focuses on pair-bonding activities which make your brain produce oxytocin instead (which is the bonding chemical that's produced during childbirth, breast feeding and sex only) which bonds and connects you closer to your partner :) Karezza is basically cuddling taken to the max, while also engaging in very slow, like, painfully slow intimate love making that promote the production of lots and lots of amazing oxytocin!! 

Plus, another benefit is that because there are no orgasms to signal the end of sex, sex can last for waaaaay way longer than the maybe \*fingers crossed\* 20 minutes you \*might\* get if you're lucky and your man can hold out long enough...Sex with my HVM and I once lasted for over \*2\* HOURS and if we hadn't had to actually do stuff that day, we could've easily gone for longer. My BF and I have been practicing Karezza for a few months now, and neither of us have had one single orgasm this entire time and I have never felt more sexually satisfied, well...ever! I don't feel any kind of sexual frustration, or excessively horny, just good and satisfied :3

I strongly believe that if you are dating a HVM, and he is opposite to even the very \*idea\* of experimenting with Karezza and wants to focus solely on sex with orgasms, then ladies, dump that guy because he's just revealed himself to be a LVM.

 [https://www.reuniting.info/wisdom/what\_is\_karezza](https://www.reuniting.info/wisdom/what_is_karezza) (This article is a great introduction to Karezza, and the website itself is also a great resource for information...bear in mind, it's a little, uh...eye-rolling sort of ""woo-woo"" so just try your best to ignore that stuff and focus on the underlying message :3)

Here's the thing, approaching 30 I feel I'm finally just NOW inching close to the sweet spot to find a HVM (both parties between 30-35). Men at this age are finally just better. And more importantly I, personally, am a better, fuller version of myself. Sex is better. Relationships are better. 

So anyway. My timeline logic...I feel like the late 20s has been such a period of intense growth and footing for literally everyone I know. So much so that I believe if I would have partnered with a HVM in my early 20s I would regret my choice after the life-changing transformation of growing up (emotionally, mentally etc). Anyone else suspect the same would have been true for them? Or do you recommend partnering when you're young? I just don't think I'm convinced that choosing a life partner EARLY in life is a good path but maybe I'm in the minority?

Also, theres no way to say this without being blunt but basically when you're in your early/mid 20s your youth is sexualized and exploited so much that it becomes impossible to escape unscathed. Youth and young pretty beauty attracts monsters, among the decent guys. I mean in retrospect the types of men who were drawn to me in my early 20s ? They were hot trash (predatory, shallow, perverted, etc). The pool has drastically improved as I age. The youth fetishisers started to narurally weed out around like 25 I'd say. Men are still shallow af, of course, but at least the ones I find now don't have that whole youth obsession thing anymore. 

In my personal life i know women who married while they themselves were in their 20s only to find that surprise surprise these dudes are the types that are only attracted to young girls. So even as they age, they have a wandering eye for youth as aging men. Meanwhile, women who marry in their 30s don't seem to have that problem (their husbands find their wives and other age appropriate women attractive). 

Also, (almost paradoxically) now that I've learned the hard way how fucking awful it is to date older men, I now find older men who are willing to be with younger women deeply repulsive (the character of someone willing to date way younger is questionable at the very least imo) so I will never date older again, no matter how appealing he is to me. Meaning my ideal age window is pretty small (which again is 30-35) 

Also....this may be controversial and I don't want to offend anyone so I'm sorry if I'm coming across as rude, these are just my personal opinions. But i don't really think it's a high quality trait for a man to consider getting married when he is 25 or younger.

The joy for them is in the manipulation, the chase and the qualification. The affirmation that all women want a piece of their precious commitment. 

But if not? Lol.

Most, if not all, men can’t handle casual sex. Tell a man you truly want something casual on your terms and watch him crumble like a Nature Valley bar.

But how does that make sense, you ask? Isn’t the dating scene so conflicted because our biological drives are diametrically opposed, aka women want relationships, while men want sex? 

Yes, our biological drives are diametrically opposed... in some respects. But in many other respects, they are aligned. Both sexes have dual drives. Fuck some, marry even better. We all want to do our best in this game which is fair. 

But men have always given themselves a pat on the back for their dual drives. It’s always been acceptable for a man to sow his oats and then settle down with a good girl. 

Meanwhile women have been ** literally murdered** for being seen talking to men, let alone sleeping with them. Legal, financial and cultural shackles have been forced on us so that we can’t deal with men entirely on OUR terms. 

We’ve been denied access to even the knowledge of our duality, that we can value casual sex AND commitment... just with different men. Why? Because men, as the disposable sex, have been running away from the fact that they are disposable their entire existence. 


They are socialised to believe that ALL women desire relationships at ALL times. They are socialised to believe in an artificial valuation of their desirability; in fact, most men have this shared psychosis that they’re sexy. 😂😂😂

After all, why would our sexualities and choices be so harshly punished if they didn’t truly fear what we could do with it?  

So when you tell a man you want something casual with him, it shatters his fake worldview that he is the prize and you, just the commitment-crazed NPC. 

Have you ever noticed when you were emotionally unavailable (for good reasons like school or bad reasons like trauma) men tried harder? 

Have you ever noticed when you were just focused on sexual pleasure, you got more of that AND emotional goodness?

More amusingly, have you ever noticed that RP men’s biggest fear is the cock carousel? Or having to pay for endless dates but another man getting it in after 1 Long Island and a kiss?

You're right, finding casual partners is typically easy for women and difficult for men.

Which means that a man who has slept around a lot has almost inevitably spent countless hours doing nothing but the most superficial self improvement with the sole objective of getting laid, taught himself to manipulate people, trawled through clubs or Tinder spamming hundreds of people with his requests. This is valuable time he could have used for projects that improve the lives of people around him and grow his character and skill set in an admirable direction. Instead he just poured all this effort into the most selfish, basic goal possible.

A woman who has had lots of partners, however, could still have invested her time wisely, and just occasionally chosen to have fun without putting that much thought into it. Because finding partners was easy for her, she still had the time to build a well-rounded set of life skills, develop her social life, get the most of her education and cultivate creativity and kindness. In her case, a high count in itself is not evidence of wasted years.

I don't really advocate casual sex since it doesn't usually benefit women, and the culture around it has many other downsides too, but I'm tired of rolling my eyes at the double standard and the poor logic that's used to justify it when this should be obvious. Time is a resource, and how you use it determines the person you become, so why brag about how much you spend it just on getting laid.",45097,"Men who justify their double standards with ""finding sex is easy for women, but requires tons of work from men, so women with a high body count are bad but men admirable"":",0,,

Normally, disclosing sexual history is not recommended. In this situation, I knew that our relationship was mid-nosedive anyways, so 1) I didn't care about the consequences, and 2) I was hoping to reestablish a power dynamic that was more favorable to me. 

Some background: for the entirety of our one-year relationship, sometimes he implied that he was some kind of master of seduction, that he had had many girlfriends/hookups, and that there were tons of girls at his work crushing on him. I had never discussed my own sexual history, except to communicate my standard that I always use a condom, 100% of the time, no exceptions. No condom = no sex.

A few weeks before we broke up, on the night of our one-year anniversary, we were having some pillow talk. He asked me how many relationships I've had that were over one year. I said ""five, including you."" 

He was stunned, and a little angry. He said this is his first relationship that was over one year. I laughed and sarcastically said ""wooow, so I guess I have the hOnOuR of reforming a former fuckboy. Let me guess, most of your past relationships lasted one night? A week? Three months?"" 

He was offended that I laughed at him, he said defensively ""I'm not a fuckboy! You're my 3rd girlfriend actually, first one was 8 months and 2nd one was 5 months. And I've only had sex with 4 other women while not in a relationship""

""Oh okay so in total you've slept with 7 women, cool""

He then started pestering me, ""well now that I've told you mine, you have to tell me how many you've had sex with, blah blah blah"" 

I resisted telling him at first but he wasn't letting go of the issue, so I casually said ""I dunno, at least 20, but probably not more than 30. It's not like I keep track""

Boy was he MAD. He literally started yelling: ""WHAT? YOU'VE FUCKED SO MANY GUYS YOU CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER? WHAT NUMBER IS IT EXACTLY? TWENTY, THIRTY?"" He literally expected me to mentally go back and count out every single one, from when I lost my virginity at 16 until the present, at 26.

I tried reasoning with him, ""hey, it's not really that bad, let's say it's 25 people over 10 years, that averages out to only 2.5 sexual partners per year"" and ""all of this happened before I met you, it's not like I cheated on you."" When that failed to pacify, I reminded him ""babe you knew when you started dating me that I have a bit of a wild side, most of the non-relationship partners were from back in my hard-partying university days, or when I was backpacking in Europe""

Anyways, he basically spent the rest of the evening being silent and sulky and cold. He always used to give me the silent treatment to emotionally punish me, but it had very little effect at that point because he used it whenever he got mad at every tiny little thing. 

I didn't really care so I just put on some Outlander, occasionally pointing out, ""see? This is why Outlander is the ultimate female fantasy. Every woman dreams of having a man who will love her unconditionally, listen to her, and be attentive to her needs""

A few weeks later I broke up with him. If you'd like to read more about how that went, by all means go ahead and check out my post history.",45096,One of my proudest moments: my ex threw a temper tantrum when I told him the full extent of my sexual history,0,,

So far he’s very keen (have distantly known each other for a long time). He’s quite demure, bookish, loves animals, intelligent, and warm. 

His main flaw appears to be a lack of organisation with dating. He’s a very well established professional (I have verified this, company website, public records concerning property etc). 

He dropped the ball a bit recently and I said I didn’t want to date him as he ‘made no effort’. I received requests for clarification followed by a proper apology, he wanted to discuss it on the phone, he sent me flowers, promised not to repeat his behaviour, as well as a renewed request to meet and to do better. This was not lovebombing, though it sounds like it when I put it in a list! I am convinced he was just trying to show me I mattered to him, not to overwhelm or manipulate me. He wants to come to my city to take me to dinner. I said yes but I will come back to him with possible dates (he wanted to take the day off work to travel 2 hours each way to take me out this week but I can’t). 

Before we’ve even got this dinner date in the diary, he also invited me to see an expensive show that I’d love to see, as tickets are going on sale and he wants to get us some. I replied saying that I’d love to do that but cautioned ‘Maybe one thing at a time’, to which he simply replied ‘OK’. I said this partly because I don’t want to pre book two dates in advance at this stage, but mainly because he has shown me he might not be too good at time management in his personal life so I’m not about to reward him with all these engagements I’m not sure he can handle. 

My question is whether I did the right thing about the second date? I feel like I’m getting really good at nexting the LVMs but need more confidence in handling the HVMs. Hence my title - how far should I push my standards, and at what point does it become self-sabotage? Should I have said yes? In my heart of hearts I think he will get the tickets anyway, and hope to secure the date when he can, knowing full well I might be busy.

Chivalry, and impressing someone they like are all concepts they see and understand at an early age!  No sane older male figure sits a teenager down and teaches them “plate theory” when he has a crush he wants to ask out in middle school. LVM and HVM are both introduced to the value of courting when they begin their adolescence. Any older male figure and even images in society in general communicate the bare minimum and how to do it safely.

Being a fuckboy and LV CLOWNERY is something young males teach themselves by CHOICE,  because having options every week for warm pussy and free therapy was a priority instead of self-reflection and improving. 
The shit texting habits, chipotle dates, flaking excuses, gaslighting, keeping exes and ONS on back burner while they look for the 50/50 cool chick to share rent with? Tactics they learn to tweak and optimize after every application. It’s unsustainable dead end misery they EAGERLY PUT EFFORT INTO LEARNING.  

They think they can magically switch to being a top-tier husband when they find the “right girl” but the damage on their frontal lobe is set after 25. LVM literally TRAIN their brains to hunt and use women instead of provide for them for FUN, because they DECIDED building on the basics of courting was not for them.

I kind of feel like I'm at a crossroads in my life, and in seeing things with more clarity.

I've come to the realization that I really enjoy doing things for the people I care about - family, friends, romantic partners, etc. But I am starting to think it goes beyond that, and that I hold this deep seated belief that I'm not worthy of love unless I'm constantly giving and sacrificing to the point of feeling used up. 

A few of my past dates/relationships for reference:
- A guy who I really clicked with on the first date, kissed, went on a second date, and things got pretty physical. He then left abruptly and ghosted me, only to emerge weeks later saying that he was sorry, and that he was just ""freaked out"" by how much he liked me, etc. We went on another date, had a blast, and he ghosted me again.
- A guy who I drove 90 minutes to see, he took me out, we hit it off, ended up fooling around, then the next weekend I drove there AGAIN (I justified it because he had a really old dog on the verge of dying and I felt bad because he couldn't leave him alone for long periods) and we had a great time, he took me out again, we made plans, then he ghosted me mid text conversation a few days later.
- A guy who's been texting me since the summer, but has never put out the effort to come see me because he works 2 jobs and lives maybe an hour away. Yet he texts me about how he thinks about me all the time and he really wants a relationship with me. Huh??
- A guy who I met online and we instantly clicked, we had great conversation, but we haven't been able to meet due to me having my kids every other weekend and him living a ways away. He's said many times he wants a relationship, he's very serious about me, etc. And yet here we are having not met yet.  His texts have also gotten to the point where they are one word answers or emojis and it's driving me insane (I'm not initiating the texting 95% of the time AND I've called him out on his one word answers before, to no avail).
- Dating a guy right now fairly seriously who is showing less and less effort. I do so much for him (dumb, and I'm going to stop) and I realized last night that he barely does anything for me, and I'm not really getting much out of this other than ""companionship"" and I need more than that. (This is the guy I wish I was having more sex with lol - from my last post.)  Ultimately I just feel hurt by this, it feels so unfair.

So I'm kind of in a boo-hoo pity party mood right now, having just been fired, but I'm also feeling some rage bubbling up lol. I feel like these men have to go. No more of these 2 texters, or the LVM situationship. Clean slate. I just feel a little guilty about it until I realize that these guys have given me NO real reasons not to date other people.

I’m working hard on bettering my looks and my social habilities. Never been in a relationship cause I’ve been focused on bettering my mental health, or that’s what I like to say. In those times where I was distant or aloof, no one ever tried to reach me in a way that you can consider romantic. Meanwhile I was silent, weird and lonely my friends and people around me were getting into relationships, loving, getting their hearts broken and so. And I couldn’t help but just look from afar, never being the “main character” of my own love story. Right now I’m trying to be out there. To joke and be friendly. I know I’m more open now, I talk more and lead my friends from time to time. The thing is that Im in my twenties and still don’t know how to do all this thing of dating. My friends say is easy. You just find a guy and start giving him signals. If he’s interested he’ll do the rest. Like pursue you or chase you or whatever. They say sometimes you don’t even have to do much, they come to you if they see you..
The thing is that I haven’t got that kind of luck or privilege. Everytime I’m about to hang out or declare my intentions with a guy there’s always something that gets in the way. “Sorry, we can’t hang tomorrow, I’ll be busy with work” “ Oh, actually I won’t be able to hang out” “I’m actually not looking for a relationship”
I understand all of those excuses and take them like a champ.
All of the times the guys are the ones asking me to hang out so it’s even more confusing when they can’t ever find the time to do so.
I’m tired of empty chats. Short aswers, lefts on seen and the feeling of them being obligated to talk to me for some reason.
My friends tell me all the time how these guys talk so much with them, how they open up. How they’re willing to hang out, and how they go on dates that lead to relationships. And I’m just sitting there, nodding and not relating at all.
Makes me think that sonething with me is wrong. Or that I’m doing something wrong.
TL;DR: I kinda have to chase men and keep on talking so the conversation won’t stop. Men tell me to hang out then place excuses for not doing it meanwhile my friends get showered with attention and options.",46196,Wondering if there’s something I could do apart of waiting and not worrying.,0,,

Ladies,

Make sure the first time a man hits you or your child is the last time.
My lawyer encouraged me to purchase a firearm. My lawyer also specializes in DV cases since his best friends mother was killed by the father in front of the children. His friend was the only survivor.

It's been hard, it was all incredibly shocking, there were no signs of violence leading up to it. 
That I have come to learn means you treat it even more seriously if it happens to you. 
Because it's the extreme form of total emotional behavior combined with absolute lack of self control and there is no way to stay safe around someine who admits they themselves never ""ever thought they'd do that ever""
If he can't control himself, 
There is nothing you can do to stay safe besides to leave.

First time is the last time. Period. 

My son will be raised with joy and happiness and encouragement,

Money is obviously an important part of female dating strategy because we want to feel invested in right? We’re looking for a sign that the guy is serious about you and responsible for himself. Although earning good money is a sign that his life is together, he’s ambitious, responsible, hardworking and has been consistent, it doesn’t mean he’s a good or kind person who will respect you. 

So I’ll just get straight into it. To understand what $X money means to a wealthy man, and also to understand when the guy is exaggerating his wealth, you need to have a good grip on the general scale of wealth. 

In the U.K. the top 5% is anyone earning £80k or more.   Top private schools cost £40k a year. A house in London will cost seven figures. This sounds like a boring economics lesson, but it really helps you to determine what is **disposable** income to a man. In other words if he owns a property in a big city (or even just rents a nice place in a nice area) has no children, is in his 30s, then £500 isn’t a big deal for him. He’s in a certain tax bracket and he has disposable income, so don’t be fooled into thinking his spending a sign that he’s invested in you as a person. 


Here is a profile on how you can become a wealthy guy. 

1) Good Honest Hard Work over a lifetime - I’m referring to the men who are actually high value, responsible and ethical and very wealthy. They just worked their way up from wherever they were, and reaped the benefits. Top signs of a HVM who is wealthy, is he’ll be friendly, confident and comfortable talking to other men, whether they’re younger, less wealthy, older etc. 

You might notice that wealthy LVM flirt shamelessly with the female waitress but bark at the staff at the airport, and talk down to younger men. They might altogether not talk to other men. Those are the men who are ashamed of their journey and don’t like to be reminded of their youth, their competition or the time they weren’t as wealthy. They have fragile masculinity because they value themselves *only* by their money.

2) Hard work with the added privilege of having come from wealth - Not all privileged people earn what their parents earned, so its worth pointing out that what may look like his money might actually be partly Daddy’s money. Beware of the phonies who like looking generous but are spending parent’s money. That’s not investment, that’s money transfer. 

Alternatively these ones might have had success young, and generally might have been sheltered by privilege. This is not a criticism, it’s just a fact of life. There weren’t gaps in their opportunities. Because of this, some of these men are unaware of the power and weight of wealth. They are they guys who can put women in uncomfortable positions by overspending, leaving the woman feeling like she’s in some sort of debt. But high value men are emotionally intelligent, so don’t settle for feeling uncomfortable. 

On the other hand, they might no exactly how powerful money can be, and use it to guilt you. While wealthy is their norm, they might fully understand that it’s not the norm for the woman they’re dating. They might act as if they’re sacrificing their blood sweat and tears to invest in you, when actually they’re fairly comfortable. 

3) Spending entire youth doing nothing but work - some men got great jobs straight out of graduation, and end up working in emotionally oppressive but rewarding environments in the city. Although they could be earning seven figures a year by their mid thirties, it doesn’t mean they have their shit together emotionally. The first ten years of their careers were likely gruelling. Insane hours, no time for sustained intimacy, and emotionally void. This makes for bad relationship habits because they just don’t have the emotional skills to empathise. Sometimes guys like this kept themselves motivated by thinking “one day I’ll be a wealthy senior figure who can buy the dream life including female attention, or a young hot 22 year old”. DON’T BE FOOLED. Some of those guys don’t have souls. 

I’m not saying anyone who had this career path is emotionally stunted - I think it’s just important to check that guys like this have done the work or therapy they need to process the “lost time” they might have experienced. 

3)Narcissism! It’s higher in men than women and in the most basic sense it’s a toxic defence mechanism. Although we can all agree narcissists are “unwell”, they’re not really suffering any ailment besides self pity. Low empathy + self consciousness + a big ego + obsession with status + no passions or interests = wealth. What else would they spend their time on? 

Narcissist operate by love bombing which often comes in the form of gifts and material things. Some narcissists genuinely believe they’re in love, but they’re so emotionally damaged that they only see the world in superficial gestures. Other narcissists know exactly what they’re doing and intentionally give “generously” because they don’t want you to leave them. These guys are just bad apples - they might have many people in rotation if they can afford it, but they might act like it’s just you. 

Narcissists are the ones who show off about their money. While the others I mentioned might downplay their wealth to make it look like their sacrificing it for you, the narcs tactic is more of a “look at my success, you’d be a fool to walk away from all the perks”. They usually make big promises relating to money and a shared life together. Or they’ll pretend to be invested in your goals, by literally pledging to make a money investment. Beware! These guys are actually very stingy. Lavish spending can turn into neglect real quick. Do not mess with narcissists if you want to keep your sanity, good health, and glowing skin.


Overall the lesson when it comes to money is, don’t accept overspending. It usually comes at a price. Don’t be financially vulnerable with ANY man, and always have a backup plan money wise. And finally don’t fall into the trap of thinking that the more a guy spends on you the higher value you are.",46175,Wealthy men aren’t always high value men.,0,,

In my ultimate pick me days as a young teen and early 20's I shamelessly boasted about being a hopeless romantic, I would fantasize about a man sweeping me off my feet, showering me with affection, adoration and deep interest/love and being worthy of such things, chosen for them.

I never had a particular scenario but it always went something like a guy set his sights on me and expressed his undying love for me and made sure I knew how special I was. In return for choosing me, I always imagined I'd shower him with the same affection (LOTS MORE LETS BE REAL) , be understanding, obedient and basically a doormat. 

Now that I'm a recovering pickmeisha my eyes are much more open now to the ideology of hopeless romantic. I'm more suspicious of overt and showy gestures of adoration after not much time has passed. A part of me still enjoys the idea of ""rose petals on the bed and a candle lit room decorated for me by him"" but a part of it feels contrived in from my pickmeisha day's. 

Of course, loving and romantic gestures are wonderful once you've been seeing each other for a little while but now Im on the fence about some of its authenticity in the beginning of courting. I even consider it something force fed to women growing up. ""Oh he's so romantic!"" ""Put the romance back in your relationship"".

I'm kinda over it.

do you just want to date for 5 years and then break up?

i've seen it on dating subs and relationship advice subs. people say ""i'm looking for a long term relationship"" instead of ""i want to settle down/ or get married."" 

and it's usually men saying this. it's like deep down they know they aren't really committed, but would just like girlfriend privileges for a few years until they find the person they actually want to get with. 

most people say ""casual dating/hookups"" when they know they don't want something serious, but ""LTR"" just seems to be a milder version of that.

But she talks about something called the “cocktail party moment”.  What the cocktail party moment refers to is your fantasy of how you would describe to other people how you met your significant other when the two of you are together at a cocktail party.

Most of us dream that the story would go like this...”We were both at a wine tasting and our eyes met across the room and he immediately came over to me and made sure I knew how stunning he thought I was.  Then he asked for my number, called me the next day to set up a date 3 days in advance.  He took me to a glorious restaurant and of course paid and was a total gentleman who swept me off my feet...and you know the rest is just history!” (You can design your fantasy cocktail party moment how ever you would like, but in mine I’m in a gorgeous black minidress and Dior pumps, but everyone can dream up their own perfect cocktail party moment)

But does your actual “cocktail party moment” sound like this.  “Well, I saw him at work and we flirted with each other for two months with out it going anywhere, until we finally went and got drunk one day and ended up hooking up.  Then I didn’t hear from him for 2 weeks, and after 3 ignored texts later he finally agreed to a Netflix and chill night where he jackhammered me into the couch for 2 minutes and left me orgasm free.  And 6 months later here were are...exactly where we were 6 months ago.  It’s so romantic!”  

Sadly...most of us (myself included) have experienced the latter far more than the first scenario.  And most of the time that second scenario never even ends up with you two together at a cocktail party.  So next time you are about to put up with some first rate BS from an LVM...think about how would this sound during my cocktail party moment?

When it was time for “the big move” of the recital, I just shook my head and stood still on stage. It wasn’t out of stage fright, but because I wanted nothing to do with ballet. Shortly after, I traded Swan Lake for sports and never looked back. 

This is an example of how kids naturally engage in activities that interest them, (before external forces start to sway their personal preferences). Now think back to a time when YOU did something as a child solely because you wanted to, and NOT because you felt pressure from family, friends or a romantic interest. This is your true self, and where your natural passions still lie (even as an adult). 

Men hold this philosophy into adulthood, and continue doing activities that gave them pleasure as kids. They don’t care if others (especially women) think that their hobby is stupid, juvenile, or a waste of time/money. They will continue doing what they love until it’s physically impossible. *Once you realize this simple fact about men, it will put SO many other things in perspective.*

Women in comparison, (especially at an impressionable age) are more likely to modify behavior based on the influence or negative reactions of others (especially men). In elementary school, I loved basketball until one of my boy classmates told me how nice my titties looked while I ran. I still continued to play other sports, but made sure I was minimizing bounce as much as possible. (Now imagine if you “complimented” a boy about how his junk swung around while he played basketball. He’d probably gain enough confidence to go pro!) 

So how can you become a “cool” girl by learning from men? You only do the activities/hobbies you GENUINELY want to do. A “cool” girl remains true to her passions, no matter what they are. A “cool” girl is confident in her femininity, while also enjoying activities that are loved by men. A “cool” girl doesn’t care if you think her tastes are too feminine or masculine. She loves what she loves, and makes no apologies for it. 

In comparison, a “cool girl” PRETENDS that she’s ok with (or enjoys) certain activities that she’s not comfortable with ONLY to please others. What’s even more sad is that soon the guy realizes you’re not really “cool” about it, but doesn’t care because you still ACT like you’re “cool with it”. 

We all know how the “cool girl” story ends. A girl thinks “pick me” behavior will help land her dream guy, but grows resentful during the relationship because she wasn’t honest from the start. Meanwhile, dream guy is “shocked” when you want to break up, and “had no idea you were so unhappy”. 

Main lesson: Learn how to communicate, establish boundaries early and speak up when something isn’t right. Be the “cool” girl who refuses to be treated as a “cool girl”. Knowing the difference is key.",46087,How to be a “cool” girl (without becoming a “cool girl”),0,,

Whether it is irl or online I have never messaged a guy first , offered my number first , and or shot my shot with a guy although I do flirt and engage in banter when need me. What I’ve been wondering lately is if me occasionally sending the first text a wrong move.

He seemed better than the average person who I've connected with. We had several things in common, specifically about our line of work. He was smart, funny, had a good job. He was relateable and attractive in his photos.

So far I liked him better than anyone else.

  
He told me how he had been married (she was a doctor) and he had cheated on his spouse due to a dead bedroom. This raised a yellow flag for me and I took a step back and had to decide if I was comfortable dating a man who cheated in his marriage. He expressed remorse but then he also said that his ex-wife was a 'woman scorned' -- this statement made me feel like he hasn't taken responsibility for his actions and was the number one thing concerning me and preventing me from feeling like I wanted to move forward.

The next day he texted me and I didn't respond.

The following day he texted me again. Somehow his first and last name came up on my phone in the text message. Something that hadn't appeared before. I took the opportunity to google him. He has an uncommon name. 

His name came up in a news article featuring his ex-wife concerning serious domestic violence charges against him. She said she was fearful for her life and is going to have to get a pistol permit to protect herself because the police gave away the address to her domestic violence housing.

Be careful and under no circumstances (!!), no matter how 'nice' or smart or relatable or sincere or genuine or funny he seems-- under no circumstance should you ever get involved with a man who has this sort of history.

I'm so glad I found this out -- I definitely would have met him and who knows what downward spiral this may have turned into.

I remember there was a study that shown that women are more likely to swipe right on men with a Master's degree rather than men with Bachelor's degree and more likely to swipe right on a Bachelor's degree than a High school degree and that men swipe right on all (women with master's and women with bachelor's and high-school) regardless.

It does not mean we are more picky since statistically speaking (and it is obvious to everyone), most men and women don't look for the same thing in OLD. Men are more likely to want a hookup or something short-term and women are more likely to want a relationship when making a profile online. It doesn't mean there are no women that look for hookups and no men that look for a relationship, they exist but the numbers def speak for themselves and so does our personal experience as women.

Many women have different preferences for men and different standards when looking for a relationship but if we only looked for hookups on dating sites (like men do) then we would only look at the person's looks and make sure they can sexually satisfy us regardless of what degree they have.

When men look for a relationship they have more ""preferences"" looks-wise (and education too), sometimes it's weight preference or her height must be below 5'9 so he can feel 'manly' yet cries when women reject him for being 5'7 (and honestly, why men say 5'6-5'7 is average for men?! average where, in Bangladesh?! 5'9 is average for most western countries) and looks, must be an hourglass body shape/must have big ass or big boobs. And of course, must have a job so she can 'contribute' to the house's financial yet only she would take care of the kids and change their diapers since he would find it 'disgusting'. Very equal of them, am i right?!

And the pickmeisha couples who pay halves all the time, will you share your pregnancy too? he will carry the first 4.5 months and you will carry the rest? you will carry and he will give birth or what?

From reading comments (and talking to my girlfriends), most women want similar things - to be taken care of, to be shown and introduced to friends, family and on social media, to be taken seriously, commitment and taken out on nice respectful dates. Height and looks differ preferences differ from one woman to another and how weird that the second we dare to speak about our height preferences or looks preferences or the fact we want to be taken out on nice dates we get called shallow, making it unfair for ugly men (because we refuse to date them) and get called gold-diggers. Men want us to make an exception for their 3/10 selves yet hate when we make 'exceptions' for everyone and call us sluts. They want to be special, beat the nature and get to f\*ck since we all know that in the nature, not all males get to f\*ck and only those who bring the most shiny object (crows) or those who have the prettiest feathers or dances or strongest get to breed, not those who sit in the side and cry about females not giving them a chance. If you can't give us a nice dance or show us your colorful feathers then the least you could do is pay for our 30$ meal.

Ugly men want us to give them a chance, so many men cry about women f\*cking chads while their crush is a 8-9/10 so obviously she would f\*ck her looks-match and not his 2/10 ass. Men rate themselves higher than they truly are, so many men think they are 5-6/10 when truly they're 4.5 at best so they feel entilted to high 6-7s and don't give the time of the day to women who are their true looks-match. So many below average men refuse to date average and above-average women, it's insane. We all like good looking people but what makes men think that they're entitled to date and f\*ck 9s? they don't want your broke ass, move on.",46019,"""Women are more picky than men"" is a LIE",0,,

Men love sex, yes, but that is not everything to some of them.

Some of them will use you for self esteem boosts, late night lonely chats, dopamine hits on texts or social media, oxytocin from cuddle sessions, looking good if you’re around them, general companionship, or a million other things.

Back in the day, I remember hearing one man who I was in love with tell me how great I am and how much he enjoyed spending time with me while he actually was pining for another woman. 

Well, of course he enjoyed spending time with me. I was giving massages, cooking for him, having sleepovers, showers, fun sex, lots of laughs— who the hell wouldnt enjoy that? We talked all day everyday for 9 months. He used me as a crutch during a particularly difficult time in his life

General interest does not equal love or respect
Curiosity does not equal love or respect 
Compliments do not equal love or respect 
Spending time with you does not equal love or respect 
Buying gifts does not equal love or respect 
Messaging you or calling you does not equal love or respect 

How will you know if you’re being loved and respected? 

YOU WILL KNOW by how it feels. You will know by the foundation of their actions towards you as a human, not just in times where they are receiving benefits from you being there. 

And this takes time to see. Don’t let all your guards down until you know a mans character. 

Any man in his right mind will accept the benefits of a woman’s existence and what she offers him. 

That doesn’t mean he cares about YOU as your amazing self specifically.",46014,"Men use you for lots of things, not just sex",0,,

Nope. Instead it's mostly a bunch of men who loathe and resent their girlfriends/wives and day dream about cheating instead of truly fixing themselves

I KNOW THERE ARE WOMEN THERE TOO but from what I see just from scrolling is that there's a big difference between men and women there.

When women find themselves in db scenarios it's more like their partner has physical limitations (low testosterone, ED) and the women talk about how much work they put in to fixing it. They mention being attentive, get into great shape, keep themselves looking good, alleviate stress from their partners lives etc 

Meanwhile the men are like ""I've tried everything"" and lament about doing chores around the house. Meanwhile, none of them mention taking care of or appreciating their partners, prioritizing their emotions, putting in emotional labor, getting into great shape or being attractive for them, the men there just all seem so emotionally stunted.

It sounds weird but I am very proud of it so far in a way.

I cringe every day as to why I did what I did, but looking back on it now it led me to where I am today, no longer a pickme. So now I just really need advice.

I just want to find a good guy and be proper friends and go through all the proper steps of dating, you know? Experience my first kiss, be asked out in a romantic way, hug him when I feel down, have a genuine friendship. I don't want to swipe on Tinder excessively to sort through LVM, which is what my friends do. I guess my question is, should I just put off dating until my late 20's? Reject guys until I'm truly ready? But how will I know what is the right time? I don't want to waste my first-everything's on someone I'm not going to marry.

This is the update:

 So I met up with him on Monday and right off the bat he asked me why I wasn't talking to him as much I hesitated but he was very insistent and told me he wants me to share my feelings with him.So I told him everything-how I can't get the beach incident out of my head,how we are so different since he loves going to nightclubs and bars and that once we're married I would never be okay with him going to one alone,how I think he's hanging out with women one on one again,etc.

I couldn't muster up the courage to ask to see his texts I asked him why he went to the beach with that coworker twice,and he responded with ""I didn't know you would be affected by it so much.I did let you know before going both times"".Then I told him I'm upset because he kept having lunches with her at work,and he said it's just because she's a coworker.And he said he's not hanging out with any women one on one now,only in groups.He told me he only has lunch every now and then with his manager at work.He said if in the future his friends ever ask him to join them at a club,he'll either take me along or tell them he'd rather stay home with me.Then we were talking about my trip to vegas and he was trying to be playful-he asked me what I did,if I went to strip clubs etc.

I told him about everything I did there,and that I didn't go to a strip club because I'm not into those things Now here's the twist:I asked him if he's ever been to one and he said yes he went to one back in new york(3 years ago,before he met me)-he said he went with friends and they didn't do anything,just watched. Now I don't know why I feel so upset and broken over him having visited a strip club when it was even before he met me.He had this week off from work and we spent alot of time together.He took me out to new places,we watched movies and spent lots of time together What do I do?Do you have advice for me?Am I crazy in being upset over the strip club thing?Honestly speaking,I'm not insecure about him having visited a strip club He thinks I am attractive,and more importantly,I am confident about my appearance It's just that I'm from a conservative asian family.I'm not too religious but I have strong family values and would like to marry a loyal man with a good character Does him having visited strip clubs say something about his character? I mean why would a guy go to a strip club.To ogle at naked women,right? Do you think he'll stop going now that we're together? He goes out of town very often with his friends,so I don't really have any way of knowing.

He was sweet and affectionate at first for a couple/few weeks, but then started to be cold, ignore me, and also shared with me that he watched a ton of porn and obsessed about his ex, who cheated on him etc. etc. We never went on dates. The couple times we had something scheduled he cancelled. Even for my birthday I asked him to see a movie I wanted to see and we never did. He was stressed, overwhelmed with his life, dealing with getting sober, getting over his breakup (which I thought he was over when we started dating because they'd been broken up for months and he seemed over it at first). I always went to his place. I often accompanied him on errands for himself. He's dealt with addiction for many years. Sober for the most part now. But the selfishness characteristic of addicts was true of him.

Eventually I felt super disrespected and eventually broke it off. 

He treated me bad but I also know he's not a bad guy. We were friends before we dated, for a while. Not super close but close enough for me to know he's a good human. Or at least not a demon, you know? (I have known truly bad humans in the past.) Like not out to purposefully make me feel disrespected and lower my self-worth, though that's what he did.

ANYWAY. He reached out to clear the air post-breakup and so today we met and talked. We had a good conversation. I said everything I wanted to say, including about how he made me feel. He admitted he was self-absorbed, etc. It was a good conversation. We were always good at conversations and working through stuff when it came to that.

I'm still attracted to him. We hugged today and it felt really nice. He wants to keep seeing each other, as friends or lovers but move more slowly. Slower would be good for me too. We rushed into a serious relationship before and I think that was part of our downfall. 

But also AH! I feel like maybe I need to just say no. Like the same bad treatment will keep happening. Even today, we haven't talked in a month. We met up and got coffee (which he bought for me) but we also went and did this errand for him at the hardware store. I was like...seriously?

He texted me tonight asking me to go to an art show his friend is in. Part of me wanted to go because it would be fun! I wish when we were together he had wanted to do stuff like that...But I'm working on an application due at the end of the month for a fellowship, for my career. So I said no. Also been reading this sub and stuff about being too available was VERY true for me in this relationship.

He's not a bad person. But also being in a committed thing with him was BAD. He was disrespectful to me, even if unintentionally, and the chaos and drama of his life just took over everything. We also have a connection though, and he was really sweet at times (and amazing in bed when we did have sex, though by the end that was rare). He says the time apart has been good and he's healthier now and less overwhelmed and more over his ex.

Should I keep him in my life in some capacity? Can I date this person more slowly? Or do I just sound like a delusional pickme? I know I have been that way in my life and am new to respecting myself and trying to think about dating a HVM. I know my ex will keep contacting me and I wonder if it's safe to go back into exploring something with him more slowly, or if I can just date him casually? (Seems unlikely after we've already connected in a deeper way) Or if it's just a lost cause.  In which case do I just say like...I actually don't want to talk to you again ever thanks bye? Do I have to cut him out completely? Should I?

Either guys just want to fuck with no strings, or they want to ""hang out"" or ""Netflix &amp; chill"" until you wake up from a weed-infused Cheeto dust fever dream coma, with both of you having sat on the couch ""hanging out"" until you're in a de facto relationship with some lazy LV loser, both of you getting fatter and dumber by the day. 

We gotta stop letting this happen. But, I kept finding that even older, HVM were pulling the ""so wanna hang out?"" card and if I were to block/delete every dude who said this, I would have no matches (*like most men*, haha). I started to realize, maybe men are conditioned to think that asking for ""dates"" is too formal? Or opens them up to the possibility of rejection, and their egos can't handle it? Regardless of the reason, I'm not playing this ""hang out"" game. Half the time it's just lazy, and half the time they are hoping that if you are willing to ""settle"" for ""hanging out"", you're willing to ""settle"" for just ""hanging out in his bed"".

So I started trying out different approaches to this question, with varying results. Sometimes I hit it a little too hard and got defensive and that definitely didn't work. Sometimes I would try and make a joke but usually they'd just be like ""hahaha, so wanna hang out?"" and completely miss the point. But I found the **best approach**, with the most consistently positive results, would go something like this:

**Him:** Haha so, you wanna hang out some time?

**Me:** Sorry, I don't do ""hangouts"". I have friends for that. You can ask me on a date, though!""

95% of the time, he will say something to the effect of ""I love dates!"" or ""I would love that!"" or a couple of times I had guys say ""hey, I respect that"" and it's followed up with a request for dinner. I was genuinely shocked at the positive responses. I think many men **want** to respect us, but we as women have just gotten so used to accepting and tolerating the bare minimum that they haven't been expected to try very much, if at all. Why put forth effort if you've never had to?

So, re-write it in your own words but make it clear: 

* You're not on dating apps to ""hang out""
* You have actual friends for that
* You're open for dates, if he chooses to ask you.

And that's pretty much it. If he doesn't ask you, he was never going to *actually* date you, so you've lost out on nothing but wasted time. If he snaps to attention and actually comes correct with a date invite, there you go!

I'll leave you with this quote from Steve Harvey's ***Act Like A Lady, Think Like A Man***: 

 *“I'm sure that if woman laid out the rules- requirements- early on, and let her intended know that he could either rise up to those requirements, or just move on. A directive like that signals to a man that you are not a plaything-someone to be used and discarded. It tells him that what you have- your benefits- are special, and that you need time to get to know him and his ways to decide if he DESERVES them.*  
*The man who is willing to put in the time and meet the requirements is the one you want to stick around, because that guy is making a conscious decision that he, too, has no interest in playing games and will do what it takes to not only stay on the job, but also get promoted and be the proud beneficiary of your benefits. And you, in the meantime, win the ultimate prize of maintaining your dignity and self-esteem, and earning the respect of the man who recognized that you were worth the wait.”*",46506,"Strategy: How to handle ""wanna hang out?""",0,,

M: Right you mentioned you wanted to be serious and you wanted ‘fun’. 

M: So what I am saying is keep it not vague. So define what is “anything could happen”? If you know what my explicit boundaries are?

H: Anything could happen meaning I am not opposed to sex on the first date if it feels right, but wouldn’t want it to be a one night thing. 
I would want to keep exploring and get to know one another.

M: Ya I don’t want to have sex right away, I want to be friends, then date, and be exclusive with a fella first ( my profile said this too). And you want sex, which is fine, I understand. 

H: I don’t either, but if it happens then it is what it is, but ideally I am going along the lines of what you are saying so yeah. 

H: :)

H: Cant put too much thought to it 

M: I am clarifying your mixed messages and helping you communicate them clearly since you’re not understanding my boundaries.

M: I can actually you don’t have to tell me.

H: Well you have to admit, messaging isn’t the best for communication. But ya sorry if you got a mixed message vibe.

H: I am more old-fashioned, not a fan of texting at all.

M: It’s a start though. I am old-fashioned. You’re just wanting sex.

H: I never said that.

M: Right out of the gates you wanted ‘fun’ kinky and non kinky. I wish you well though. I am not the woman for you. 

H: just because I said fun doesn’t mean it has to be sex related. Eventually yeah, but that’s all in time.

H: Yeah good luck to you maybe you should try match.com. Lol.

M: Maybe you should be a high value man.

I plan to work on my looks (looksmaxxing, r/Vindicta) when finals are over but I already try to look nice. I always make sure my hair is not greasy, skin care, etc. and today I actually took time to properly put on my scarf, winter coat so the collar sits well on my neck and shoulders. I also pulled my hair out from under the scarf and laid it nicely on top of everything.

I know it doesn't sound much but I felt good that I took that few moments to put effort into my looks and I felt good. I held myself straight up, I could feel that my gaze was piercing and my steps were certain and long as my high heeled boots clicked along. 

and it showed. I know that looksmaxxing is not and shouldn't be about men. but I noticed that a few men noticed me. I know how that sounds, but as someone, who is still trying to embrace her feminity, who is still working on her looks this felt really nice.

it felt especially nice bc winter is my weakness when it comes dressing nicely. I can dress nicely and look more attractive during summer bc of summer dresses. but during winter I'm mostly seen in my winter coat (which is actually elegant) and ugly sweater (I will buy new ones when I have time). 

so yeah. that felt good and wanted to share this with you ladies :)",46484,today I held myself differently and I could feel I looked good and it showed,0,,

It started as a way to keep track of what I talked about, what I wore etc because I was going on three or more dates each week. It’s evolved into quick notes on where/when the date was, my impressions before and after a date, major topics discussed, likes and dislikes, annoyances etc. these are just brief notes after a date, a few sentences/5 minutes. 

I’ve noticed that inconsistency and minor negative experiences pop right out when I’m keeping track of my dating experience in a clinical way. It makes those tiny annoyances that indicate disrespect more obvious and makes it easier to drop someone sooner who is acting hot and cold or otherwise being low value. Then I delete and block their number. 

If I feel any attachment at all, I edit the note to only include all of the reasons I ended it and I’ll keep it until I feel done with them. Others I just delete everything. 

( Side note- I have three outfits set aside, one that I always wear on a first date, one for all second dates etc. most guys don’t last past the third date so this streamlines those early dates. All I have to do is get dressed and show up)

Anyways, one guy rose to the top and I’ve been seeing him for three months now. I know we have been on 16 dates and two day trips so far and all of them have been spectacular. I remember every restaurant and activity we have gone to so I know for certain he is bringing his a game. I can’t gaslight myself into feeling like he is offering more than he actually is. 

He has brought me flowers 11 times, the same number of times he has picked me up for a date. Before that I met him at the restaurant bc I didn’t know him well yet. He bought me a nice vase the second time he brought flowers bc he noticed I put them in a pitcher the last time. I have notes in the small thoughtful gifts he has gotten me and also a few notes on the two times he has been forgetful/slightly inconsiderate. 

He kissed me for the first time in our third date and I made a note that he read my body language well and gave me lots of time to pull back, the kiss felt like we met in the middle and was very mutual. I know memories can get fuzzy and I give people the benefit of the doubt so I’m glad I wrote this down when it happened. 


These are just brief notes but reading over them shows overwhelming positive interactions and no uncertainty, angst, confusion etc. it shows clear clinical evidence of a thoughtful generous man. I can feel the chemistry and I’m excited to see him but it’s nice to also have data backing up those feelings. My goal is to stay unemotional about the decisions I make while still enjoying myself and being present in the relationship. 

He asked to be my boyfriend after Christmas and I went home and read over my notes before agreeing. It helps take the emotion out of it, so I wasn’t just giddily agreeing and instead was looking at the information and making an informed decision. This makes him aware that I’m thoughtful about this and he said he felt special because I put a lot of thought in to choosing him. So, I started this to make a good choice for myself but it also has made this very lovely man feel very good about how well he has been treating me- we have fun plans for the next two weekends so it looks like he plans on continuing. Time will tell, I plan to keep up with the notes. It will be obvious if he starts slacking but I don’t expect it tbh.",46451,Keeping a date diary,0,,

I've been dating a guy for about a month now. So far he's been acting like a HVM, and told me in the beginning he doesn't know how long he will be in my area because he's a traveling Occupational Therapist. I decided to try it out anyways, as I need a little break after a LTR that ended early last year. I'd like a LTR again, but I know I cannot be approaching every dating opportunity with this kind of mindset. I have had Pickmeisha tendencies in the past, but it usually depends on the person/situation. After reading the handbook and browsing this sub, I quickly realized the error of my ways. So far this guy has been quite a gentleman, paying for most meals, (I offered to split a couple of times, but he generally preferred to pay anyways) took me out to a great place for my birthday, bought me small thoughtful gifts, walking on out the outside, locking arms, all very considerate gestures. 

My issue is, because I am a highly active person, I am seeking an activity partner as well as a lover. I've initiated almost every date we have been on.  In the beginning, he always said yes, but this past week he has been turning me down/less available, and I think it is because I may have taken too much initiative here. 

I have taken a step back, have not asked him out or initiated any text conversations. He initiated a few conversations this week, paying me complements on how his coach has noticed an improvement with his performance and he said he has given me that credit as I have helped him with his fitness greatly, and other complements as well so I know he's still interested in me. He has things going on, like trying to move out of his current house because its not a healthy environment for him (and happens to be moving closer to me). I'm a fitness professional, and have a tendency to make suggestions to people on how they can improve their health/lives without them necessarily asking for the input. In a sense I may come off as being pushy or giving advice for free that my other clients have to pay for. This tendency I've been working on for a while to curb. But initiating the dates is a blindspot that I only realized was an actual issue after visiting this sub,.

What steps can I take to level up and stay away from my old tendencies of initiating/asking guys out on dates? Is it possible that if I change this behavior he might take the lead?

After a couple of days he asked me out, but was travelling over the holidays so we’d arrange it when we got back. Absolutely fine.

He got back last weekend, still texting, him initiating every text, and suggested tonight. Great. Text sparser but we were back to work, so fine, his last message was two days ago where he a) vaguely said ‘we still on for Saturday?’ (I said yes, told him to tell me where and when, he said yes) and b) after we carried on chatting for a while after that, didn’t reply to me.

So I’m here. Got back from my day’s activities and I’ve been waiting for confirmation all afternoon. It’s nearly 6pm here. I toyed with texting him, even to say that I hadn’t heard from him and had made other plans. But you know what, nah.

I’ve made plans to go out for dinner and drinks with my girls. Empowering playlist on. When he contacts me, if he contacts me, I’ll just let him know that his radio silence suggested he wasn’t interested.

In 2015, I dated a narcissist. 

We weren’t together very long and I kept ending things with him because he was so shady and intrusive and actually scaring me.

After we stopped seeing each other, one night I was drunk and lonely, and he came over. I wasn’t wearing clothes but I was under the covers. We didn’t do anything because I didn’t want to. 

When I fell asleep, I remember waking up briefly like something weird was going on and like he was taking pictures of me. But I was too tired and intoxicated to really think about it and also, I never thought someone would actually do that.

We worked at the same place and a few days later, someone called me and told me that he had nude pics of me and showed them to everyone at work. LIKE TEN PEOPLE. 

I called him and told him I was calling the police so he better delete the pics. He called me crazy and said there were no pics. He continued to text me a slew of abusive text message for days.

( isn’t it something how we are so ingrained  to think that way...)  

Anyway I told him appreciate him putting this together but I do not want to go rock climbing. His response without hesitation “ no problem “ dinner it is! So easy , understanding no pressuring to make sure. I was taken back by that.. there is no way I’m considering him yet to be HV ( if you look at my post history you will see made that mistake too quick last time ) 

The point I’m making is that it’s okay to speak up and tell them if we don’t want to do something.. their response to it - especially so early on can tell you something to look out for ( red flag or possible HV)

What is a good expected time frame for a guy to text you? How long do you wait before you decide to drop him? I need a 2x4 and am determined not to let infatuation rule my decisions on OLD. 

What if you went out on a date and he said he had a nice time? Does it change? For instance, you say goodnight in text after the date, then he waits til the afternoon (the day after the date) to text... is that bad? Then you respond and he leaves you on read? But we don't have lengthy text convos, and he went straight to business setting up the date. Is it acceptable for me to message first 2 days after a date? or is that taking away the chase? I want to do this right.

Thanks!",46328,Timeframe of Texts?,0,,

How did this become a common cultural phenomenon? 


&amp;nbsp;

I can’t pinpoint an exact moment I knew this was a thing but I knew it was a thing far before I started having sex.

&amp;nbsp;

I can remember women talking about faking Orgasms in some movies I watched when I was probably too young. And I also remember reading some dating books I can’t recall now which basically said not to hurt a man’s ego during sex if you didn’t orgasm and try and talk to him about it later or “lead” him through positive reinforcement You know, Some more LibFem sex pozzy “you can change men with rational conversation” bullshit. 

&amp;nbsp;


WHY? WHY should we do any of that, EVER??
Who conditioned us to pretend to like shit?

&amp;nbsp;

WHY. WHY. WHY. The more I think about this the madder I get about it. 


&amp;nbsp;

WHY WERE WE NOT TAUGHT TO JUST WALK THE FUCK OUT? Ladies, Has anyone ever given you that advice before now? Just stop the sexual encounter and fucking leave or kick him out? I don’t understand in this allegedly “sexually liberated” culture women are still being taught somehow that our pleasure and sexual discomfort is somehow secondary to a man’s feelings about it. 

&amp;nbsp;

It’s literally an expected part of the sexual experience for us and I want answers as to who the fuck decided this and when. Faking orgasms should have never been a thing in the first place, what the fuck for?  Can you recall how this social norm was dictated to you?",46326,Where Did Women Learn That Having to Fake Orgasms Was Normal??,0,,

He comes from traditional family, we have different cultures but he was the only one who ever made me feel loved in my life. I think I just ruined his dreams because I broke up with him. He might not go overseas anymore and just turn into priest.

When he knew his family did not aprove, he gave me ultimatum:
Either a life with me without kids, or a life without me  with other spouse and children. That was too much for me to try to accept. I wanted love, commitment and children but maybe I am asking too much in this life.

I loved him too, and I stayed because I didn't want him to be by himself. But now I am still leaving him by himself, maybe it's not up to me what to think or say he deserves.

I don't think I'm fit to date or have a family because my family has a history of cheating and having mistresses.

I overstep boundaries, understep process.

Even if I know how to the game with men, I try my best to be noble in relationships.

But, simply put I don't think I would be in a committed relationship because of how sarcastic I think about life and everything.

I think I am done, I don't know if I ruin men or whatever.

I just like to fuck but I really wanna fuck with somebody within marriage because compromise won't happen with me unless I have a ring on my finger.

I don't know. Am I crazy or stupid?

What are those privileges? 

- frequent sex
- emotional labor
- maintaining a home - cleaning, cooking

These are the main ones. There could be benefits tax wise. 

But I don't think any man, a boyfriend or husband deserves these privileges. 

- frequent sex must benefit both of us - both of us must have at least 1 orgasm and both of us must feel loved.

- emotional labor - both of us must get support and other forms of emotional labor and that emotional labor must NOT be too much of a burden on the other.

- maintaining a home - housework also must be sorted out equally between the 2 of us. But this can change depending on who spends more time at home or if there's a child in the picture.

Anyways hey everyone! I’ve been lurking your page for a while and right now seems like the perfect time to say something. So, for the past 3 and a half months, I’ve been hanging out with a guy (for the sake of this post, his name is Andrew). We get along really well, have similar interests, and great chemistry. A month into hanging out, we started to act more like boyfriend and girlfriend, and it’s continued to be like that till this day (keep in mind, we never asked each other to be in a official relationship). A few days ago, Andrew texted me that he isn’t ready to be in a serious relationship and that he wanted to be honest and upfront about his reasons because he didn’t want to lead me on. personally I am not ready to be in a serious relationship either due to personal reasons (which Andrew understands). We agreed to continue how we normally act around each other (including acting like bf/gf, having sleepovers, going out to different places, having sex) because we are happy/content with our behavior around each other. Also, we agreed we didn’t have to worry about putting a label on us and that we can continue to hang out as usual. 
While I am happy still hanging out with him, I’ve been having this gut feeling for the past few weeks. It’s the feeling where I know nothing is wrong, but something isn’t right. I just don’t know what that something is. 
I would like to see y’all’s opinion on how I should approach this gut feeling, and if we should continue with the decision of acting like a gf/bf (without labeling ourselves) thanks! 😊",46752,Need Advice on Complicated Relationship,0,,

I only found FDS less than two weeks ago, but it has impacted me greatly and I'm a huge fan of you all awesome ladies. Just wanted to share a couple of things how I have noticed that have changed since I have been trying to align my mindset according to FDS principles. 

\-I have noticed that I have been putting more effort into pampering myself and giving good things to myself more. Also cutting myself more slack. I guess I have started to feel a bit more empowered and having more of self-worth.

\-I have started to change my style a little bit. I have always been a tomboyish kind of girl, and now I've started to add more femininity in the way I dress. I instantly feel more confident. 

\-It's incredible, but the mantra that keeps on being repeated in this forum in different forms really works! By mantra I mean the message ""You are already worthy and do not have to prove this."" It really surprises me but it has helped to decrease my social anxiety, and by that I don't mean just romantic circumstances, but the usual social anxiety around people. I just feel more relaxed. I now don't expect people to validate me as much as I did before, and it somehow makes all types of communication (also professional and with friends) easier and more pleasant.

\-I feel now more determined to kick old unhealthy habits and work on self-improvement. 

Now for the romantic part - there is a guy from my friends circles that I have been crushing over since summer. We are platonic friends with some sort of chemistry, but I have spent a lot of time trying to decode mixed signals from him. After finding FDS, although I still have romantic feelings, I have been successfully working on killing the unhealthy obsession part and am now able to accept what we \*actually\* are: platonic friends with some sort of chemistry. That has also helped me remember that there are lots of other men around and that they notice me too. 

A couple of days ago we accidentally met at a bar and spent several hours talking one to one. This wasn't a date since we are friends, yet I also noticed several things that I instinctively do differently now:

\-When the talk got more personal, I managed to shut myself up for several times when I wanted to go full oversharing mode which has usually been my go-to move in personal convos. Instead I found myself paying more attention to listening to him and focusing on any potential red-flags.

\-I noticed and acted upon some small chances to give him ""protector/provider"" opportunities. Like really small, for instance, asked him to pour me some water when normally I would have done it myself. 

\-Stopped myself from instinctively giving him compliments. I'm a natural compliment giver, they come effortlessly for me, but now I reminded myself that there should be some balance between giving and receiving (I still gave some and received some, but I avoided the 5:1 ratio that had been the previous cases for me with this guy).

\-Noticed I was evaluating him using the HVM checklist, for instance, gave him plus points when he touched upon his relationship past and didn't overshare or go into details without me asking something specific, and spoke highly of his ex.

\-Did not try to decode any potential ""hints"" from him. Reminded myself that I am cool enough to expect a move from him, not make a move myself.

\-The most impressive part - after this night I found myself thinking, ""hm, he did well tonight"". NOT, ""did I do well tonight???"" that would have been my pre-FDS thought. 

So thanks a lot for this sub! I generally feel so much better in life after finding this special kind of sisterhood!

(Ironically, when we said goodbye, he admitted that he had a great night and his farewell words were ""Never change!"" I will damn right keep changing boy, climbing up that HVW ladder!)",46741,Noticing myself implementing FDS principles,0,,

So there are two versions of this:



1) Moving in after getting engaged, with a wedding date being set: 

Isn't this incredibly irresponsible? You are engaged to be married to a man, who has only shown you the best side of himself and you have absolutely no idea how it is to live with him and share a household with him. 



Wouldn't having a wedding date picked out, all your friends/family expecting a wedding and possibly having deposit given to the venue/photographer/etc. discourage women of breaking up, if they realise while living together, that the man is not that great after all? Wouldn't all those things pressure the woman to go through with the decision they made while not having all the information needed?




2) Moving in after getting engaged, without a date being set:

So you have said yes to a man that you are not yet sure if you want to marry. I definitely think this version is better than Version 1, but how is this different than being a live-in girlfriend? To me, it sounds like only the name of it is different, but everything else is the same, including the chances of you two eventually getting married.




What am I missing here? Shouldn't ""marrying a good man that fits you"" come before ""marrying a man, who wants to marry you""?",46741,Only moving in together after getting engaged? Are we sure about this?,0,,

I just don’t know what to do.

About a year and a half ago, I was “introduced”, ( someone I considered a friend, which I don’t think I should anymore, gave this guy my info and basically said I was open to have causal sex. I was told after, back then I thought this was fine and empowering) to someone that emotionally scared me and I feel like crying when I remember all that happened.
The first time we hooked up, I had to initiate having sex. When I asked if he had a condom, he told me what would that do for him. I was at a low point in my life, I agreed to not use protection. We would hook up a lot, without protection at anytime, I know. Then one day I came over depressed. He asked me what was wrong, I told him about my past sexual trauma. He pretended to care, and tell me about how I could share my feelings and emotions about it, I would soon learn this was a lie for him to keep having a sexual relationship with him. 
Throughout the months we were “together”, I would start to come over more and more. I’m still living with the person that abused me as a child. So I would come over to his and his roommates place as an escape from my parents. The more I stayed over, the more problems I started to notice.

He lived with 3 other people, all a little older than me, and they kept the place filthy. Beyond filth, they would have old plates that developed black mold. They would not wash dishes, or mop their floors. It had a rotting smell that I eventually got use to. I would sleep in his bed before I went home to wash up. He NEVER, no exaggeration, washed his sheets. He was also a major alcoholic. He would drink hard liquor as soon as he woke up. He would always drive drunk, and would never let me drive his shitty hoopty when he was obviously to intoxicated to drive. I would let him because I would have no other way to get back to my car at his house. (To this day I wish I would have just walked all the way back to my car at the house, he would drive over the legal limit nearly everyday.)

The disdain for me didn’t start until I pointed out the things that I personally felt were wrong. I feel that eventually I opened my mouth to much, because after all these months of letting him have unprotected sex with me. Not saying anything when he would penetrate me when I vocally told him I was not ready or aroused enough. After dealing with all of the alcohol, staying up past 3 in the morning, and thinking that drinking liquor straight out of the bottle was completely normal, he told me that he was no longer attracted to me. He also told me that he was seeing a girl in a different state, that he was actually in love with and wanted a relationship with. 
He had told me he loved me and wanted to be serious before, but I guess he told her this when he wasn’t drunk, looking for sexual gratification. 
A little bit after this, I would still tag along, trying to gain any little bit of confidence and self worth I had left by proving to a boy that was older than me that barely bathed, that I was worth HIS time. Then the worst happened, I discovered that I developed Herpes. 
I had only been with this one person for the past five months, had been tested before this relationship, but when it came time for him to get tested, anything. I was treated like I was either lying that I got it from him, or made it all up in my head by everyone involved.
I had been used up, and dumped in the trash after my sexual value to him was no more. And then the worse of it all, he gives me a incurable disease that I discover as soon as he was done with me? It happened so long ago, but I feel broken, thinking about it, the way my “friend” and his friends treated me after, I cry instantly. 
I have a disease that I will have to explain to everyone else I would ever want to have anything with because I let this guy use me and I let everyone associated with him gaslight me. I really don’t know how to pick myself up from this. Everyday I want revenge from everyone that was involved. How do I just let it go, and move on to be healthy. Especially when I’ve been burned with Herpes? I’ve been “okay” for a while, but thinking about how it all went down lately has left me distraught. I feel as if I have no value to be in a relationship anymore.",46734,A traumatic “relationship” has made me lose any hope for future love.,0,,

They can be loyal and honest with their wives and spouses, but I feel that HVM especially if they’re handsome, only show off their sweetness, kindness and passionate love when they don’t have a lot of money or material assets!

They can value integrity but are more likely to consider sensitivity and romance as worthless, as if they were gods.
If they have a great bank account they will be less likely to be extremely romantic and affectionate, unlike their women counterpart.

I don’t advocate cheating but I am starting to understand why their trophy wives sometimes end up cheating on them with romantic loosers that write them poems, because it seems that they can’t have both which is passionate romance and financial stability.


On the other hand I see so many women who plus of being successful, educated and attractive also show and value kindness, sweetness and heartwarming actions, and passionate romantic love.

As a med student I see many of my male classmates talking and acting as if being doctors and decent looking was their only personality, and enough to be adored and worshiped. But female doctors on the other hand, are still friendly, and down to earth, which is why me and my girl friends are often mistaken as nurses.

I was 22, doing the post-grad program, penniless, and he was 23 - uni student because of international student visa issues.

He was a *smooth talker, was a playboy and was the life of the crowd*. The **Plain Jane virgin pickmeisha** me was so lonely as I was isolated between uni and apartment and was just coming into terms about my childhood trauma revealing itself when I started having problems adjusting in school. He didn't seem that keen on commitment but he said the right words to say, and knew how to comfort me when he sees me having issues. I wanted a companion and someone whom I can rely on because of my ptsd, which I knew in my gut would be scary because I wouldn't know if he was a nice or bad person. Everyone had positive remarks about him, so I thought he was nice. Maybe I was really depressed and desperate because I felt it in my GUT it was no but my FEAR prevailed and for that I said yes. He kept on love bombing me with words, instagram posts about us, introducing me to his sisters and talking about me to his parents and sending videos of him confessing his love for me with his circle of guys friends.

What I was so bothered was he was **WITHOUT REMORSE when he did things that disrespected me**. Talking about me in a sexual cue with his friends, drunk texting his viber group about missing me when he's drunk and always just calls me whenever he was partying or drunk or just going to uni or school.

I felt hurt and more isolated whenever we meet up because he would always do things that scared the shit out me. He would remove the condoms, asks me for another round, and asked me to take photos of us and videos which I profusely declined. **It was like he didn't hear me saying NO, and it bothered me a lot like my mind was clouded by his malevolence.**

Growing up, I didn't know how to fight for myself, because **I learned at home that right or wrong depended on the person in power in the house not on the morality itself.** I dumbed down with a brute way of verbally instigating mal-educated, misinformed way of looking at morality of the Church's views. I wasn't taught on how to learn about self-sufficiency as I only learned how to obey without question or reason not to and all the **verbal, emotional and psychological abuse made me feel powerless and insecure as I felt I was living in a war zone.** All I wanted as an OUT, an ESCAPE, a NEW LIFE on my own and without these people around me hurting me and what hurted me the most was I met him when I was in my lowest point and he used it against me by LYING to me and DRAWING me into a jungle with a lot of weeds to be sowed.

With this, I learned his motive and move. He wanted whole ACCESS on me without doing much. He seemed like he was hovering at me and he was trying to get my reaction by saying the right words manipulatively to get me to do what he wanted to do. **GUT FEELING IS A LIFESAVER**, and what I saw was him not feeling any remorse on the bad things that he did to me, and that made realize that **LVM WILL NOT MIND WASTING YOUR TIME AND SOUL IF IT BENEFIT OR AMUSES HIM. He will MIND only if I will find him in his tracks.**

LVM has this ability to capture and cage a woman physically, mentally and emotionally if the woman is naive and incapable of seeing trouble or danger especially when she grew up in an Authoritarian, overly-protective, domesticating, economically withholding household. Which revolves around fear and coercion and economical control.

LVM would say the right things, but will do nasty things behind your back. He would say sweet things while stabbing you in the gut, making you confused and mentally clouded because in your mind your way of thinking it would be like this:

""He/They would never hurt me because they love me and they're my family."" WRONG, some people will not even consider your familiar or emotional relationship to treat you right or wrong.

Having toxic people in your life will really make confuse of right or wrong and what is true.

You have this, idea of the role on which the people around you should do as you do yours. It is disappointing to see how people who are supposed to care for you will be the ones who hurt you.

So, it is not falling in love or wanting love is the problem, but wanting it or expecting it to people (family and lover) who were supposed to give to you instead they make a mockery of it on you.

Second post here, I told my love story here, asked questions and received usefull advises which I still work on.

Long story short, my relationship is going stronger and stronger, but this weekend, during an intimate moment of tender share of views and stories I confessed something I thought not really important, that the week after we met the first time, dispite we get along so well, I went to a diner invitation with a man that was already set, and I had been seeing some month ago, not really seriously . 

It was the last time I saw this man, and my choice was made.

But when I told that story, my actual lover showed great surprise and even some sadness.

He told me he didn't see me acting like that, especially when our first meeting seemed so promising, he added he can understand and it was minor but still, he felt kind of a disappointment.

I was really sorry, and couldn't understand why I told him. 

Things turned good though and he expressed he wouldn't have been affected if he wasn't feeling solid feelings  towards me and really after that long conversation some more bound was obviously here.

I may add that I live in an European country were there is less dating rules, maybe things are more natural so strategy apply less ?

So my conclusion one is keep those truths for yourself , and two is should I fear other consequences into my relationship, due to my confession, and how should I react then ?",46704,I made a big mistake,0,,

He also made a snarky comment once about how I “wasn’t there for him” because I had to board a flight a few minutes after he texted me that a famous cyclist he likes was hit by a car.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/eoobme/i_give_up_i_give_up_i_dont_know/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

The ex and I had a talk last night. He finally realize how our relationship has been holding ourselves back. Compared to me, he had a delusion of love and safety. I felt guilty all throughout the relationship because I knew I shouldn't have given him false hope, but I too chose to live in the delusion myself.

I was in his position when he first met me. I was in agony in the state of my life and I wanted someone to lean on. I had no job, no money, just all the parental obligation that was instilled on me to follow my parents ever since I was a child.

I was in rebellion mode, how I was angry that life seemed unfair. I chose to choose things my way because I was scared of losing my freedom. I was scared of being stuck with toxic people all my life. I was an angry atheist, cursing everything and eveyone. Because of all the anger and sadness, I wanted somebody, I wanted love. In that, I chose to have a LDR relationship with my ex before this current ex. Because I thought he was the ticket to freedom, to removal of myself from all the toxic people in my life. But life doesn't go that way. You can't get your cake and eat it too.

I learned that I should take responsibility over my life, and not escape with a man and develop a small world just because I'll live with guilt and overcompromise, just to be with another delusional person who wanted escape from his situation too.

You can't skip steps, but you need to do these alone. It will hurt, but atleast your conscience will not be guilty of sabotaging anyone and yourself.

I think he is another lesson for me, a lesson that my choices are seemingly right for me. He is another lesson I learn to confirm what I've always thought so far. You can't fully control your life, what you think you deserve is good but don't get yourself wrapped up in a ideological way of living if you know it isn't feasible or reasonable. You know things should have happened in that way inside your head, but reality is reality. There's a reason why what you wanted to happen with your head did not happen.

What is in your mind is predictable and easy to control. But reality is not predictable, you do one thing, another happens. It just means that you need to sit back and watch what delusion who have and why you should face it. The important thing is you are alive and breathing. 

He chose the very different way than I did, and I respect his wishes. Both of us had been reacting to our life situation emotionally, I cannot chose to be angry anymore. I think I should just be more honest with myself everyday and just pour my heart out. The  more I get angry, I more I will be alone.


I learned that I shouldn't hope and give false hope that I should look for a man in a Godly way. Just basing my choices in men with my own personal idealogy just got me in trouble, but also gave me lessons. I knew in my heart I wasn't compatible with him, but because I chose delusional hope and then guilt of incompatibility, I decided to stay but had been wanting to get out without leaving him in dead air. Maybe this was what my other ex felt about me.

I just pray that my ex would get more courageous for himself, brave enough to see that his family has been holding him back financially. But who am I to say that someone has been held back by family? I think its a common norm. He earns more than his father, and so he is the breadwinner of the family. His money goes to his mother's joint account, so he is tightly controlled. I learned how important having to hold your own account can, it will give you more freedom and choices. I wish him the best of life, I will post it here, because I know when I share somethint emotional to him, he will just start falling down again. I am not that sefish of a person.

It's nice to hear, but when they expand on that, do you ever notice what they really mean is ""I love what women provide for me"".

They say something like, ""they're pretty"" or ""they're soft and smell nice"" or ""I love her cooking"" or ""she takes great care of me"".
 
They don't love women. They love what women do for them.

Their compliments relate to how they are benefiting from the woman. You're enjoying the sight of her or the smell of her because it delights your senses and pleases *you*. You're getting satisfaction. Not all women smell good or are pleasing to the eye, do you include them in your ""love of women"" statement? I bet not. 

Or they say they love her cooking or how she takes care of the house. So, you love how they provide you with nourishment and a nice place to live in?

What about compliments that you don't benefit from? ""She's passionate about her hobby"" or ""she's an excellent gardener and voracious book reader"" or ""she lights up the room with her laugh and wicked sense of humor"".

Or how about a general statement. ""They're strong and smart and tenacious"". Not ""tHeY'rE hOt HuR dUr"".

When men say ""I love women"", ask them to expand on that and if they focus on things that they think are compliments, but it only benefits their five senses or lifestyle then you know they don't actually mean they love women.

In these past few months I’ve changed so much of my thinking and attitude and am so grateful for you ladies and this sub!

One thing I’ve seen discussed here is that we should be hiding our sexual pasts. Which I agree with. I’ve had it used against me before and been broken up with over it so I simply don’t bring it up or mention it anymore.

I was recently talking to my good male friend about some of these things. My friend is a pretty HVM, he’s good looking, emotionally mature, nice, funny, upper middle class background, fit, smart, educated, successful, travels, surfs, meditates, good family, etc

As we were talking though, he confessed to me that he also always lies about his past to women he dates.

Apprently he has cheated a ton in two of his past relationships and used to do a bunch of toxic fuckboy shit. He also said he hides the fact that he had a phase where he was a very heavy drug user.

I was seriously shocked because he’s genuinely such a great guy and everyone in our friends circle thinks so. I would never ever have expected that from him

To be honest, it has kind of shaken my perception and thrown me off mentally. If he can easily hide something that big and come off totally nice and normal, it makes me wary of other supposedly HVM being the same underneath.


Are there any signs to spotting a guy like this? It would awful to fall for a HVM just for him to secretly be something else and finding out after investing so much.",47152,How do I recognize HVM that are hiding their pasts?,0,,

Today is the day of the last of my difficult university exams (three more after this, but this is the hardest and after that I'll write my bachelor's thesis) is going to happen and I am calm, prepared and happily excited. 

So I deem this day fitting to tell you my pickmeisha story. If you are in the mood to read and have the patience for a Longtext ;) 

My pickmeisha story began long, long before I was even born. 
I don't know if it began somewhen in the early childhood of my father, who because of what happened to him, became a narcissist. 
Or in the childhood of my (German) grandmother, my father's mother, who lost all of her four brothers in WW2 and therefore had to grow up in a grieving, broken family after the end of a war which effects lasted several generations. 

See, my grandmother Gertrud, in order to cope with what happened to her, what she saw, what she felt and what a women's position was in that time generally and in her case specifically, became in the long run a very difficult person. Her lifelong dream was to go to university, like 3 of her 4 brother's did. Her family was blessed with a good mind inside their heads and if she had lived today, she would have totally made it academically. Instead, she had to run the farm of her father, along with her three sisters, after her brothers didn't return from the war. 

When she was old enough, she married my grandfather. A young orphan, the first-born son of a farmer himself, who had to care for his siblings, his parents in law and the farm of his father. Together, they had children: in January of their first year of marriage my aunt (she turned 60 yesterday) and in December of that same year my father. Six more siblings followed - one of them a stillbirth. 

Due to the person my grandmother became, she had not much love to give. Especially to my father Albert, who would himself inherit the farm from his own father. This lack of love in his early years made him become a person with strong narcissistic personality traits. Like a lot of narcissists, on the outside he became rather successful in running the farm over the years, so today (in contrast to my grandparents and my parents) he does not have to worry about money so much. 

But see, in order to make his life seem perfect from the outside, he had to do several things: 
The farm was prospering, that was all right. 
He already had married a compassionate, beautiful women from a well known family with as long a family tree as his own. But he needed something more: 
A strong, smart son, that would take over the farm that his father and his father's father and the father before that (this continues down for six more generations of father's and son's ). 

And this is where my story begins. 
I am the firstborn child of my parents. Strong, smart, as we will later discover. But not a boy. 
By the first act in this world, by being born, I had dared to defy the wishes of my father and had possessed the audacity to be born a girl. 
Luckily for me, I was a good natured child. And! Two more boys followed (both smart and strong, the bigger one physically strong, the smaller one emotionally strong). The first one got the honour and curse to be the successor of my father. A fact, that was irrefutable etched into his existence by naming him Albert as well. 

What followed was a mostly happy childhood (for me, I cannot speak for my brothers), due to the fact that my mother loved me very much.
My father shone through absence, physically and emotionally, because he was away most of the daytime and if he was home, his nature didn't allow him an healthy emotional state or true and honest emotional bonds with other people. Of course he took my younger brother Albert with him as soon and as often as he could, to prepare him for his future as farmer.  
I was sometimes labeled as 'quirky', 'peculiar' or 'weird' by my peers and regarded somewhat 'difficult' by my father. 

The thing with narcissists is: they create their own reality by simply repeating their version of what happend so many times, people start questioning their own recollection and start believing them. 
Therefore my childhood was also colored by many many arguments with my dad, where I was using logic and he was using this strategy and we both didn't get along very well (to put it mildly). 

Of course, over time, my mother realized that my father is not the emotional stable and healthy man he wants people to believe he is. A fact that drove her to seek love somewhere else - somewhere, where she wasn't constantly taken for granted, where she was loved and cherished and her opinions heard and respected. Somewhere where she wasn't allowed to 'cry more, then [she] didn't have to piss'.  
This place were the arms of a man called Volker. 
They have been together close to 20 years by now and are very happy. divorce from my dad only took place in the last quarter of last year and still she comes everyday to the farm to help with accounting and cooking, washing and to some extend even farming. My father tolerates this situation because he still needs her. 

But i digress. 

So. After I graduated high school and went to another city (after I flunked out of college after two semesters) I met my (now ex) boyfriend. 
On the surface he was everything my dad was not - albeit not financially stable (he was 25 and had no job for some time when I met him, due to his depression), he was emotionally available, very loving and caring. Also he was very smart, or at least led me to believe that. 
So I defied the male role model I had when growing up by staying with this boy for around five years and thought I was truly happy. We were talking about our future, about wanting to marry and having a family of our own. But he slowly isolated me first from my dad, then more and more from the rest of my family. Then from my old friends from high school. Then from my friends in our city. Then from everyone. 
I grew very quiet. Very 'acceptable' to normal standards. 
And, without me seeing it, he started showing the same signs my dad showed over time. Because at some point, the facade started to show cracks. Nobody can wear a mask all the time without giving away hints. 

In retrospective it is very clear that my ex had the same narcissistic tendencies as my father. Those personally traits were the exact reason why I wanted to be with him - those traits felt like love to me because the person who should have shown me true and unconditional love, my father, showed my these traits as true and unconditional love. 
So of course I felt that this exact behaviour, the gaslighting, the second guessing, the changing of past facts that defied my logic and never satisfied my mind, as true and honest love. While in truth they started wreaking havoc on my mental well being and state of mind. 

It took me two years to figure out, something wasn't right. It took me three more years to putting myself first and leaving that sorry guy. A lot of tears were involved on his side, I worried he'd hurt himself, I worried he'd have to go to a psychiatric hospital, that his depression would spiral out of control. (Spoilers: he's now very happy with the girl he met not 4 weeks after we separated.) 

In wonderful irony the person who helped me the most to leave this guy was my dad (who never liked my ex).
And my wonderful, lovely, beautiful little brother (the emotionally stable one), who helped me move out of the flat I shared with my ex one day after the separation, because my crazy ex had packed up all of stuff and wanted me gone (both our names were on the lease). 

This was nearly two years ago. 

Since I am on my own again, I progressed with my studies - something my dad and my ex doubted I could ever do. Very little can go wrong graduation wise for me at this point. 
I picked up new hobbies. I met new friends. I visited other countries. I grew as a person. 
I started working out and am now very strong physically, which gives me a lot of confidence. 
I cut my hair very short - something my ex always dictated I couldn't do - and live my best androgynous life. I started rock climbing. I learned how to play the ukulele and singing and am now rather proud of my singing voice. I finished one book this year already and my first oil painting (landscape - thanks Mr Bob Ross for the lovely Tutorial!). I am thinking of doing a master's degree next semester in Malta. 

Last year I visited several cities for conferences in my country and two separate European countries. And on my 29. Birthday I landed in Frankfurt airport after a week in Japan - for a conference - completely paid for by the company I worked for - as a student still. 
(Spoilers: I left that company in December because my vision of my future didn't align with their vision of my future. And I made that decision trusting my gut feeling, something I have never done before in this degree). 

I am so so very content with all aspects of my life at the moment. And right now I work on the aspects I regard as love because of my families past. The future looks so immensely bright for me. Even though I'll turn 30 this year ;) 

What I love the most about who I am now I realized only today. 
I love the most that I succeeded in surrounding myself with people who value me for my quirky, weird and peculiar, sometimes difficult and annoying mind. 
That I can trust myself enough to trust these friends to like me for who I turned out to be, after I finally cancelled out all that noise from the men in my past. 

I am who I am for my most wonderful mind. 

And you are, too. 

Your future looks just as bright, just as promising, just as trustful and honest and beautiful. 

I believe in myself. And therefore I can believe in all of you, too. 

Happy 'this is the first day of the rest of my life' day :) 

(And thanks for bearing with me through this honest to god longest of longtexts).",46988,My Pick-Me-isha Story,0,,

One thing I’ve seen discussed here is that we should be hiding our sexual pasts. Which I agree with. I’ve had it used against me before and been broken up with over it so I simply don’t bring it up or mention it anymore.

I was recently talking to my good male friend about some of these things. My friend is a pretty HVM, he’s good looking, emotionally mature, nice, funny, upper middle class background, fit, smart, educated, successful, travels, surfs, good family, etc

As we were talking though, he confessed to me that he also always lies about his past to women he dates.

Apprently he has cheated a ton in two of his past relationships and used to do a bunch of toxic fuckboy shit. He also said he hides the fact that he had a phase where he was a very heavy drug user.

I was seriously shocked because he’s genuinely such a great guy and everyone in our friends circle thinks so. I would never ever have expected that from him

To be honest, it has kind of shaken my perception and thrown me off mentally. If he can easily hide something that big and come off totally nice and normal, it makes me wary of other supposedly HVM secretly being the same underneath.

We thought we’d be hearing the usual motivational content, but instead it was a hardcore emotional boot camp. These people cut straight to the core to identify the personal weaknesses holding you back, and it got intense. 

To get to the root of various problems, a lot of childhood trauma came up. These stories varied from “mom didn’t hug me enough” to “my uncle molested me at age 8 and then I got raped by my cousins”. No matter what the participant said, the instructor provided the same response “WHO CARES”. Everyone in the group shared similar feelings of “WTF?!” as well as sympathy and rage watching this girl cry her eyes out. 

The fighter in me felt compelled to protect this poor girl, as well as several others in the group who got riled up. It was soon evident that the people who passionately defended the girl had encountered physical/sexual trauma themselves. The instructor knew this would happen, and then explained the rationality behind his harsh response. Basically, regardless of what heinous events have occurred in your life, it doesn’t matter. The only one who really cares is you. Others may temporarily feel sympathy towards your story, but they don’t feel the constant pain you do. It’s up to you (and only you) to heal. 

If “Who cares?” seems a little harsh, substitute it with “So what now?” when it comes to FDS advice. Basically, regardless of the issue (no matter the subject or severity), “What are you going to DO about it now?” 

For example: 

“My ex was a manipulative narcissist, and I still keep attracting assholes” (So what now?) 

“My parents were very controlling, and now my bf has gotten more possessive throughout our relationship” (So what now?)

“My father and/or mother always criticized me, and I ended up with a verbally abusive partner” (So what now?)

The women of FDS can offer you the same great advice (on the same old questions), but it doesn’t mean you’ll follow it. Not because you don’t agree, but because you don’t know HOW to change. Until you determine the root of your relationship problems, you’ll never be able to move past them. Reflect on how the relationships with your parents may have affected your romantic relationships. (Dig deep, and you’ll see the connections)

If you still have a toxic person around, you have two options. You either completely remove them out of your life OR you try to forgive and move on. This does NOT mean you excuse and/or validate bad behavior. It means you acknowledge it happened, but move past it. Forgiveness is more for the sake of your own well being, rather than removing the burden from the person who caused it. Set... yourself.. free...

Note: In case you’re reading this thinking “Pfff easy for you to say”, this is coming from someone who’s gone through some serious shit. And guess what? Who cares! 😉",46851,"“We can’t always control what happens to us, but we CAN control how we respond”.....",0,,

But I noticed something which is that as a young teenager no matter how much I used to hear that I was pretty,  was spotted by a model agency more than 3 times ( but my mom refused) and I turned in some commercials, and yet I always considered my self to be barely average.

It didn’t help that many peoples praised me for being simple, especially as a kid. But when I grew up ( around 15) I noticed that the only guys I was attracting where the low value guys and the loosers. They would call me cute but the moment when I show them that I am shy and insecure , they would start to treat me like rubbish, and one of them cheated on me with a 50 years old overweight woman, just because I refused to have sex, after 5 days of dating! 

I never understood why I was always treated like the bottom of the barell no matter how much I would hear how nice , smart, sweet, and pretty I was. 

I felt that I can be as perfect as possible a guy would pick a hairy bald 120 years old woman with herpes instead of me. ( did any of you felt that before?)

However it drastically changed when I started to be confident and to stop giving a fuck about what others think. I wasn’t afraid to hit on the best looking guy of my circles  even tho I got shock when he told me that he’s confused and that he always wanted to ask me out, but I gave him the impression that I wanted to be alone.

I noticed that my poor self-esteem actually made me look like a cold person.

I was surprised when I see so many girls getting treated like queens by gorgeous looking men, while I was treated like trash by questionable creature looking loosers but now I think confidence played a really big part in that.

We always hear that men overrate themselves and I think it’s the main reason why most of them can easily get a better looking partner, while women were always conditioned to be humble, which is why they even struggle to be with their looksmatch. 

You can look like a Victoria’s Secret model but if you have poor self esteem, you will send a message which sound like «I can’t believe that you wanna be with someone like me! You must really desperate and stupid to want me!» 
However we can’t help but feel a little bit proud when an arrogant picky person want to hang out with us. 

I swear that since I became confident I am surprised that I started to get asked out by men I would consider my self to be lucky if they just looked at the same direction as me",48148,Let’s talk about confidence,0,,

I saw a young dude that looked just like a regular that comes into my work. So I asked him if he comes in to my job and I tell him that he looks like a regular. It was pretty loud in there, so it took a lot of yelling and closeness to even have a conversation. 

He asks, “Is that guy as good looking as me?” I answer, “Haha sure!” Because I could clearly see he was kidding. I got my answer that it wasn’t that regular, but hey we had a good chuckle. 

But I guess my positive answer was flirtatious(???). I wasn’t going to call him ugly and make things awkward. He says, “I’m taken. I have a girlfriend.” I respond, “I do, too haha.” 

It is awkward and it makes me cringe that he thought I was hitting on him. But now I’m cringing for him for misreading me. Did I do anything wrong just asking him if I served him before? Did any of my body language indicate that I would like to sleep with him? I just wanted to headbang and shove people. 

I’ve had issues in the past of guys getting the wrong idea if I’m nice to them or if I even say hi to them.

I have been creating a mental list of practical tips that work really well for me, and I want to share.  I just saw a post requesting this information, and I started writing one of my long comments so I thought, no, this needs to be talked about in its own right! This is not a cheat code, you have to really have the standards if you want to signal them.  Please add yours too.  

Obligatory caveat/ reminder: You already know you have to be in the company of an HVM in the first place. No amount of standard-signalling is going to change who's sitting across the table from you. Do not try to train an LVM. Some of these tips work as small tests to establish a man's disposition.  Essentially, for me it's mainly about spotting opprtunities for him to demonstrate his true nature, and hanging back to see what he does.  The point of showing your standards is to demonstrate your worth, not to teach him how to be your man. It also forms an important part of getting to know each other, personal preferences, habits, little cute quirks, etc

 Secondary caveat/ reminder: Know your standards and your personal style. For me, some of the standards I look for in a man are manners, chivalry, thoughtfulness, financial security, generosity both material and emotional, gentlemanliness, intelligence, initiative, and being observant.  My personal style is ladylike elegance.  There's no point expecting a man to treat me like a queen, if I'm not one.  Lead by example and be honest withyourself about your standards and style.  Live up to your own image of yourself before you try to find a man who you'll be compatible with.

Of all the practical tips I'm about to list, I would say there are two key aspects.  The first is pace.  Slow your pace down a little bit to create opportunities for him to demonstrate his true nature. Don’t rush to fill the gaps.  The second is the power of being indirect.  This avoids coming across as brash or spoiled.  If you are a high value woman, you have manners and tact!

ACTUAL PRACTICAL THINGS YOU CAN DO ON YOUR NEXT DATE - PICK/ CHOOSE/ ADAPT ACCORDING TO YOUR STANDARDS AND YOUR STYLE:

When approaching doors or chairs, have both your hands softly clasped on your handbag etc and slow your pace. Mind your posture, very important here.  This just gives him a couple of seconds to get in there and open the door/ pull out the chair, if he’s going to. If he doesn’t, your hesitation gently signals that you were expecting him to, and if he notices and cares he will do it next time. You can’t be stuffy about doors, sometimes it’s just awkward for him to open them. I generally find 50% or more success rate is quite acceptable. 

When you ask for your coat, instead of taking it from him, give a little smile of thanks, and turn around and put out your arms (behind you, not out to the sides - you're not a 4 year old).  He should help you find the armholes then ease the coat up a bit and then you take it from there.   
When you’re in the passenger seat of his car (obviously this is further down the line!!!), or you are in a taxi and you’re about to get out: wait until the car has stopped and then spend a few seconds straightening yourself out or fussing with your handbag. He might hop round and open your door in this time, and if he does, a brief but beautiful smile looking upward toward him will have him floating on a cloud, and he’ll make sure to do it always. One day - months down the line - tell him that it was something you first noticed in the early stages with him, and that you appreciated it.  An HVM will try to build on this and keep finding more nice things to do.  
In a restaurant, if something is wrong, for example you need another napkin or whatever, always tell him, before you tell the waiter. This gives him the chance to fix it for you by calling he waiter and requesting what you need.  If he does this discreetly and smoothly, this is a good sign and believe me, you can get used to this kind of respect. It’s bloody lovely and it permeates through your relationship. As you build on this, there is eventually a subtext that you think highly enough of him to allow him to do things for you, even though you are perfectly capable of doing it yourself.  


When the bill comes you don’t even notice it. When your glass is empty you don’t notice. If he’s going to take care of it, sometimes he needs time to notice, or for you both to finish a part of a conversation.  Try to avoid topping up your own water/ wine glass.  If it goes on too long and you're thirsty, try to wait until you are the one telling an interesting story, pause, and say, hold on, I need a drink.  Slow it all down and refill your glass.  Choose the water not the wine if both are available.  Take a drink in the spotlight and then resume your story.  HVM should notice that he could have prevented that interruption by being proactive sooner. Always thank him after he's paid the bill, not as part of an umbrella 'thanks for a good time end of date' thanks.  It's part of the fun.  Don't say 'thank you for paying'.  Either just say 'thank you' or 'thank you, the food was lovely'. Ie it's not about the money it's about the experience.  Make eye contact, it's a nice moment that acknowledges this is a potentially romantic situation, not just friends grabbing a bite. He should enjoy it too.

  
If you have jewellery that you received from someone you love, and you like it, wear it on a date. If he comments, just say ‘thank you, it was a present’ and move on. If you have nice jewellery that you bought yourself, say 'thank you, I bought this to celebrate X' (tell the truth).  Doing all of the above signals it's not costume jewellery, it's of value, and/ or sentiment. No harm in costume jewellery - as a reminder I'm just talking from my personal style.  You can alter it to suit you and your tastes.  It could be that you're wearing a treasured band t shirt in which case say 'thanks I got this at the gig at X'.  It could be your sense of humour in which case say 'thanks I think it's really important to see the funny side of life' Basically, use certain compliments to amplify certain messages.

In conversation, get used to pauses.  If you're smart, sparkly, and witty, it's easy to fall into the habit of filling the gaps.  But that's not what you're there for.  Wait and see what he does.  Don't make it awkward, obviously! But if it IS truly awkward, you can lean into that if you feel it's right.  Use your judgement and be ready to ask an interesting question or make an observation at the right time. Just watch that you're not carrying it.  The pause is a power move in many contexts, and being comfortable with them demonstrates many high value traits in you eg confidence, expectation, strength, calmness.

If you said you need to leave by a certain time/ can only have one course/ drink/ whatever limitation you set at the beginning of the date, you have to stick to it.  This shows you mean what you say and he can be as charming as he likes, he isn't changing your plans.  

Indirect examples and observations are incredibly valuable in demonstrating your standards.  For example 'I went to the ballet the other week.  I loved the experience, but I was a little disappointed to see so many people wearing jeans.  Personally I love an excuse to put on a nice dress, it's part of what makes it special.'  Or whatever matters to you.  It's just a template.  Don't do solely negative comparisons, also talk about behaviours that you noticed or that your friends/ family exhibit, that you value.  This one really is all down to you and your style.  Finally - only do this as part of conversation, don't go out of your way to say this stuff just for the effect.  

Don't be a snob, don't put other people down, but do call upon all your experiences in life to convery what you do and don't like.",48060,PRACTICAL TIPS MEGA ESSAY! Easy classy ways to signal your standards.,0,,

I’ve been reading the FDS handbook and it all makes a perfect sense. I’d love to start applying these to my life in general and dating life in particular. But I’m struggling with finding a way of getting over my recent breakup not only because I’m feeling very disappointed in how I handled things and how insecure I was (something I’m working on with my therapist), but the guy is also my coworker. And is best friends with my boss, so I will see him around. I know I might feel very strong when that happens and be able to fake the HVW attitude. But I might also get emotional and feel ashamed of myself because I gave in too quickly, made all the stupid mistakes and the guy probably sees me as pickmeisha  which sucks - because I know it wouldn’t be unfounded.
I did think we were having fun and that he treated me well, but my standards were low. He was paying for me on dates initially, then we would split and then he stopped paying for me all together (right before breakup). I do love and respect myself but damn do I need to level up....

I know I want to be treated like a queen in a relationship but I have no idea how to express that to a guy. I always end up in situations where I don't know how to react. I never know how to verbally express or show through actions that I expect certain treatment or refuse to tolerate certain things. Let me just give you some  examples:

First guy I went out with would always prioritize himself first. In all restaurants and places he'd walk in first and let me walk behind and open the door for myself. He'd always grab the most comfortable seat for himself, especially if there was a couch and I'd end up sitting on a hard chair. In a crowded bus he'd take the seat for himself and make me (in high heels!) stand for the rest of the ride. (I want a guy who always puts me first and would have offered me the seat!) He forgot my birthday and  got me a gift I had no interest in (a t-shirt from a gamer he was into..)

In these kind of  scenarios, how would you react? What would you say? How do I set my standards and express how I expect guys to treat me? Because I  definitely expect a whole lot more than that but I just don't know how to show it. I dumped the guy a long time ago, but I still think back wondering HOW I should have reacted, WHAT I should have said because all I did was remain quiet.

The second guy I went out with went from extremely interested to zero effort in a matter of 5 months. From texting me every day to not bothering to call for THREE months because of ''exams''. Yet whenever he needed a boost he'd text that he missed me. What I'm mostly angry about is that I let it go on for three whole months without firmly reacting. And I still don't  know how I should have reacted in the beginning - what would you have  done when a guy goes from that high to low effort? Like how do you show that you're not going to tolerate that?

Third guy would constantly make plans to call me and we'd decide on a day and time (LDR thing kind of, bad idea I know) - but  then he was always, ALWAYS 5-20 mins late for our phone calls and I just didn't know how to express that I'm not fine with that.

Basically, I don't know how to lay out my requirements and show that I expect a guy to invest and put in effort. I've read Becky vs. Dreamgirl and this is exactly what my problem area is. ''*you* control how you will be treated (Becky or Dreamgirl) by showing him what you will tolerate, and how much you expect. '' I don't know how to show a guy what I will tolerate and how much I expect. I'm unsure of how to apply all the things I've read in real life when interacting with guys and when dating.

Please help me out with advice and how you handle different situations!

Everything about him was on point - educated, well travelled, respectful, kind, generous, consistent, decisive. I do believe he was a HVM. 

Cue to our last date. He asked if I was free Sunday (last Sunday) I said yes and waited for him to solidify a time and location for us to meet. I waited until that Saturday and sent him a very stern text that I am not an option and that I have offers for other plans that day. In hindsight, I should have just booked something with my friends instead of waiting around for him, but he is going on a month long trip abroad starting today and I knew we didn’t have long to see one another. He apologized profusely and came up with 12 different options of things he thought I’d like to do. I accepted my favourite option and we went out Sunday. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, he asked if I was free Saturday and I said yes. He said great, then let me know that he was very busy this week and wouldn’t be able to let me know the final plan until Friday night. This isn’t impressive to me but I say it’s ok because he gave me a heads up. Friday comes and he chats a bit about what we could do but does not solidify a time and location. He texts me this morning to say he’d like for me to meet him at the Art Gallery today at 3:30.

I say no, you didn’t follow through on your promise to finalize plans with me on Friday night, so I made other plans instead. It’s inconsiderate of my time to wait until the day of to make a concrete plan. I told him to enjoy his time abroad. Was thinking maybe to give him another chance and leave him free to reach out when he returns because in every other way he’s been perfect. But he said he will not be reaching out again. I blocked him.

I genuinely do think he is HVM but I don’t think he was crazy enough about me to make me a priority. I’m pretty bummed right now, any encouragement?",48000,Just need some reassurance,0,,

UGH, I WISH I HAD LISTENED AND JUST BLOCKED HIM!!! But no, he was so 'nice', and 'attentive', and 'funny', and 'conversational', and I kept talking to him like the gullible fool that I am. I'm re reading all the comments on that thread and feel like going back into the past and vigorously shaking myself and yelling in my face to cut him off.

So I'd been having these niggling thoughts about the whole episode I talked about earlier and how I didn't think he was capable of really being a husband or a father because of his weak career at the moment. Some things came up in conversation so I sent him a text being very clear and direct about how I thought he is not ready and that I expect certain things from a marital partner, and yes I pretty much sent it with the intention that it would be a 'bye-bye' message, without explicitly stating so.

Despite how mean I can be, he had a history of always texting and being sweet and trying to make me laugh so against my better judgement and goals I was lowkey expecting him to reply, but he read it and never replied...and worse? He went back on to the OLD website, so...it's over for realsies. He pulled such a 180! I just wish I'd done it sooner.

Now I'm crying because I made this fantasy in my head and now I have to live in a future without that fantasy. I've gotten over much much worse so I know I will be fine in the near future but right now...right now I'm just bawling. 

I swear I'm never going to give anyone a second chance and make it IMMEDIATELY clear if my expectations are not met. Never give a man the chance to explain his actions because he's just going to lie anyway. Block a dude at the first red flag, it's never going to be worth your while. Men are not naive and they know exactly what they've written/answered/done, don't make any excuses for them AT ALL and don't EVER rationalise anything they do. 

For now...I'm just going to cry for a few days, but I am glad I did not waste any MORE time than just a little over a month and a half and proud that I was much smarter this time than any other time in the past. I am probably just trying to scratch an itch and find a distraction to one of my core issues in life: my location. So I've typed up my emails and will be hitting up immigration lawyers tomorrow to take control of the trajectory of my life and live where I know I'll truly be fulfilled instead of expecting a man to come swoop me away.",47980,"UPDATE on ""Date report.

I have no one to turn to for this matter.
My partner and I are together from 10 years now (8 of living together) we started when I was 13 years old and he 17. A week ago we returned from our holidays together and due to time issues (work and study) we could not properly intimate yet. (I am menstruating and I don't really want to do it. More the anguish of having returned from my vacation) We have very intense and satisfying sex. Normally it does not take more than two days without having done it but this is not the case for the first time a week ago that my partner has no sex and today he turned against me in a very derogatory way.
- He continuously complains that I reject him when I am sleeping and I do not remember any of this!!! (is that I am really sleeping) he begins to caress me and I reject him.
- Once we are awake we have few hours together (5 maximum) but I do not receive any progress from him (it is not that he wants to try hard to seduce me. He never did and I think there is the problem)
- The first thing he did today before going to work is to tell me that I can't even squeeze his penis for a moment. (My caresses are tender, I kiss him, I admire his beauty all the time) that I can't even make him a masturbation and that I don't need to have all the sex to give him that.
I feel a great sadness in telling him this but I believe that my love for him is greater than what he feels for me at this moment. I await your advice.thanks for reading.",47944,I am being gaslighted?,0,,

I'm talking about bringing companionship, fun and beauty to a successful mans life that isn't interested in finding a true partner at this time, and receiving a comfortable standard of living while I finish college. I'm not planning on sleeping with them, at least until I can call them a friend that I know and trust and actually want to, not because I feel I have to. I'm planning on applying to medical school after I graduate, so I do value financial independence and understand the importance of that. I have been unable to work due to my school schedule (duel degree while needing straight As to be competitive for med schools, and time to study for the Mcat). I have no family support at all. I live on a scholarship and financial aid but it's still hard. I would be able to get by if I had to drop him though. What do you think? I realize that men on sugar daddy sites are probably not the ones I want to be around and lots of them are actually looking for escorts, but convince the sugar babies that all sugar relationships are basically sex, essentially tricking the girls into being cheap escorts. Real escorts can cost a few thousand a session, so clearly if I was going to have sex for money (I am not), it would be that way lol. I want to date and get to know men and not disclose the sugar daddy thing unless I love him and we decide to be exclusive. Is the kind of dream sugar daddy I hear about even realistic to find? Is it dangerous? Please no judgement, but I want your real thoughts about this, thanks!",47937,What's your opinion on sugar daddies?,0,,

Last night he messaged me to say he missed having sex with me, that he thought about it all the time and how I was just perfect. He said I was so hot I could marry someone famous. And then he added.

“But putting up with the other side of you is A LOT.”

SORRY WHAT? “The other side of me” is the woman who complains and fights him when he treats me like shit. This man literally tried to hang himself with a belt from a cupboard for attention when I got mad at him once because he got too drunk on a night out and kept fucking up the Uber and wouldn’t let me help. And I’M too much????? 

This, ladies, is a textbook example of negging. And unfortunately for him I see right through it. It might have worked a few months ago before FDS, but this time I just saw it for what it was and I was shocked and disgusted and ANGRY. I said to him don’t ever talk to me again and he said “I’m sorry, I just miss you... the good you.” 
Wow, just wow. I replied saying “I’d miss the good you, but I think he was a figment of my imagination.” and I blocked him.

I was recently planning my first post-FDS first date. Texting was going well, we clicked on a lot of things, but he was dragging his feet about planning the date. I'd bring it up, he'd be non-committal etc. Should have dropped him there, but I'm still learning. Instead I basically told him he either needed to ask me out or continuing to talk was pointless.

Of course he apologized, said he usually moves too quickly and wanted to take it slow, let's do something low-key like coffee. Now I know it's not very FDS, but I actually really enjoy low-key dates like that. So I said ok. We agreed on a time and place for a few days later.

The date was supposed to be yesterday at 1. He texted me at 11:30am - He'd had a weird night, he's someone's emergency contact and he didn't get home till 6am, he just woke up, ""I'm not trying to blow you off, and I'm not a catfish lol"".

So I said ""I'm sorry you had a rough night, I hope everything is ok, but I'm confused - are you cancelling? Rescheduling? Just saying you're gonna be tired when you get there? You haven't said."" He asks to reschedule, I say I'm free later that same day, and he said ""well I'd thought about that but I might go up North to visit (I assume he meant the friend from the night before but idk), I'm not sure yet""

This is where FDS kind of kicked in for me. Old me would have backed down, pretended I wasn't hurt, told him it was ok, and ended up waiting weeks for another date. Instead I said ""Look obviously I don't know the whole situation, but from my perspective cancelling set plans because you 'might' do something else feels a lot like blowing me off"".

He never responded. My first instinct was to second guess myself, maybe I overreacted, maybe I was insensitive, I should text again and apologize - no. I reread the texts, and I'd done nothing wrong. I specifically said I don't know the whole situation, this is just my perspective. The door was wide open for clarification. He just didn't care enough.

I definitely cried a bit yesterday, because being ghosted is a sensitive spot for me. But at the end of the day I'm better off. I've never been especially high-maintenance or asked for much. I will not back down from the few things I do actually need. Reliability is something I need.

Sorry for the rant, I'm just so thankful to you ladies for giving me the confidence I needed to stand up for myself and my needs in dating situations.

TL;DR: LVM flaked on our first date, ghosted when I called him on it. Thanks to FDS I'm not even a little bit sorry about it",48344,I've really been trying (sorry it's a little long),0,,

I’m ready to hear your opinions and IF this relationship could be saved

This is 2 posts in one so you can only read the first one as the second one is an update.


Post 1:

I want to start off by saying that I don’t think he is, and if he is then he might be doing it unconsciously but my friends have been telling me I shouldn’t get fooled.

Last Wednesday, my boyfriend and I had a fight about me supposedly distancing myself from him (physically)

I want you to know that I’m very paranoid and my father doesn’t approve of him so 90% of the time we hang out, we shouldn’t be.

He complained that I wasn’t as clingy as I used to be. The reason is because he had told me he didn’t like me holding his hand and being clingy previously. 

We didn’t speak for 2 days and on Friday he texted me saying he didn’t know if we should what to do about us. I was destroyed.

He said he just didn’t see the point because obviously I didn’t love him as much as he loved me.

The whole 2 days I had actually been crying myself to sleep and I was constantly ranting to my friend, S, about the situation.

He told me he wanted to be with me but that if I really loved him I shouldn’t hang out with my friends and should hang out with him instead because we don’t see each other a lot and that I needed to show him my love by kissing him a lot more and letting him touch me more.

We agreed and we’re still together.

That same night he started talking about how he wanted to have sex soon. I had told him numerous times I’m uncomfortable with the idea of sex right now and that I don’t feel I am ready.

He said that it was painful for him not to and that I should do it for him. I stood my ground and said that I don’t feel psychologically ready also because of a past trauma involving sex and to just wait for a while.

He still continued talking about it and told me I should try masturbating (I’ve never actually done it before) to know how it feels like and that I’d be more comfortable with it.

I declined and after a while we said our goodnights.

My friend B told me that he wasn’t worth it, and that maybe he never actually meant to break up with me, but just scare me into submission.

The whole time he was very vague and never actually said “I’m breaking up with you” or something similar.

I don’t know what to think honestly.

Edit/update: my boyfriend and I have been chatting for about an hour and he just asked “can you take a hot pic for me babe?” 

And since I know that’s like a definite no-no I said no. He went “pleaseee” and I said “I don’t want to” which I don’t.

He asked me if I trusted him to which I responded yes but that I still didn’t feel comfortable.

He said “ok” and LEFT. I texted him some random shit to see if he was mad and he responded with “Mhm”

Ok then. Amazing.

If anyone wants the chats I’ll be glad to send them but they’re in Italian so yeah

Edit/update 2: ok wtf. He texted saying how much he hates himself for putting all the pressure on me and that he feels gross asking for this stuff and that he’s sorry. 

I am confusion ????


Post 2:

Written a day after the original post:



Tonight he pulled the same shit.

He asked me when I was going to be ready and I told him I didn’t know, and that it would just happened when he felt right.

He responded with “oh so I’m gonna have to wait until I’m 30?” I don’t know if he was joking since it was through text, but I treated it as such.

He then started saying that he didn’t wanna pressure me and that he’d stop if I asked but that we could at least try for 5 minutes.

I said I just wasn’t ready and he said “oh ok then”

Left me alone for a bit and then said “don’t make me wait too long tho, can I at least get a picture?”

I sent him a normal selfie where I was smiling and he said “be serious, don’t torture me like this” So i sento him another selfie, this time not smiling and he seemed satisfied.

I want you to know I’m extremely uncomfortable with taking selfies and he knows that.

Another thing that happened before that is that he said, I don’t know if jokingly or not, “it’s not like I look at your face anyway, I look elsewhere”

That made me feel a bit bad. It kind of conveyed the same message as “I don’t care about your personality I just like you because you’re pretty/hot/sexy”

I know the only possible advice is LEAVE but I find it so hard... especially when I hear him laugh over the phone, my heart just melts... I’m so conflicted.

What he’s doing is so obviously messed up and it makes me feel uncomfortable but I feel  like somehow it’s my fault?

By saying that someday we could have sex I just feel like I led him on...

When I was comforting him yesterday I also told him I loved him multiple times and that he’s the only thing I need.

Another thing he said today is “I’m giving you one last chance to prove to me you love me, don’t mess it up.” Referring to the reason we fought in the first place.

I felt and still feel so anxious...

I don’t know what to do even though the answer seems obvious:’)",48333,Is my boyfriend toxic?,0,,

We’ve been together for two years and this has NEVER happened. Basically to sum it up. He lives 35 miles away from me, he has no car, and usually i drive to see him. Since we’re both in school we only see each other on the weekends but since it’s break time we’ve been spending more time together. We had our anniversary in December and a few weeks later we spent a week together meeting his parents. After we got back i had a tonsillectomy, i needed someone to take care of me and he agreed to the first 24 hours lmao....then he left...i begged him not to because i was in so much pain and couldn’t talk, if something happened to me i wouldn’t be able to call for help. I basically live alone. He went home on Sunday. Come the following Thursday I’m in the worst pain I’ve been in. Haven’t eaten in days, haven’t pooped, threw up a bunch, and passed out in the shower. I asked him for help and he told me to “text 911”. I asked if he could come Friday because i was feeling very alone in this stressful situation, he agreed. I should also quickly mention that he uses a phone i gave him and some of my apps are still signed in. A day before Friday i got an email that someone had tried resetting my Uber password at 8am....mind you he never really leaves the house and walks/uses metro when he has to. I asked him if he did and then since i was pissy i said “betraying me while I’m sick and injured huh?” That is the last message he read to this day. Friday came....no word. I texted him and asked if he was still coming. No word. Then Saturday comes and I’m worried now that maybe something happened to him. I spent the day crying thinking the worst things. I sent him a message apologizing for the poor timing but i expressed that i felt alone and needed support. Still nothing. Then i said “please let me know that you’re at least okay, idk what I’d do if something bad happened to you”. Still nothing. I called him twice and his phone is off. It is now Monday....no word from him. He left his google signed into my computer and i can see his web history and movements....ALL this time he has been looking into building some bullshit guitar electronic. He is fine...at home...avoiding me while i am in pain. Is this an offense worthy of a break up. I’ve thought about letting him approach me since the ball is and has been in his court. Should i break up with him over this? This really crossed a huge line with me and it’s honestly very cruel. He was online on Facebook a few hours ago but of course didn’t open my messages. Sorry for the long read ladies. I’m feeling very lost, lonely, and hopeless. What do i do?",48306,How do i approach this?,0,,

This is rough description about them, their mannerisms, how they made/make me feel. 

* I met H at dance class. H crossed the room for me. H has a good job. He is confident in himself. He listens to me and makes me feel heard. He constantly tries to impress me. He has never said anything negative about me. He respects my physical and sexual boundaries. He did not complain, act passive aggressive, or change his behavior when I made him wait (roughly two and a half months) to have sex with me. When I told him he had to be tested before we had sex he, again, did not complain, etc. He agreed it promptly and _did it_ promptly without attitude. H holds my hand, opens doors for me, and is a gentleman. He is interested in my life. He is concerned with my concerns. H respects his mother and has female friends. H makes me feel respected and safe. I never feel violated, used, or sad after having sex with H. He holds me after sex until we fall asleep. H keeps his apartment clean and enjoys cooking dinner for me. H asks me what I'm comfortable and uncomfortable with. H has a wide social group and enjoys doing various activities with me. 
* I met S online. S had low self-confidence. S never listened to me and I often felt unheard. S crossed my sexual boundaries from the beginning. I overlooked various red flags to to naivety and being love-bombed. S cheated on me and had inappropriate conversations with other women. I asked S to get tested repeatedly after the cheating and he never did. Towards the last year of our relationship, S negged me. S would text me incessantly when I was not around him. S displayed sexually abusive and emotionally abusive behavior. S made me feel like an sex object and infantilized me. I felt used and gross after sex with S. After sex, S would roll over, play on his phone, then fall asleep. S was not concerned with the hardships in my life. S did not treat his mother well. S did not clean, cook, or help me with any domestic chores. S did not ever want to go out. He preferred watching YouTube videos about Star Wars and Marvel in his free time. Although S had an incredibly good career and made good money, he was lazy at his work. S made me feel anxious, sad, and suicidal.

There are clearly integral differences between H and S. Personally, I believe self-confidence plays a huge role in a man's ability to be HV. A confident man will be secure in himself. However an insecure man, like S, will act out in insecurity, whether that be cheating, negging, or other extreme behavior. 

Another difference between the two was how they made me feel sexually. As I mentioned above, S made me feel sexually objectified. He pushed and violated my physical boundaries. H, on the other hand, is respectful and sensitive to what I don't like. With S, I would have to tell him repeatedly not to do something, only for him to argue with me about it, pout, gas light me, and then do it anyways. With H, I barely have to adjust his hand and he picks up on it immediately.

Also, it's important to note that your own behavior has an effect on how men treat you. S was a piece of shit and would be apiece of shit regardless. However, with H, if I had approached him as a Pickmeisha or a Doormat™ instead of a Queen, he would not be as great to me. Right off the bat, I showed him that I expected to be respected. I'm not going to go on and on about how I did it, because there's a whole side bar for that, but just keep in mind that your behavior plays a role. 

Last but not least, don't ever fall into the trap of thinking any man is different. A HVM is still a man and AMALT. The moment you give in,  think ""he's different"", give your everything to him, you are fucked. Keep an emotional distance between you and your man. Despite how good he seems, he could swipe the rug from beneath you at any moment.",48304,High Value Man vs. Low Value Man: A Case Study,0,,

I’ve tried almost every single one of them: Tinder, Bumble, OKCupid, etc. However, Hinge is one that likes to distinguish itself as a relationship app or, an “app made to be deleted”. Or so I thought. 

I first tried Hinge in London (2018) and came across some really weird guys on there. But what bothered me was that most of them weren’t actually looking for relationships. They were looking to connect with women and “see where things go”, meaning they were all just looking for some pussy. I did ended up dating one guy who went from HVM to LVM within the span of a month. I immediately broke that off and deleted the app because I figured maybe this wasn’t the place for me to be trying it out and because the guys I was matching with were all using me as a fetish (as a black woman, it’s more typical in Europe than it is anywhere else. That’s just my experience 🤷🏿‍♀️) 

I came back to the US (end of 2019) and moved from NY to MD, and figured I should try it out again. I’m in a new city, so why not put myself out there and try to find someone. I downloaded, matched with people and starting having conversations. Again, I was seeing this pattern of many men being on the app that weren’t looking for serious relationship. Some hid it better than others, but still it really bothered me. Some would blatantly ask you if they wanted to fuck, all on an app that was “made to be deleted”. 

Why are you on an app that is specifically made for those who want to find something serious? Take your ass to Tinder if you’re looking for a fuck, bro. And then it occurred to me that these apps, no matter how hard they try to cater it towards one thing, will be contaminated by people who wanna do whatever they wanna do. The dating pool on Hinge is tainted with LVM who just want “vibe” and “chill” and fuck around. 

Hinge apparently is one of the “better” apps that people can use to find something serious. In my personal experience, it’s a load of bullshit. This is one of the main reasons why I’ve decided to quit the apps. I’m sure there are ladies out there that have experienced what I have experienced, and there are ladies that have been able to create meaningful relationships from the app. If you happen to also be experiencing what I’ve experienced, it may be time to take a step back from the apps and put that time and energy somewhere else. If you’ve made it work (like many people I know have), that’s awesome for you. Honestly. But anyways, I’ve decided to go back to the organic way of dating: meeting people in person!!! And I don’t plan on ever downloading a dating app again.

Oh man, I am embarrassed over the time I wasted telling LVM all the things they did wrong........just so they could apologize..........only to do it again.

Now I see ladies here who are being a free dating coach to some loser asking pervy questions within the first 15 minutes on dating apps, dudes who send dick pics, dudes who pressure you for sex on the first date (or ever) etc etc etc.

WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?

Ladies- the second you feel the impulse to tell a man all about himself, instead say this:

""Hm, okay. I am dealing with a LVM. I know this now. If I tell him all about himself, I am essentially telling him what to apologize for and hide from me until I am further invested. He's just shown me who he is. What more is there to argue? At this point, I am just arguing with myself. Let me go write this out in my journal to take out the frustration, but first: BLOCK""

Ladies, in sales there is a saying: ""If they're still talking, it's not a no"". 

I was taught this in sales as well. If I am trying to sell something to someone and they say no and walk out of the store, I'm done and it's over.

However if they start objecting to certain things, I can counter. If they're still talking and telling me why they can't buy it, they really actually want me to convince them.

Them: *Oh, it's too much to spend right now*

Me: *That's okay. You can finance it today for zero down!*

Them: *This color isn't my first choice, I really wanted xyz.*

Me: *Actually, it seems to me you have  warm undertone. This color will make your eyes pop. Here let me take some selfies for you and you can see.*

Etc, etc, etc!

I just can’t get over this one LVM narcissist. He treated me horribly in so many ways. He wanted to keep me a secret, yelled at me when I told people we knew in common that we were dating, wanted to keep things casual/not commit but left crumbs of hope that maybe we would get into a relationship. I made all the mistakes with him. He’s a true clown- he’s 48 to my 28 but wants to have kids?? (I don’t, which was part of his reasoning of why he didn’t want to commit to me). He always wanted to split the bill on dates. I wasn’t FDS enlightened so even though my instinct was to be upset about that, 50/50 is the norm in my social sphere. I let this BS situationship go on for 6 months.

Normally I would never be interested in such an old fart but he is extremely good looking. A little less so now but still looks like a model/actor. Every women who has seen a pic of him agrees. And he’s very successful in my field so that was very attractive to me as well. I’m a fan of his work and we could talk nonstop forever about our shared interests. The main thing is we had the best physical chemistry and he was a great lover. I’ve never enjoyed kissing so much and that’s what I miss the most. I was actually hesitant about him at first due to his age and self-absorption but as soon as we kissed I got that swooning/swept off my feet feeling which I’ve never gotten before with a guy. It was just so connected/intimate/perfect/sexy. And I always felt that extreme high when we kissed.

I’ve dated men since him (this was like a year ago) but it’s all been duds that didn’t go anywhere. I still think of him every day and feel so much love for him despite the horrible things he’s said to me. It’s like the rational part of me knows I deserve better and he’s a loser but my feelings/emotions can’t catch up. I don’t know how to let go of the romantic fantasy. I feel like I’ve tried everything to let him go but I can’t. Help!!!!!",48247,Can’t get over him,0,,

Reddit (and any semi-anonymous forum) has an interesting habit of polarizing very quickly. A lot of people assume we here at FDS are ""man-haters"" and ""man = bad, woman = good"". And many of us are working through intense, lifelong issues with ***men*** who have ***hurt us*** so it's not hard to see how someone could come to this conclusion.

But this assumption is faulty. If we hated men, why would we actively create and contribute to a community about finding and keeping a great relationship with a great man? That makes no earthly sense. We're not incels who just seek to criticize or TRP who just seek to use and discard as many men as possible. We actually want strong, healthy relationships.

Sometimes we get conflated with incel communities (which is silly because no woman would ever be an incel. There will always be a man willing to bang, that's just a fact). And incel and Red Pill communities, in fact, *do* hate women and seek to use and abuse us with their manipulative and dangerous emotional and physical tactics, so there is a legitimate confusion there. If people label us the ""female version"" of *those people* then, by the transitive property, we would be trying to manipulate and hurt men, and that's just not true. For some reason, expecting effort from a man, according to men, is the equivalent of abusing them. *Interesting*. 

But at the end of the day, we at FDS don't hate men. The issue isn't ***us against men.*** It's ***high value versus low value.*** 

There are many, many, many high value men. There are even more low value men. Why? Well, obviously, because being high value is harder and men have hundreds if not thousands of years of being told (i.e. socialized) that they don't really need to try as hard to maintain relative status in society. Eating junk food is *easier* than cooking healthy, so most will eat junk food. Working retail is *easier* than getting advanced degrees, so most people will have uninspired careers. Drinking and doing drugs to manage negative feelings and memories is *easier* than going to therapy, so most will just numb themselves. Being low value makes sense, especially when you don't have consequences for your lack of effort, and most men have been able to avoid the social consequences of poor behavior and still manage to find wives and have families despite, for all intents and purposes, not putting in the work because they have been the ones with access to education, employment, freedom and political spaces.

This is changing, of course. We as women are nearing equality in many ways and the balance of power is shifting. We are in a financial and emotional place to expect higher quality behavior, and we've had to **be** higher quality in order to demand equality within a system designed to prevent equal rights from happening. But that doesn't mean that we can expect high value men and be low value women. That's not realistic. We have to bring beauty, intelligence, kindness, hard work and a dedication to continued self improvement if we expect to find a man to bring those things, too. Nobody is sitting around saying we can be lazy, boring, manipulative, entitled *takers* and still expect a man of substance to invest his time and energy into us. 

The issue has never been ""men = bad"". The issue is ""low value = bad"", gender irrelevant. We should be expecting the men ***and*** women in our lives and in our inner circles to have quality character. I personally believe you are the sum of the 5 people you spend the most time with, and I want to be around people that build me up and expect better of me, regardless of gender. In the [FDS Discord](https://discord.gg/y27Mkv) we are constantly pushing each other to work hard, better our careers, prioritize our mental and physical wellness, and give back to our communities. We seek to *be* quality to *attract* quality.

I want to actively work on that and grow from this so it can never happen again. 

I have been seeing a guy in a LDR who I have known for around two years. We only became close in the last six months or so. And he invited me over to visit him as I had talked about wanting to go to the UK. Everything seemed great at first as it does but when I arrived in person he was quite different. Not looks wise that was fine but his personality was nowhere near as kind, warm and loving as he portrayed online. I realise now looking back that he love bombed me at the start. He made a lot of crazy declarations that I was foolishly flattered by. 
My trip over there was originally four weeks but he begged me to stay longer after he finally (finally) opened up to me and so I stayed an extra three. Things were going very well. I met his family and all his friends and minus some small things we got along well but it did bother me that he was much more volatile and reckless irl as opposed to the calm online persona he had.

He then had a freak out at me when we went out with a group of his friends. He went red and I tried to comfort him but he slapped my hand off of his and then proceeded to berate me in public. He then told me he wished he could just be alone with his friends. This scared me because I was alone in a country where I knew no one and was worried I’d have to stay somewhere else. 

He ignored me that entire night while I cried. Then apologised to me and I stupidly forgave him. 
Later on he told me he was in love with me and that he saw a future with us together. And as I left back for my home country he promised me he’d actively try and see me early 2020 so I assumed things were on a good note. As soon as I landed back though he went extremely cold, shut me out completely and then would send me half suicidal threats and other depressive thoughts then refuse to talk about it. This ended in me saying that we needed to go no contact as he refused to pick up the phone to end things with me.

We went no contact and he sent me a message about a week ago just to ‘check up’ on me which involved him telling me about his depression and how he’s addicted to social media. I have a big dumb heart and feel a lot for people so I was considering him like a project. I have also been naively assuming he will come back to me because I’ve been romanticising this situation when really if you remove the glasses it’s a silly girl being conned into becoming a guys on tap validation machine. Finally last night I had a break through. I don’t want to wait around for him to get better. Just because the love felt good in the moment doesn’t mean it still feels good now and it doesn’t. So I am planning on ending things for good with no doors open tonight. I just feel I need some support and accountability so I follow through because I’m scared I’ll be weak and fall for it again.

I just got to my layover and downloaded the app on my temp phone so I could tell him about the situation. I wasn't able to message him for 9 days and if he sent me a message it did not go through.

I noticed that in this time period he added a couple of things to his profile that were not there when we matched. 

I am not sure how to feel about this.. maybe he thought I had ghosted him and decided he was going to move on? But I just do not understand why he would think that.",48207,Wasn't able to contact him for 9 days.. noticed he updated his dating profile?,0,,

My message to them after a couple of days passed and I had a nagging feeling that something was off about them. The interview was a video call and very unprofessional and informal. The man referred to his gf as partner was being condescending and spoke over her a few times! Utilising FDS and my own personal growth , I made the decision to next them 1 or 2 days after the video interview.


Dear xxxxxx,

I regret to inform you that due to changing situations, I must renege my acceptance of the xxxxx position at xxxxx. I was really looking forward to working with you both and I wish xxxxx continued success and  growth in every facet. I thank you so much for the opportunity and consideration.

I finally have stopped fearing being alone and I am looking forward to just having total control over my life and pleasing no one but myself.

He mesaged me and asked for a date. The date was great . He told me he got out of a bad 2 yr relationship. They lived together and that didnt work out. He said he was ready to date again. He said they broke up in Sept. 
It was literally late October so I was hesitant and thought that was quick but he said they had been not getting along for months and he had mentally left that relationship before he even ended. 

After our 1st date. He texted me so much and asked for so many dates and did romantic shit 247. Often he would bring up  his ex and talk about her in a really negative way. That made me uncomfortable but i didn’t want to show it. 

I really wanted something serious and I even explained to him i wanted to wait awhile before we had sex. He agreed. 
I did everything gradual.  He wasn’t allowed in my house for awhile. I would ONLY  allow him to pick me up and drop me off for dates. He brought me to every party and introduced me to all his close friends gradually. Everything had been fine. Eventually i was comfortable with him and i started to allow him to come inside my house and hangout.  Early December we finally had the “talk” one night and made it official. We were in a relationship!

My work was throwing a Christmas party and I told him about it in a joking way. He asked me if he could come. I was quite surprised and thought that was kind of early. I told him I would think about it. I just wanted to be sure before introducing people to a significant other until I was sure about them. The night before the party he texted me and asked me if i wanted him to come with me. I still felt hesitant and a little anxiety creeped in but I agreed. He put on a great impression and my coworkers and even my boss loved him. 

Things progressed and I allowed him to sleep over (no sex just cuddling and movies). One night we came  back to my house after a party. I finally felt like I was comfortable enough and we had sex for the first time. The next day was fine and we got breakfast the next morning. But a few days after that his energy seemed different. We still talked but something felt off. 
On Christmas Eve i purchased a pretty vintage dresser on craigslist he stopped by to help me move it. I figured he would sleep  over to spend time with me because i was leaving to go out of town the next morning to see family.  but after he finished helping me move he was like “I have to go home, I want to watch football sorry”. It was a little weird for me because it just threw me off but i agreed and he left. 

While I was out of town he sent me a kind of dry Merry Christmas text around like 7pm but it felt weird and not very genuine. I  didn’t respond.  

When i came back There was a gap of us not really talking or texting. I felt sad and confused. I blocked him on all my socials ESPECIALLY instagram. I post alot on Instagram and i can see where he watches my stories and  I didn’t want that anymore. I wanted real communication not just a man lurking my social media. 

Eventually, he called me on New Years Eve asking me If he could come over. He came over we exchanged Christmas gifts (since we had not seen each other on Christmas).  He told  me he was upset that i blocked him from my social media. He made it such a huge deal and made me feel so bad about  it so I unblocked him. We stayed in and drank a little and cuddled and thats about it. Then after that he got distant again. 

The gap was too much for me so  1 night I  just called him and asked him to come over and hang out. He agreed and everything was fine. Just cuddling and watching movies. The next morning he told me he was just so sad and needed space and he couldn’t spend the day with me because he had to go watch football at home. I asked if he wanted to break up he said no then said idk your call. We had sex (because I asked to) and then he left. 

There has been days of silence. He randomly followed me on Instagram and then sent me a stupid cat meme. But hasn’t texted me anything of substance or called so I didn’t respond. 

So here I am sad and confused. I just want a healthy relationship. I wanted communication and love and honesty. What did I do wrong. Someone please be blunt with me and tell me what I am doing/did wrong.

Unfortunately, this behaviour was almost always accompanied by low effort. 

I have been dating a man who I’d describe as “medium maintenance” so far, and it’s a weird experience. He has opinions on where to eat and what to do. I’m used to always doing what I want, so it’s something to get used to, but it’s also nice not to have to carry the responsibility of organising a good evening and coming up with things to do yourself.

I don't care if he's on his death bed.

I don't care if he has a terminal illness and the only cure is your naked body, on his cracked Samsung Galaxy s7. 

I don't care if a picture of your tits would unlock the Ark of the Covenant.

Under no circumstances should you ever, ever send nude photos. 

Let's talk about the pros and cons of this fuckery.

**Cons:**

* **Nude photos take away your power.** Someone else has free reign to do what they want with your body and likeness. Maybe they're a ""good guy"" and will ""just"" keep them in a folder with his other nudes. But what if he doesn't? What if you piss him off one day and he's not feeling so *""nice""*? Revenge porn is a real, devastating problem. And the only way to prevent it from happening? **NOT FUCKING SENDING THEM.**
* **It is the ultimate PickMe behavior.** What did he realistically do to earn those photos? Flatter you? Ask for them, without even a first date? It's becoming toxically normal for guys to expect to see your goods up front, and guess what, you're not a 1999 Subaru Outback Impreza. He's not entitled to shots of the interior before he considers investing in you. Your body is not a commodity and your safety isn't something given up because someone shows interest. We leave that PickMe shit in the 2010s.
* **It's cheap as fuck.** Nothing says ""my value and worth are negotiable"" like defacing yourself for approval from a man who probably re-wears his boxers between washing. ""Man, giving Gary a shot of my snatch really advanced my professional career,"" said no woman ever.
* **No High Value Man would ask for them.** No High Value Man would respect you for them. No High Value Man would send them.

**Pros:**

* **You get a temporary thrill from doing something naughty.** That's it. That's the end of the benefits. Then he says ""mmm baby"", you never actually meet up with him, and you forget it happened until your second cousin is forwarding you your naked photos on Facebook Messenger asking when you became a cam girl. I'm not saying that *happened* to me but you know for damn sure it's happened to *someone* and that *someone* should **NOT** be you.

I used to be all about sending nudes. I thought it made me a Cool Girl. I thought it made me seem sexually free and fun. Guys liked it, and I liked guys liking me for it. I didn't need ""respect"", I had attention and when your self-esteem is in the basement, attention is a drug unto itself. I loved the positive reinforcement and feeling sexy... until my ex decided that he was angry enough at me for leaving him that he would send my nudes to my Facebook contacts unless I did what he wanted. You don't realize how much power you have given away until the most vulnerable part of you is threatened to be exposed to a thousand of your closest family, friends, business associates, and random middle school classmates by someone who never really cared about you to begin with.

I have a friend who was fired from her job because her photos were leaked and distributed without her knowledge or consent, but it reflected poorly on her company and the clients submitted complaints, so she was let go. It absolutely should not have happened, was deeply humiliating, and put her in a financially, emotionally and mentally damaging situation. I imagine we all know at least one person to whom this has happened, and the frequency is only increasing.

So why are we doing this? Why are we playing this game? Who benefits, besides men who get a cheap thrill for making a girl do free sex work for them? There are millions if not billions of pictures of naked women online, **he specifically wants yours because it's a way to control you**.

And before you LibFems bitch me out about ""nudes being empowering"", fuck right off. There's nothing empowering about debasing yourself for the Male Gaze. It's also **not** victim blaming to encourage my fellow sisters to not put themselves knowingly into stupid, potentially humiliating situations in the name of feminism. Sending nudes isn't feminist.

He was working as a cook and a pizza maker to support his mother and siblings, and I can see how hardworking he was, and he was always there for me whenever I felt down or sad, and he clearly respected me and treated me like a diamond queen. 

Plus he was extremely smart and knowledgeable, but the only thing I hated about him is how he lacked ambitions professionally. I tried to change his mind many times but his choice was to work as a cook to clear his mother’s debt and then to work as a police officer, getting married and having a family.. and that’s it.

Even tho he wasn’t against me enrolling to med school, I could feel how he would have been happier if I choosed to be a stay at home mom, and that the lack of time I’ll have will bother him.

I was already against ending up being the breadwinner but being with someone who lack goal orientations soo much turned me off.

When I broke up, we stayed in good terms and then he started to date a waitress and they got married a few months after. He’s treating her amazingly and they live alone in his small studio, and I can see how happy she is. I am very happy for them, and I wish them the best, especially that I am now dating a richer better looking man but I can’t help but ask my self what would’ve have happened if I didn’t broke up with my ex. I know I sound stupid and emotional but I actuality cried because he’s the one who loved the same books as me, who was sensitive and caring af but I couldn’t help but being turned off by his lack of money and ambition, and the modest life he was offering to me, but I found my self believing that maybe and I repeat maybe if times can go back I would’ve probably stayed with him. 

Am I being stupid? I mean... my current boyfriend Is actually amazing but the chemistry I had with my ex something else, even tho I wasn’t truly physically attracted to him, nor was I financially.

It's sad that it's everywhere -- in movies, in art, in 'normal' relationships, and then these beliefs are instilled into children from a young age.

When I think of 'birth control,' I instantly think of the pill, and condoms second. That's already social conditioning: the first thing that comes to mind is the burden being on a woman. As a lover of relationship subreddits, I've seen so much crap concerning this. 

So many low value men think 'the pill' is this magical thing that just removes any chance of pregnancy and that's that! Because they don't have to deal with any of the consequences of it, they barely have to think about how it affects women, and in general, it isn't their burden. It's convenient for them, and no matter how much it detrimentally affects women, it's convenient for them so therefore it's okay.

Heaven FORBID a woman doesn't take birth control or goes off of it, though. All of a sudden, low value men magically care, because \*gasp\* it then affects them! It's such a selfish viewpoint and shows how they only care about themselves and their pleasure. 

Fear of being 'trapped' by a pregnancy? Such a lie. It's socially acceptable for men to leave and just pay child support, and some don't even pay the full amount, or any money at all, because they know a single mother can't often afford to take them to court. That happens more often than men will EVER admit online. Low value men just don't want to wear a condom or have a vasectomy -- oh no! An easy, straightforward procedure with barely any recovery time. But it isn't \*convenient\* for them and the 0.1% chance they lose the slightest bit of pleasure in sex is just too much to bear -- ignoring the fact that many women suffer low libido, lack of pleasure, horrible hormonal imbalances, possible acne and weight gain and ovarian cysts and more from birth control.

Low value men will find every excuse in the book to not wear a condom, too. They'll lie, they'll whine, they'll say they're clean, and they'll ignore the risks women constantly endure when it comes to birth control. And what's funny is that a condom is the most convenient form of birth control, and somehow that's still not convenient enough for low value men.

Birth control is NEVER a woman's burden to carry alone. I'm sick of reading even on other women-based subreddits about women going ahead to get an IUD or a serious procedure like tubal ligation. On one hand, yes it's nice to have reproductive freedom. At what point should the burden be shared with men, though?

I foolishly bought into the lie that an IUD is a painless procedure, the best option because it's a short procedure and lasts five years, and that it's freedom for myself and feminist and blah blah. No. It is not. I could barely stand after the procedure, I was so light-headed. I could not drive home or focus. The cramps, the worst pain of my life just under the pain of appendicitis, lasted for days. A month later, I can still barely stand or walk longer than an hour before the pain gets too bad. I can't work my college job which is in 4-hour shifts, the job which I desperately need to pay for textbooks. Painkillers don't help. I don't even want to talk about trying to walk around to classes.

The worst part is, in a follow-up appointment doctors told me the pain is 'normal' and will go away in maybe around FOUR or FIVE MONTHS.

When was this suddenly considered okay????? I'm going to spend almost half a YEAR recovering, possibly almost half a year without income from a college job I desperately rely on, and can't run when I want to start training for a half marathon again.

A condom is not that hard to put on. A vasectomy is not a huge sacrifice to make. But if a Pickmeisha is the only one handling birth control, making sacrifices for some relationship to work by making a guy happy and ignorant -- that's not a relationship. Fuck that and fuck social expectations.",48489,"One month after IUD insertion, I'm still having horrible pain. Fuck the lack of male birth control purely for their convenience.

Using a throwaway account because I’m ashamed at how I’m still pinning over a guy whom (I think/thought) was HVM. Since discovering FDS almost 4 months ago now, I’ve changed a lot in terms of what I tolerate (thank god) when it comes to dating and find it easier getting over LVMs. I’ve pretty muched ditched my whole rotation of guys now bc I’ve got no time for that.

This happened before I discovered FDS and back when my emotions were all over the place - this guy and I texted for 3 weeks before meeting, and when we did it was magical. I felt something with him (and I don’t feel this way much, I’ve been on too many first dates) and he told me he did too. Now, it was only one date, but I felt like there was so much potential. 2 days later he tells me that he couldn’t date then because he was still dealing with healing from his prior breakup. He was honest and didn’t cock up some lame excuse which was unlike all the other guys I’d been out with. He told me before we met that whatever happenes he would be upfront and honest, and he was. Needless to say I was ‘broken’ for awhile. Infatuation? Probably.

I thought I was over him and I’m currently seeing someone else now (6 dates in and I still don’t know how I feel but that’s a whole other issue), but sometimes I still find myself thinking about him &amp; wishing that he’d give us another shot now that it’s been a few months down the line. In a moment of weakness I texted him the other day (yes, I know, I should’ve deleted his number. And in fairness I’ve deleted all the other LVMs but couldn’t bring myself to delete him)... idk where this post is going sorry for the word vomit lol.

Just want some encouragement please :(",48489,How to get over a HVM who did nothing wrong,0,,

Law of Abundance and all that jazz. 

So I update Tinder (which will show you in the ""feed"" of anyone you matched with previously if you update), and guy who I talked to in August for about 2 weeks messages me the next day.  At the time, I had just started dating and didn't know what the hell I was doing - certainly not in terms of FDS. We got along well via text and he had asked me out, but we couldn't get together right away due to our schedules. So we planned something for one weekend, and we kind of mutually flaked. I started seeing someone else, and we just kind of drifted apart and never met.

So he texts me and says he saw my update, and mentioned that he was bummed we didn't get to go out, and he wanted to get together if I was still interested in doing something. So my concern is that back then, I was a pickme in so many ways. Our convo veered into sexual territory at times, and I definitely over-texted him and did a lot of chasing. He probably thought we were going to get physical right away, and we probably would have!  But now I know better.

I want to go out to dinner/dancing with him and see how this plays out, using my new boundaries learned from FDS. If it doesn't work out, no biggie, I feel confident ending it.  What advice would you give me leading up to meeting him? I want to make sure he knows my boundaries without coming out and saying, ""I'm not sleeping with you, dude.""

They had known each other for over a decade and I had known my friend for a decade. So when this friend of a friend wanted to take me out I said yes.

He took me on a nice date to a winery where we listened to live jazz, drank some very nice wine and had hors d'oeuvres. He paid with a $100 bill. He was dressed gross and lazy but I overlooked that. (Not a red flag for abuse ~~or is it? Because it says a lot about somebody's character~~ but barf anyway. Never again)

Then we went downtown, walked around, went to a little impromptu theater show and had some more drinks and food and we even ran into some of his friends whom he introduced me to and they were nice people.

Anyway our dating sort of continued like that. We went and did nice things and met his nice friends who were really lovely people. I guess I must have ignored the red flags because he was such a close friend of my friend. By the way, don't do this. Just because your friend thinks someone is wonderful doesn't mean they are, or that they are *for you*. This has gotten me in trouble three other times not including this time. Literally every time it was a disaster. Always independently vet someone without allowing other people's influence to sway you.

So here is the list of red flags:

- He literally snapped at me like I was a misbehaving dog, twice. snapped at me to scare me out of what I was doing and caused me to freeze. Just because I said or did something that was extremely minor but it wasn't the way he wanted it done. (this one alone should have been an automatic dump for the first time)

- He said Hillary was a criminal and what she did, which of course turned out to be lies (the emails), was just as bad if not worse than Trump, who rapes women and little girls.

- He didn't think that voting or which person ended up being the president could or would ever have any sort of effect on his life whatsoever. Beyond this being extremely ignorant it also shows a level of privilege as a straight white man that I find just astounding. Who becomes president easily affects Supreme Court appointees which could remove one of my most essential human rights: abortion. (This is maybe more of a yellow flag?)

- Yelled at me and practically got me to grovel because I opened a bottle of wine in a manner that he didn't approve of.

- Said sexual things about me in front of his friends.

- Commented in front of his friends the first night I met some of them about how he wouldn't go down on me if I didn't shave my pubic hair. We hadn't even had sex yet or done anything. (this is so utterly disrespectful I wish I could go back in time and slap some sense into myself) 

- Put on a show for us one night and it turned out to be an extremely misogynistic comic, and you know how bad most of them are. He was worse. Why would you play abusive and insulting entertainment for your date when you're trying to look your best? Answer is because he liked it, he was utterly clueless and also had no respect for me. Oh and he was a misogynistic piece of shit.

- Told me he would never raise another kid or pay child support and that if I got pregnant he'd move to Mexico so he wouldn't have to pay. Also said this in an extremely nasty, angry tone. Vile.

- Refused to give me any pleasure or even foreplay in our attempts at sex. And I call it that because he also had ED and would come after one minute. But he refused to treat this or talk about it at all. This is such a deal breaker.

- When I told him about having been raped (don't do this) he tried to find out where the man worked and what his name was. The only reason he would need to know that is either to go beat the guy up or to go ask the guy if it's really true because ""fAlSe rApE aCcUsAtIoNs"". 🤢🤮

- He didn't take care of his dog or spend time with his dog, he would just leave it alone at home all day.

- He told me about his 35+ year old male friend who was a convicted sex offender for raping a 15 year old girl. He was convinced his friend's story was true that the girl made it up because he refused to touch her when she propositioned him. And somehow he got a child rape charge because she grabbed his hand and put it on her breast. But of course this happened alone at night at his tent on a camping trip, he was a friend of her family. Anyway I've been through the legal system and my rapist confessed twice and and they wouldn't even charge him with a misdemeanor which was basically groping. So that's a big fat fucking lie! He referred to this raped 15 year old girl as a sl*t and a wh*re who was ""pretending to be more innocent than she was"" and ""she wasn't a virgin"". This is like 26 different red flags all together. (I'm almost to the vomiting in my mouth writing this out to think that I dated this person for 2 more weeks after this)

- Raised his voice at me, got verbally aggressive and cut me off when I tried to talk about women's oppression. Yelled something like don't ""Talk to me about that bullshit! Men have hard lives too. It's just as bad for both.""

- When my young friend who lived across the country was being stalked and followed by a man on the college campus where she lived and it triggered my rape trauma, he didn't give a fuck and he refused to even speak to me about it let alone comfort me at all. Which triggered me even more and I actually had to go out and sit in my car and call someone else that I could talk to.

- The second time we met his friends, first time for about half of them, he got wasted. At the bar getting another drink he put his hand up my dress and groped me in front of an entire bar full of people that was well lit and everyone could see. He was so drunk he partially lifted up the back of my dress and flashed my ass to people. I asked him repeatedly to stop and tried to get his hand off of me and he wouldn't let go or back off. He was laughing. He did this right in front of the bartender who looked at me with this look like oh my god you poor woman. 

That last one was final. I got away from him that night, blocked him and deleted him. I feel sick just writing this. And as a side note, this is why you don't date when you're dealing with rape trauma and PTSD. It totally corrupts your ability to make appropriate choices about your safety.

I decided to write this just to give people here an idea of a variety of red flags, but also as a little bit of catharsis since all of these things keep popping into my mind and making me feel ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

i have to talk about THE WALL and the okcupid sTuDy. for the sake of impressionable women who linger on reddit and are being driven crazy by the creeps pushing this stuff.  

&amp;#x200B;

so the okcupid ""study"". gospel in loser circles, right? a cornerstone document of the ""women hit a wall, while men age like wine"" mythos.

If you somehow have missed it: the gist is that OkCupid released data showing that no matter what age the men were, they always prefer women around age 20. Meanwhile, women prefer men within a few years of their own age range as they age. OkCupid released this data and announced ""women peak at 20, men at 45""!

Soon after, every blog, news site and meme factory on the internet started cranking out non stop material about it: men are so disgusting! women expire! at 20! men only date young women! women hit a wall! The dating market has flipped for men! most men are pedos! source??: okcupid data.

the sensationalism died out, but reddit continued to carry the flame. and it's still going strong. people still constantly reference that ""study"". women are always talking about how it fucks with their self esteem. but there are some things women whould know..

\*\*First of all, the OkCupid data was released by a guy who runs OkCupid\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

He used specific data, from a specific time period, for a reason. It was a marketing strategy. It exploits insecurity in women about their looks. tale as old as time. the idea is to send them panicked toward dating sites: ""i'm 22 and i'm already past my peak?!?! i'm ugly now! i better settle down with someone before i'm undesirable!""

Meanwhile, they exploit the insecurity of aging men, especially DIVORCED, OLDER men (a notoriously vulnerable target demographic, rife with high suicide rates and crippling loneliness). this sends them flocking to online dating too: ""i just heard that men over 45 are at their peak! and that women want us now!!! i better get in on this...""

it also exploits insecurity in young men by telling them they aren't good enough because they don't have rEsOuRcEs and ExPeIriEnCe compared to these old guys. so young men make profiles hoping to play a numbers game against the imaginary competition that okcupid has created. none of it is real. everyone is being manipulated.

one of the lies that gets spread is that young women want older men but older women are undesirable. men ""peak"" at 45! women ""peak"" at 20! 

if you went up to a 90 year old man with a magic wand and told him you were going to transform him back to any age of his choosing, when he was in his prime - do you REALLY think he would choose 45? hell fucking no. he would choose his late 20s or his 30s,

next thing: 

consider the differences between the way women use online dating and the way men use online dating. 

...in general A LOT of men use it for sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

younger men find relationships online dating more often. so MAYBE young men really ARE looking for relationships (i still have my doubts but anyway...) older men are looking for sex. and consider what types of older men are even on dating sites. divorced middle aged guys? who don't have any prospects in their own lives and are very likely unattractive? of course they're gonna use an opportunity to talk to beautiful women who would otherwise not give them the time of day in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

meanwhile, MOST women are using online dating in hopes to find a life-long partner. they're not using online dating for sex, they're not going to bother with young men. of course the men they are most ""attracted"" to are going to be their age.

  
Notice how no one ever discusses the okcupid statistics about how women find 80 percent of men on okCupid to be unattractive? in fact anytime that data gets posted on reddit it gets heavily downvoted. do you want upvotes on reddit? link to the okcupid study about women ""peaking"" at 20, but stay far far away from any of the stats about women finding men (especially older men) undesirabe. it's just not cannon on reddit.

  
but why would reddit be like this? because. most people are reddit are men...and when i say men i'm not talking normal, well adjusted men. a huge portion of reddit men are THOSE types (lol ok idk how to describe the 'type' without being viciously mean and i don't wanna go down that road...but you know the type) 

next thing:

in reality, most couples are the same age. women prefer ""older"" men, yes. but that's older as in literally 2-3 years. A HUGE majority of couples are the same age, or with the man being 1-6 years older. not 15. not 20. those relationships are RARE. in fact, those relationships are not just rare, they also have very bleak statistical outlooks. sizable age gaps bring huge challenges to realtionships. Again, most people partner up with people their own age. even before women had any semblance of civil rights and were living in the midst of male domination, they were typically married to like-aged men. 

""well thats because men are just ""settling"" for women thier own age"" - reddit men say - ""but they're still daydreaming of 19 years olds.""

ok! i counter with this: so what. 

we (women) do the same.exact.thing. the average age of male porn stars that women enjoy is 22. twenty fucking two. most posters and magazines sold feature YOUNG men. consider the average male hearthrob. ALWAYS a beautiful full head of hair, in shape, gorgeous skin, almost always young (in their 20s and 30s) grown women fawning over the young BOYS from stranger things. From twilight. From harry potter. etc etc etc.

people want companionship. they want meaningful relationships. despite what reddit implies, very few people truly want transnational relationships where an older man 'buys' a young woman. yes it happens sometimes. but MOST people want partners that truly love them. they don't want to be second-guessing their partners motivations all the time. they want to be respected. they want to be loved well. cuddle around a campfire and drink a beer with their partner. they want to tease each other and play and joke around while making dinner together. they want to discuss and share life with someone. most people want partners their own age or within a reasonable age range. the reality is NOT as bleak as you think. it's time to retire the ""i saw a study about how men want teenagers"" b.s.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, ""the wall"". ladies, young ladies especially: no matter how many times you hear the manipulative pathetic repetition tactics of mgtow-ers it will never make their fantasy true. look around with your own eyes. are you seeing men aging like wine? are you seeing women fawning over middle aged men? cuz i'm seeing women being creeped out by middle aged men. and women aging better than their counterparts. 

&amp;#x200B;

it's projection. the wall is real. MEN really do hit a wall at 30. by 30, they are expected to be successful, to have found a long term girlfriend or a wife, to have ""made it"". meanwhile, testosterone is fleeing. their hair thins out. they lose muscle. fat distrubution changes in men, which means they carry fat in their bellies. they get hair on their backs and lose it from their heads. i've seen it described as ""body horror"" and that's about right. it's like a werewolf movie. imagine what that's like! it's got to be fucking awful. in addition to THAT, many start to suffer with ED. and for men who missed out on having children it is probably pretty hard to deal with the fact that their sperm quality plummets in their mid 30s and their doctors tell them please consider freezing sperm before 35. there's a reason sperm banks want sperm from young men 18-35. they will only accept 35-39 as a last resort and have a hard line cut off after that, NO ONE is going to put women at risk and give them sperm from men over 40, no matter how loudly they declare that they are in their supposed ""pEaK"". 

&amp;#x200B;

are young women are GORGEOUS? duh. who on earth doesn't agree with that. young men are gorgeous too. but everybody ages. the magical thing about being a WOMAN however, is that your ""PEAK"" beauty is so off the charts high that even as it falls it stays pretty fucking high. lol. just stay in shape. take care of yourself. it really is that easy for women. we don't have to deal with any of the BODY HORROR that men have to deal with as early as their damn 30s. if you prioritize staying beautiful, i mean if that's something that is important to you (toatlly fine btw) you CAN do it. look around you in the real world. i mean, even just look at the examples that these mgtow types present. i know that sometimes they use pics of like mums who let themselves go or women who did drugs or whatever, but look at the flawlessly beautiful women they tell us are disgusting: scar jo, emilia clarke, winona ryder, jennifer aniston, selma hayek, etc they say things like ""they hit the wall hard"". meanwhile, these women are killing it lol AND are still unbelievable looking. are we supposed to not believe our lying eyes? are we not seeing the same images? meanwhile they recycle the same pics of george clooney, keanu, steve carrell, brad pitt and leo (barf btw) as PROOF that men age like wiiiiiiiiiine. it's hard to yawn and laugh out loud at the same time but somehow i manage. 

&amp;#x200B;

but besides all that, peak in other ways ladies. get awesome at an instrument. delve deep into your favorite hobbies. kick ass at work. learn languages. embrace your sense of humor. whatever. remember, women report higher levels of happiness as they age. Very few women look back at their early 20s and go ooohhhhh life was soooo easy i miss my old self. Lol, when women actually get out of their 20s they're like hey wtf, i was lied to. it's all a big dumb lie.

&amp;#x200B;

sorry for the length. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moreso, I was infatuated by him. We kept in touch over a year and I started visiting him in Europe where he was doing his masters. I’d bring him gifts. When i mean by gifts is not just small gifts but literally entire clothes such a shoes, customized rayban. supplements , foods and also is send him card on his birthday and even did food delivery for him as I had deliveroo (food delivery service in U.K.). But even before this he’d always comment on me saying why I’m not doing my nails and my makeup how I’m fat, and he ask me to join dating app so that he could have free membership when I was visiting him for the first time. Now looking back I was really foolish. And then the wise thing happened. He started falling for his female friend who was in same course as him. He denied and denied but when he didn’t make any date plans when I was visiting him, he was with her. I always had to find it out from her instagram story. He’s Muslim and I actually wrote about this before on comments. 
After this I suffered from severe PTSD and was on verge of suicide because ir wasn’t just pick me things I did for him, i was total package. His emotional abuse, how he did triangulation and made me crush my self esteem and doubt myself. And he kept denying the obvious facts. I had to even quit my masters bc of my health issues. 
If I was a guy, I’d beat him up to death. There’s more to the story but I cannot write it all and put it words. 
First never date a Muslim men who’s in foreign country for studies. You have no idea what kind of person he truly is. And no way to find out also. 

After this, I disputed all the transaction with the credit card company and got the money back luckily but had to close out the card. I didnt come out of house in months but also made lots of $$ and moved to my own apt finally. Got a new job and worked on myself, studied mediation and Buddhism. That’s when I realized, you attract what you are. I was thinking so low of myself that I attracted those kind of Behavior from him. 

After this , I never date a guy who had bad upbringing in the past. More so if he had series of crazy ex gf. And I only date rich guys or well established guys. No broke students. No guys who are unkempt. No guys who have thing going on with female friend who can’t distinguish friendship vs relationship. And most of all, I do the exact same thing when a guy starts manipulating me. It’s hard but I don’t ever call a guy out. I just mirror him exactly. And lastly I don’t ever trust a man 100%. It’s too dangerous. And I don’t even spend a penny on a date. 

But just don’t date narcissistic guys and best way to confront them is to take away all the attention you’ve given him as they thrive on attention. My ex used to be so anxious when I’d pretend he was invisible right in front of me. It always worked. To deal with narcissistic guys, you have to be very very passive aggressive.",48475,The epic pick me things I did for my ex,0,,

•Keep your expectations realistic. Not every man you meet is going to be right for you. In fact, the majority will not be right for you. That’s why it’s up to you to weed out all LVM without a second thought.

•Remember, HE asked YOU out. HE is trying to impress YOU.

•Make a deal with yourself-decide to remain unbothered and pleasant no matter what he says or does. are you about to ruin your own evening because he turned out to be a dud? Absolutely not, you already decided to remain unbothered. Carry on unbothered and simply make a mental note not to see him again. Your energy is precious.

•Crushes are useless. Train yourself to only be attracted to men who actively pursue you and court you, and want to impress you. Guys who don’t know you exist are bad matches for you. So having crushes is a form of self-harm and self-sabotage. 

•The date is HIS interview and HIS time to be a pickme. “Pickme, I will be a good provider! Pickme, I will support you in all aspects of your life! Pickme, I will never be an emotionally abusive asshat to you! Pickme, I will listen intently to your goals, dreams and opinions”

•By nature, men are supposed to be the pickmes. You have no business bragging about your cooking and cleaning skills to a man you just met-Extinguish desperate Pickme behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

Long term lurker here, I finally broke up with a LVM after 2 and a half years together, where he had called me a bitch, whore, self obsessive etc. and had threatened to send photos of me he'd taken to  my workplace early on in the relationship, not to mention 3 months ago when I broke my ankle and needed pretty intense surgery and he didn't come and see me once in all that time and when I broke it off had the cheek to call me emotionally abusive.

But all that being said I still feel hideous about it all, I'm feeling really lonely and afraid of what comes next, I'm sad I've tolerated this for that long but I'm also really sad I lost someone I cared about so much, part of me is happy I've started my journey to levelling up but at the same time I feel so overwhelmed and awful.

any advice of how to get through this horrible feeling patch would mean a lot right now.

I also think a little background will help FDS members understand why I've had a number of bad relationships, why I find it harder to get over my ex and why I might struggle to embrace the FDS mentality.   


In terms of background I was born in the equivalent of a ghetto to an abusive mother. I was neglected and emotionally abused for years. The neglect included physical and medical neglect which adversely affected my appearance and meant that I was bullied in education up until university. Most of this abuse centred on my appearance. It also meant I developed health issues which I have since defeated. In the simplest sense, I come from a position where I was treated as though I wasn't good enough and to some degree I internalised this message. I can still struggle with negative patterns in my thinking and language, even though I now look decent, am healthy, and I am much more accomplished than I used to be. This probably contributed to a string of negative relationships wherein I believed that I had to accept poor treatment, be it emotionally or sexually, to be in a relationship at  all.   


Around 5-6 months ago my ex left me for a number of reasons and I have been struggling to properly get over him. I don't normally struggle to get over lost relationships, friendships or otherwise so this is new for me. Indeed, I was **shocked** that I was crying and upset almost everyday for at least a month when he left. Most of my past relationships were terrible and it was my best relationship up until that point. In my past relationships I was either put down constantly, bullied by my partner's family, neglected and even manipulated into performing sexual acts I didn't want to do. My last relationship wasn't like that. He was reliable, would call me virtually everyday even though he worked a near 100 hour week, he would pay for pretty everything without asking, he always made sure that I enjoyed sex, he would pick things up for me using his own initiative, remembered every holiday and virtually never put me down. Essentially he was **almost** perfect.   


He left me because there was a conflict between his job and our relationship. To become incredibly successful he would need to move to the middle east. This means that he would have to marry me if I came to live with him. Another issue was that it is very difficult for someone who isn't a professional with years of experience to get a job in the country. I am not a professional with years of experience of yet, and he wasn't willing to marry me. He had issues because of a failed engagement, avoided negative emotions and situations and didn't want to settle down. I was absolutely heartbroken. The MGTOW, red pillers, and incels who believe women can't love are full of crap.   


In addition to being heartbroken, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find another man who would treat me well and invest in me. I tried OLD for a while which appeared to confirm my suspicions. Eventually one of my friends proposed a long distance relationship. We've been friends for five years, I know him back to front and he has a number of HVM qualities. Even though I am still occasionally thinking about my ex, I decided to gamble it, probably in part because I am insecure. Obviously this is inadvisable and I've got a long way to go.   


I will appreciate any input or advice you have to offer.",48469,Struggling To Get Over Ex,0,,

Trust is earned, not given, and thus everyone has to prove themselves before deemed trustworthy! Our trust should not be taken for granted or taken as fixed either! Trust feeds on actions to maintain it! 

Why? Because trust is such a big thing in all human relations and interactions and it should not be given freely or treated lightly. Being conditioned to 'trust' and 'give people the benefit of the doubt' from early on, meant that I didn't create proper boundaries with others and skills of self-protection  and self-preservation while I was growing up.

Therapy, intense exercise, healthy eating, friends, new classes, working more, reading, tv, etc. fill every hour of my day but nothing, and I mean nothing, helps. It's been almost a month of constant daily torture of no contact and seeing him move onto someone else he seems smitten with.

We met in the gym and got to know him over months casually (he is an instructor there). While I developed a strong crush, I think I was a distraction/part of his day where he didn't need to try harder or make effort. I went along with the flirting, but deep down I wanted it to be more but never asked him to back up his flirting with a date or anything. (We did end up going out to play pool once and he mentioned getting dinner but instead pushed for Netflix and Chill sessions).  
While there were lusty, excited, friendly, silly moments with him, more often than not, he made me question my worth and feel less than...which sucks because he claimed to have liked me. After discovering this sub, it seems it was a combination of not asserting myself when I should have (letting things ""slide"" too often, letting him disrespect me by ignoring me at parties, leaving in the morning when I spent the night (we never had sex), mental and emotional blame shifting, keeping me as this ""secret"" around other people, etc.) Just because he wasn't my boyfriend, doesn't mean I should get a lack of humanity..so I cut him off once, but he begged his way back and apologized profusely so I gave it another chance. Now that I've actually ended it for real and stopped contact, I get into negative mental loops wondering/wishing if I found this sub sooner and handled it differently, maybe it would have had a different outcome.

To a normal person, they would believe they were worth more and move on....meanwhile I'm over here obsessed even more after ending it (even though I'm not acting on it/showing it or talking to him...just suffering internally.) It's compounded by the fact that he's moved on almost instantly with someone he seems enamored with...It's so hard for me to look at them from the outside seeming so happy yet he barely acknowledged me. Like I never even mattered and just vanished into thin air.

It's really pathetic and I'm wondering what's gong to be the end of this. I'm not connected on social media or anything, just seeing constant real-life proof that he didn't care about me and that I was in the placeholder position until he found someone he was really into.

TLDR: Did I nuke my chances from my ""Pickmeisha"" behavior or did it never stand a chance to begin with?

When I really sat down and thought about the fact that using me for sex wasn't enough and that's what I thought it was only about.

 But it's about the conquest, the reciprocation of attention (during love bombing), which I unfortunately return. He wanted his ego stroked, I gave that to him. He wanted validation, I gave that to him. He wanted someone to hold him and I did that. He wanted someone to be submissive and to degrade, me again. He wanted someone he could have sex with multiple times until exhaustion, I was there. Like these dudes will really took more from you than you initially thought. He probably thought he was god until he decided he could take no more from me and ran off to the next (whoever than poor soul is) 

I didn't realize how I went against my own standards and moral code because I was lonely and had no one else around. Not just romantically, but no friends currently and I have no family support. I hadn't dated in a very longggggggggg time  Completely alone. That someone that put up an illusion/mask made me feel like if I missed this opportunity, it would never arise again. He pulled out every trick in the deck to take advantage of me on every level except financially or me playing the wifey card (aka 50/50, cooking, cleaning, etc) that I'm sure if I stooped to that level, he would have exploited me in that way, too. I could give him my attention, my support, my kindness, his ego strokes, he could push me enough to get me to do certain things, I could give him my trust, intimacy, etc but that wasn't enough for him. I didn't even realize I was actually being a pickmeisha but it's only because the person who I thought he was actually cared about me. 

I am not experienced at all when it comes to dating or sex. I thought it was about sex until I came to the realization why I feel MORE violated than just being used for sex. He was nothing but a parasite. Give me attention, give me ego strokes, make me #1, give me sex, be submissive, etc. So really be careful who you involve yourself with ladies. I feel really ashamed of myself giving myself over to a parasitic narcissistic.

*""Recently I spoke up about being frustrated that once my husband cums - all sex related activity ends. In his defense I never spoke up about it before. I was frustrated because I felt like I shouldn’t have to say this, but accept it’s not fair to have expectations and not communicate them. So I did. He asked in the future to let him know so that he can help me finish. 

The other day we had sex. He came inside me. I hadn’t cum yet and was super horny still. I did as he asked and told him I hadn’t cum and wanted to finish. I’m rubbing it out and ask him to join in. He was clearly grossed out by it. We talked about it after and he said it was just a lot of his cum getting all over and it was too much in the moment. 

I’m like WTF.. How the hell does he think I feel sometimes? I love it when he cums inside of me, but get overwhelmed when I give him blowjobs and he blows a load. Yet I take it like a champ most times. To get to the point. It hurt. I’m not planning on asking him to help again. I’ll just do it privately after or not at all. 

I just had to get that out there. I’m mad and hurt all at the same time. 

I’m really putting myself out there sexually lately. Things like this just make me want to retreat.""*

THIS is their esteemed opinion of women! 

""We're all products. And we're all customers. And each of us is trying to maximize what we can get in exchange for what we offer.

Women have little to offer. Worse (for them), each year erodes the value of their offer. Time takes a toll on their bodies. They wrinkle, shrivel, and droop. Meanwhile, they retain all of the mannerisms and traits that must be tolerated by customers (men).

It's like owning a car. The car depreciates with time. And its noises, creaks, and engine troubles aren't going away.

Men can generally offer a lot to women. We create. We invent. We build. We protect. We provide. And time increases our value, assuming we take care of our bodies and minds.

Women still want to get married. For family. For security. For approval. For validation. Some do it early in their product life cycle. That's smart. That's when they'll attract the best customers. Others play the field. They rent themselves out. And by the time they're 30, the pool of customers has dwindled.

These latter women are like the rental cars on a Hertz or Enterprise car lot. Ridden hard and put away wet. Their situation is a desperate one, even if they fail to recognize it. Their naturally declining value is exacerbated by the miles they've been ridden.

Men can wait to marry. Their value rises with time as they improve their lots. Their skill set broadens. Their financial picture improves. Their pool of resources expands. Men's value follows the trajectory of a share of Berkshire Hathaway stock.

And for many of us, the passage of time is kind to our appearance.

As more men realize that women have little to offer, and recognize that attaching themselves to women presents a significant financial risk, they'll increasingly opt to lease rather than buy. Rather than marrying women, they'll ride 'em for awhile, and then throw 'em back on the lot in exchange for a newer model.

Again, we're all products. And we're all customers. The problem for women is that, as products, they're in a buyer's market. And that market becomes less friendly as they age.

Women can assuage their fears and desperation by claiming to be queens. But the fact is, men have a LOT of options. By the time women reach 30, it's time to have a permanent fire sale.

Or buy cats.""

Him: “I really enjoy being with you. I’m so happy we found each other.”
Me: “Aw, that’s so sweet. I’m happy too. Don’t break my heart.”
Him: “Don’t be fickle and shallow. Deal?”

I have no idea what he is referring to. I’m pretty much a slob. I mentioned I’d gotten a haircut that day, but that is literally all I can think of. This remark was like a needle scratching a record.

Do I:
1. Ask him what he meant
2. Block with no further comment
3. Say nothing until/if he tries to make plans, then tell him I’ll be too busy off being fickle and shallow

Give them and inch and they’ll take three and a half. 

Every day you have moments where you have the opportunity to swallow it or speak up. Your boss just assumed you’d be OK with staying late, and didn’t actually ask you? Your date assumed you would be OK with a change of timing at the last minute? Your neighbour just assumes their music isn’t too loud since they never heard you complain? Your friend always just calls you and emotionally dumps on you, without asking how your day was and checking whether you have the emotional reserves for it right now?

People will push you as far as they can, whether consciously or not.  Think about those little moments where you’re uncomfortable, but you’re preserving the peace or trying to be polite. You are swallowing the awkwardness to make someone else’s life easier! And is that person demonstrating any care or respect for you? Are they fuck!

I’m NOT victim blaming, but I am saying you need to think about what’s making you unhappy, and be ready to stick up for yourself when appropriate. You need to rehearse NOW because in the heat of the moment you’ll fall back on your powers of empathy and politeness to preserve the status quo. The you’ll be kicking yourself when you walk away, thinking of the perfect comeback, and you’re going to agonise over it and feel resentful. 

Practice these situations in advance and be ready to use it when appropriate. It’s NOT RUDE or BAD to push back! Just look at the standard of behaviour the other person is showing you, and ask yourself whether they deserve to be constantly accommodated and have the easy life. They DO NOT.",48787,Reminder: People will push you as far as they can!,0,,

We met three years ago when I (f23) started working for him (m40) at that time he was divorcing his (now ex) wife, of course from the beginning I thought he was really handsome and I was very attracted to him but I never tried anything because he only had eyes for his wife even when she cheated on him with another man. Two years ago he finally divorced her and he was devastated, he has a good relationship with his employees but he always had a different relationship with me, he used to tell me about his wife and the things she did, he even cried once talking about her and the man she cheated on him with. He never tried to flirt with me and always treated me like his friend, but a few months ago our relationship changed drastically.  It was my birthday and since my whole family is in my home country I was going to spend that day alone so he and my coworkers prepared a surprise dinner for me, it was a very special night and at the end of the night he took me to my house and he kissed me, since then we started flirting and we always kissed when we were alone. And a few months ago we got sexually involved, he was the first, and only, man I had sex with and since then I've fallen in love even more with him, the problem is that he never asked me to have a formal relationship but he is really sweet. Last Sunday while we were having lunch, he hugged me and said ""I love you"", but I don't know if he meant it, I didn't answer him and we didn't talk about it later.

But I don't know if I can stand this anymore because a few weeks ago I learned that I'm 10 weeks pregnant, I always dreamed of getting married, having children and a loving husband and none of that is happening because I did everything wrong. My parents will hate me and tell me ''we told you so'' and I'm sure they will hate their grandchild too but I want to keep the baby. I don't know what to do, at this point I'm not sure of anything, should I tell him? How can I tell him?

Tl;dr ""We met three years ago when I (f23) started working for him (m40) at that time he was divorcing his (now ex) wife, two years ago he finally divorced her and a few months ago our relationship changed drastically.

Marriage was always in the back of my head.

Now, in my early 30s, my spirit has been broken and I blame myself. You see, I spent my whole life focusing on the eventual prize of having a man to share life with. I’m wiser now, mostly thanks to an ex who turned out to be a full-fledged sex addict. I don’t think I can ever trust a man again. Honestly, I believe in my core all they want is to use us and dump us once they get what they want. 

This realization has destroyed me inside. I’m not motivated to do anything anymore, because I’ll never have what I want most. Because it doesn’t exist.

I don't use the app we met on for OD (as it goes completely against FDS) any more but I have been checking it once a week to see if anyone super-interesting comes up, and also to keep on eye on his profile to see if my time is being wasted.

**2) I've changed my own fucking pictures on the same app.**

A few of us here have already done that, are a bit older and seem to be looking for a serious committed relationship, but not marriage.

I married at 26, divorced at 43 and have been single and dating on and off for about 8 years. 

The first half of my marriage was pretty good. We were a career focused couple who decided to be childfree. It worked for a while. We achieved great things financially, traveled, and basically lived the good life. Then, in year 8, after I made a career change (mutually agreed upon) that left me financially dependent on him he changed and his narcissistic traits emerged. We spent the next nine years in and out of marriage counseling to no avail. Finally I decided to direct my energy into myself, friends, hobbies and physical fitness instead of working on trying to save the marriage. This caused major narcissistic injury to the husband and was the death knell of the marriage. After the divorce I took a little time to find myself again, enjoy a peaceful home and took a nice trip. Then I was ready to date and try to find a companion.

Here is what I was looking for: A man my age or a little older with a similar level of education, worldly experience and professional success. I had envisioned maintaining separate households but spending a couple of nights a week together, being an official, committed couple and travelling together. I was going into this financially sound, no debt, no children and by most people's standards no baggage.

What I found instead:  A veritable shit show of broken, addicted, personality disordered men. Nothing I entertained lasted more than a couple of months tops (with one horrible exception) because these men were that bad. When things didn't work, friends who have been married for decades, would tell me ""how I was doing it wrong."" I was meeting men the wrong way, I ""picked"" the wrong men. I was too picky or I wasn't picky enough. I needed to date older, or younger. The reality is they had no fucking clue because they hadn't tried to date in 30 years and have no idea what it is like out there now.

I think FDS is fantastic and necessary, but for those of us who are in our 40's and 50's and have no desire to marry again we may have to take a slightly different tack. We don't want the ring, wedding or babies. At this point I'm skeptical that what I am looking for even exists. I just know too many women in my shoes. We have it together on all fronts but can't find partners on our level. It's validating yet also very sad to see younger women going through the same thing.

Anyone else out there in my situation and have you had any success?",48658,Been there done that - If you don't want to get married again,0,,

**Do you support your girlfriend (NOT wife) someway financially? If so, how and why? What are your thoughts about some such an arrangement in general?""**

Here are the replies

"" Before we got married, I paid for everything. Cellphones, insurance, car repairs, food, etc. Didn't bother me one bit, I felt is was an investment in our relationship and **proving to myself that I could support us financially.** This went on for about 2 years before we got married.""

"" I give my girl Gas Money (the drive is \~45 min so fair is fair) and if she has no cash I'll happily give her $20 so she doesn't have to sweat it till payday.""

"" I finally managed to convince my gf to split rent proportionally to our income. She is a graduate student and I work in the Tech industry. She was always broke and I have excess cashflow because we still live like students. If we wanted to increase our quality of living, I would have to support her. Proportional splitting rent is helping keep her out of debt. I also sneakily grab the check whenever possible because I love to go out with friends, but grad students can't afford that shit.

She doesn't want to feel like I am paying for her, but the tradeoff to splitting things equally is that I have to live in her financial lane. I want to enjoy my money while I am young so I try to do what I can without her noticing.

**I wish she would let me support her financially more. I have the money and I want to spend it to increase our quality of life.** I'm getting sick of living in terrible student apartments.""

""A good friend of mine recently told me that he and his gf have a rule that anytime they go out for breakfast, she pays. Otherwise he pays. She made the rule because **he always wanted to pay all the time** and she wanted to contribute.""

""I'm very old-fashioned with this, **I'd never accept cash from my SO more so out of principle.**...however she has bought smokes and stuff for me when my bank had issues.""

I’m 19F and boyfriend is the same age as me. He’s not in college, doesn’t work (he babysits which is a job I got for him, but that’s only a couple hours a week), overweight, etc. 

I know I deserve better. We’ve both let ourselves go since we started dating—it’s been two years—but at the moment I think I’m out of his league in terms of looks. But i’m in college and doing well, I have a part time job and an internship lined up for the spring. Apart from this relationship my 2020 is on track to be perfect. He already ruined my New Years and has yelled (literally screamed at the top of his lungs) at me almost every day since then. The sex isn’t great either. I know I should leave but I get flashes of self doubt. I had horrible self esteem growing up and even if I try to compare myself to him and come out better in every aspect—health, academics, career, finances, social—I can’t help but feel I won’t find anyone better. 

I read posts on here about women who have found HVM and I feel like I’ll never find that. I know FDS is against settling and logically I know 19 is too young to settle anyway, but I feel like I can’t leave. 

We broke up once this past March for a month and I went on Tinder and it was not good. That was a big part of why we got back together. How do women even find HVM? If I break up with someone who I know is mediocre, am I doomed to wade through a pool of men who are even worse, just in the hopes that someone will eventually not be garbage? 

I know this is a lot of ranting so I’m sorry and thank you for reading this far if you have, I just desperately need advice.

From the beginning he seemed like a genuine guy, we’d talk for hours, I’d met his mom, some of his friend and I was staying at his house maximum 4 times a week. I had a toothbrush there! 

It was nice, we had a understanding that sometimes we’re busy so can’t reply straight away or if I’m with my friends I’m not on my phone but I’ll text later. 

Then his energy changed and I sensed he was gonna end it which he did - he’s leaving the country for 6 months soon and doesn’t want the long distance to ruin our relationship or hurt either one of us’ feelings, he wanted to end it and remain friends.

Which I was bummed about, I won’t lie. He was the first guy I’d really invested in since the end of a 4 year relationship so I was really putting myself into this. But I said yes, we’ll remain friends because this wasn’t ending on bad terms and I liked him as a person, just because it didn’t work out why would I cut him off?

It’s been a week now and we’re still talking everyday - no cute pet names or flirting. I’m just wondering am I being a fool? I know he isn’t obliged to reply to me but when he doesn’t for a while, I get anxious and scared incase he’s ghosted me? Which is weird because I never did when we were together. 

Should I just cap the interaction now and wait until I’m fully over it to be his friend (I don’t have a problem being friends with exes, so that doesn’t seem weird to me) or am I just being silly and secretly waiting to see if he’ll change his mind (which I know he won’t)?

It’s really sad and I cannot stress importance of this enough. Because sex is something physical and can be seen, using the girl for sex is blamed on heavily. While using the girl to get over their emotional wound isn’t blamed as much. 

A guy who doesn’t take time to get over his breakup and jumps right on to dating app to feel the ‘void’ are definitely LVM. It doesn’t matter he earns much or handsome. Because on back of his mind, he thinks that he can use people’s feelings  to benefit for his own needs. 

My ex who literally fucked me up was like this and other guys I met on tinder. Always always ask how long ago if they’d broken up. And how long they were together for. For me , a guy who dated his ex for few years and past six months is definite no for me. I don’t want to be burden for any emotional baggage from any men.


Always ask about their ex. If you really like him, at least see him platonically and don’t have the sex until he fully is healed from his breakup. If a guy doesn’t tell me he just broken up, I feel deceived so I immediately put him into friend zone. So I’d meet him for freemeals and drinks. Nothing else. Just like you didn’t tell me your past, I won’t tell you that I won’t be having sex with you while I’ll be reaping he benefits from you. 

I used to be naive, clueless girl who thinks she can make the guy fall in love with her. No. A guy who is broken up mostly has hurt ego, and there’s high chance that he’ll return to the girl. Not because he loves her, because he wants to rebuild his lost ego by going back to her. But he’s confused that he wants her back because he loves her when he’s not. 

Also if you want the guy to stay with you, hurt him once in a while. Don’t always build his ego up. Guys never forget the girl who hurt their ego.

Also I realized being on tinder was rude awakening for me. I really get to see how fucked up most guys are. Especially beta ones. After I started using tinder, I feel like I changed 180. No naivety in me and only logic and cold heart. It’s sad that even though I life in such a big city, that I find most of guys untrustworthy.",44873,Don’t be the guys rebound girl,0,,

For background, I’ve only been in a relationship once before (and it lasted 2 years) but as I look back I realize he wasn’t considered as “conventionally attractive.” Not that it mattered though, I loved him.

Now, all of the sudden this guy who is popular and attractive likes me and I’m stumped. This has happened once before with another “highly desired” guy. What usually happens is; I find out we like each other, we date, and then I eventually fuck up because (I think) I show too much interest. 

I found out he likes me about 1 month ago, and we’ve been talking every day over text, I’m a little nervous to speak to him in person but that doesn’t really stop me, I just never initiate like I want to. From what I heard from one of our mutual friends; he’s nervous to make the first move and is waiting on me, but after my experience in the past I’m afraid it will drive him away like the last guy. 

How do I prevent this? Or in other words, how do I pursue a conventionally attractive man that is desired by tons of women? Oh, and for the record, yes, I do like this guy for more than just for his looks, I really find him bubbly personality charming and she’s extremely fun to talk to.

LVM are OK when things are OK! The moment they are not, their first response is to disappear! Even in situations such as a premature baby in NICU and a wife dying of cancer...

Ladies, weed them out early on! Weed them out before you invest more of yourselves, your time and your energy on them! You never know what life brings and we need HVMs as partners to ensure that even if or when we are gone, they will protect and care for our offspring ('our' as in children that WE made together!).

When dating or engaged or what have you...how do they react in emergencies? When they or you lose your job? When life throws them lemons? When life throws the lemons at you? In health scares, emergencies or operations? How do they treat their sick or elderly parents or family members? How do they treat you when you get a cold or the sniffles? How do they treat their or your pets even? Are they proactive? Future planning and future proofing? Do they take action? Do they reach for their mothers for support? Or even to you and expect or demand that they are comforted because you know...life happens and all?

There are SO many indicators, signs, red flags around us when in contact with men. Be extra vigilant during your interactions, do not give the benefit of the doubt, reply the conversations you have had or the scenes you have witnessed in your heads to make sure you did not miss anything or that you are not making excuses for them.

Damn, why there aren’t normal dudes anymore? I met guys from OLD to real life situation, and most of guys acted like they were ready and into me until like am 3-5 dates. 

However, over time they suddenly kinda showed true colour, tried to rush into sex (as I was trying to have it when I really feel it.) and eventually some guys said they aren’t so ready for something serious.

This is pretty hurtful and emotionally draining as I believe this is going somewhere, but suddenly I gotta put a stop.

I really have no more motivation and intention to meet guys as I’m sick and tired of all haha...

I called (I know, I know), and he sent me to voicemail (I didn't leave one). I sent one final text saying goodbye and left it at that. He texted later that night saying that he got super busy at work, wanted to see how things went with me when he was super busy, and was disappointed that I didn't ""take the lead"" and reach out to him. There was some back-and-forth between us, where I said I couldn't possibly be expected to just know his schedule, and he said I seemed cold and distant. He said he wanted to put things on pause so he can focus on work and ""think about things"". I told him that I would continue dating other people.

I'm freshly 23 and this was the first serious relationship I've had since high school ( if you  count that ). He was a LVM, less attractive than me by a lot, still lived at home and at my age it wasnt too much of a problem but the reason why was. He blew all his money, his parents still babied and spoiled him. He had a DUI with a blow and go and still had to go out drinking almost every night. Those obvious red flags I chose to ignore and then others came creeping up and I ignored those as well. We were friends first and the idea of more seemed easy to me because I was already comfortable with him.

He was so nice to me at first, literally treated me like a princess. He was the one who wanted to make things serious. I waited a little and then we decided we were going to make things official. It was great for a little but even for a new relationship it didnt last long at all. Quickly it became him ditching our plans last minute all the time. If I got upset it was my fault because he always had an excuse. I started to become insecure because we worked the same job lived in the same town so hanging out a couple times a week wasn't like it was a hard thing to do because we had similar schedules. But he didnt want that. There would be weeks where we wouldn't hang out because he always had an excuse. I had my own place too so at the time I didnt expect much I just wanted to see him even if it was only for a couple hours but that became too much. 

He would constantly complain that he needed to be able to hang out with his friends and that he didnt need to see me everyday because that's not what he needed in a relationship and I needed to be okay with that. My problem was I didnt need to see him everyday either I had friends too but the constant ditching me last minute for plans we made became too much. I started to feel crazy, insecure, and depressed. When he ditched our plans he never bothered to make new plans and I started to sit there wondering if and when I'd see him again.  He started to ignore me at work and flirt with other girls in front of me. His reasoning? Well he wanted to stay professional at work now. 

The last straw was when I was going through something very horrible he kept doing this and went to hang out with his friend the day before he left for vacation without bothering to ask me if I was free even though he knew I was going through something and he was going to be leaving. Fast forward on vacation I was talking to him about it and started an argument and he told me basically to fuck off he was trying to enjoy himself. So I broke up with him. 

When he got back we got together in person and talked about it. I told him my feelings and APOLOGIZED for breaking up with him. I was super nice to him when we worked together and then stupidly I decided to give him another chance because he seemed so sorry and I thought I loved him. The first week of us back together was amazing. He kept telling me he loved me and we had so much fun together. But then the old behaviors came out full force and worse than ever. I remember the one time we were supposed to hang out was after our shift together and I brought it up and he goes oh yeah I picked up an early shift I cant without bothering to tell me before i asked even though we had plans.

He said ""we can hang out another day."" And all I said was ""I hope something doesn't come up."" And that set him off. He refused to speak to me. Turns out he didnt have to work that shift anymore and we could have still hung out but didnt bother to tell me. So I called him and apologized and asked if he still wanted to hang out. He was angry said no and was already on his way home. I legit begged him to come over apologized so much for that statement and in hindsight I shouldn't have. He refused saying he didnt want to see me after that. 

Fast forward he was still ditching me of course and everytime he did I started to fight him on it. I was really starting to feel depressed and insecure. I kept wondering what was wrong with me that he could barely give me his time? My roommates even asked me if we were still dating because he was never around. One day mid argument he texted me telling me he was done. I kept texting him because I didnt realize he meant with the relationship but just the argument and he ignored them all until the next day telling me didnt reply because he was done with our relationship. My pathetic self begged for him back apologized so much for arguing with him and he made it seem like it was all my fault. 

He told me maybe we should just take a break because he still loves me and we just need to get over us fighting all the time. I thought I loved this guy so much and I was so hopeful. A few days later after not speaking to him I texted him about this ""said break"" basically my feelings on it and how I felt maybe taking a month long break wouldnt do anything and that maybe we should try working this out. He never responded. I texted him two days later and asked him what was up and he literally told me he wasnt reading these messages because he was trying to have a good time with his friends. 


That my friends was the wake up call I needed. He said those words before when I was going through something bad and he said them again when he gave me a fake idea of a possibility of fixing our relationship. There was nothing to fix this relationship was dead from the beginning. He only cared about himself and he treated me like a doormat and the worst part was I let him. I let him walk all over me and he took full advantage. I never replied to that and for some reason he hates me now. Will refuse to acknowledge me at work and has talked badly about me. It hurt for a while. I felt so ashamed and so stupid. But clarity set in.

Being without him made me realize how unhappy and depressed I was when I was with him. I hated myself and cried all the time when we were together. I had anxiety all the time. Now I feel so free. Sometimes I miss him but then I realize quickly I dont actually miss him I miss the person I thought he was. And the biggest thing I've taken from this is to never ever let a guy walk all over me again. And if I have to literally beg a guy for his time then I dont want his time.",46223,I was pickmeisha in my last relationship and as embarrassing as it was I learned a lot. Warning long rant below,0,,

“What makes you worthy of being someone’s girlfriend? What can you bring to the table?” 

I’ve never been in a committed relationship or anyone’s girlfriend before, which is often what sparks this question. Have any of you been asked this question before? And if so, what was your response? 

In most cases, I’ve responded in the most PICK-ME ASS BITCH way (listing what I can do for a man, this that and the third) and now looking back on it, I wish I would have ignored their question and/or probably ended the conversation right then and there. 

But from now on, if I am to be asked, I’m going to respond with this, “First of all, you need to get to know me before you ask such a question. I know my worth and I deserve nothing short of what I can I already do for myself/bring to myself. There is no need for me to be explaining my worth to ANYONE when I know it for myself. Whether you can see it or not, is on YOU. Second, it’s not about what I can bring to the table, it’s about what a person is willing to do to prove to me that they are worth bringing something, if anything to the table. Why provide anything for something who isn’t going to reciprocate that? If you aren’t doing anything to show me that I am the one you want, does it make sense for me to try to prove that to you that I am the one you want? NO! Because people work hard for what they TRULY want and don’t have to be told, convinced, persuaded, etc. If you not working to obtain it, then you don’t want it. And that’s that.” 

Women, we are the prize. We are the ones to be sought after. We are the ones that keep this world on it’s fucking axis for goodness sakes.

We, as women, naturally are apt to provide a nurturing type of love to others. It’s somewhat instinctual, and that instinct is stronger in some women than others. 

That being said, you should **not be giving this type of love to male romantic partners.** Nurturing is meant for your family, friends, and children (if you have them or choose to have them), NOT for men. 

Why?

One—Nurturing love leads to self-sacrifice. 

Two—Men are incapable of this type of nurturing, self-sacrificing love, thus you will not receive it in return. 

Choosing to impart this kind of love on men therefore leads to more pain, stress, and labor for women. A theme concurrent throughout many relationship subreddits is women feeling overtaxed due to taking on the role of nurturer for men, meanwhile men do not attempt to do the same for their women. This includes domestic and emotional labor. 

The solution is this—Stop nurturing them. Stop fussing over them. These are grown men. They can cook their own food, fold their own laundry, and make their own doctor’s appointments. If they choose to stay up late and they have work tomorrow? Let them. They eat garbage most of the time? Okay. It’s not your job to mother or nurture them. 

I know it’s hard, as women, not to do what we are programmed to do—care, nurture, mother—but you must stop yourself. These wonderful instincts should not be wasted on people who will not ever return the gesture in full. It does not benefit you to act this way toward them, and they will not a) appreciate your efforts or b) respect you for submitting to be their emotional and domestic slave.

Treat him like a man, not your child. Stop yourself from nurturing and sacrificing. Establish this from day one, until the moment he puts a ring on your finger and beyond. Your number one priority should be you and pleasing yourself.",46830,"Save your motherly instincts for your family, friends, or children, NOT MEN.",0,,

Back when I was single, I had casual sex with hot but value men. I thought they were good choices because they made me feel validated. They were low value in some way or another so I knew I wouldn’t catch feelings. 

But three years into my relationship and some of them are still slipping in sliding into my DMs and phone messages in between (and during) their failed relationships saying, “YoU sTiLL wItH. YoUr bF?!) knowing damn well I am. 

Three years later I look at these men in disgust. Like did I really give you free access to my body when my bf who does *so much for me* is so grateful to be able to touch it? 

Who gave them this audacity? Well, once upon a time I did. Well reading your stories and watching them make NO effort to improved helped me realize **never again**. 

It made me realize that if I was ever single again, I would need to get *orgasms* from men I permit into my body. 

Why stop at vetting men for having high value when it comes to relationships?

Casual FWBs should be vetted for high **sexual** value if nothing else. Sure sex still “feels good” but if you can’t blow my mind and make my body spasm in ecstasy, you’re not permitted to even *look* at it. I also included the words “decent” men in my title because they need to always treat you with respect. Maybe they’re low value cause they live at home or watch porn, but never compromise your dignity for a LVM. 

Men need to be held accountable, even if it’s regarding casual sex. These are baby making activities ladies. Even “protected” we put our bodies at **severe risk** every time we let a guy inside of us. Let’s be smart. Let’s be strategic. Let’s be selective and let’s make it fucking worth it.

Says the man who invites his ex to plan a date for the women vying to marry him where she tells the story of all the good sex they had together. Acts shocked that said ex ends up crying over him and the other women are upset.

Just a reminder that you don't have to put up with nonsense like this and be the ""cool chick"". If a guy displays bad judgement and has loose boundaries with his territorial ex, it's totally cool to say ""Wow! I love that you guys have such a close friendship! Good for you!

And I also like to observe how the alpha females behave. You'll see there are a few women who come from strong families, are really self assured and confident and beautiful. They don't seem to question their worth and many of the other girls hate them. The insecure girls you can tell right away because instead of having a relaxed gaze, they seem antsy and are looking left and right, comparing themselves. They also tend to complain about other women.

I don't come from a good family and have lacked confidence in the past but I've learned how to not give those things away about me, by grooming and dressing well and being confident, friendly and unconcerned about competition. These shows are good for studying if you can't survive the cringe and nonsense omg...",46821,Is anyone else watching the Bachelor? 🙄,0,,

I'm weighing options between two guys, and feel like a sleaze, or psychopath, or coward. If I am, call me out on it please. Gonna ramble, but please give some feedback or opinions or advice if willing. Thank you.

I've been in an rough relationship with a guy for a couple years, and after being introduced to FDS, I'm ready to walk away soon if I can't see a future where he treats me right. There's a younger guy who I've known for a couple years, and have recently been spending more time with due to joining the same group, who seems HV, but is also very young. 

For the guy I'm with, I have feelings for him, we call it love. I wasn't even entertaining the idea of giving another guy a chance. After an argument on New Years (because I've changed and become insanely critical, thanks FDS) he threatened to break up with me and blocked me for the night. Since then, I haven't felt the sense of devotion that kept me rejecting everyone else and certain I wanted. If threatening to end the relationship was that easy for him, I don't consider it serious. I told him I won't tell people I'm still seeing him until I'm certain we'll work together. And he has become more distant.

The sex is absolutely insane, and with how sexually high maintenance I am, that is a big deal. I truly don't believe I could find another guy as good in bed, or absurdly well endowed. He's comfortable to joke with, model level handsome, and tall. He says he wants a relationship that leads to marriage and kids, but won't marry until he's 26 and off his father's insurance (he has costly treatments to manage a genetic disorder). However, he's stated he's comfortable with his life as is (finishing up an average 90k/yr degree before some internship), doesn't read, spends hours and hours playing videogames every day, and has literally dozens of exes in our area. I'm the first person he's dated longer than three months. We're about the same age (24). His behavior, respect, and approach to communication and the relationship has improved greatly over the last year, but I don't find it satisfactory yet, and I'm very uncertain how truly committed he is to making things work.

For the younger guy, I'd just like to say I only recently found out his age is 19. He works full time 40k a year, helps to care for his large family, is still a virgin, is tall and cute and bearded but in a less model-esque way, literate, polite, and reminds me of myself at his age. Our interactions always feel refreshing to me, and he told me he never feels more constantly lost on how to respond in conversations than with me - he clarified it was fine. When we met, he wore a promise ring, which he took off last year. He comes from a very religious family (same as me), and wildly awkward. He does make dirty jokes back at people if they initiate though, which I see as a good sign.
Recently, he joined a group I'm a part of, which means we interact a lot more. I'm developing a mild crush, but won't show it. I've rejected a LOT of people througout my life, and can see a lot of common signs he'll ask me out within a year. He's expressed attraction and compliments me, but I won't give an opening, and have been doing my best to create a situation where he can't possibly ask me out (mentioning how  I can't date a teenager, always being around other people, implying I may be seeing someone.) I've considered telling him to ask me out when he's 21 if he's still single, but it feels so sleazy. I'm not sure if it would be a bad or cruel idea to ""put him on layaway"", and let him develop feelings for me when I am not in any way committed to him, and won't give him a chance later if things can be good my SO. But I don't even know what's going to happen with my SO now, or if I should jump ship before he does.

I would have never done something like this before, as it seems cruel to the one I am with to be prepared to move on. I was always ""ride or die"" in relationships, and thought once you love someone, you should see it through till the end. And it seems cruel to let someone naive and sincere fall for me when I don't have such sincere intentions. 

I've been let down so many times now. I've been abused, cheated on, mislead, and simply can't be sincere, transparent, and good with men or women anymore. I'm too tired of being hurt and disappointed. I just want to have the best I can, and know I can keep them, and they'll be loyal.

If you read all this, and are willing to reply, could you please be the clear head helping clear my head? Thank you.",48636,"Weighing choosing my LTR with a LVM, or giving a chance with a very young possible HVM",0,,

I’m new to this sub but already see how it’s helping me reclaim my power. Like most of you, I’ve had my share of heartache and betrayal and am in the process of breaking lifelong unhealthy patterns in both my dating and day-to-day life. Therapy has been hugely helpful as well as being brutally honest with myself about men and the reality of their intentions. 

That being said, I work in a—unique—environment that often clashes with my FDS principles. 

I’m a dancer—not the ballet kind. 

The club I work at is big city/high volume/intense pressure and many customers are obviously LVM whose egos I have to pander to in order to make a living. Ironically since I’ve been educating myself about FDS I’ve been making more money—basically acting like the goddess I am, refusing to accept scraps, walking away at the first sign of fuckery, and consistently demanding more from these men AND myself. You know, queen shit™️ 

Obviously most men who go to strip clubs are dumpster fires/fuccbois/married scum bags and despite my *I-am-Beyonce-always* strategy I still find myself struggling with the cognitive dissonance. I hate that paying attention to them inflates their ego but I also find power in taking as much money as I can from them. As you can imagine, it’s a mindfuck. 

I don’t want to hate all men but in my years of dancing I’ve met so many and see firsthand just how truly low value most of them are. It’s depressing. 

Please don’t tell me to get another job (this is paying for grad school while I transition to a new career and it’s what works for me right now.) I also genuinely enjoy performing and pole dancing on stage because it brings me joy. I work with some amazing and brilliant business women who deal with zero bullshit and come in here to make their money (and lots of it.) 

My question is: how can I use FDS to keep me sane in an environment that often feels like a writhing old-spice-and corona-drenched snake pit. I have another year or so left before I hang up my shoes and want to make these mofos PAY. I call it asshole tax. 

I know this may be an extreme example but I’ve worked in traditional environments and sadly have come to the conclusion that male entitlement is really rampant in every industry. Although I have to say I’ve been treated better here in the club that I have in any office. Occasionally I meet a unicorn who is kind, understanding, and generous. I know they’re still LVM since they’re usually married but this does give me some hope that they’re not all complete monsters. 

I know, it’s pathetic when the only men who give me hope are the ones cheating on their wives. Sadly this is the environment I am currently immersed in. I’m in therapy btw 🤣

How to stay queenly and keep my eyes on the prize? 

Any tips are appreciated 🙏🏼💗",48625,HVW sex worker: how to stay queenly when you deal with men for a living?,0,,

People always talk about how men are so nice to their female friends because they want to get in their pants, but I just needed to rant about how terrible men are to their ugly female friends.

During my first year of college, I hung out with a group of guys. They would always say I looked like a mom, that I was ugly, fat, stupid, talked too much, etc. And of course, when I called them out, it was always the excuse of them ""just joking"".

I would look around and realize that they had been treating all of these girls so nicely, respectfully, and the only time they ever gave me any shred of respect or kindness was when they were using me as a free therapist. I was looking through my journal entries, and realized how abusive they were to me, and how depressed and sad I was the whole time during these ""friendships"".

Then, I started to branch out in school, left the group chat, and cut out all of those guy ""friends"". They said I was changing and becoming a fake person, but I realized that that wasn't true. What was happening was that  I was changing and becoming a woman who wouldn't put up with shit, who wasn't a pickmeisha, and had some fucking self-respect. I Started learning about boundaries and self-love. I started working out, clearing up my skin, dressing better, and wearing makeup. Not to impress boys, but because I deserved to feel confident and beautiful in who I am.

And let me tell you. These scrotes are really upset. Every (few and far between) chances they get, they try to make passive-aggressive comments and try to diminish who I am and what I am doing (we live on the same dorm floor. But next year I am moving out, so this is not going to be a reality anymore). I realized through this sub that the reason they are upset is that their emotional fidget spinner of a friend who they could pick on for an ego boost has dropped them. And has been better than ever for it.

Moral of the story, watch out for male friends. Either they want to get in your pants, or are trying to use you for something. Unlike female friendships, most men lack the ability to be able to grow strong friendships, give praise, and give warmth. As I look back on all my male friends (I have always been the ""not like other girls. I hang with the dudes"" type girl) I understand now how male friendships are 99/100 a waste of time. Thanks to this sub, I can see it is not just me being crazy, but that these experiences make perfect sense.",48625,"Male ""friends""",0,,

Until last week I was picking to be open and to not “play games”, but his refusal to take our relationship a little more seriously, to tell me that he loves me unless I said it first, and his general cockiness about the fact that I -a woman above his league- is in love with him, made me reconsider my position and I started using some strategy. 


At first it worked. I just withdrew a little and that made him text more. My texts were nice but infrequent, and it worked. We met Tuesday night for drinks and I looked a little better than usual. He called me “the most beautiful lady in this bar” more than once, and generally seemed content. Even stayed pretty late despite the fact that he had a huge day at work the next day (yesterday).


But then... Yesterday, I think for the first time since we met four months ago, I didn’t text him at all and he didn’t text me either. Some days I wouldn’t text but he would. But this time, nothing. No text. Nothing from him. 


I know he had a big day at work yesterday and he’s having a very busy week, but it’s not like he never had those before. 


I’m worried and I don’t know what to say or do about it. I was so confident prior to this, but it’s like he outsmarted me and has flipped the script on me. He was supposed to languish, and now I’m the one who’s starting to freak out. My friend told me to stick it out and not text him until he texts me, and even then to leave him on read, but I know myself well and I know I will get very heartbroken about this very soon if he doesn’t text.


We have plans for a date Saturday night, so I know one of us will have to contact the other at some point. 


Please help! Kind words and advice welcome. 
Also I’m new here so I’m hoping I won’t get a bunch of “just talk to him!” comments.",48619,Dying to text him,0,,

Yesterday, this regular couple comes in. They are late 40s early 50s, clearly have been together for some time, and I'm pretty sure live together. They are both extremely nice, super fun to serve, and the guy likes to make those standard serving jokes such as ""it was awful lollll"" when they have clearly eaten everything.

So yesterday I drop off the bill and they both reach for their wallets and he takes the bill but she goes, ""you got last time, are you sure you don't want me to get this one?"" and he goes, ""no, I'll grab this one..... But you have to give me sex later."" I literally walked away from the table and pretended to check on another table because I was so grossed out. Then I could hear him say, ""ah! She walked away.""

YEAH! Of course I walked away. Not because you told your partner you wanted sex but because you equated paying $36 dollars for drinks and appetizers to being ENTITLED to sex.

I was so grossed out and horrified and now can't look at this guy the same way anymore.",48619,"$36 is the going price for sex, apparently!",0,,
