I have no idea.

Literally. As if having children ""for men"" is some sort of a financial transaction. As if mother's need to be compensated for going through labour and birth. And whenever the guys in that group mentioned that she could just hold off having children entirely by using birth control, she mentioned accidental pregnancies and then threw a tantrum about how the ""emotional hardship"" associated with aborting a child-----men must obviously compensate for this by paying for all their dates (and obviously they must also pay *for* the abortion). She also mentioned that women catch all sorts of STIs because of ""filthy men"" so they must compensate em for that (literally the audacity, mentioning ""falling victim"" STIs in a subreddit for gay men when their community has been hit so badly by STIs) Basically a lot of her logic was that, women get pregnant accidentally or get an STI which the man is obviously responsible for (the woman's own improper use of birth control and protection can obviously be excused), so the man must pay for the majority of their shared expenses.

That is exactly why you got drawn in. I myself joined this subreddit because my own relationship was going through a rocky phase. Most of the current FDS newbies are fresh out of abusive relationships or at least relationships that were not physically or emotionally fulfilling. They have a lot of anger and frustration locked up inside. I guess we probably expected that these women will offer us consolation and counsel along with a safe place to vent. Instead as soon as you step in, they just tell you whatever you want to hear so that you feel validated and then they start brainwashing you. Obviously there are women who call out the bullshit and that's why they have created labels like ""Pickmeisha"" and ""Cockholm Syndrome"". Thankfully my beliefs about going 50/50 in a relationship (in case of both expenses and household chores management) directly countered with their core beliefs, so I was able to make the decision to leave easily. I'm literally a textbook ""Pickmeisha"" according to FDS.

Okay lol first of all how DARE you bring your trans-phobic bullshit here by saying their experience of dating and sex is not like that of a cis-woman's. I know a few trans women and it's not that different at all. Trans women are women and they always will be.

Please don't call yourself a feminist if you're not willing to support them. As I said before, trans women go through enough crap in their lives, they certainly don't need a sub undermining their sexuality purely because of what genitals they have.

The ONLY thing I can think of is a post where a guy rented a truck and took his girlfriend to the drive in movie. The OP posted it as an example of a HVM. Some people on there started saying it's actually low value, that a drive-in movie is horrible first date, they expect to be taken to a fancy restaurant etc etc etc. The guy had obviously been in a long term relationship with the girl. It wasn't a first date. Many people agreed with me, so unless the mods banned everyone (including OP) for thinking it was a sweet date, the only other thing I can think of are my comments saying that people who expect to be treated to Michelin starred restaurants and always given diamonds and luxury brand gifts, etc tend to be people who grew up with no class and usually having nothing, and now they want to escape their humble roots and demand that every bite they eat is from a fancy restaurant. I even said there is nothing wrong with coming from humble roots, or with being financially disadvantaged, but it's tacky and off-putting to start acting like you're too good to eat something that doesn't cost $40+ an entree for your every meal, especially when it's a long term relationship during a pandemic. Even billionaires sometimes stay in, order pizza, and watch netflix. So, I'm guessing I got banned for saying that demanding that every moment of your existence MUST \* star is the mark of someone who is classless.

It's such a horrible and disgusting attitude to have, because you're down on people based on how much money they have. I'm sure tons of poor women who love to be able to afford fancy meals for all their meals, but they can't afford them. It doesn't make them low value as people.

It amazes me that TERFs keep acting like they have any understanding of science beyond the sixth grade level, because only a sixth grader would subscribe to the simplistic and debunked beliefs of sex corresponding to gender, and of sex being determined completely by chromosomes.  TERFs are the ones saying women are defined by ""being feminine"" (whatever the fuck that means), that women are defined by their ability to produce ""small gametes"" (this one makes me laugh because some trans men have ovaries, and TERFs in the past have said that trans men shouldn't be allowed in women's bathrooms because they aren't women, but then can't seem to extend that courtesy to trans women?  Hmmm I wonder why).

Also your use of the word ""sane"" is rather ableist.

Are you really such a snowflake you can't handle a positive post about trans people without commenting ""oMfG tHe liBruLzZzzz""?!

Did you not read the sidebar before commenting here?  Transphobes are not allowed.

Get off mumsnet and your ""gender critical"" ""feminist"" forums and maybe go on Google Scholar and read some actual science about trans people and their relationship to their gender and associated physiological changes.  Everything radfems have told you is a lie.  And you are a piece of shit for not bothering to acknowledge that trans women are an oppressed minority.  You have the gall to say we gaslight people while being part of a transphobic cult that boots you out at the slightest disagreement?  I got a good laugh out of that one.

And don't bother linking ""news articles"" bashing trans women (like SOME FDS MODS *cough* we all know who those are *cough* did).  You'll only find a few of those anyway, whereas if you Google ""trans rights fact sheet"" you'll find about 200+ references' worth of actual unbiased scientific research (of course, there are a whole lot more of those than just 200 since we don't know most of the biochemical pathways of sex determination in humans).  I've read them all because I spend some time punching shitty TERFs like you online.  We don't debate trans rights here. 
 
Also, TERFs seem to ignore the simple fact that language changes over time.  And you all had no problem with trans women being in women's spaces in the 60s or so, until that stupid lesbian separatism ""omg male essence bad"" shit came along that excluded bi women, trans women, and non binary people from the wlw community.  Why are you bringing it back now?  We're not pawns to take your frustration out on from being oppressed by cishet men.  Quit punching down and grow a fucking spine.  How are edgy little transphobic shits like you any different from the sexist dipshits we have to deal with irl every day?  Newsflash, you're not.  I detest you.  Transphobes like you are nothing but the shit I wipe off my shoes before stepping inside my house on a bad day.

Also, it's not ""transwomen"" it's trans women with a space in between.  Trans is an adjective, like tall or short or thin.  Duh.

Just this month two french feminists published books advocate for the hatred of men. The first book name is ""i hate men"" the second is called ""the lesbian genius"" she say she is lesbian by choice. she is an elected official for a feminist party ( the ecologists )in the council of Paris. i never seen feminists condemn misandry.

Robin Morgan who was the editor of Ms. Magazine the biggest feminist magazine said ""I feel that ‘man-hating’ is an honorable and viable political act""

A lot of feminist leaders said openly that they don't read books written by men !! imagine if someone say he/she won't read written by jews ? that would nazi ? this is why the term ""feminazi"" exist.

In 2015, the University of York announced its intention to observe International Men’s Day. A torrent of criticism ensued, including an open letter to the university claiming that such a day “does not combat inequality, but merely amplifies existing, structurally imposed, inequalities”. The university cancelled the plans and affirmed that “the main focus of gender equality work should continue to be on the inequalities faced by women”. In contrast, its observation of International Women’s day a few months earlier was a week long affair with more than 100 events.

The event was reserved for men's health, at the same day a male student committed suicide in the same university. but feminists canceled the event saying that ""Equality For All"" is misogynistic rhetoric !!

Is this really true though?

There's this vibe of ""you need to hate men to join us"" that pulls people back into the cult.

&gt; They are WGTOW. 

I don't really think this is a good thing.  Oh and notice how in all portrayals of WGTOW spaces, none of the women are ever BIPOC (if you go to the subreddits for wgtow, that is).  It's like they don't even remember that WOC and NBPOC exist. :)

1. If a woman doesn’t want a broke man it’s fine, yeah I’m sure there are some sweethearts that are struggling financially, I think it’s okay to date them provided they provide a LOT of other value. I think our female natures want someone who can provide, it’s sort of biology. 

2. I agree with you here. From my browsing it seems like the sub has a lot of deeply damaged women who are looking for an outlet for their anger at their pattern of toxic relationships. I’ve noticed they seems to assume the absolute worst of all men and situations. It’s very sad, and hints at poor emotional health. The problem is that they’re refusing to take accountability for this and projecting the blame on men and anybody who disagrees with their philosophy. 

By refusing to accept that some of these patterns could change if they worked on themselves, they’re essentially saying there’s nothing that can be done about it and perpetuating this victim mentality. Instead of focusing on themselves they continue to obsess about men and the ways men have made them unhappy. I believe that would repel a lot of men they’re probably wishing they could attract.

[],,Alma00019,,,[],,,,text,t2_3yxbc7mm,False,False,[],"1. I think it depends on many factors. The truth is that they ARE a lot of men in dead end jobs or no jobs with no ambition, even before the pandemic. If you're a student, dating another poor student doesn't make him a LVM or you a pick-me. If someone has fallen on hard times, despite their efforts, that's not a LVM. Someone who is just starting out their career and doesn't have much money isn't necessarily LVM. A serious and legit entrepreneur who is just starting out on a shoe-string budget isn't necessarily a LVM. I think they're whole idea of a man taking out a woman on a lavish first date grew out of frustration from men refusing to go on dates with women. Millennials and younger are notorious for this. It's like pulling teeth trying to get a guy to ask you out, take you on a nice date (""nice"" means pleasant time, not necessarily fancy restaurant). Instead, they ask you to come over to netlfix and chill and to pick up beer on the way. The point isn't for the man to take the woman out on crazy expensive dates, but to put in the effort and show that he likes her, he cares about her, he wants to show that he cares about the relationship. If a man doesn't have a lot of money, a nice ice cream date, or dinner at an inexpensive place or a picnic is ok. But then this snowballed into the expensive dinners FDS demands now. Another thing is that after a certain age, if a man truly cannot afford to take a woman out to more than ice cream or coffee, then he really needs to be focusing on getting his financial and career situation in order, rather than trying to date women. If a man is in a dire financial situation, yet is trying to date women, then I do question his motives. I personally want a committed, exclusive, long term relationship that will lead to marriage and children. A man who can't afford more than coffee won't be able to afford marriage, a stable home, and children. So this man likely isn't looking for anything serious, but is more likely looking for casual sex, which I'm not interested in. And even if he WAS looking for marriage, then I question his judgement: looking for a wife when he can't even afford dinner for two at an inexpensive restaurant. I need my partner to be intelligent and pragmatic. Someone who spends time looking dates instead of working on improving their own life does not exhibit those qualities. Again, this is after a certain age. It's different for college students and recent college grads because they don't have a career or have barely started one. So I think there is a seed of truth, but the FDS blows it up into ridiculous proportions.
2. Yes, I would imagine HVM would be turned off by FDS. I don't think they are turned off by a woman having standards and boundaries - both in dating and in life in general.

The problem here is that you're just seeing it as ""withholding sex"", and the fact you can't get past that is skewing your view of the matter.

Yes, but withholding sex as a blanket advice for every woman isn't effective. Condoms break because of improper use and storage, which is to be prevented regardless of relationship status.

&gt; Especially if the guy is in denial about his actual size, which is something I experienced and led to the condom breaking multiple times throuought our relationship. 

If a guy uses protection irresponsibly, he should be avoided for all kinds of relationships. Withholding sex until there's trust becomes pointless because he's showing you that he can't be trusted with these things at all.

&gt; So yes, pregnancy is a risk because not every woman is going to want to take bc, and **STDs are a huge risk of course**.  

Withholding sex until a committed relationship protects from STDs that could be contracted AFTER the relationship is formed, and only if he's monogamous. The thing is that the ""wait to have sex"" advice rarely comes with the suggestion to get tested before having sex with a new partner. If he carries STDs from a past relationship chances are you'll get infected too. You're at a higher risk of contracting an infection from a diseased person that you're sleeping with regularly than from a diseased person that you sleep with once or twice while using protection.

Moreover, just because the risk of an infection is lower for men, doesn't mean that men can't get infected. In fact, that's the point, that heterosexual women contract STDs from sleeping with men.

The media has given both genders unrealistic expectations in finding a partner physically and emotionally. IF we don't feel butterflies then they aren't right for me, if they don't meet conventional physical ideals then they aren't good enough. All that this has done is left a generation (millennials) of lonely zombies too afraid  and too idealistic to find a partner.

As a man, it seems like it's not enough to make 60K a year, you have to make a 100K yr. It's not enough to be a good husband, Dad, and citizen. You have to be an alpha male. And it's lame to only sleep with one women. Men are not happy with the current expectations, that have been forced on them, that women are shamed into accepting by the media. Trust me men are just as unhappy with the current environment.  

It's funny that you wrote this because just the other day I was thinking men and women are at each others throats, especially on social media. The constant twitter war, the subs that call each gender out,  the men oriented YT channels that blame women, dating gurus, red pill...etc . Culminating  in various subgroups such as  Incels, MGTOW, WGTOW,FDS...etc. These communities have emerged to cope with the growing divide between men and women. And I just find all of this sad, because we  literally want the same thing, that is each other yet somehow we have lost touch. 

As for an answer, I don't really see one. Our perspectives are so warped that we don't even know what's real or not.

Are there shitty men out there who will refuse to pull their weight in relationships? Absolutely. The answer isn't to gold-dig for a ""HVM"" and do everything to tear down that man's self-worth so that he sacrifices everything for you; the answer is to find the man whose skillsets complement your own in a way that you both feel enhanced by the relationship. 

In the broadest of strokes in today's society, men need to learn about emotional labor and housekeeping, and women are generally required to earn their living to an extent that wasn't expected of them 50 years ago. Of course there are exceptions; some women are happy to bear the burden of emotional labor, and some men are happy to be the breadwinner of the family.

Honestly, there are many bits of advice on relationships that have no gender - find your hobbies, learn how to engage in interesting conversation, don't be a flake, communicate, etc. A proper dating strategy resource should focus at least as much on those gender-neutral strategies as they do on the gender-adversarial issues like the ones above.",,1611024985,,{},gjsfklr,False,t3_l09qwo,False,True,t3_l09qwo,/r/exfds/comments/l09qwo/why_i_even_though_i_am_not_part_of_fds_i_think/gjsfklr/,1611144158,10,True,False,exfds,t5_2hokp6,,0,[],,,,1

It's entirely possible in this day and age to earn the salary a man does if you find the right job. Not all men earn a lot more than us women, some earn about the same and just cause they earn more doesn't make you entitled to their money. Also men are expected to be financially independent and pay their own bills so it's just fair that women do too, and anyway, why would anyone deliberately want to be dependent on a man financially? That's like signing away some of your financial freedom girl. Also the women on FDS expect their man to look hot too, which mean they have to work out or keep their facial hair neat and trimmed and keep up a good haircut and hygiene, same as women. Also men don't expect 10 layers of makeup, in fact most men find it off putting if you spend hours in the bathroom and cake your face full of makeup until you become unrecognizable. Most men like a simple natural look which isn't hard or especially time consuming to achieve at all unless you look like a gnome. Also if you're not into sex and view it as a negative thing you don't really wanna do, and not something you enjoy, why you in a sexual relationship in the first place?? You're supposed to be in a sexual relationship because you see it as something that adds to your life, something you enjoy and benefit, not just something that is for men or to please men for some sort of monetary reward, that's gross. My God, and on top of everything you expect a man to pay for your dates? Why? Cause you don't wanna put in the work to earn as much as a man does?

it's just that being a part of that subreddit is so cringey.  but i'm definitely more peaceful without having to talk to most current FDS users besides the ones that show up here occasionally wanting to defend their ""beautiful high value fellow FDSers"" like shut the fuck up nobody cares omgg

okay i should probably stop typing before i start rambling about them again.  it's interesting how i was only on there for about 4 months tops, but i'm still trying to undo some of the shitty platitudes they threw at me.  i was watching this documentary about scientology yesterday and it suddenly hit me how FDS can be as harmful emotionally when you get indoctrinated.  even the pyramidal structure of information flow within their cult is analogous to scientology's, like first they rein you in with ""feminist"" sounding optimistic platitudes, then they turn you against men, then they turn you against trans women, then they create this atmosphere of fear around trans women even though the chances you'll meet a trans woman in your lifetime are almost zero (since they make up less than 1% of the total world population right now), then they use that to convince you that they're the only group of people you're safe with, then they ""ask"" you to join their discord and provide them with your real name, address, and a fucking **voice recording.**   like what the fuck is up with that?  it pisses me off that all these women (some of whom may be gender non-conforming and can't express that part of themselves because FDS tells them they won't be ""high value"" if they do that) don't realize this.  i guess that's a realization they'll have to come at themselves.  we can just help from the sidelines.  

i do feel proud of myself for being able to leave.  and quite frankly, once i really introspected and realized that FDS didn't know my guy friends as well as i did (usually when someone spouts misogynistic rhetoric i just drop them, i don't have time for all that bullshit) and read a few posts about FDS that weren't *from* FDS, it tool me only a week to properly leave.  it was a little surprising to me how clear-headed i felt afterwards.  i mean, it's not like my circumstances magically improved, but i stopped molding myself to what other people wanted me to be.

like, you don't need to be an FDSer to be feminist.  in fact their particular flavour of fake feminism is just being afraid of phalluses for some reason (genuine question: if you're afraid of dicks why do you wanna fuck cis men? lmao) and of trans people for whatever bogus reasons they've made up in their heads.  they just cite the jessica yaniv example and ignore the fact that most trans women want nothing to do with her.  FDS is a bunch of hypocrites.

okay rant over.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; What's the intention here? This is someone who by her own admission was abused. She's dealing with a lot of trauma. She's emotionally unavailable. And who are we to say ""you aren't happy""? She may well be happy with this arrangement. It allows to her to have some level of male company without being heavily invested or worrying about abuse. Perhaps that's not the most healthy thing on planet earth, I don't know, I'm not qualified to say. However, I know sometimes people have other preferences in their life. This is at worst two emotionally unavailable people keeping each other at arm's length. Maybe I'm going soft here, but I don't see the point in laughing at her. 

Of course, FDS was going in on ""she can't actually be happy"". I had the top comment and then I got banned lol. The problem I kept seeing was this insistence that the preferences of women there were universal - there is literally no other way to be happy except to be with who the kind of men they idealize (and it is in an ideal). They have a cartoonish view of the rich to boot. It's laughable. Maybe that's not your idea of a fulfilling relationship, but women who have gone through abuse tend to value safety over excitement.

I don't hate anyone or want anybody to get hurt in any way nor do I ask anybody for anything, however I myself am guilty of contributing to the ""exposing of female nature"", as you have so put it, by uploading my own screenshots of other subreddits, partly because I am fascinated by the bizarre things that go on in the heads of some people, and partly because it is nice to see what other like-minded people think.

This inherently doesn't sound bad until you spend 5 minutes browsing the subreddit. Sure there are the occasional posts asking about career advice, the occasional post about travel that gets stickied, the occasional post about motorcycles or cars or something like that, but the vast majority of posts are obviously about bitching about women or taking screen grabs and talking about how ridiculous they are.

Usually when this gets pointed out the follow-up argument is that it is ""exposing true female nature"" but I view this as a cop out. Sometimes a guy gets frustrated or wants to vent or thinks that some hardcore progressive thing has gone too far and it's fun to poke fun at. It's like junk food, you know it's not good for you but sometimes it's comforting, and I imagine that this is true for women on the other side of the fence in their own way with FDS.

""Women never tried to blackmail me into sending nudes.

Women don't speak over me when I'm trying to say something.

The person who leaked my bikini pics to 4chan wasn't a lady.

The pedophiles who targeted me when I was 16, were not women.

A female friend never violated my physical boundaries.

I don't have to worry about how I dress in front of my female relatives.

Women never tried to dox me and search for my house on Google Earth.

Women never broke my heart with no regrets.

No woman has ever ghosted me.

No girl has ever tried to drug my drink at a nightclub.

No girl has ever inappropriately groped me"".

&amp;#x200B;

1. Its very unlikely a woman would blackmail with nudes, but baby trapping is a thing. Both things are unlikely to deal with to you as an individual. The mindset of thinking one crime is worse than the other is marginal in group bias. I'll argue both sides of the margin for the sake of fairness. A. Men are more likely to black mail. B. Baby trapping is far worse than nudes on the internet no one gives a shit about.
2. I have most certainly been spoken over by overly enthusiastic female conversationalists. I have also spoken over others. Mansplaining actually has scientific studies on it which imply an inappropriate name. Men are more likely to interrupt a woman than men are to men, however men are less likely to interrupt a woman compared to women talking to woman.
3. Involuntary pornography is illegal, I don't share nudes of girls received in DM personally, but it does happen. Women also enjoy going in depth with other women verbally about what men are like. Once again marginal in group bias.
4. First off its pronounced ephebophile. Also r/mensrights has plenty of stories of women doing the same to men. It would be impossible to compare numbers as crimes related to age of consent likely go unreported. Per marginal in group bias arguments. 1. Men are more likely to attempt. 2. Women are more likely to succeed. Either complain number 1 makes men worse than women, or number 4 here makes men worse. You only get to pick one though.
5. Men are more likely to be sexual predators. Women also commit some crimes more than others. r/pussypass and r/pussypassdenied will argue that women are much more likely to hit men, than men hit women. The comparison of the two is again prone to marginal in group bias, but there are certainly female dominated crimes.
6. Women go naked in front of each other yes. Umm, this is men's fault? We wear clothes and dress differently when trying to attract too.
7. Is she seriously trying to claim that no woman doxxes? Or that she even knows the gender of the doxxer?
8. Huh? She's trying to claim women never break hearts, on a sub literally devoted to nexting guys overly infatuated with them? Ok....
9. I don't get it is she bi? Women literally promote ghosting men and in general on reddit, while men say its better to deliver a single hit that hurts once.

So when a woman enters a relationship and becomes the manager of the above jobs, she expects the man to contribute equally but that's really hard since 'men's jobs' (taking out the bin, fixing a car, changing the light bulb, assembling furniture) are very infrequent and are not daily tasks like how cooking is for example (3x a day) or child care (all day) or cleaning (every day). Women then expect men to pay for everything so they can feel some sort of relief and feel they are being compensated. This is also the case with sex. It might seem equal in today's society but you'd be surprised at how ignorant men are about women's sexuality. It's rare to find a man who really understands how a clitoris works or that women need foreplay so even sex becomes a chore for most since 70% do not reach orgasm through penetration alone. I don't like a lot of things about that sub but this one I can understand.

Because that Center you're talking about isn't an authority on hate subreddits either (I haven't even heard of it, actually, do you have a link?).  

We aren't aiming to ""convert"" people.  This is just a safe space for people to discuss how they've been hurt by TERF cults in the past.  Reddit admins have acknowledged r/AgainstHateSubreddits in the past, it's the most reliable resource on Reddit to find hate subreddits.  AHS has already covered TERF and TERF adjacent subreddits using logical arguments and studies.  I'll reiterate that we're not out here to convince people FDS is bad, any reasonable individual would know that themselves, this discourse is all over the place, on Twitter, Facebook, actual studies, etc.  You can type ""trans exclusionary radical feminism"" into Google Scholar and you'll get a bunch of hits.  Most of us have other things to do, and personally I don't want to waste my time trying to convince someone FDS is a TERF subreddit if they aren't open to reading well-documented TERF post compilations (from FDS) themselves.  We literally have disgruntled FDSers reporting screenshot posts here, taken from their own sub, as misinformation.  And we get the occasional butthurt FDS mod too.  If they weren't a hate subreddit, they would ignore us entirely because we wouldn't be worth their time.  TwoX mods don't go around brigading random subs like FDSers do.

(And by the way, AHS also has anti-MGTOW posts.  So they're not the stereotypical incel basement dwellers. I've made a post on AGS about TERFs myself.  I can state categorically that I'm not a basement dweller.  I live in a very well ventilated house.)

I can point you to some off-Reddit resources though.  Amy Dyess' articles and Gemma Stone's Medium articles are good.  Pink News has some articles about TERF recruiting tactics.  And I follow a bunch of Twitter accounts like GC Homophobia, GC Racism etc.  If you look through their posts and compare those with FDS posts, you'll notice some similarities.  The issue with debunking TERF rhetoric is that it's so filled with dogwhistles that it takes a lot of time to debunk even one paragraph.  Any attempt to call them out is seen as misogyny (if other trans-inclusive cis women so it, they say we have internalized misogyny...lmaoo) so that's usually where the discussion stops because most not-TERF folks realize by then that there's no point engaging in actual conversation with a TERF.

Most Indian women you see on FDS have jobs, are Hindu, some even live in the US (which doesn't have universal healthcare and has terrible class disparity yet somehow isn't classified as a third world country because... reasons and imperialism I guess).  I don't remember the specifics of what you said in your comment, but I did pick up on an eagerness on your part to blame men from all these countries for these women on FDS being extremists.  These aren't your run-of-the-mill occasional ""i hate men"" Facebook shitposter feminists who want to vent after a tiring day being catcalled outside.  These are women who are homophobic, racist (because White women on the sub who are racist homophobic TERFs agree that they're oppressed, so they feel the need to agree with them.  If you read studies about 60s White separatist feminism, you'll get a better idea of what I'm talking about here, I can't articulate it properly) and TERFs.  The only excuse they have to be hateful is themselves.  Don't you think, given the abuse I've been through in my life (since you took the liberty to see my post history), I should have become a man hating ""feminist"" as well?  On FDS, the hatred directed towards Indian men (for example) comes from a White TERF perspective.  Indian women (like myself) tend to agree with that hatred because 1.  there's no denying we are oppressed, obviously and 2.  we don't want to get kicked out of FDS for defending men of colour from that kind of racist hatred, because FDS labels that as excessive male sympathizing.  There are very few active spaces for Indian women on Reddit, and most of us have experienced sexual harassment to some degree, which is what FDS capitalizes on as a TERF recruiting ground.

In your comment, you've generalized POC culture entirely, which is racist.  That's what I was trying to get at.  It's one thing to acknowledge nuances (which, again, you are not doing because you just painted us all with a very broad brush.  Black women, Latino women, South Asian women, Native American women, East Asian women, Middle Eastern women etc all face different kinds of misogyny and even that depends on a whole lot of other factors) and another to say something that makes all POC cultures look the same.  Usually the racist evangelical Christian patriarchy we have to face when we emigrate to Western countries is also upheld by White women (just look at voting stats by demographic in the recent US election).

I get that you're concerned I'm a moderator because of my past (well, and present) and you seem to insinuate that being anxious makes me somehow unfit to moderate a subreddit...which is a very ableist and ageist notion, but let's not go there.  I'm intentionally sitting out my ""drunk on power"" phase of moderating here.  It'll go away in a few days when the novelty wears off.  I already got called a ""White man's whore"" because I decided to remove some polygynous dickhead's comment because he thought I wouldn't date him because (apparently) he was Black.  Sweet Jesus Reddit has really done a great job toning down on the hate speech, huh. /s 

The reason I said pro FDS brownie points was that you are regurgitating the exact rhetoric not-White TERFs have used on FDS to hate on South Asian trans women.  I'm sure you can understand why I wouldn't be too happy about that.  I'm genderfluid and I take that shit personally because it literally fuels hate based on identity.  It's very triggering to read something like that because TERFs have sent me hate online and have tried to dox me in the past.  I have no interest in sympathizing with them because they are the kinds of women who uphold the patriarchy in South Asian countries while claiming to fight against it.

I do have a question for you though: are you White?  Because so far I haven't seen any BIPOC feminist woman have this unintersectional a take, neither in real life nor on major subs like TwoX.",,1605159072,,{},gc0i99y,False,t3_jsllf8,False,True,t1_gc0deuq,/r/exfds/comments/jsllf8/fds_women_should_take_a_look_at_themselves_with/gc0i99y/,1605159771,1,True,False,exfds,t5_2hokp6,,0,[],,,,0

 I can see how this advice is useful for women in undeveloped and third world countries where they fight deep rooted misogyny every day. You can tell which ones are from these countries due to the abundance of low quality men they talk about/date and the low education rates, poor hygiene issues, and little availability of a career (however this is also typical of immigrants in the states and POC because they come from these countries). However, I can tell which ones are from the states because they are what we would call ""welfare queens"" because they leach off one system or another. They have this constant need to validate themselves because, in the states, black women are usually rated fairly low for attractiveness and desirability. But I can also tell if they are immigrants to the states because of their internalized misogyny and cultural differences with American men.  They have expectations to be taken care of as a vestige of their previous culture but can't reconcile the women's liberation movement here in America.

So I looked at her profile, found out her “intellectually gifted” daughter is having sex and was caught with magnum condoms in her possessions and mocked her and told her she’ll be doing amateurish low budget porn like OnlyFans in 3 years when she turns 18. 

As for not caring whether I’m black or not, here’s my little question to you, how many ethnic men have you dated. I’m willing to bet it’s a big fat ZERO. I on the other hand have had sexual experiences with women from practically every race (western &amp; Eastern European, Indian, Chinese, Latina) and dated women from all parts of Africa (North, South, West, East and Central). 

So I’ll rest well at night knowing your racist ass would never consider me anyway.

I noticed their ""XY"" not allowed policy. Before I saw this, I thought their ""female-only space"" policy was inclusive of trans-women. Now I feel disappointed, since trans-women also experience misogyny from both men and women. Trans-women also struggle a lot in the dating scene because of transphobia and misogynistic hate crimes, and could benefit from **some** advice FDS has to offer (that isn't transphobic). 

Another point - even though I don't find sex-work empowering and find it mostly exploitative/inhumane, I don't like to see FDS members dunk on sex-workers and sex-work. This is because sex-workers already face so much stigma and have even more difficulty getting out of the industry, and the last thing sex-workers need is to be derailed for simply trying to make a living/survive.

I mean I'd say, if you're conflicted about the right path for you, just learn what you picked up from FDS on dealing with timewasters and looking out for red-flags and do your own thing. Take all the time you need to heal from your ex, especially if he was a narcissist. 

I was very taken aback when I got banned because I was on board with a lot of FDS' general principles. I was never comfortable with the idea of the guy being a provider in a relationship because I grew up in a conservative household and I saw having financial power gave more scope to be abusive. So I'm all for doing everything equally in a relationship. One thing I never got about FDS was they said the man should provide but then the relationship as a whole should be equal? Seemed quite antithetical.

I'm currently going through a no sex phase myself and I understand why some women would be like that. But personally I could never shame anyone for wanting to do things like casual sex because it's not really my sex life to comment on. I got told by one girl from FDS I'd get date raped because I used to sleep around at the start of college.
