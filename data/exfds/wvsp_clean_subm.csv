So today I meditated. Just finished 30minutes ago. I meditated with some positive energy music with headphones and with my amethyst crystal (this is the only crystal I have right now. I've had it for years and only now decided to get into witchcraft).

I was holding my crystal (charged it earlier with positive energy sounds) and for the first few minutes it felt like something was being pulled out of me when I breathed out. Then afterwards I felt calm and at peace, like I was in the clouds. Was negative energy being pulled out of me while I meditated?

We can start an animal rehabilitation program and care for injured wildlife. 

We can have book clubs and dance parties. We can make up our own yoga that pairs each pose with affirming self-love statements about our miraculous human bodies. 

We can build a hot tub out of a round horse trough - I've seen it done.

We can vote on if we want to let feminist men in on our fun or keep it a women identified community. 

We can do anything... if we say no to the nuclear family trap and instead share resources, space, heartspace, and time with each-other!

THE SHORTEST DAY BY SUSAN COOPER 

So the shortest day came, and the year died,

And everywhere down the centuries of the snow-white world

Came people singing, dancing,

To drive the dark away.

They lighted candles in the winter trees;

They hung their homes with evergreen;

They burned beseeching fires all night long

To keep the year alive,

And when the new year’s sunshine blazed awake

They shouted, reveling.

Through all the frosty ages you can hear them

Echoing behind us—Listen!!

All the long echoes sing the same delight,

This shortest day,

As promise wakens in the sleeping land:

They carol, feast, give thanks,

And dearly love their friends,

And hope for peace.

And so do we, here, now,

This year and every year.

All 3 of them. All. Three. Of. Them. And my Aunts.

Let's start with my Safti. She's rather whimsical and fun, and gives off an odd magical energy. She'd make up and still makes up little songs that meant absolutely nothing. They never fail to make anyone smile. Seriously, I have never seen someone upset if she starts singing those (maybe) meaningless little songs. Plus, I found a few witchy symbols on the top of her chest of drawers (which I think is her alter). She has a little brown dog named Koli who is incredibly well-behaved. I think that Koli could be her familiar.

My other Grandmother is Haitian, and is more serious. She practices more Christian-type things, praying, that sort of thing. She also has incantations and things. Once, when I was a kid, i had this really bad headache. My Grandmother, she keeps Holy Water in little medicine bottles (I once caught her putting powders in it). She took some of the ""Holy Water"" and a black brush out and painted something (I now suspect it was a sigil) on my forehead. My headache stopped almost immediately. I went to her church once. It has Holy Water in it. I looked at it, I smelled it. It's nothing like the stuff my Grandmother has. I think she practices Vodou.

Then there's the last one, my Grandma Vicki. She's technically my Step-Grandmother, but I digress. She keeps a very well-maintained garden. There are odd little books in the attic, and she paints too. I saw some witchy symbols in her paintings. Her garden is always blooming, and pests tend to stay away from it. I think she might be an Earth Witch, or something like that.

And then there's my Aunt Sarah. She's like my Safti, but a little less whimsical. She's a crafty sort of person, and making things. Well, I found a spell jar in a bathroom. And candles. And a little bottle cap with resin in it. Embedded in the resin is a pentogram. 

And last but not least, Aunt Tamar. I am CONVINCED she's clairvoyant. She always seems one step ahead of life. Once, when I was younger, we were making spaghetti together. The pot (full of boiling water) got overturned, and I was going to get directly splashed. But my aunt pulled me out of the way. Here's the thing: she pulled me out JUST BEFORE the pot fell. And I remember she kinda spaced out the minute or so before the pot fell. Yeah. That's just one example, I have a few more.

Add to that that I've started having out-of-body experiences at night and I think you see that I have an odd little dilemma.

So yes. I think there are 5 (or 6, if you include me) witches in the family. What do you think I should do?",262090,I need some advice. 5 women in my family could be witches.,0,,,,1

I obviously cannot really explain that, but it shook me up to the point where I woke up right out of my sleep and it scares me that maybe I did the wrong thing by performing that spell… I’m not sure.

The reason for this post is because I wanted to know if someone could possibly guide me on how to undo the spell or to be pointed in the direction of someone who could.

Parent/ guardians/kinship witches or people that know children etc.

If you, like me are white with sons and look at them and hope they do not grow up in to misogynistic racist assholes... well rest assured like me, raise them properly. 

By properly I mean:

Not be racist 

Be true about the horrible history that white people that are romanised and colonised have done to everyone else

As situations and history is created, tell them what is there difference between white and black people doing something have different outcomes (especially with police).

Demonstrate telling racists off and sticking up for people that are being bullied

Tell your child or even someone else’s child off for being racist or even a bully

Explain why peoples hair is different but all hair dreads (mine does if I don’t look after it). 

Tell about the genocide of First Nations peoples

Tell the history about how Germanic Tribes were invaded, raped and enslaved by Romans and how Europeans adopted Roman rules by giving up when their sons and daughters were stolen

Check the social media and internet history on your kids phone/computer to see if they are not being radicalised by q&amp;a etc.

So above is just some examples...

We can all do the job of parenting... even if we’re not a parent. It takes a community to raise a child.

If your kid ends up being an ass; you can clearly look at yourself and say I did everything in my power to prevent that.

What are some good romance novels you have all read recently? 

Bonus points for 

1) Consent. I'm as big a fan of ripped bodices as the next gal, but I do not enjoy rape fantasies where the heroine says no, but it's ok bc she had an orgasm...also ""tell me no now bc I wont be able to control myself"" is bullshit

2) Lack of toxic masculinity. I do not enjoy men crying being refered to ""being unmanned"" or men punching walls/ commiting violence out of sexual frustration. 

2) POC protagonists/writers. I am extremely white and I would like to read books by and about POC to support the authors and broaden my perspective.

3) LGBT protagonists/writers. Same deal. 

4) Witchy-ness or crafty-ness. For any knitters or fiber folk ""How to knit a love song"" by Rachel Heron and the others in that series are AMAZING and so sweet, yet sexy, and fun. 

I read these to decompress and relax. I guess I'm trying to say that for this purpose I'm not looking to have my mind blown, I'm looking to curl up with some tea and a blanket and not think for a while and just be happy that 2 fictional characters are going to get some action...lol",249649,"Requesting Fun, relaxing book reccomendations",0,,,,0

I had therapy today and in this whole depressive period, I realized that while trying to become more firm, to get to know my animus- I’ve neglected my anima.

I feel like there is an obstacle to me fully embracing my femininity. I mean this in the sense of me feeling and being sexy, flirtatious or glamorous. I’ve spent two years hiding myself, being critical of the weight I’ve gained due to depression and thyroid problems. I want to feel whole and free, and I know that losing weight won’t necessarily do that for me (it may help, but I feel that the key lies within). Even when I have been skinnier, the thought of me being sexy has made me feel ashamed about myself. This is an important point for me, it’s likely childhood upbringing and family environment - and I want to let go of it. Flirting also makes me feel shy, it’s difficult. 

That is why I wanted to ask you, do you have any ideas on how to go about embracing the sexual/sensual, glamorous within a woman? How to release from shame? Any practices?

Today I was woken up by him washing off the words I put up above my door ""May Hecate Guide Me"" that a good portion of you saw. When I opened my door and said ""What the fuck do you think you're doing"" I got soapy water flicked at my face.

At first, I was livid, but after about 30 minutes of yelling at each other we both calmed down a bit and started talking things out. From this two-hour conversation, I learned a few things.

First off, I got a glimpse into how his brain works. He went into detail about the trauma he went through as a kid and about the motorcycle wrecks he's been in and I started to understand him. He shared a bunch of personal stuff, I shared a bunch of personal stuff, and rapport was built. 

Secondly, we both have discernment of spirit (we're both empaths) and we have a bunch of other stuff in common. He doesn't have anything against my faith, he just wants me to stop ""marking"" the property. Though he's been a dick, he's actually a pretty cool guy. 

Last but not least, my mother has been two-faced this entire time instead of helping us resolve the issue. She's been being agreeable and lying for the sake of trying to keep the peace and to make us both happy and in turn has been fueling the fire. She has Huntington's though so I can't really be mad at her. 

If there's one thing you can take away from reading this, it's this: If you and your perceived enemy are at odds, make peace if you can. You'll feel a hell of a lot better after.

Also, to the person I snapped at in the comment section of my ""Satisfy my curiosity"" post, I'm sorry. I went through some shit as everyone does, but I shouldn't have been a dick. I tried looking through my history to find your UN but I couldn't find it, so hopefully you see this.

Things such as the pay gap aren’t in existence simply because men teamed up together and decided to pay each other more than women. The golden image of a powerful man is a sought after milestone in society solely because it’s what women desire. Power, resources, and authority are qualities women look for in men that men do not care for in women. It’s the incentive to attractive female mates that drives men to hoard power and wealth. Women, on average, don’t have equal incentive because they do not need money or equity to attract a male. Women who live with their parents or don’t have jobs well into their 20s do not receive the same societal criticism that men do because power and wealth are traits expected of men and not women. Any woman who criticizes the American patriarchy, but still desires a wealthy/powerful man is not only a hypocrite, but instrumental in creating the patriarchal system they claim to despise so much. The patriarchy will never end as long as such a large percentage of women still desire patriarchs. Meaning the patriarchy will likely always exist, since this social structure is only natural after thousands of years of evolution. Whether they know it or not, women are programmed by evolution to seek strong hunter-gatherers with many resources by which to ensure the survival of their potential offspring. This is the natural order of things and fighting this is concept is nearly useless unless more than half of women someday just wake up and decide they don’t want quality partners anymore. 

TL;DR - Societies are direct reflections of what its women desire in its men.",252576,The patriarchy was created by women,0,,,,0

This year was full of surprises to all of us and I hope, at the end, this all is for good.

So I opened an etsy shop, not as a business per se, but I'm selling out some couple things from my personal dried herb stash. Mugwort, juniper and pine needle smoke cleansing bundles. The prices are low, as I need to get through this month.

10£ for two mugwort or juniper bundles, all are around 20cm long. I send out only around UK and shipping is free. 


I would appreciate if you would have a look at my shop.

After working this out over the past weeks, I wanted to share this with my lovely witchy peeps so you can enjoy life in retreat.

Use intent with everything you cook. It's all spells to make sure the people who eat it are happy and healthy.

For those who have crust challenges, this forms its own thin crusts.

Butter the pan, blend the batter, pour in, bake, cool, chill. No rolling pins. No hot-water baths. Easy. Delish. Delicate chewy bottom crust, crunchy thin top crust.

It's a flexible recipe. It's a friend, not a martinet.

For those feeding someone with celiac, this uses *any* fine flour, not just wheat: corn, rice, almond, coconut, manioc. 

For vegans, use plant ""milk,"" vegetable shortening or oil, and whatever you use in place of eggs. Frankly, the eggs are there for richness, and if you leave them out, let me know if it still sets up. I think it will, from the combo of flour, fat, and liquid. The worst that will happen is that you have to eat it with a spoon out of a dish like pudding.

Sugar can be cut back. In fact, I'm working on a totally unsweetened quiche version. So it's flavour, not mechanically necessary. Use any sugar substitute powder if you like.

This is designed to use all the pantry powders -- milk, butter, egg, cocoa, vanilla -- because I don't go to stores any more. All this you can get in the mail. I will list the substitutes in case you have fresh eggs or liquid egg sub but not egg powder, liquid milk not powdered, butter not powder. (Let me plead for your health: don't eat margarine. It is unhealthy, despite the advertising propaganda. Use melted shortening or oil if you don't do butter. Margarine is artificial long-chain molecules that have a high correlation with problems with the auto-immune system and/or liver, and morbid obesity. It's unnatural fake food. The few made with special short-chain formulas cost more than butter.)

Also, you may mix all the dry ingredients first to make sure the egg powder is broken up. You may just dump them in the blender or food processor on top of the water as you measure. Or in the bowl and use a beater or whisk. You aren't trying to make it airy, just get everything homogenous. Just don't put the dry in the blender first, or you will be digging it out of the bottom over and over trying to get it up into the batter.

Mostly because I've been considering making and wearing one. But I wanted to do my due diligence and not just assume that it's something I can or should do.

I have read a few Quaker women saying they are totally down with it and that for them it's affirming and supportive. But I don't know that that's necessarily the big picture. I also know that, like any group of people, Quakers aren't monolithic. And especially where Spiritual or Cultural Appropriation is concerned, it can be tricky to navigate when people have differing views.

For me a witches hat is part and parcel of feminism and rebelling against the patriarchy. That I can take so many things that women were persecuted for and be proud of those things. To reclaim the image of the witch.

But I also want to be mindful of the history and all those who went before me who fought and died and loved and lived that I can make that claim 💜",255796,Are witches hats appropriation or symbols of support? Any Quakers in this group or know any to ask?,0,,,,0

This year I got suede shoes for the first time ever. I'm not a big fan of leather and suede but justified it thinking that they'd last longer than the kind of houseshoes I normally get and be better for the environment overall (My reasoning: shoes that last longer don't have to be repaired or replaced as often, so less landfill waste, and while the lining on these shoes are synthetic, the suede and rubber would be biodegradable. It was also reassuring to know that most suede and leather is a bi-product of the meat industry, but I digress). 

Nope. Nope. Nope. The shoes were a nightmare, and it wasn't the suede's fault. The lining was cheap and the ""padding"" was non-existent. So once the shoes were finally broken in, they were already breaking down :(

But even though the interior didn't outlast even the cheapest pair of houseshoes I've owned in the past, the suede and rubber are still holding up fine. So in an effort to honor the animal used to make these shoes, I set out to re-line them with a sturdy and upcycled denim lining.

Not quite stitch-witchery, as I chose not to embroider anything into the shoes, but the days spent repairing the first shoe were peaceful. As I hand stitched the shoe back together it felt a lot like having a conversation.

I apologized for the system we live in: one that dishonors the animal that was killed by pairing its hide with cheap materials and pre-destines it for an early retirement in a landfill (aka fast fashion).

And I expressed gratitude to the animal and cleaned and treated the suede with the same care I would when bathing a familiar, or caring for a beloved houseplant. In a funny sort of way, I reassured it that even when the shoes became beyond my repair I wouldn't just throw the suede out. It would become a pouch for my sewing needles, a pad for my thimble, and scraps for repair work.

I chose to repair my shoes to honor and respect the animal, but I chose to share with you guys because in repairing my shoes I also feel I've given a small ""f\* you"" to the fast fashion industry, and the patriarchy. Fast fashion: For making a product designed to fall apart in a matter of months. And the patriarchy: For charging me more for unisex shoes just because they're in a ""women's"" size. (seriously, next time you're buying shoes go check if the ""men's"" version is cheaper and in your size. The 'women's tax' is real.)

I plan on these being my only suede shoes for the next decade or more, but next time I have to get running shoes or something, I'll definitely look at shoes that I could probably repair myself. It's been a very rewarding experience. (crossposted with r/ZeroWaste).

I'm kinda new to witchcraft, and the was the first year I planned to not celebrate Christmas but the winter solstice! I've been planning for a little over a month, very excited to finally break ties with a holiday that brought up triggers and pain from the life that caused me to have PTSD. A few weeks ago we realized that our oven was turning on randomly and asked the landlord to fix it. Two days ago he shows up and dumps a new oven on our porch. We pulled it inside and made due with the annoyance of having a floating oven in our studio home. Today he popped by and installed the new one in less than twenty minutes and leaves. Shortly after he left we noticed that we could smell gas. We pull out the oven to turn off the gas only to find that the foot and a half long gasline doesn't provide enough room to get back there and test for a leak. We managed to turn off the gas and the smell subsided. Now we have to wait till Monday(the fucking solstice) for the local gas company to come have a look before our landlord will even lift a finger.

We though of putting the old one back but came to find that our landlord took a few of the knobs and all the burners. So now I can't cook, or bake at all! The bunch of cookie dough I had made for solstice cookies, the ham I bought, the pumpkin pies I was getting ready to make. All the the main point of my holiday gone.

I don't have family, to speak of and I only have one friend. I was finally trying to do something for myself. My friend will still have Christmas with her family. But I will be spending my holiday doing a half-assed ritual alone in the darkness. Realizing all of this on my one mental health day a week after weeks of hardship and everything falling apart I found myself cutting the arm again. It's been years I've managed to keep this horrible childhood couping mechanism away... But I really needed this holiday... And I guess that just how life goes right?

Is it because the Church enforced gender roles so embracing occult stuff is a form of recalcitrance? Or bc supernatural powers represent a form of strength for the physically weaker sex? Or still bc embracing evil is a rebuke to valuations of women according to docility and purity?

Also, do u actually believe in this wicken stuff or is it just a larp?",258210,Connection between magic and feminism?,0,,,,1

Full Moons are full of energy and are great for charging items, casting spells, or performing divinations. If you set a new intention during the most recent New Moon, now is the time to reflect on your progress, and to make the decision to fully manifest it or set it aside. Additionally, this is a great time to reflect on and discard thoughts/ideas/intentions/manifestations that are no longer serving you.

I tried my best to keep in touch with them since we graduated but they haven’t done the same. And eventually I stopped trying. On Instagram it’s clear that they hang out all the time, and it’s a little discouraging. 

The more I thought about it tho I realized it was a blessing in disguise. A lot of people on my life have come and gone. Some people have challenged my values and others have helped shape them. Thinking about it, if I had really clung on to those relationships I would be really unhappy. I’m realizing more and more each day that the relationship I really need to focus on is the one with myself. Each day I’m making more of an effort to connect with myself and to be my own best friend. I’ll admit my expectations are always high and it’s impossible to hold people up to those standards. But I know that I’ll always be able to hold myself accountable.

The universe really challenged me in 2020 and I tried to hold on to what I had. If I never let go, I wouldn’t be me now. I’m very content with my life right now: I’m going to therapy, my career is thriving, and I’m surrounded by good people. If I held on, who knows where I would be. Here’s to 2021 and new challenges!",265212,Some friendships aren’t forever and that’s okay,0,,,,1

At least two to three times a summer a pod would come on super close to our beach. The adults would freak out. Everyone would watch from the breakers as they played and hunted. I always secretly thought it was because of my underwater clicking and screeching.. but it was more likely them following a school of bait fish up the coast. 

They would splash and play on our beach for at least a half an hour each time. And it felt magical each time. Little me felt special. 

I just saw a pod last weekend. I haven’t seen one in about 5 years. I drove from the city to the beach and as soon as I stepped onto the sand, I saw them. There was a pod about 30 feet out feeding and playing. Everyone on the beach saw them and was laughing and pointing. Pure joy.

I hope my post is welcome here, please let me know if otherwise. I have been a long time fan of this community and interested in spiritual powers.

I recently visited a psychic and she read my tarot. She was the third psychic I have seen in my life and the third to tell me that I have some kind of witch/bruja power. 

I am unsure what to make of this or what it means. I believe my mother and my grandmother are what I call ""sensitive"" and I've had moments in my life that seem sensitive/special to me as well, particularly as it relates to dreams and premonitions. 

I suppose as an aspiring male witch/bruja, is there any advice you might give me on my journey? I feel sometimes like I have something within me that could be used for good but I don't know what it is or how to use it.

I want him to know it's okay to move on, or follow us on to the next home. I wish this for the other pets as well.

So I had a dream today and I remember very well about a black cat sitting in my arms, petting it, but the cat is trying to lick my face. It was cute n all because i like cats, but obviously as it was deliberetly getting into my face i felt slightly annoyed but was still nice to the cat. I looked up about some ot the symbolisms and meanings this could be but I would also like to hear your thoughts on this. 

Oh yeah also last night I saw that person in my dreams. I remember walking through a supermarket when I see a little girl misbehaving and making a mess near the potatoes, so I told her to follow me because I wanted to discipline her. So I sat at the curb of the road with the little girl talking and talking about things. Suddenly I saw a truck speeding very close to the curb the girl n i were sitting on, almost hitting us, she runs and I jump away from the truck's way. Next, I saw the person at a distance, they were wearing their usual clothes (all black) like a black coat, black tshirt, black ripped jeans and their hair splitted in the middle. So I approached them. We hugged, and I remember saying ""I lowkey hate you"". The hug was long. When I started walking away, two trucks were coming my way now and one had a loose back wheel on its right side, therefore loose screws which when the truck was pressing the brakes, the screws flew everywhere and the truck was very unstable, almost hitting me when the other truck actually blocked the way of the failing truck. Then I see that person appear from between the trucks and walking away from the scene. I left the scene to look for the little girl that ran away, the person followed me and when I finally saw her, I turn back and he's now very far from me. (Also the person that I saw never smiled, they had a neutral expression all the time)


Background info about my current situation: Not too long ago (maybe a month or two ago) a friend of mine came back into my life and I'm not a big fan of them. They're pretty negative most of the times n stuff which was why i tried to cut them out. Anyway I was thinking of sending them a Christmas card (I already made it just need to post it) because I still like them as a person but also don't. I'm pretty confused because it feels wrong and right because I don't and do like them as a friend. They do like me which is why they were trying to get me back, that's what they said at least. 

So yeah that's all about background situation which I feel is linked to my dreams. So what's your take away on this? I'm happy to hear your thoughts and personal analysis! :)",251467,Dream work question,0,,,,0

I'm hoping for some of that support. And maybe some healing, too. If I should ask elsewhere, I'm happy to, I just spend more time here than in any of the other witchy-pagan subreddits.

I started miscarrying around Halloween. I didn't know that's what it was, because I have PCOS and am very used to irregular periods. But this was different, and I spent all of last month struggling with fatigue, bleeding, cramping, nausea, and vomiting. 

I didn't know I was pregnant. I've struggled with infertility my whole life. I didn't suspect until the second week when the bleeding and other symptoms changed.

November was... Hard. My physical and mental health tanked. I've been struggling with feeling withdrawn and isolated, and while my bf is being gentle, he doesn't know how to help. Physically I'm getting better, but I'm still struggling mentally/emotionally. At first I kept my feelings locked up because of the uncertainty, then numb that I both got pregnant (finally! I want so badly to be a mother) and then quickly miscarried (second time; first was when I was much younger). It's been especially hard because my stepsister announced her fourth pregnancy not long after I told everyone what happened, and because everyone... Immediately jumps to, ""at least now you know you can, so your day will come"" which... Feels very dismissive of my grief and hurt *now* and like it... Shuts the door on conversation about my miscarriage. 

My therapist yesterday suggested that I find a ritual of some kind to help me process, grieve, and move forward. He'd been suggesting dbt skills like usual, but he also knows I've been exploring my spirituality and witchiness. So he suggested looking there, and that I could try to use my creativity (writing and drawing) to express the grief. We didn't get to talk much more because I had to get to work.

I just don't... Know how. I'm still learning to follow basic rituals; creating one seems too much for me right now. So I guess I'm... Hoping that you all might be able to offer suggestions? Advice? Resources? 

I'm primarily focused on Celtic (and especially Irish) practices, but I'm open to suggestions. I wasn't very successful in my own searches, and trying to craft something myself just makes my brain go blank. I really appreciate it.",251431,Miscarriage Grieving/Healing Rituals?,0,,,,0

I’m white. I grew up around Indian culture and I was wondering if it would be okay to wear the clothes if I research before wearing anything. I’ve been told that it’s racist of me to even consider that. But I personally don’t think they’re right because it was a toxic sub that I had asked.

Three months ago, I entered a business services program to expand my small company. They have an ""embedded"" life coach feel to it, I didn't mind. I'm not a fan of coaching, but I'm neither against it.

They connected me to this guy. I didn't like that he issued a video call without asking first. I declined and he had to properly schedule. He then insisted that all meetings be video calls. During our first meeting, he was very guarded and defensive. He said ""if you don't like something about me, just tell me. Don't go and tell the program directors because they will always take my side. It was weird, but I already paid and I didn't care about his weirdness, I'm here to complete something for my goals.He seemed knowledgeable and very proactive. We had good working discussions and he seemed to share equal concerns regarding small business. 

&amp;#x200B;

He began to talk about reincarnation and knowing each other etc. I stayed quiet. No forum for his crap.

A second time he tells me ""you will get a call about my work"". that never happened. The third time, he says he supposedly attended a seminar and was told to keep it professional, The said: I'm glad we are friends"". It s obvious that he was making such calls up/conferences up.

I began to notice he started promising deadlines and never fulfilled them. He wanted to get the video call and it felt like chit chat. So I told him.  He asked to screen sharing and honestly, it was all about changing a couple of words to a document, no real knowledge shared. So I cut the video calls. He acts too intimate. He says ""I could read you"" and once he asked me something about my early business days and I answered he said, "" I knew that"". Charlatan. He left me voice messages that go like this: ""you complete me, we have lots to give to each other. I just feel you want this. I a very glad we are in each other's life. So I stopped replying to him and reported him. He has since gotten fired and was forced to return my money. He sent a voice mail telling me "" we need to nurture our bond"". So I reported him a second time and higher up. He emailed me that he could lose his license, but I don't care. He says this is his livelihood and that I'm in the wrong. I am clear in my intentions. Just want an opinion. I am disgusted, totally and entirely.

For one thing, both are usually the main villain when showcased. Unsurprising in a show about two brothers going around saving people from supernatural threats but seriously? Almost every witch is basically using super dark magic (animal sacrifices for hexes, for example) and every pagan group they meet is usually killing innocent people for a sacrifice to appease whatever deity they are worshipping (and I'll swing back to that in a minute) 

And if they aren't the Big Bad, they're usually some side character/witness for the episode who Sam and (especially) Dean mock as ""hippies"" or ""New Age types who are just getting scammed into buying cheap junk"".

And going back to the Pagan deities, every time one shows up they're evil (big shocker) and either manipulating their remaining followers to kill for them or just doing it themself. Also they're canonically no where near as powerful as *the* God because of how their followings really stopped after Christianity got started (the stats on that are probably true, but I doubt Pagan deities are any less powerful because of that????). 

Oh and witches work with demons a lot. Sell their souls to demons to get their powers, work for demons and with demons. Even though most Pagans don't believe in Hell or demons because that's a Christian concept?

But on the flip side outside of the obvious extremists (one time, one of the characters declared himself God and smited a homophobic church leader, I can't say I didn't appreciate that moment) they're pretty kind of Christians and the Church. In the battle of Good vs. Evil, Christianity is planted firmly on the side of good with things like holy water and exorcisms used to defeat demons. 

Now I can't be too angry at Supernatural for this because it definitely isn't exclusive to them or even the sci-fi/fantasy genre. I mean how many movies have you seen that put witches or witchcraft in a bad light or portray them inaccurately? How many can you say do the same thing to Christians (the only one I can think of is Carrie)? 

I'm not saying that all Christians are bad or dumb or have a fake spirituality. I'm just saying that Pagans and witches don't either, and we don't deserve to be treated as such. 

Now I understand the reasoning: a good chunk of the country is Christian, which means a good chunk of your potential viewing block is Christian, so you have to be careful not to piss them off so you can keep your show going or get decent numbers at the box office. On the other hand, most people either don't know Neo-Paganism exists or just dismiss as crazy people so they don't really care about pissing us off. 

That's why I really appreciate stuff like *Charmed* and *The Craft*. The creators of both of those properties actually researched witchcraft and talked to people actually practiced in real life.  Even though some aspects are clearly exaggerated for the story purposes, they're still based on real practices of actual people.",255384,"You ever notice how disrespected Pagans/Wiccans/Witches are in media compared to other religions, especially Christianity?",0,,,,0

How do I handle this? I'm so nervous and keep getting anxiety attacks about it. I keep second guessing if I should even said anything to my close family.

• when i started my journey I was automatically drawn to herbs and crystals which, to me, are spring related and therefore related to Persephone

Today I remove my mod witch hat and replace it with [my nursing cap](https://imgur.com/a/iFuSu5x). (Okay that’s not actually me.) When I was first given my nursing cap, in a nursing school ritual to denote my commitment to the profession some years ago, I would never in a million years have predicted the experience of the past nine months. However, today I breathe a little easier: as a frontline healthcare worker, [I got the incredible privilege of receiving the first part of the emergency use authorization COVID-19 vaccine.](https://imgur.com/a/YAr4d6C) (That is actually me.) Let me start with this reassurance: not once, in any part of my brain, did I question this decision. Instead, I rejoiced. I cried with joy while my occupational health nurse injected me with the SARS-Cov-2 mRNA. I tippy tapped in the chair like my cats getting a treat. I laughed. I asked the other EOHD nurse to take my picture. (She obliged.) I asked her if she wanted to make out with me. (She declined.)

There are a lot of misconceptions and misinformation out there about the vaccine. So I want to present some truths. I want to make perfectly clear two things:

#This vaccine is safe

#This vaccine will save lives

I will tackle a few of the most common concerns:

* Has this vaccine been made too quickly to be safe?

**NO.** Of course this vaccine was brought to market faster than most drugs. But there is an obvious reason why - *there was an ongoing pandemic.* Does this mean there were steps skipped in any part of the vaccine trial? [No.](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-additional-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-second-covid) In fact, due to the pandemic, the bureaucracy and red-tape of the drug authorization was streamlined [but the science remained intact.](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine) The fast production of this vaccine is not a conspiracy to monetize pharmaceutical companies but instead an effort to curb the spread of a deadly microorganism. 

* What about the long-term side effects?

I understand where people are coming from with this concern. However, my counterpoint is this: We know that the short-term side effects are congruent with… [literally any other drug or vaccine.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577) Side effects usually occur within the first 24 hours to one week - and the [reports](https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download) look great. Conversely, we know what the short-term side effects of COVID-19 are - including death. I ask you this, if getting the vaccine saves even *one* life, isn’t that worth it? (To me, it absolutely is.)

For transparency: 

My *actual* side effects: Some soreness at the site of injection (similar to a tDap) and an overwhelming sense of hope. So far, my opinion of microsoft products remains the same.

* Does SARS-Cov-2 mRNA alter human DNA?

[**NO.**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html) The literal “m” in “mRNA” is short for “messenger.” Not “changer.” SARS-Cov-2 (the fancy name for the virus) mRNA does not have the ability to alter human (the fancy name for you) DNA. Unless you are a coronavirus, in which case, you are not welcome in this subreddit. The SARS-Cov-2 mRNA attaches to cell walls (not inside!) and allows for proteins to replicate (again, not inside any cells!). Your stellar immune system immediately realizes that this is not a welcome protein and makes specialized defense cells. This is how immunity is developed. Microbiology is magic, y’all. 

I’m sure there are a lot of other concerns, but to the obvious conspiracy theories I won’t initiate any response. It is 2020; we know that vaccines do not cause autism (and why is autism the worst case scenario, again?). It is 2020, we know that there aren’t microchips in the small fluid injection. It is 2020, I welcome a 5G connection if it means I can stream netflix a scoche faster. If you have concerns about these misguided and clear misinterpretations of data, please comment below so that we can kindly redirect you.

At the end of the day: science is magic. Vaccinations are magic. Saving lives is **my magic**. Soon this vaccine will be available to you. In the name of my goddess [Florence Nightingale](https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/florence-nightingale) and in the name of exhausted healthcare workers wearing the same mask for several hours while watching people die preventable deaths, I beg you: **help us reach immunity and get vaccinated.**

In the name of science: Blessed be ✨

My story of becoming a witch is full of pain. I've been a witch for more than two decades now though, and it's one of the best things that has ever happened to me. Maybe yours was the same way, or maybe your discovery was made with joy. I want to hear your story too. What was the moment when you discovered or decided that you were a witch?

\---

When I was young I remember sitting in a pew one day, and against the drone of the Catholic service reflecting on men. Grown men. I sat and picked apart the sense of bewilderment I often experienced when they took swipes at me, to diminish me, to cow me, to shrink my person. Always nastily, always where no one else was looking. 

Men didn’t like me. When they tried to cut me down to size, I would only blink at them. For the small ugly things they said to me simply didn’t land. Didn’t prick, didn’t sting. They were expecting those barbs to find a home in me, because they expected that I already believed myself lower than them. But I did not. It was a kind of righteous naiveté, and it was dangerous. 

I only let those small ugly things hang there, wiggling between us like the black sludge they were. *Is this yours?* I would say with my eyes. Self-possession, and making them hold their own words. They hated that. I’ve had men swing at me for simply saying nothing and giving them that look.

I know now that patriarchal rage runs deep. For some, to be flashed that kind of disobedience is enough to murder. I played a game of fire blindly. I didn’t know the stakes. 

But they didn’t know me either. 

Because either one of two things happened. A man tried to diminish me and I turned on him the flat mirror which stopped him in his tracks. Or that mirror enraged him, and he rose, ready for Combat. They didn’t know my secret. I *would* fight them. I would fight them to the death. I would tear at their jugulars with my teeth. I would pull apart their ribs with my bare hands. I would drink their blood and scream to the moon. Bewilderment became the glint of madness. 

I had already suffered the worst indignities at the hands of men. Held down, raped, silenced. Again and again. Their rage was no match for mine. Do you know why Kali is a goddess and not a god? Because the soul abrading injuries felt by women who have no control over their bodies, their lives, form the deepest, most incandescent rage you can imagine. 

That rage foments a murderous heart. I knew that the men saw it, when I flashed my madness at them like a blade. And as I sat in the pew and looked up at the cathedral ceiling, I recalled when the priest had said that the thought is the same as the act. To be cleansed, to be saved by god, I would have to confess murder. But I could not do that, because then I would have to explain *why* I confessed murder. Even with all that self-possession, I was still trapped by the secret of my rape. 

Because I was 12. 

And it was in that very moment, when I was damned for being damned, that I said fuck the Church. Fuck anything that puts men over me ever again. It was then and there that I gave up Catholicism, and decided to become a witch. And trust me, I knew what that meant. Do not underestimate the murderous hearts of 12-year-old girls that decide to become witches. They mean it deadly seriously. They mean it forever.",260853,The Moment I Became a Witch (CW: sexual assault is mentioned),0,,,,1

dreaming evil, I have done my hitch

over the plain houses, light by light:

lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.

A woman like that is not a woman, quite.

I have been her kind.

&amp;#x200B;

I have found the warm caves in the woods,

filled them with skillets, carvings, shelves,

closets, silks, innumerable goods;

fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves:

whining, rearranging the disaligned.

A woman like that is misunderstood.

I have been her kind.

&amp;#x200B;

I have ridden in your cart, driver,

waved my nude arms at villages going by,

learning the last bright routes, survivor

where your flames still bite my thigh

and my ribs crack where your wheels wind.

Pretty much what the title says- I’ve been feeling isolated lately. Not just from people (although that too), but from a kind of meaning or depth in life. 

I’ve been an atheist for the majority of my life. I don’t believe in the supernatural. But if there’s one thing I envy about religious people is they always have something to moor themselves too. When they’re distressed, they can repeat prayers, burn incense, say the rosary, etc., and feel like they’re connected to something beyond themselves that gives them meaning and clarity.

I’ve like there’s no form of deep spiritual and community connection left in western culture that isn’t inherently religious. You either believe in God, in which case you become part of a church community with shared beliefs, history, tradition, rituals, and dignity, or else you live a secular life of avocado toast and algebra. If you try to adopt non-religious spiritual practices from another culture, it mostly ends up as a shallow appropriation, and if you try to make up your own way it ends up feeling silly and shallow too. Nothing like how I remember of the dignity and majesty of growing up in the Catholic Church, with hundreds of people singing these beautiful hymns and praying together in these huge beautiful churches brought together by a shared connection with ritual, a history, and something so much bigger than all of them.

I just want to feel a deep meaningful connection to my ancestors, community, and history, you know? But there seems to not be a lot of space for that in western culture. And being proud of European history and ancestors is very complicated politically and morally, which just makes it harder to feel rooted. 

I was full of these thoughts yesterday. Wanted to pray or something but I don’t have any god to pray to, so I went out in the snow and dark and smoked some weed under a tree and looked up at the sky, reflected on all the other humans throughout time and the lands who’ve probably felt the same. That helped a bit. 

I’d love to hear your perspectives.",266016,"Struggling with a lack of tradition, connection, culture, and roots that come with religious practice.",0,,,,1

My first thought was The Swan Tower, after the fortress of my favorite D&amp;D goddess, but that turned out to be the website of an author I really like as well. Hermit and Heirophant was another thought, but as much as I like the concept of a Heirophant, I am not so hot on it's tarot meaning.

Trigger warning as the story discusses topics of transgender struggles. 



The story begins with a person struggling with their gender identity. Fighting through all the mental gymnastics we put ourselves through on the journey of figuring oneself out. She finally accepts and acknowledges she's Transgender after a long time of questioning and doubting every thought and clue she gave herself. She starts her transition, but rather than peace she soon finds herself going through the struggles Trans women have to deal with. Being sneered, and yelled at in public. Harassed. Objectified. Chased out of bathrooms. Difficulty finding work. Safe spaces being invaded by TERFs claiming they aren't valid or imposters. Sadly, the list could go on. 

Time goes by as she continues transitioning and learning to live with the constant struggle society and her own thoughts put her through. While living her life she discovers an interest in witchcraft and begins to study and learn. Eventually she finds the strength to overcome her fears of rejection to reach out and connect with other witches and eventually finds a group that accepts her for being her. In time they become good friends and they form their own coven. 

One uneventful mundane day she finds herself sitting around with members of her coven just talking and doing their thing. When in a moment of silence where she's listening to others talk, it finally clicks for her. For the first time she feels accepted for who she is and that the thoughts of being an imposter and not real have become less and less common. She feels confident and empowered. And for the first time she notices that she has finally started to see herself as the woman she always was. And she has found others who see her that way too. She stealthily wipes away a few tears of bliss and continues on with her day beaming a little brighter than she had any day before. As her thoughts tainted with self hate and doubt fade away and become replaced by one's of acceptance and encouragement.",265762,I wanted to share a short story/idea about self discovery and empowerment.,0,,,,1

They tell me truths 

I do not know

They tell me lies

They cannot show

They storm the capitol wielding pitchforks like fairytale gremlins

They scream witch as the fires grow

Hide warmth hide hope hide love

Spread hate like dandelion seeds caught to the wind

Grow yellow flowers come summer melt into dried out kindling

For smokey fires

We learn to read with our eyes closed afraid of what we might see

Caught between the pages like some sort of malevolent backdrop

Tell me change is coming

Tell me the sun will shine again

Brightening our lives with new beginnings

Until then we learn to breath through ash

Think we have found a new whole when really we have only learned to live with half

Burn bridges hide ourselves with xenophobic pain

Eat money cause thats all we receive as payment

And we pray for another day away from the smog away from the gloom

We live in an age of history in the making

The lessons of the past have started flaking away

Lather it up with lotion to keep the skin close to our hearts

Draw lines in the sand to claim this as only our path

Yet tides come to wash the castles away

As borders melt to seafoam fizzle

And in the drizzle we learn to breath without needing to gasp

Reverse the prism to one uniform light

A rainbow to chase out the spark

Leaving lines to blur

Making the sea floor prepped for another wave

Hold tightly as our feet wash away

Leaving us as seeds to the wind

**Under the Shadow-**10/8/20

Give us our hopes and dreams back and our future too,

A break from the constant fear and dread, 

Leaving us bound to reality with chains dragging on the floor,

Give us freedom free from fear, 

not this patriarchal perfection you cling to like it’s your dying child,

But you don't because if you cared about your children you would care about us, 

We would be focused on school not on you with protests like paper to glue,

I want a day where I wake up not aching and yearning for the headlines saying The shadow dissolved,  

Magic miraculous crops growing green as factories rust,

But instead you weave your web of lies as if your crimes will be absolved, 

A cultish prison for flies, 

Flies like the one perched upon the head probably dead from the evasion of truth,

Just like you manage to ignore the Darkness looming above,

As the gloom gets darker you say we are wrong in our dread

It's almost as if you don't have eyes on your head, 

Eyes that make it so you don't see the grief that prevents you from immediately replacing Ruth,

Maybe I don't know, 

Too young to rally cries of resistance, 

You must be scared to sink that low,

Even Though I know the White Christmases are down as hurricanes arise

White like a polar bear soon to be gone

Or wet like a forest covered in rain,

Maybe our cries are in vain,  

But the shadow tells us to fight flight or freeze

Please resist not run and deflect,

I can't bear the pain

Yet you read the facts and continue to reject,

Maybe you’re so dense you don't understand so I spell it out slowly:

I am angry at you

Step down, have a rest,

Let science lead and maybe the countries will see a world without a shadow,

And we will have our hopes and dreams back 

And a future not battling your mess

I'm, like, ""Ooohhh, ultimate acceptance, surrender and compassion, this is the message of Buddha, of Guan Yin!""

And so now when I see and meditate upon imagery of Guan Yin, I look into those gentle eyes and I understand the message and can feel the wish for peace rippling out through this conditioned world of cause-and-effect. 

I've had the same experience with Kali, Shakti, Mahakala, the dakinis, hell, even Jesus. 

Each with a slightly different flavor, each with a slightly different, and yet deeply similar, message. 

Just recently, almost on a whim I took time to call out to and give praise to Goddess Aphrodite, Mother Love Herself. 

And the message is so utterly sweet and beautiful. 

""There is nothing that goes unloved in this world. All is touched with Love.""

""Even Hate can be held gently with Love.""

These aren't things I'd typically associate with this goddess, as my impression of her in her stories was of a tempestuous force that made and broke people at her whim. Not this ever-loving force I sense now when I call to her. 

The more I delve in, the more and more I appreciate the messages these divine icons inspire. The more I'm convinced the words and icons are symbols that point towards an experience, a relationship.

I'm the kind of person that believes in energy - positive and negative, it's sort of like colours and temperatures. I try to give out the right energy for situations and I'm acutely aware of the energy of others (makes me very good at my job as a speechie). 

I ended a DV relationship late 2018, and he moved out in early 2019. I have struggled to feel like my home is safe and mine. 

I recently lost my eldest cat, who died suddenly early December, and his little brother has been unwell since then. I have my cats ashes, some bones and fur in my room next to my grandpa's ashes. 

Recently, I have noticed out the corner of my eye or felt my cats presence in the house. Recently I've been dreaming about him a lot more. He was my best friend and my greatest comfort. I am struggling mentally right now so I think he might be hanging out to look after me and his brother. 

My question is, is there a way that I can cleanse myself, my home and my remaining sick cat of the awful energy that my ex left behind, while still preserving the energy of my deceased cat. Obviously I don't want to trap him, but I don't want to block him out. 

Any help or advice you can provide would be so appreciated by us. We miss our big boy a lot and both need to be able to breathe freely again.",263044,"Need help from helpful people to cleanse my space, person and cat, but keep a positive presence",0,,,,1

If you disagree with me, I'll completely respect it. I feel like these things are personal, and everybody experiences them in their own way.

All of this started when I discovered I was a trans woman. Before that, I enjoyed life, I felt emotions, but everything felt a tiny bit distant. And it was getting worse, I began to feel tired. Like everything was devoid of colour. I even began thinking the world might not be real and things like that. It was as if I wasn't there, at times.

And then, I discovered that I was a woman. I came back to reality, with such a powerful and resounding ***THUD***, that it was so wonderful and stressing at the same time. I felt *alive*. It was stressing, of course, coming out of the closet was really, really stressing, but isn't why I'm here.

Over time, I began to feel some new things, or maybe, I just noticed that they were there. These felt... different to me. Maybe... *magical*. Maybe I'm wrong, or something, but here they are:

**Auras. (This is a big one):**

 I don't know how to put it into words, but it's like a layer of human beings, heck, even some animals, that I didn't notice before. It's specially noticeable with the ones I'm comfortable with. It's all around them, but they are quite indescribable, it's like, I can feel people are *there* now. But... I think I began to feel mine, too. It's... They're like, instruments. They're all different. Unique. And depending on how the one that is connected to it feels, it sings differently. But the thing is, mine has done something that took my breath away when I noticed. It reharmonizes. My friend brought her friends once, and they were quite different, more funny, and even umm, flirty? They were cracking jokes all the time, and flirting with each other. I don't know how, but I began doing it, too. Like I was singing in their tune. It was still, *me*, my timbre was there.

When they left, I realised three things. One: it was tyring. It was fun, but it took energy from me. Two: I do this with everyone that's close to me. After sometime, the auras of those I (willingly) spend time with, and how I want or feel like I should reharmonize, it becomes second nature, and less tyring. I don't bother with people that clash with my aura, or those who I don't find... enjoyable, as harsh at it sounds. But, Three: with the ones I'm really, really, close with... I don't have to do it. It's like, they have become a part of me, or that our auras are so familiar with one another's, that the reharmonization is no longer needed, or is so small of a difference it doesn't matter. But if feels deeper than reharmonizing, somehow.

And I begun to feel mine shining/singing. People even, started asking me for help, at the subway, or st the street with adresses and these things. I don't stand out, and I'm even wearing headphones. But somehow, people know I love to help. It's like my aura was giving off my kindness somehow, and people knew where to find me.

**Premonitions/Déjà vús?**

This has happened to me since, well, ever. I don't usually dream vividly, or remember my dreams. But sometimes, I'm about to experience something, and it hits. It's not a ""I've seen this before"" it's a ""I've dreamt this"". I forget about them when I wake up, but when they happen, I know, and sometimes, I *know* how much time has been since I dreamt it. I have minutes of shock, when I just remembered 20 seconds that I dreamt *years* ago. A wild case that happened recently: I was thinking about trans stuff, and then it hit, like, 30 seconds of connection to that memory. The memory felt so *old.* It startled me, that a part of me knew that this going to be part of my life for so long. Sometimes, they are minor sparks, one happened right now while I was writing, but this one It felt like another path, I wrote the same number of words, but it was different. Like I changed the course of what was going to happen. Those happen sometimes too.

**My imagination**

The rational part of me knows that this is just a case of having a really good imagination. Like, the complete opposite of Aphantsia. 

...But if feels like I'm connecting with other worlds, when I read books. Like I'm a observant, of a real world, I feel like if I could... I don't know, use more poweful uhh, ""magic"" I could actually travel there. I love to use my imagination when I'm bored too. But, it's like, so, so real. I have imagined animesque battles with magic and stuff to pass time, with plots I never write because reasons, but sometimes *I'm* there. And it's like I can feel those weapons on my hands. A part of me is sure that I could pick up a scythe or a sword (two weapons I like) and I'd be proficient with them. 

Sometimes I'm so deep in the connection with other worlds, that when someone or something tries to bring me back, it takes a few moments to realise where I am.

And one really strange time, I confused one thing that was normal in a world and I thought it happened here, too. The book contained werewolves. They called their howling ""singing"", and, when I looked at the full moon when I was out with my friends, I almost said, without thinking ""We might hear some songs tonight"" but then, instead of thinking ""what? Are you crazy, me?!"" I instead though, ""oh, they don't know any werewolves, they won't know they call it singing"", and I said ""Full moon, careful with the werewolves"" and it was a *joke to myself*, because in the book, they weren't dangerous, but people believed them to be. My friends stared at me. I was shocked too. And then one of them said ""Ohhh, was this a joke for me? I haven't read the book you recommended me yet"". I was like ""O-oh, sure! I thought you started reading it already"" I never had that happen. For a second there, I believed weres were real. And I even *thought* what I was going to say, I revaluated the reflex, and said something like that anyway. It was, so, so, weird. I felt like I was sobering up from being ""drunk"" of the other world, when I didn't even notice when I'd gotten so drunk.

**Manifesting my will**

My mother calls it ""The law of the secret"", I don't know why. (It is translated from Spanish, so maybe it something from here? I don't really know) what matters is that she has seen it happen.

Many, many, times, if I just wish it enough, I can make things *happen*. I can't do it knowingly. I can't think, okay, let's bend the universe so I can have/experience [thing]. It's more subtle.

Examples are things like wanting to go for a place for dinner, even if the rest of my family wants to go to a different place, and then, the only place that isn't full already is where I wanted to go. Or wanting a second monitor for my PC, and then suddenly a relative saves 5 from being recycled and brings one to me because he knew. Or just noticing that what I was about to buy had its price lowered that day. (This has happened so often that my friends are amazed by it)

It feels like the universe is smiling back at me.

I thought that this was something that I just imagined... But my family feels its effects. To the point they say things like: ""*sigh* I want to move out to a house instead of living on this flat, but we can't find anything. Ocultx, maybe your Law of the Secret could help? Or... maybe what happens is that you don't want to move out?"" I got away with ""I just want to have a driving license first""... But in reality I was planning to move out, on my own.

.
.

These are the four most ""magical"" things I've experienced. There has been more, like when at a busy station at the subway, I felt like everyone was connected or something, and it took my breath away. I passed through that busy station many times. Or suddenly feeling I could conjure up a weapon somehow, only to find my hand empty when I try to grasp it.

But... It's... Scary. Why?

Well, aside from feeling a little bit crazy, (Aren't we all?) my relationship with magic was always strange. For example, I don't like astrology at all. I don't like being reduced to: ""You're like that because your Gemini"", at all. What, the stars, planets, and moon defined who I am? No. ***I*** define who ***I*** am. And it has been proven wrong many, many times. 

And that's what drives me away from magic. My science self, and skepticism. I've always loved science, specially IT. Everything has an explanation. I can ask ""Why?"" or ""How?"" and I always have answers. Or at least, people are working (and getting close to) answer them. But magic feels the opposite of that. It feels like mistery. Like something that can't be explained. It feels like feelings. (And I'm an Aspie, I'm not good with those) I can't say I don't believe magic. Because then, I wouldn't be scared of Ouija boards. I wouldn't have said no to my mother doing a tarot umm, ""prediction"" (I'm not familiar with my terminology) and when she said ""Wasn't that you didn't believe in these things?"" I just said that my future was a quantum superposition, and I didn't went her to mess it up, collapsing the superposition by measuring it with her cards.

A part of me says this is all things I've made up. That they are psychological effects, like what horoscopes are (if you enjoy astrology, be free to do it, I'm sorry! I don't really want to call your believes false. They're just false for me.). And that the people that believe in these things don't believe in vaccines, or global warming .""*Fools*"" the mean part of me said. But, you, r/WitchesVsPatriarchy ,proved me wrong. You believe in science. You know how much the vaccine matters, you have it pinned in the subrredit. Heck, I've lurked long enough, you all seem lovely.

So, at this point... Maybe *I* am the fool. People have discriminated witches for literally centuries. Maybe I'm just denying things because of my fear of the unkown (a human thing, I know) Maybe I'm closing off a part of myself that needs the same attention my programming or musician selves need.

For crying out loud, I've lived with my ""Law of the Secret"" thing for so long that basically I'm denying that it *works*.

So... I am basically asking for... what to do. Should I explore this? How? Should I let it be? This feels very personal, and I don't think I would trust, for example, my mother, even though she has done witchy stuff in the past (although I have more reasons for her particular case). I'm confused? But excited, somewhat.

It feels like a piece of me that I didn't notice before.

It has everything: an alternate history of the town of Salem with the cadence of retold fairytales, and nods to non-European stories. It has witches, the maiden, mother and crone, and household magic worked from bits and bobs, from puddled candlewax, matchsticks, string, and feathers. It has words with power, dried herbs and flowers. It has women resisting, it has dresses with pockets and it has sisterhood. It even has a lesbian leading romance and a minor trans character arc. Most of all, it has powerful transgression, empathetic growth and steady resilience. 

I do not regret this as my first read of 2021.

There a few points in the plot and pacing that I might have preferred differently - the centrality of children, for example, to the narrative of women makes the novel fall short of its own subversive potential. Similarly, certain sections took a bit longer than precisely necessary. 

But on the whole, this was exactly what I was looking for - something centred around women, exploring witchcraft, history, sisterhood and living life outside the bounds of convention. A magical book that fed my soul.

Scrolling through this sub, I feel like telling y'all about my experiences with nature, especially since covid hit Canada.

I live in the city, I am lucky (extremely lucky) to have a country house with a large swath of forest. (This is my family's but I live with them because I'm a \~young adult\~.) I never full attention to the forest before. I had my reasons for not liking being here (like not hanging out with friends much). But, when covid hit, we decided to have our lockdown in the country. I took walks practically every day. Why wouldn't you? I started to see the beauty in nature and walk outside of the trails we have. There's a pond right on/outside of our property, and I walked over to it. I was such in awe that I decided to kneel. I had never experienced such a thing before. I was compelled to do it. I prayed for Mother Nature. I thanked her for all she gives us and prayed that we stop taking advantage of her soon. That we realize the value of nature and have real climate action. Back in the forest, I sang while my palm was on a tree. 

I am atheist, still am, but now I feel a stronger connection and spirituality with nature and everything that is part of it. I have prayed to the moon and the stars, normally so they watch over people. I don't care about whether or not it ""works"", I just do it. In nature, I explore more, see the beauty in every place that I find in this patch of land. I take care to break as little branches as possible, thank any being I take from, or just thanking nature for existing. I knelt once when I saw a deer. Deer are a sweet spot for me as well as the moon. They are so majestic and beautiful. I have discovered so many things that I never would have if I had not stayed here for months. I don't like online school, and I wish to be back studying in the city, but these months of living in the country have made me question if I really am a city girl. I can feel so happy in nature, doing nothing but just standing around. It's really something.

I'm also happy to see the moon everywhere in this sub. One of my favourite sights is outside of my window here in winter nights. When I'm lucky, the clouds are gone, the snow is a blanket on the small, moist field, I can see the outline of the forest trees against the sky, and the moon is full, shining into my room. The shadow of the trees are in contrast with the bright white snow. It is amazing. I used to talk to the stars on nights like those. I love the moon and feel a connection with her. Glad to see people here say the same.

I wish I found this sub back in April where I had that moment, but alas, here I am. I don't know where I want to live in the future (city or country) or even which province to live in. (I used to think the mountains were all I needed, but I also like winters full of snow.) I need to remember that these questions do not concern me right now and to just be. I can explore right now, forage some things (even if I've only found 1 thing that I really liked eating), and hug a tree.

So.. it's my first post here but i truly respect you folks opinions and now i'm coming to you for advice.

I'm having some serious thoughts of changing my study/career field. Now you're gonna say what does this have to do with witchery or patriarchy? Well the fact that i'm in college for engineering(i mostly lean towards programming). An almost exclusive male field to my country. I feel so defeated always having to fight to be taken seriously and given a chance. The stats for my schools is 30% of women enroll and less than 15% graduate and most women graduates i talked to end up in telecommunications usually in sales or in HR. And if that's what they like good for them but it has turned to be the standard and if you want to do something else people try to hold back laughs. Or you have to do something artistic as well for example graphic design.

I used to love coding so much but i've grown to resent it. And i'm gonna lightly expand on other issues like sexual harassment which noone took seriously even if i had screenshots and had talked with other girls who experienced the same or ableist behaviour (i have a neurodevelopmental disorder) that it's not fair for me to ask for another way to get my exams done cause everyone should be treated equally. Hell a professor once called me the r-word cause i asked him to explain to me in another way a part of the syllabus in front of a whole auditorium.

I'm so fucking tired. I'm tired of being treated less than by men. 

And now i'm at a crossroad and i don't know what to do. Do i try to finish my degree purely out of spite and never bother with programming again besides my own personal hobbie if i feeli like it or do i drop out and persue something that is actually fullfilling?(i'm interested in biomedical studies and keep programming as a hobbie again)

I feel like i'm letting my younger self down with dropping out and my whole idiology of i'm gonna do it so i can show other girls that they can do it too. But on the other hand i feel miserable every time exams come around and especially now with covid that i have to beg my professors for extra credit projects etc. cause we can't do our labs.

I'm 25 and yes i know that i have a long way ahead of me but if we're honest completing another degree i'll be almost 30 and have minimal job experience in both fields.

I'm truly sorry if this turned into a vent but i've been crying my eyes out for a week and i didn't know where else to turn for advice. If you read through all this thank you for listening to me and don't feel obligated to respond i just felt safe here.",263849,I need some sisterly advice,0,,,,1

On January 1st of this year, two birds crashed into my sliding glass door (grackles or Mexican black birds.) They were both ok and flew off without becoming stunned. We haven't cleaned the window recently or anything and that's never happened in the two years I've lived in this apartment. It could be that it was Jan. 1st, but it definitely made me feel a little spooked. Like it was a sign of danger coming. (Interestingly enough, we had an attempted break in on the 6th but again I'm trying to look at things with a rational mind and not force connections where there aren't any.)

Late last year I went camping with my family in northern Az. I was lucky enough to see an eagle fly right overheard, low enough that he was easily identifiable. Ive never seen one in person so I was excited and full of wonder. The next day I finally found the strength to let go of a very toxic old friendship for good. 

And finally today, I was standing under a tree early in the morning (about sunrise) and heard a little hiss above me. Not a foot away was a little brown burrowing owl on a branch. He didn't look to pleased to see me under his tree but I felt happy when I saw him. It made my morning feel a little more special and magical. 

So, I have not yet attempted to work with any specific deities but I have roots in Norway, Ireland, and on my father's side Navajo. I've only begun to explore my spirituality (for about the past year) and am still figuring out what I feel most connected with. So I guess I'm just looking for some input and opinions.

I figured you might be able to help with this. 

We all play d&amp;d together, so I wanted to create a collection of art featuring everyone’s beloved characters in a way that could be useful. Some of my friends are into occult stuff, and the ones that aren’t are still super nerds who love Dungeons and Dragons—they’ll appreciate the art, and use the 22 special cards (major arcana, right?) as an improvised Deck Of Many Things, which features a slightly altered cast of cards while following the same theme (the fool = idiot, for instance)

There’s a few things I’m hoping to get help with.

First, how important is it for each card to have unique art? Is that a hallmark of a tarot deck, or can I use standard playing card layouts of x number of symbols? I don’t have unlimited time to do complicated pieces, but if it’s important I could improvise something pretty for each. 

Second, I’d like to accurately follow the meanings of the cards, while trying to fit in as much character art as I can. So, while my designs may not be fully traditional, I want to know what NEEDS to be included in a piece for it to retain its meaning (the tower needs lightning??)

    I’m a 28yo eclectic pagan/animist/witch. I’m in a stable, loving, decade long relationship. Last year my partner and I also purchased a home with lots of room to grow. We’re fairly well set up to have a child. Every time the question of having children comes up, my partner and I are at a loss. How do you choose to create a life in that way? When I consider the state of the environment, the issues with family that I don’t want to carry forward, and the way it could change my own (very lucky) life, I feel that I can’t justify it. I would consider fostering, but all I’ve heard is that the system is broken, and burnout is high. Despite all of this I inexplicably feel that I want to raise a child together with my partner.

Untreated childhood PTSD, depression and ADHD will fuck you up. I've been in therapy for 4 years now and while I still have a ways to go I finally found an actual, solid reason to live. One that actually comes from within me instead of only staying alive so the people close to me don't get hurt.

I am the only human being on the planet that carries a blend of both of my Nanas genes. I have several half siblings but I am the only person in the world who gets to carry **both** of them in my genetic code.

They really were amazing people. My Nana on my mom's side lived with us and pretty much raised me, she was a wonderful homemaker and a fantastic artist. She made great food and sweet tea and loved Animal Crossing and Nintendo games. My mother was an abusive narcissist so I have no idea where I'd be if she hadn't been there to support me. Probably dead. 

My Nana on my Dad's side was the first female judge in my county. She was kind to a fault. She donated $20k to a church so they could keep their doors open, and nobody even knew until she was literally on her death bed because she was so humble and wanted to give just for givings sake as opposed to making a show out of doing a good deed. At her funeral there were dozens of cop cars lining the road to pay their socially distanced respects. Putting my thoughts about police aside, it just illustrates how she was so very treasured by so many people.

And I'm lucky enough to have a little bit of both of them built in to me. They were both incredibly special people, and since I carry both of them in my heart and my DNA, maybe one day I can be something special too ❤️",251279,Today I realized exactly why I can't commit suicide.,0,,,,0

It is not, as the title might suggest (and unlike misogynist structures) a call for violence, but more so one to question our perspectives.

This is a movie from my childhood, and I remember trying to think of what kind of with I would be! Potions, fortune telling, and who knows what else my brain could conjure up. It was a lot of fun, especially growing up with four older sisters to play with.

I noticed something interesting during my last watch: this movie does not pass the Bechdel Test. Well, it doesn't pass a gender swapped Bechdel test.

No two named male characters ever speak to each other.

I just found this interesting and refreshing. It's also not centered around a love story like many Disney Princess films. While there is a love *interest*, it is about a girl growing up, finding meaning, and coping with feeling like an outsider. 

This is a female lead movie that understood women have more stories to tell than whether or not they fall in love and get the guy.

Mostly during the night, awake or asleep, I get these scenes. They play out in my mind, and I always see them as first person, so it’s happening to me. Sometimes they involve people I know, in places I go, and I thought that these ones were just dreams. I still think they are and still try to find the meaning in them. However, I also get ones where none of the people are people I know and these ones can be very traumatic. I wake up from these crying or whimpering, they are awful to experience. I call these ones visions, which for some reason my soul tells me are visions of events that will happen to other people in the world. I can’t see faces in these more anonymous, scary visions, so I don’t know who it will happen to, where or when. 
TDLR, I get two kinds of nightmares: dreams and visions, one good and related to me, which I can unpick, and the other awful, upsetting, anonymous and often confusing.

Does anyone have any idea what the difference is, any thoughts, suggestions or even ideas as to what these visions and dreams are? I’ve been mulling over it all for sometime but have come to no conclusions so far. Thank you so much. X",253480,Visions or weird dreams?,0,,,,0

Not exactly about witches, but it is tangentially about the patriarchy, and how it effects me as a 29 year old heterosexual man. 

Over the last few years I’ve been coming to terms with the effects that toxic masculinity has on our society, including myself. It’s come at an unexpected cost though. throughout my adult life most of the women I’ve become romantically attracted started out as friends who over time exhibited qualities I would love in a partner. I’ve never acted on them in the past mostly for fear of rejection and also because I didn’t want my friends to think I only got close with them for the sole purpose of sleeping with them, which is definitely not the case; physical attractiveness is such a small part of what leads me to catch feelings. So I always let these attractions go and eventually the friendships fade in some of the cases. 
In all this I’ve learned that I’ve stopped trusting myself when I’m attracted to someone because I’m worried about the attraction being for the “wrong reasons.” as a result I’ve never fully learned how to approach the subject of romantic attraction with people who I’m attracted too and have been in an almost perpetual “unrequited love” mindset, weary of become a “nice guy” who thinks he’s owed something from the women he’s attracted to. There’s someone I like now and I really want to learn that I can trust myself with my feelings for her and that it’s not purely driven from a sexual attraction (although that’s there too.) I reaaaaallllly don’t wanna fuck this one up because she has every quality I’ve been searching for in a partner. she’s also very much awakened to her divine feminine and very perceptive, and I’m sure she senses my attraction to her.  
I guess I don’t really have a question as much as I’m just looking for reassurance that being attracted to a friend isn’t inherently toxic and maybe ask for some direction on how to approach the subject of m romantic attraction with a woman who can see through everything.

And I really wanted to keep that tradition ongoing with Yule, especially as its one of the more popular and larger pagan holidays of the year.

Unfortunately, this time of year is also hard on a lot of people, myself included. Additionally, because of COVID, myself and many other witches around the world are having extra difficulties being unable to travel and see our families, something that may be extra stressful during such a community-based time of year.

This is a long way of saying that I'm kind of living through that meme of all the different types of depression ganging up someone. As such, I've kind of been working on the Yule post on and off since around Thanksgiving, but I just don't have the mental spoons to keep going with it right now. I went from hoping to have it out early, to hoping to have it out before Yule at all, to composing this post.

I figured if anyone were looking for it or waiting for it, this way you know not to bother. There are a lot of wonderful resources about Yule, both in this sub and elsewhere, and I hope our other witches will continue to share their Yule traditions, photos, stories, and ideas for those budding witches who could use the inspiration (and also for the rest of us who just plain enjoy it).

I hope you all have a wonderful Yule season! I'll hopefully be in a better spot by the time Imbolc comes around.

It’s been months and I really have neglected myself during that time. Yesterday, I think I sat for an hour or two, so soothing and healing, I finally found myself again. 
Feeling much more grounded and strong today as a result. 

To all those who practice mirror work: I am sure you too experience this phenomenon in which all of the sudden your face morphs and you look like a different person! 
For me, the eyes always stay exactly the same, my eyes become the sole focal point, literally like this 👁👁. 

And my facial features change a bit in the beginning, so then I look like a close cousin of myself or like a sister or maybe like my own young aunt. The characters flip by quickly and a lot of people show up in a short period of time. 
To me, it honestly feels like it’s a version of my self in a parallel universe doing mirror work at exactly the same time and this is where we all meet to commune. We all wear the same clothes, we are very closely related and/ or connected, we are all of a sacred sisterhood and on the same life path. 

And when I keep at it, sometimes amphibious-human creatures show up, they seem very powerful, some dark demon like characters also show up with bright red or pitch black skin but I am never truly intimidated and just keep looking at them. We are pretty much at peace, there is no real terror or war going on. 

I haven’t really done a lot of research on this. There might be folklore out there, other than Snow White, that I am unaware of. 

I just once read about this little girl who would stare in the mirror for ours, then turn to her mom and ask: who are all those people in the mirror? 
Yeah, I was and still am just like that.

You know the kind of dream where you wake up and have the feeling like this dream meant something. Thats how intense it was. 

Dream~~

I was laying on the couch with my boyfriend (Dan) as he slept behind me. I was texting my old drug dealer and we were talking about how today felt off for some reason. And I was like “yeah, it must have something to do with the great conjunction.” And right when I said that I saw out my window a giant meteor headed for the earth. I was so scared that I instantly started dissociating feeling like this wasn’t real. All I could do was point at what was happening. But couldn’t move or say anything to wake up Dan. So I just stared in disbelief. As it got closer my mind shifted into thinking it was a nuclear bomb. Just as bomb was about to make
Impact onto the ground it instantly stopped and started hovering up into the sky. I could make it out more clearly and it was actually a meteor and in its crater was glowing green lights. I then had the thought and feeling that this was an alien life force and didn’t know what it was going to do next. I woke up and when I opened my eyes I felt like it was going to be there right in front of me. I even felt like what happened in the dream actually happened. It felt that real and intense. I even had the thought of looking on Reddit to confirm that people are spotting aliens. 

The intensity of the feelings has washed away quite a bit and I have a theory that my dream meant bc of the great conjunction happening and there’s a new shift happening that the dream meant that there’s an ending to how I see things now. Things are developing into new and “alien” (unknown).

I've come for a bit of help, if you will. I am starting a new church called the Church of the Conflagration. It is open to all faiths, creeds, beliefs, backgrounds, and etc., for its purpose is to metaphorically burn away the veil of ignorance and pain through which so many of us must travail on a daily basis.

I believe in the extreme power of perception, and it's direct influence on the world via the untapped might of the human Pineal Gland, and I believe that if I can ignite the passions of the downtrodden then the great Conflagration of life, light, and change can finally consume the world, and burn away the patriarchal way of the world as it now stands.

I foresee this.

But I'm an extreme introvert so it's going to be a massive challenge, and I need help.

I have/had a really good friend. We met on the first day of uni in 2010 and bonded so quickly, we became such good friends. We shared all our secrets/thoughts/desires between us and we each felt like we had one another’s backs. Uni finished and work started, still kept in contact and our friendship was still the same. The thing is we were never the type of friends who had to message each other everyday so we could go weeks sometimes months without a text but when we would meet up it was like nothing had changed, no time had passed since we last met up. 

5 and a half years ago I had a big, traumatic life event, I left my family, friends and whole life behind and had to start over in a new place. That took some time but we were still in touch, I kept her updated and she knew I was safe but we hadn’t seen each other for about a year. Now after that our contact became less and less, we were both busy with our lives. Years of 2016/17/18 we saw each other twice a year and caught up via phonecall/WhatsApp every few months. 2019 we kept making plans and she kept rescheduling and then cancelling altogether. I accepted every excuse and would say “next time” but it was wearing me thin. Our last scheduled meet was dec 2019, we had a plan in place then she wanted to change it super last minute. Our original plan was to meet each other halfway, making it fair imo, then she asked if I could meet her closer to where she works which is also the same town I lived in. It’s a small town and I was told by my parents if I left, never to come back. Obviously there’s a lot of feelings attached to my hometown and how she suggested me going there - even after she knew what happened - well, it just hurt. 

I felt so distant from my friend then 2020 happened which put an end to any kind of meeting up. Our last text exchange was jan 1st 2020, generic happy new year blah blah and today she messaged me happy new year again. After the niceties were over, I wanted to discuss where our friendship was at. I calmly and politely let her know how I was feeling. She had no idea I felt that way and thought everything was fine. She said she respects how I feel and wished me all the best. I did say to her we can either choose to make an effort with each other or just end it and she hasn’t replied to that but I feel like that’s the end. Part of me feels like “enh I’ve lost so many people already, this is just another name to add to the list” but most of me is so upset that I’ve lost someone who was like a sister to me.

Horoscopes Jan 17-27

We began 2021 with a new moon in the sign of Capricorn. Astrologically, each new moon begins a month-long cycle, and the theme this month is all about consciously creating new systems. Unfortunately, due to seemingly endless challenges both personal and collective, clouding any sense of a new beginning, emotions are high, and it is hard to feel hopeful. Perhaps we can take comfort in knowing that the only constant in the universe is change, and things will not be like this forever. Finding ourselves united in new ways, through grief and through hardship- together we are establishing a new reality that is both healthy and supportive. As we also struggle with an endless sense of isolation, we find ourselves asking if things always be this hard.

On the day of the new moon, Venus, the planet of relationships, art, and balance, made a beautiful trine with Uranus, the planet of upheaval and change. This was a fortuitous sign indicating that we can be the change we wish to see. Then the Sun joined with Pluto, illuminating the dark corners in our minds, encouraging us to push past our fears. However, when Jupiter squares Uranus on the 17th, those who feel as though they are being restricted unfairly may be compelled to push back against the powers that be. We are desperate for things to be different, but so much is out of our hands, and those who have grown tired of waiting or intolerant of restrictions may explode. This sense of bubbling frustration and impatience reaches a boiling point on the 20th, when Mars joins Uranus for an exact conjunction. Emotions will be elevated, and explosive erratic behavior is highly likely. 

One of the most difficult human emotions is frustration, and our maturity level dictates how we respond to situations out of our control. Before the full moon at the end of the month, the Sun joins up with Saturn, reminding us that whatever future we build must be done so carefully, with patience, and consideration for others. Without a strong foundation, our castles are made of sand, and the tides of change will wash everything away.

Aries: From the new moon on the 13th until the full moon on the 28th, things will feel challenging for you, Aries.  Your headspace and thought processes are smoothing out with a helpful sextile from Mercury, but as you pursue your dreams and ideas, there continue to be challenges and subsequent frustration. Why can’t things go smoothly? While the moon moves through your sign from the 17th to the 19th, emotions will be running strong, so avoid making hasty decisions. You might not be thinking clearly. For the early Aries born in March, relationships may feel especially challenging right now. Your desire to give or share is often held back when you remember painful experiences, or times you’ve been taken advantage of, but you’re feeling ready to shake the past. It is important to learn from our mistakes, and you’ve done a lot of work recently. Now, in order to move forwards, you’ll have to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. Facing your fears and having faith in yourself are the most important things to focus on right now. For the later Aries born in April, facing your fears seems much harder, because you are still processing what went wrong last time. Try not to overanalyze situations. Recent challenges may have brought you to a place of deep self-doubt, but try to avoid being too hard on yourself. It may help to write down what you have learned. With baby steps you will slowly regain the confidence that you used to have.

Taurus: The planet Uranus has been retrograde in your sign for so long, but now that it’s moving direct, it feels as though progress is finally happening. Your patience and headspace aren’t the best right now, but a helpful angle from Neptune aids your pursuit of ideals, and you’re getting better at taking space before you blow. That being said, when the moon moves through your sign from the 20th to the 22nd, your emotions will be harder to manage. For the Taurus born in April, relating to others and maintaining balance feels easier these days, as a helpful angle from Venus and Pholus add generosity, patience, and warmth. You are not in the mood for anyone’s negativity, but remember that life isn’t always going to be positive. Be mindful of any tendencies towards escapism when it would be healthier to sit with your emotions, or to hold space for someone else to do the same. For the later Taurus born in May, it’s getting easier to process any negative emotions that come up in a healthy way, but you’re feeling unsure of your direction. Recent changes and constant upheaval have left you a bit confused and reconsidering a choice. Allow yourself the time to process any new information or options presented to you, and then make a decision when you’re really feeling ready. Don’t rush anything important!

Gemini: Your ruling planet Mercury is in another air sign, which benefits your headspace as well as your communication. Even though relating to others has been somewhat challenging recently, lightbulb moments of realization are emerging from your interactions. You are not your usual chatty self, but the exchanges you’re having recently have been of such a high quality, they sustain you for days. Your ability to pause before responding is serving you well lately, and patience is a virtue you are currently blessed with. Embracing a fresh awareness and a new perspective, you are (slowly) moving forwards in pursuit of your dreams. However, the journey still feels immense, and for the May Gemini, your direction is still unclear. Take your time sifting through ideas and inspiration, and let curiosity be your guide. For the Gemini born in June, it feels as though you have somewhat of a roadmap, and you are itching to get going. When the moon moves through your sign from the 23rd to the 25th, your emotions may cloud your mind, so don’t make any major decisions during this time, and don’t take yourself too seriously. The dark clouds will pass, and in the meantime, remember your amazing track record so far, and trust in your ability to solve the problems at hand. 

Cancer: Your dreams have been wild lately, but not always easy to remember when you wake up. A lingering sense of deja-vu seems to follow you through your days. Unfortunately, your thoughts stop and start like an engine that just can’t get going, so let go of trying to figure everything out.  Moods seem to shift so quickly lately, and it feels hard to get comfortable.  It may help to change your environment, in order to get in tune with the rhythm of your heart and spirit.  From the 25th to the 27th, emotional experiences will be the most intense, but this unsettled feeling will be here for a while due to a challenging aspect with Mars, the planet of action. Wanting to help or affect change is so frustrating when you feel powerless- but even if we cannot do something big, a small gesture can mean the world. Also, sometimes being present with compassion can be the best thing to do when a problem does not have a solution. For the early Cancerian, Venus and Pholus opposing your Sun are drawing out the unconditionally loving part of you. As you witness pain and suffering all around, you are compelled to act, and your thoughtfulness and kindness are appreciated more than words can say. Cancers born in July are struggling with low energy levels these days, due to the Sun at full opposition, so don’t expect too much from yourself. It’s hibernation time!

Leo: Due to the challenging angle Neptune is forming with your sign, you are likely dealing with some sense of disillusionment. Something you hoped dreamed or wished for recently fell apart, and it is hard not to feel shattered right now. Frustration is the dominant energy right now for your sign, but remember that when one door closes, another opens. Consider that this “curse” may actually be a blessing in disguise. There is nothing left to do but move forwards, and action will come easier to the Leo born in August. This is a great time to channel that bright positivity you are famous for, instead of dwelling in disappointment, because an angle from Pluto indicates you may get lost there.  Receiving a gentle boost from Mars, your plans will start to come together- provided you put in the effort- so just keep trying. For the early Leo born in July, your direction may not be clear yet, but you are making peace with situations outside of your control. For you, it is easier right now to deal with the negative feelings that seem to come in waves. Due to Mercury’s position opposite your sign, all Leos are feeling sociable or chatty right now, so use that energy to your advantage- you never know when someone else’s idea will unlock something that was stuck for you!

Virgo: Neptune makes a conjunction with Ceres this week, opposite your sign. This may be felt as a wistful craving of the success you see in others, but remember to have patience- your day will come. All good things take time. Also keep in mind that success never comes easy, there’s always hard work or impeccable timing involved. Because Mercury is not playing nice with your sign right now, your logical side isn’t cooperating. When your typically organized and efficient brain fails you, what can you do? It is time to keep your goals small and attainable, and your schedule light. For the Virgo born in August, progress is happening, albeit slowly. Your patience is unusually high, and even moments of frustration offer brilliant flashes of insight. Virgos born later in the sign have made serious headway recently with inner (and outer) demons but are not feeling sure about where life is going right now. Enjoy the journey as much as you can without worrying about the destination if you can help it. Later in the month, relationships will become challenging, so this is the best time for negotiations or working something out with a difficult person. Your keen eye for detail is not as sharp as it usually is, so take your time, and don’t rush any major decisions. An upcoming Mercury retrograde next month will affect all Virgos, so now is the time to take care of anything important, sort out details, and tie up loose ends. Don’t procrastinate!

Libra: You have been on a roll lately- chatty, organized, and motivated! Make hay while the sun shines, Libra, it will not always be this easy. Mercury bestows blessings this month, but next month presents massive challenges. Not everything is ideal right now, but making the best of what you have is something you have got down to an art. Early Libras born in September are struggling a bit with relationships. If it feels like you are doing all the work, consider this- there is a possibility that you are chasing, but it is also possible that you’re feeling more grounded than most people around you. In a healthy relationship, people take turns leaning on each other. On any level, if you have put in a valiant attempt, yet your efforts come to nothing, consider redirecting your energy instead of doggedly pursuing an unattainable goal. For the later Libras born in October, frustration might be getting the best of you. Despite your clear headspace and high energy, forces outside of your control keep throwing you curveballs. Share your experience and invite input from someone you would not usually think to ask, because this time the answers you seek will not be found in the places you typically look.  One conversation can change your entire perspective! 

Scorpio: With your creativity peaking and your logic struggling, motivation seems to come and go like the tides in the ocean. When you need to work, the energy fades. And, when you are ready to rest, inspiration strikes like a bolt of lightning!  Good grief! If possible, make your own schedule, aligning with what your body and your spirit truly need. Early Scorpios are in a good groove when it comes to relating to others, but currently struggling with doubt. Mars and Uranus opposite your sign puts an emphasis on the support you receive from others, and how important reflections are when it comes to our sense of success and self worth. Do you feel comfortable sharing that you are struggling, or feel as though you must pretend that you’re okay? Conversations with people you feel safe with can replenish your thirsty heart. Scorpios born in November are having an easier time with the emotional ebb and flow, but feeling a bit lost in space. It’s not that anything is wrong, it’s just the sense that it could be better. No sense in making a decision just for the sake of changing something- wait until you’re truly inspired, and sure, before you leap.

Sagittarius: It is hard when your brain is going a mile-a-minute, yet it’s time to sleep. With your problem-solving capabilities at full steam, it may be difficult to wind down at the end of the day, so consider incorporating physical exercise or meditation into your routine. Despite your keen mental abilities, challenges seem insurmountable these days, and the hits just keep coming. For the early Sagittarius born in November, relationships feel awkward, progress feels stalled, and sometimes you just want to throw in the towel. Don’t give up! This too shall pass. For the Sagittarius born later in the sign, negative thoughts continue to be a challenge, but you are finding new and creative ways to keep busy. Any form of channeling excess energy or overwhelming emotions is helpful, no matter the format. A healthy goal for your sign right now is to avoid holding stress in your body, by finding a healthy way to release it. Movement, art, or screaming into the void- it is all productive.

Capricorn: The new moon on the 13th realigned your heart and your head. What a nice reset to start the year! Now, with a fresh sense of clarity, you are ready to pursue some dreams or ideas that have been turning around in your mind. Unfortunately, not everyone understands what you are thinking, and recent conversations have not been as supportive as you hoped. It is deeply disappointing to not receive the encouragement you have shown others in the past, but resentment will only distract you right now. Try not to let other people’s inability to be there for you deter you from your goals, keep doing what you are doing. Early Capricorns born in December will feel as though action is happening and your efforts seem to pay off quickly, but Capricorns born later in the sign have many hurdles ahead of them still. Unfortunately, things will not be so easy for you- but determination is your middle name, and patience is your game. With the Sun and Pluto in your sign, your energy is relatively high, and your tenacious spirit will help you overcome any obstacles in your way.

Aquarius:  Ever since the new moon on the 13th, there has been a planetary party in your sign! Many of the big names are attending- Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, and even the moon for a couple of days. Although you would think all this attention would be inspirational, you are bouncing between inspired and flatlining these days. Maybe it is a bit too much energy? You know what you want, but your goals and ideals seem a million miles away from where you are right now, and you just do not have the energy for extra work. Early Aquarius sun signs born in January may be feeling especially stuck, and deeply frustrated. If your headspace becomes too dark, contemplate what is sinking your ship. It is time to throw extra weight overboard to save yourself, and reach out for a spark, any light you can find. For those born in February, the support you so desperately need doesn’t seem to be there, and unfortunately, you’re struggling with a sense of isolation. For you, quiet moments of reflection, spending time outside, and the occasional guttural scream into the void will help you purge the negativity inside of you. Make a habit of nurturing yourself on a daily basis, meeting your basic needs (drink lots of water), and reflect on what’s bringing you down the most. You have the courage to change what you can, and the wisdom to leave the rest. 

Pisces: This week, on the 20th, there will be a rare conjunction of Neptune and Ceres in your sign. Neptune represents dreams, intuition, and our ideals; and Ceres is the Earth Goddess, representing what we nurture, as well as our personal seasons. There is a sense of magic in the air, and the feeling that something truy special is underway- although logically you cannot explain it. For the early Pisces born in February, relationships feel supportive, action is happening, but self-doubt keeps nagging at you. Remember comparison is the thief of joy, and try to be your own cheerleader. For the Pisces born in March, the opposite is true. You are feeling a new sense of confidence, but action is not happening- at least not the way you expected or hoped. You will receive advice or inspiration from someone that leads to a massive breakthrough, so keep asking for help, and keep an open mind.",265583,Hello everyone!

I'm an artist that mainly works with art installations. My work always included mythical and magical elements, mostly otherworldly creatures and hybrids, even when I was not consciously or consistently practicing the craft. 

The last few years I have been both conscious and consistent about it and of course this has become apparent to the themes that concern me art wise. 

Lately, I have become very interested in the altars people create in their own homes. Of course I have my own altar at home and I gradually form my very own relationship with it, as I evolve in my practice. Meanwhile, I really have the need to learn how people interact with their own altars, the meaning they have for them and how this translates in aesthetic and material terms. 

So what I'm asking from you my dear fellow witches is help for my artistic research. If you want to, you can share with me pictures of your altars, stories and ideas behind them. I want to gather as much information and material as possible. I'm not really sure what I'll do with it, in first place I'm more interested to share and get insight from other practitioners.

If you are interested you can first comment here or directly pm me. I'm more than happy to interact with you.

Someone recommended I post it here as well. If this isn't the place, just let me know.*

This is a pretty intense situation that is still developing, so details will be vague. If there is somewhere else I could post this, please let me know. 

This pertains to the Catholic organization Opus Dei. I became aware of/involved with this situation when an elected official in California reached out to me. I am currently the only person talking about and presenting information on YouTube about Opus Dei, and they came across one of my videos while doing research. I feel somewhat unprepared for the immensity of the situation, but this is important and needs to be dealt with properly. If you're unfamiliar with what Opus Dei is and what they're capable of, I'll make sure all my past posts on this are visible.

Over the past decade, Opus Dei has systematically established themselves in the Silicon/Napa Valley area. The general public is totally unaware, even as the organization uses public money to fund their schools and special interests. This is a problem because of the staunchly neo-fundamentalist, anti-LGBTQ, anti-women beliefs that they promote. It goes without saying that Opus Dei has the right to practice and believe whatever they want. However, doing so while not being transparent with the public is a major issue. The individual that reached out to me had become aware of the situation when they ran against and almost lost a local election to someone associated with Opus Dei. They began digging and found a web of Opus Dei-run orgs, businesses, and centers throughout California and their area that has quietly been taking over for the past decade. This starts at the local level and goes all the way up to the state. It should go without saying that, gone unchecked, Opus Dei poses a real threat to the democratic process. The public should be aware of what their tax dollars are going towards and be able to make informed decisions during elections. This is about freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and preservation of the democratic process. 

This is where the call to action comes in. The politician in California that has been in touch with me is attempting to create a network of activists across California who can help raise awareness and educate others on what Opus Dei is doing. They don't need a ton of people, but anyone who wants to help needs to be in California at the least, and it would be best if you're in the Napa/Silicon area. Because this is still a developing situation, any volunteers would have a big role to play in assisting in developing a plan to educate and reach the public. 

IF YOU WANT TO HELP:
Please send me a message. I will put you in touch with my contact in California. We are trying to have something of a plan put together by the second or third week of February.  I don't know how to drive home how real this is. If you know anything about Opus Dei, maybe you'll understand. If you are a believer in human rights, an ally or member of the LGBTQ community, and you're in the area, your help would be so appreciated.

""Men only care about themselves. Who needs them anyway?!"" she muses, as she lounges in her college dorm room in a building built by men, in her final semester studying ""Gender and Sexuality Studies,"" her $55,000 per year tuition being paid for by her father -- a man. She gets up to go to the corner store to buy some lip gloss at 1AM at night.

""Patriarchy is just about perpetuating rape culture!"" she thinks, as she walks alone in the middle of the deserted street that is brightly lit due to street lamps installed by men, in a neighborhood that is completely safe because of a massive police presence ready to use deadly force at a moment's notice, a police presence consisting of men. She buys the lip gloss and heads back to the dorm.

""Toxic masculinity is the worst,"" she sighs, as she tosses the lip gloss packaging into the trash, trash that is collected and disposed of by men in landfills maintained by men as part of a massive network of utilities and services provided by men, in a country that is defended from the possibility of foreign invasion because of an army of men willing to die for the protection of the nation's interests, including its women and children. She applies the lip gloss and picks up her $800 iPhone for a selfie.

""Things would be soo much better if women ruled the world,"" she smiles contentedly, as she posts her selfie to Instagram, hoping that that rich, smart, good-looking guy in her network of friends will notice and show interest in her, maybe send her a flirty message, maybe one thing leads to another, maybe he sweeps her off her feet, but in a way that totally respects her independence and her lack of need for men in any way, shape, or form. Instead that ""ugly"" guy who drives an old Camry DMs her, asking if she is interested in going out.

""OH MY GOD, what is this creep doing, trying to get in my DMs, pushing himself on me?!"" she sneers, as she hastily prepares a #metoo social media post about sexual harassment, male privilege, and perpetual female victimhood, once again typing angrily on a $3000 laptop developed and paid for by men. She decides to go to bed.

She closes her eyes, but she is seething with rage. She tosses and turns, hatred keeping her up later into the night. Finally, she dozes off as one last thought crosses her tortured mind: ""Men are trash!""",263204,Down with the patriarchy!,0,,,,1

For those of you who may be wondering why some people feel as though it is a “closed” practice, I’ll do my best to summarize:

       *the descendants of the Romani who were historically discriminated against and forced into the role of fortune telling due to lack of job opportunity are the only people who should be partaking in their ancestral trade, out of respect*



The practice of cartomancy using tarot decks is passed down from generation to generation. It is also believed that gorges are not able to connect in the same way when practicing due to the various intricacies which are taught (not read) and are therefore, just playing with a deck of cards.

On the other hand, Oracle decks are fair game for any person of any background. There are also multiple other divination tools which are considered “open.” 

•For those who are Rom/descendants of, what say you? 

•Folks who have no relation to the culture, are you aware of the discourse involved with tarot? (This is a genuine question, and not at all meant to read as snarky or condescending!)
