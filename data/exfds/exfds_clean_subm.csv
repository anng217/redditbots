&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ratajkowski added to her essay, ""I like the idea of forcing as few gender stereotypes on my child as possible""  
&gt;  
&gt;I've known far too many white men who move through the world unaware of their privilege, and I've been traumatized by many of my experiences with them  
And boys too; it's shocking to realize how early young boys gain a sense of entitlement — to girls' bodies and to the world in general  
How do I raise a child who learns to like themself while also teaching them about their position of power in the world?

Why they can't see the contradiction ! you can't be against gender stereotypes and then perpetuate the stereotype that only men and boys are abusers and only women and girls are victims ! apparently feminists only oppose stereotypes that are harmful to women and girls (misogyny) but not stereotypes that harm men and boys (misandry)

And what about female privilige ? they still pretend that it dosn't exist ! ask a male and a female friends to call government funded domestic violence shelter and see who is the priviliged.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My friend who is the mother to a three-year-old boy tells me that she didn't think she cared about gender until her doctor broke the news that she was having a son. She burst into tears in her office. ""And then I continued to cry for a whole month,"" she says matter-of-factly. After a difficult birth experience, she developed postpartum depression and decided that she resented her husband more than she'd ever imagined possible. She told me she particularly hated — and she made an actual, physical list that she kept in her journal, editing it daily — how peacefully he slept. ""There is nothing worse than the undisturbed sleep of a white man in a patriarchal world.""

What is this ? gender equality ? no. this is hate. this is pure hatred against men and boys. what caused the hate is the patriarchy theory. All feminists (radical, liberal and intersectional) support the patriarchy theory. men are considered oppressors simply for existing as men. Robin Morgan the editor of Ms Magazine the biggest feminist magazine said "" I feel that ‘man-hating’ is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***It was hard to come to terms with the fact that I was bringing yet another white man into the world***. But now I adore him and can't imagine it any other way."" She also eventually learned to love her husband again. The sound of his perfect sleep next to her at night is now tolerable.

You can't believe in feminism (radical and liberal) and not hate men, boys and masculinity. and if you believe intersectional feminism the hate will also include white people too.",271,""" It was hard to come to terms with the fact that I was bringing yet another white man into the world.

Firstly, I'm married I dont need a dating strategy (... who does?). But I talk to young people alot about many things including love and relationships. FDS caught my eye because it was the first time someone else was saying something I was too which leads me to the first points Ill lay out the things I like about FDS;

1. They challenge the idea women need men (to be happy). The best dating strategy (or whatever) is to work on yourself first and then invite other people in to share your life ...if you even want that... not to try and gain happiness from another person. 
2. They are WGTOW. In an attempt to explain to me they are not WGTOW they made this idea more clear to me, I have always felt we needed a mgtow for women to deal with the first point...

Now what I dont like or at least what ruined the illusion that this was meaningful change;

1. Wgtow isnt women going there own way its literally mgtow for women that is to say, they sit around and complain about the opposite sex all the time instead of you know ...going there own way. I really dont know what I expected. mgtow and wgtow are birds in a cage with the door open talking about flying away when they could just fly away instead.
2. The misogyny. This is the first thing I noticed that sowed the seeds of discontent for me. Fair enough they hate men and whatever like their hot takes are adorable and tired and not revolutionary at all, but the hatred they spew for pickmes and non-FDS is unacceptable. Pickmes and whatever else need to be viewed with charity and patience.
3. Eugenics. Female sexual selection may be important and may be good. But, eugenics is a giant red flag. Unacceptable. Any doctrine with eugenics in it is automatically unacceptable, giant red flags with white circles and black swastika territory. Yes free speech is a thing, yes debate is a thing yes we can have a discussion about eugenics - conveinently its already been had and won not by the pro-eugenics side. There was even a war involved in that discussion, like the largest war in all history. Like holy fuck. Pro-eugenic rhetoric the whole thing, that was the fuck this I'm out point. Their inability to accept things like men with disability leads me to wonder what they would think of women with disabilties for example.
3. The lgbt-phobia, I am not a hvm, or a hvw, im not trying to be, im trying to be a good person. Their disallowance of alternative gender expression and male lgbt culture is not congruent with basic human decency and leads to to question how they treat lgbt women - not as well as they could afaik

I might be off the mark here, but something that started out so promising just had the ass fall out of it for me, Im so dissapointed in the movement and in myself for getting my hopes up.

Given this and any other feedback I can gain from you guys I wanna lay out what an acceptable format of FDS might look like.",264,"I love some things about FDS, other things... are kinda icky",0,,,,0

I've not always agreed with every single thing (the idea of the man providing has always made me quite uncomfortable) and I encountered a few rays of sunshine (""You're gonna get date raped if you continue like this""). I always ignored comments like these and did my own thing.

Anyway about two days ago there was a thread about sex workers and I mentioned that some of them might not necessarily have the resources to find other jobs (I have a sociology qualification where I researched about the sex industry and why women can't get out of it so I like to think I know a decent amount). I was attacked for that. I mentioned minimum wage jobs might not necessarily help single mothers because of extra costs like childcare and medication. Got attacked for that as well despite me saying I didn't support the conditions sex workers are in. I consider myself a huge feminist but I do also think if you're not willing to support all kinds of women, you're not really a feminist at all.

let's face it, with all the slutshaming around, it's just impossible for a more conservative woman to learn about their own bodies, so what can you expect from strangers? 

i've heard so many stories of bad sex, women literally just lay there and be totally passive.

another thing is that, people are just not supposed to click sexually. and sometimes you just don't and that's ok. that does not make them a bad person. that could mean a lot of different things. not everyone is supposed to have sexual chemistry with you. and even if they are genuinely bad at sex, that does not make them a bad person, or low quality. no one wants to be bad at sex. that's why people date, to check for sexual chemistry, because sex is a huge part of relationship and can be a source of tension. 

not to mention that you're just as responsible for your own orgasm, if not more, than your partner. i've been with a lot of guys and so far none of them have been selfish or refused to do what i ask of them. most of them seem to prioritize me more and put myself first during sex. it makes me wonder what kind of men FDS women have been seeing. could it be maybe they treat sex as some kind of test to see how this guy would do and treat it like some kind of test and again fall into the self fulfilling prophecy syndrome? i mean, there are many comments there literally talking about how they will not tell men this or that or give them clues, and proudly saying they will not reciprocate. girl, that sounds like you're setting this up for failure anyways so maybe don't be so shocked. 

idk, maybe  try masturbating while watching some gay porn, maybe that will teach you that good sex require work.",348,"for all this reverse-bragging about bad sex in r/fds, can we just admit that straight people are just bad at sex, and part of that is because of all of the slut shaming and how women often forbid themselves from exploring and understanding their sexuality.",0,,,,0

well kinda, i guess it goes without saying that straight men don't usually get matches on tinder as opposed to women who always get unwanted attention. but   hot men with high prospects do, and they have options here too, even more so than an average woman, because ultimately, by the way that they operate, it's the men who eventually chooses. 

tbh i haven't think about it like this before because dating has been fun and easy to me. but  you can't seriously think that when all the men who has pursued you are bad, it's not because you haven't done any active decision in choosing a man and then go through the same pattern again. lol.",344,the way that we tell women not to pursue good men because good men will do the pursuing and then get mad when we are pursued by bad men is quite funny.,0,,,,0

and being high strung and keeping scores  with all  the brainwashing that happens in r/FDS , are just proof of emotional baggage which demands emotional labor from your partner, which means you are just as much of an emotional black hole. 

this could have been solved if everyone just strives to be a normal person in a normal couple instead of looking at everything transactionally, like incels do. which explains that fds are just teaching women to be gold diggers, both figuratively and literally. if your emotional baggage is too heavy, you need a therapist, not a boyfriend, and none of your relationship will succeed.",335,not sure who needs to hear this but your emotional baggage is still an emotional labor for your partner to endure.,0,,,,0

\- I called out a user who said men’s legs are hairy and ugly, and that men’s bodies were ugly. 😯 That’s not nice. I love men’s legs. I asked if he should shave them for her. probably flagged the police. 🚨 

\- I said his legs are muscular. A self proclaimed fitness person said actually they are fat legs. wups.

\- I asked if the sub was terf 🚨 👮‍♀️ in response to some sourceless statistics shared by a terf tumblr account. This post got cancelled shortly after my comment. I cant find any declarations on trans people on FDS and realized, wow I don’t know if this is legit. maybe I’m dumb for not realizing how pseudo terf the operation is. if this is the case, they are skating on thin ice skirting hate speech to our trans sisters.

\- I questioned whether it was a big deal if your gift was something you went out and bought yourself with money gifted to you, versus something a guy went and picked out for you and bought.

\- I said I don’t let guys buy me clothes because they never get me what I want, and I like picking it out.

\- “He can look up your size, or go on your Pinterest, he has no excuse not to find you nice clothes! A gift card, cmon. (I actually agree, yeah)

\- I said I wasn’t gifty and people in my family never bought gifts and literally just chilled on xmas, and were there for each other year round.. and made extra careful to say After, “but buying gifts is important and good, and Im trying to come at you from a perspective that explains where some women are coming from.“ because this is what I believe, but maybe came off as insincere.

\- a user said in response to my downvoted non gifty comment, that her dad bought her mom designer stuff Every year. 💅  like sassily..  I said mine didn’t do that and my mom doesn’t want designer shoes or bags or rings from my dad, but gets support writing books, and I grew up thinking that it was trashy and bad to ask men for stuff, but am growing out of it and learning to appreciate material stuff bc FDS, and de-program that inside of me......... and i think they hit the eject button.

hm maybe that sounds bad, maybe that was it. 

i would always try to bring the topic back to FDS, if there was dissonance, and affirm,

 “but I am not saying this to deny the ideology, x is important” 

or “i used to x, but I have changed since”, 

or “but this can offer perspective as to why some women are in x position” 

but it’s a lot of work to curate posts to a thin skinned group of people who may be running a hate speech sub, akin to somehow mashing the a SCUM manifesto into The Rules. (which is why I love FDS  💕)

  
Honestly, it was a good time, and some of the advice is actually very solid, so it’s really a shame. 🤷‍♀️

However, I'm suddenly being hit with thoughts that my feelings cant be real. That I'm some flavour of pickme or I am trying to erase womanhood or I'm rejecting femininity bc a LVM has left me bitter.

Instead I'll be posting some compilations I've found over the last few months.

First, I'd like to get some obvious points about FDS out of the way that are unrelated or loosely related to the 'hate' part.

1. the flair 'FDS Rescue Mission' was used to brigade subreddits like r/AITA and r/relationships and other relationship advice subreddits under the guise of ""rescuing p\*ckmeishas"" (note that the definition of ""p\*ckmeisha"" itself varies depending on who you talk to and how much of a TERF they are)
2. the flair 'Male Depravity' was used to systematically indoctrinate FDSers into thinking that AMALT (""All Men Are Like That"").  Instances of men being abusive are documented here.  While I was on the subreddit, there was an appeal to the moderators to remove the flair because it was affecting the mental health of a lot of users adversely.  The moderators told us to ""filter the flair"" which is something that can only be done when you're on the subreddit itself, and not from your Reddit main feed/ homepage.  As a ""female"" dating strategy subreddit, I don't think it was out of line for us to expect that our needs be taken care of by the moderators first, since most women already agreed that posts appearing under the 'Male Depravity' flair showcase, well, sufficiently depraved behaviour (like sexual harassment, rape, FGM -- female genital mutilation, child molestation etc) for us to never ever date these men.  So it was a bit of a useless flair, and the comments always turned to AMALTing anyway, and some Newbies (including me) didn't like that because we knew that, well, NAMALT. **NOTE**: **this flair has also been used against trans women in the past! (obviously, this qualifies as hatred)** Something else to think about is how, in order to avoid potentially triggering content, FDS users are forced to stay on the subreddit and browse FDS only.  
3. their Twitter account, [@FemDatStrat](https://twitter.com/FemDatStrat), retweets almost exclusively from TERFs and transphobic Twitter accounts.  Liberal feminists (or ""libfems"" in femcel speak) are regularly degraded in these retweets.  This, however, can't be used against the subreddit itself because we don't know which of the moderators runs that account.  It's quite possible that FDS just happened to be infiltrated by TERFs and wasn't originally intended for that purpose, but it must be noted that if you do want to at least pretend to support trans people, you would ban TERFs from your subreddit, which is something FDS does not do.  (**Also hate)**
4. The 'Roast-A-Scrote' flair has been used to shame plus-sized men, men with undiagnosed mental illnesses, and also to dox men.  Names and photos aren't blurred out.   Personally I detested this flair when I was on FDS.
5. The flair 'Scrotation Report' is a classic gender reversal of the MRA/ PUA/ incel 'plate spinning' rhetoric.  FDS says women should stay away from men who date multiple women, but don't refrain from encouraging their users to date multiple men themselves.  There is a common thread of dehumanizing the opposite gender (doesn't matter to them if said members of the opposite gender is a chill person or an abuser).  MRA/ MGTOW/ PUA/ incels like to make arbitrary rhetorical excuses when called out on this dehumanization.  FDS and MGTOW users both use random unrelated events to bolster their generalist sexist rhetoric.  Frequently, on both types of fora, racist hatred is seen, sometimes propagated by people who belong to that race themselves.  (Sorry, I don't know the proper term for this, English is not my first language.  But basically it's r/AsABlackMan material.)  A lot of... dick shaming (like actual penis shaming where FDSers wax eloquent about how PENIS MAN BAD) also happens on this flair.
6. the flair 'Cockholm Syndrome' is used as a proxy flair to dehumanize women who don't conform to FDS's arbitrary standards for not being a ""p\*ckmeisha"".  How do we know the standards are arbitrary?  Because whenever you ask an FDSer what characterizes a ""p\*ckmeisha"" they'll throw some random feminist buzzwords at you (which have actual academic definitions, btw, but it's not like FDSers care about that anyway \*rolls eyes\*) and will contradict themselves in the next comment.  We can see this happening in real-time on this subreddit sometimes.  Come watch the show!
7. FDS thinks everyone on here is a cis man.  This speaks for itself, really.  If you search for exfds using the Reddit search bar, you'll see a recent post about how ""male LARPers"" (I don't know exactly who this is talking about) ""crying about getting banned from FDS at r/exfds"".  And if you consider how 'stringent' the mods claim to be about doing background checks to see if new members are cis women or not, shouldn't there *not* be as high an influx of cis men as they claim there is?  So are the mods very competent, or are they incompetent?  Which one is it?
8. Back when I was on FDS, the mods were heavily advertising for some sort of official FDS Discord server.  To join the Discord server, you had to provide a photo of yourself with your Reddit username (or something along those lines, probably your real name), proof of address or a voice recording.

Enough dunking.  Now for the receipts.

[An r/ unpopularopinion post causes mods of r/ femaledatingstrategy to lock down the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ik8of4/an_runpopularopinion_post_causes_mods_of/) If you go to this link and click through the thread on r/ unpopularopinion, you'll find a guy detailing his experiences dating someone who was on FDS.  Needless to say ***\*narrator voice\**** that shit was pretty bad.  SRD is a pretty chill subreddit though, people there just laugh at everything.  Also no hate speech is allowed, unlike most of the rest of Reddit, which is a very welcome change from being called a ""White man's wh\*re"" because you decide not to date misogynists who happen to be POC.  Sweet mother of God, u/spez really needs to get his shit together and stop wanking to the next Hot racist sexist Nazi subreddit (sorry, spez, but you had a chance to fix this and you still haven't.  Very annoying for the snowflakes like us who'd rather not be targeted by racist hatred online).

Too many women on there complain about how shitty common sex acts are and how men are so unclean. Literally,  are they scaping the bottom of the barrel? I've had plenty of sex in my 39 years and have never once had the complaints these women have. They bitch about wanting a HVM, but clearly they are low value or you wouldn't attract such low value men. 

Sure many of them are trying to improve themselves and yes we should have standards but the creators and moderators give women such a bad name. I'm so embarrassed for them. 

In the end, I realized by the comments that many of these women have been abused in relationships and struggle to find an identity and are right back in the cycle of latching into another unhealthy relationship (with FDS) and having someone tell them how to think and act.

I am so glad that this subreddit exists. ❤ I hope more women someday will wake up and see that FDS is a terrible subreddit and that they will leave the toxicity and come here instead. 

I wanted to share my story on this subreddit. 

I was banned from FDS last night with no warning and wondered what the hell I could of have possibly done wrong because I followed all of their ridiculous strict as fuck rules, and I got banned from there all because in the FDS chatroom I said I was going to make a subreddit teaching men how they could be a HVM (and learn to be good men, if they struggle with things.) Instead of being supported *gasp* I thought they loved HVM! 🙄 I got jumped on and I'm sure some of the ladies in that chatroom reported me to the mods and I got banned. I messaged the mods finding out at least why I got banned. No response, OFC. I was so angry at first that I had to go and journal to try to calm myself down. I'll admit, I was vulernable to them... I recently got my heartbroken nearly 2 months ago and I thought that FDS was the way to go. Now I see that it's not the way to go. I now saw the subreddit for what it really is... A toxic, hateful subreddit towards men and women. I have lurked FDS for almost a year, so I have seen a lot of things. 

They are misandrist. I thought maybe they would like at least some men. Nope. They hate ALL men. Even the HVM from the few snippets I have come across. That and the reason I was banned solidifies that point. They hate ALL men. Even HVM. They even so much as think that HVM don't even exist... What even... They have no right to call themselves feminists. They are feminazis. 

They are Misogynistic. Believe it or not, FDS is also misogynistic because they are inwardly misogynistic towards women. They hate pickmeishas or any woman that doesn't agree with FDS or follow FDS THEIR way or 100%. They hate sex workers and trans women. 

They are Ableist. I have aspergers syndrome and am on the autism specturm. All of the hate towards people with autism is DISGUSTING! It's insulting for someone who actually has it to see all of that shit. It's hurtful. They also are Ableist towards anyone that is ADHD, neurodiverse, or has any kind of mental illness... 

I have heard some stories saying that they are also homophobic, racist, and transphobic. The thing I know for sure is that they are SWERFS and TERFS and that the hate transgendered folk and that they are not allowed near that subreddit with a ten foot pole. 

I have seen them make male genocide comments ages ago... I remember browsing almost a year ago and on a post about abortions they said something about ""aborting all male babies."" And I felt that was so fucking disgusting! I would NEVER abort my baby if I found out it was gonna be a male. I would love him, just like I would still love the child if it was a female. 

I am honestly so surprised Reddit hasn't banned or quarantined them yet... They should be! Just like GC and PPF and even the male subreddits that got banned like Red pill, Incels, and MGTOW... They are nothing but a hate group. 

And they say they are nothing like the Red Pill. Yeah right. They are the female equilivillent. 

The only good thing I liked about FDS was the fact they promote trying to level up and avoiding bad men and unhealthy relationships. Common sense shit that you could probably find on another subreddit. 🙄 The rest of it is a dumpster fire. They just complain about men and Pickmeishas. 

Goodbye FDS! Thank you for banning me. I am glad to be freed from your toxic ass subreddit. Oh and btw... I did make my own subreddit. I hope it will grow someday. 💁

An ex-question that wouldn’t get posted on FDS.

Full disclaimer: I am a man. Leftist / I admit we live in a patriarchy. I’d love some honest answers and feedback.

1.

The whole concept of a HVM and anticipating men to pay for most everything is absurd. I can understand if, when looking for a long term relationship, you want somebody to be stable. But doesn’t this discount all the potential HVMs that are struggling financially? I mean isn’t the economy in utter shit? Especially for young people, having to set aside income for student loans, as well as a deteriorating job market, it seems to me the concept of “poverty” on /r/FDS associated with a lack of ability and character flaws as opposed to anything substantive.

I just don’t understand how you can subscribe to the belief in a patriarchy (which in my eyes seems fairly leftist and “woke”) and not acknowledge society’s disenfranchisement of the poor.

2.

Wouldn’t a lot of “high value males” see a rigorous philosophy regarding men and dating as a negative quality within a woman? I mean we understand how women feel about MGTOW and TheRedPill. Why wouldn’t it go both ways?

I think the women at FDS really don't consider that a lot of guys are not going to pursue you if they don't feel like they have at least a little bit of a chance with you.

My main problem with dating was that I wasn't making guys feel comfortable around me. I came off very unapproachable and cold at times. I never initiated any dates or texts and eventually guys (IRL) would just stop trying and revert back to acquaintance/friend. 

When I genuinely tried to be warmer, and more receptive to them, and maybe tried to initiate a few texts here or there, I found the response from men was much better. They felt more comfortable around me and therefore were more enthusiastic about me. 

I just don't understand FDS playbook of waiting for the guy to make all the moves or acting disinterested, etc. Has this actually worked for anyone?",387,Does the avoidant/passive approach to dating that FDS supports work for anyone? I've done this all my life and it's never helped me.,0,,,,1

I suspect they banned me for saying I prefer Bumble because I can chose who to talk to instead of being bombarded with unwanted messages from men I'm not interested in. Or for saying that I refuse to commit to a dinner on the first date becauseInsee it as a waste of time. But anyway, there are way too many crazy ladies there and apparently mods are also not very stable. 

The idea behind the sub is great - don't  be a doormat, don't entertain time wasters and fuckbois if you are looking for a relationship, remove yourself immediately form an uncomfortable situatuon, etc. with which I wholeheartedly agree and which got me interested in the sub in the first place. 

However, even though the handbook is mostly based on commin sense and couldbe useful for women who coulduse some guidance regarding boundaries and self respect, it seams that the sub itself it's not about dating at all but rather about hating ALL men and women who enjoy intimate relationships with men and who are still interested in dating. There are hardly any posts about actual dating strategies and mostly ""see, they are all monsters"" posts. 

There are, of course, incels and shitheads who make dating a little more difficult that I'd prefer, but my overall experience is so much better than experience of 99% of women in that sub which makes me think that they are not very good at vetting and keep choosing the wrong men and confirming their bias against the whole gender. 

The observation that shocked me is that there are way too many women there who had never enjoyed sex, never had a normal, not dysfunctional relationship, have never been loved or just treated well by men, and overall had only negative experience. It's very sad and sometimes disturbing to see that many women living like that and making a conscious choice to indulge in such misery and projecting it on the world around them.

They keep making it clear HVMs have to be attractive so basically they want this attractive simp to serve them for the rest of their marriage and be happy about it.
