Na. If you genuinely did care for Transwomen you would acknowledge their unique life experience that deserves its own attention and resources.

223,"Actually no, what I was trying to say is that the people disagreeing with me had an overly simplistic view on getting out of sex work. It's not as easy as it's said to be.

Okay lol first of all how DARE you bring your trans-phobic bullshit here by saying their experience of dating and sex is not like that of a cis-woman's. I know a few trans women and it's not that different at all. Trans women are women and they always will be. The fact you're suggesting they aren't women due to biology gives me the impression you view cis-women as nothing other than walking vaginas (which is an attitude you probably need to work on). Please don't call yourself a feminist if you're not willing to support them. As I said before, trans women go through enough crap in their lives, they certainly don't need a sub undermining their sexuality purely because of what genitals they have.

I agree that FDS is great for helping weed out the timewasters but if I have to be transphobic (despite being LBGT myself) to fit into that group then it definitely wasn't for me.

The OP posted it as an example of a HVM. Some people on there started saying it's actually low value, that a drive-in movie is horrible first date, they expect to be taken to a fancy restaurant etc etc etc. The guy had obviously been in a long term relationship with the girl. It wasn't a first date. Many people agreed with me, so unless the mods banned everyone (including OP) for thinking it was a sweet date, the only other thing I can think of are my comments saying that people who expect to be treated to Michelin starred restaurants and always given diamonds and luxury brand gifts, etc tend to be people who grew up with no class and usually having nothing, and now they want to escape their humble roots and demand that every bite they eat is from a fancy restaurant. I even said there is nothing wrong with coming from humble roots, or with being financially disadvantaged, but it's tacky and off-putting to start acting like you're too good to eat something that doesn't cost $40+ an entree for your every meal, especially when it's a long term relationship during a pandemic. Even billionaires sometimes stay in, order pizza, and watch netflix. So, I'm guessing I got banned for saying that demanding that every moment of your existence MUST \* star is the mark of someone who is classless.

It's such a horrible and disgusting attitude to have, because you're down on people based on how much money they have. I'm sure tons of poor women who love to be able to afford fancy meals for all their meals, but they can't afford them. It doesn't make them low value as people.

263,"Women aren't defined by having uteruses.  Unlike the TERFs we don't define ourselves by our ability to pop out babies.  It amazes me that TERFs keep acting like they have any understanding of science beyond the sixth grade level, because only a sixth grader would subscribe to the simplistic and debunked beliefs of sex corresponding to gender, and of sex being determined completely by chromosomes.  TERFs are the ones saying women are defined by ""being feminine"" (whatever the fuck that means), that women are defined by their ability to produce ""small gametes"" (this one makes me laugh because some trans men have ovaries, and TERFs in the past have said that trans men shouldn't be allowed in women's bathrooms because they aren't women, but then can't seem to extend that courtesy to trans women?  Hmmm I wonder why).

Also your use of the word ""sane"" is rather ableist.

Are you really such a snowflake you can't handle a positive post about trans people without commenting ""oMfG tHe liBruLzZzzz""?!

Did you not read the sidebar before commenting here?  Transphobes are not allowed.

Get off mumsnet and your ""gender critical"" ""feminist"" forums and maybe go on Google Scholar and read some actual science about trans people and their relationship to their gender and associated physiological changes.  Everything radfems have told you is a lie.  And you are a piece of shit for not bothering to acknowledge that trans women are an oppressed minority.  You have the gall to say we gaslight people while being part of a transphobic cult that boots you out at the slightest disagreement?  I got a good laugh out of that one.

And don't bother linking ""news articles"" bashing trans women (like SOME FDS MODS *cough* we all know who those are *cough* did).  You'll only find a few of those anyway, whereas if you Google ""trans rights fact sheet"" you'll find about 200+ references' worth of actual unbiased scientific research (of course, there are a whole lot more of those than just 200 since we don't know most of the biochemical pathways of sex determination in humans).  I've read them all because I spend some time punching shitty TERFs like you online.  We don't debate trans rights here. 
 
Also, TERFs seem to ignore the simple fact that language changes over time.  And you all had no problem with trans women being in women's spaces in the 60s or so, until that stupid lesbian separatism ""omg male essence bad"" shit came along that excluded bi women, trans women, and non binary people from the wlw community.  Why are you bringing it back now?  We're not pawns to take your frustration out on from being oppressed by cishet men.  Quit punching down and grow a fucking spine.  How are edgy little transphobic shits like you any different from the sexist dipshits we have to deal with irl every day?  Newsflash, you're not.  I detest you.  Transphobes like you are nothing but the shit I wipe off my shoes before stepping inside my house on a bad day.

Also, it's not ""transwomen"" it's trans women with a space in between.  Trans is an adjective, like tall or short or thin.  Duh.

So in the end, as is frequently the case for anti-feminist arguments, the video is arguing against a straw man.",forsakenquantum,2020-10-28 05:51:35,2020-10-28 06:53:13,/r/exfds/comments/jiyy1i/why_some_people_think_fds_is_created_by_men/gactb8p/,t3_jiyy1i,exfds,2,0,2020-10-28 06:53:13

I agree to some points. Like if you have mental issues, fix it first before entering a relationship. Basically, fix everything first, finances, confidence, career, social life. Applies to all gender.

Having said that, thats not a refutation of cult-like tactics which are unexceptable and I didn't notice much of that outside of dogmatism for their manual and hatred of outsiders but hatred of outsiders can exist without cult. In any case cult = bad. 

To your point about wgtow I already threw it in the trash, hunni, I am not surprised there is no BIPOC. Actual non-wgtow-women-going-their-own-way are too busy doing something important of whatever and are bipoc oc.

Just this month two french feminists published books advocate for the hatred of men. The first book name is ""i hate men"" the second is called ""the lesbian genius"" she say she is lesbian by choice. she is an elected official for a feminist party ( the ecologists )in the council of Paris. i never seen feminists condemn misandry.

Robin Morgan who was the editor of Ms. Magazine the biggest feminist magazine said ""I feel that ‘man-hating’ is an honorable and viable political act""

A lot of feminist leaders said openly that they don't read books written by men !! imagine if someone say he/she won't read written by jews ? that would nazi ? this is why the term ""feminazi"" exist.

In 2015, the University of York announced its intention to observe International Men’s Day. A torrent of criticism ensued, including an open letter to the university claiming that such a day “does not combat inequality, but merely amplifies existing, structurally imposed, inequalities”. The university cancelled the plans and affirmed that “the main focus of gender equality work should continue to be on the inequalities faced by women”. In contrast, its observation of International Women’s day a few months earlier was a week long affair with more than 100 events.

The event was reserved for men's health, at the same day a male student committed suicide in the same university. but feminists canceled the event saying that ""Equality For All"" is misogynistic rhetoric !!

&gt; They challenge the idea women need men (to be happy).  

Is this really true though?  Then why do they post all these articles on ""how to keep a man"" or ""how to build sexual tension with a man"" or ""how to get a man to pay for all your dates"" or ""how to get your man to propose to you"" I think this is one of those things they talk about a lot when they want to recruit more women into their TERF gender critical political lesbianism ideology.  There's this vibe of ""you need to hate men to join us"" that pulls people back into the cult.

&gt; They are WGTOW. 

I don't really think this is a good thing.  Oh and notice how in all portrayals of WGTOW spaces, none of the women are ever BIPOC (if you go to the subreddits for wgtow, that is).  It's like they don't even remember that WOC and NBPOC exist. :)

It's not ""change"" is really all they sell is misandry and transphobia and homophobia, like you said.  There are real feminists out there doing ground-level work.  That's what the change is.

That's the kind of crap fds is doing. Men value your virginity because the men that can provide for you and he men that you'll like, are older experienced men, who have been through hard break because other women used them or they were just not ready for women, and these men know that first love is the strongest bond. If they were good men with hearts, they never used women and tossed them aside, usually they were used by women. These guys won't accept anything but virgins it incredibly low number count women.

It's actually a choice to choose whetter or not you want children..

A man can do those things too and he can do them to show her he cares about her. Also if a woman wants to buy expensive clothes or makeup then she can go work a job like any other ordinary human has to to pay for it. I don't get why these women think they're entitled to someone else's money. I guess it's cause they don't think the men are good for anything else or capable of giving or prodiving them anything but money or things paid for by money? Honestly that's just sad.

337,"First of all, I agree with it being a women’s only space. I don’t see it being exclusionary to men as sexist, I see nothing wrong with having female only spaces. I think men shouldn’t go there or concern themselves with it. Women have been harmed by patriarchy and we deserve our own spaces, and I thank you for admitting we live in patriarchy still.

1. If a woman doesn’t want a broke man it’s fine, yeah I’m sure there are some sweethearts that are struggling financially, I think it’s okay to date them provided they provide a LOT of other value. I think our female natures want someone who can provide, it’s sort of biology. 

2. I agree with you here. From my browsing it seems like the sub has a lot of deeply damaged women who are looking for an outlet for their anger at their pattern of toxic relationships. I’ve noticed they seems to assume the absolute worst of all men and situations. It’s very sad, and hints at poor emotional health. The problem is that they’re refusing to take accountability for this and projecting the blame on men and anybody who disagrees with their philosophy. 

By refusing to accept that some of these patterns could change if they worked on themselves, they’re essentially saying there’s nothing that can be done about it and perpetuating this victim mentality. Instead of focusing on themselves they continue to obsess about men and the ways men have made them unhappy. I believe that would repel a lot of men they’re probably wishing they could attract.

And it's very bad for women who trust them because this rigid philosophy is ignoring various circumstances and fails to adopt to change. 

Because adaptability is so crucial for any intelligent approach to such delicate area as dating, those women will be stuck in a rut, trying to follow those outdated and very narrominded rules. Some of those rules, however, are based on a personal opinion and aren't supported by data or a collective experience. 

If we could share different strategies that work for us, exchange ideas and discuss dating issues without worrying that we get banned for saying something wrong, it would serve women so much better!

I was trying to connect and say I am also traumatized by men but they took it as something else. The mods I was talking to refused to believe my boyfriend is actually a great person and said my comment history is full of libfem stuff?(I commented on one feminist sub on a post about Ex Machina (a SciFi) just saying its a well made movie). 

I do feel that it’s a way these women are processing their trauma, that’s why it’s so volatile there. The mods seemed like they weren’t very articulate as well and shut down any intelligent conversation I tried to make. 

Really bizarre experience all around, some of the content was really good but there’s a lot of dysfunction there and I think they prefer it that way.

363,"&gt;""There's only trash on the apps""

Yeah I remember getting into an argument with an FDS user about this. She kept saying that there are ONLY trash men on the apps and that any man ""of value"" is not going to be on the apps.

But that's simply not true. There's been a cultural shift in the past 10 years or so. Almost everyone is on the apps. If you're attractive with a good job and are generally socially aware/kind, you'll likely meet someone else who's similar if you keep trying.

As for the attractiveness rankings, honestly that scares me simply because of my terrible hinge experience.

364,"I don't think they even know how apps work. You have to actively swipe, match and engage for the algorithm to pick up on your preferences and a feedback from other users. Apps rank your attractiveness based on that feedback of how others engage with your profile and if you only see shitty men for a while that means your profile is not very good and it's not Bumble's fault. 

""There's only trash on the apps"", they like to say, but that only means that those women weren't even shown to decent men and were ranked among overweight, trashy men. 

Passively sitting and hoping for prince charming to magically find and pick you IS pickmesha behavior.

Also, do they not realize that you can pay to see the dudes who liked you on bumble? I only paid for 1 week and selected someone cute who had already liked me. We clicked remarkably well.

FDS loves Hinge because they wait passively until the likes trickle in. My problem with this? The only guys who were liking me on Hinge were overweight, jobless, or completely boring. I really started questioning my attractiveness at that point, but tbh I tried bumble and there were cool, attractive guys more on my level (i.e. good job, good body, cute face) who were genuinely interested in me. There's something about the Hinge algorithm that favors men. I've heard many men who don't get likes on other apps are fairly successful on Hinge.

419,"I never commented about it there but recently was banned (not sure why), but yeah, the kinkshaming was pretty unrealistic. Like they claimed women can’t like anal sex, which is clearly false. Sex toy websites wouldn’t be selling anal toys if some women didn’t like them. Some women even just like anal for solo masturbation even if they don’t have a partner, and some lesbians also like anal. Saying women can’t like anything anal at all is just...incorrect. Same with bondage, rough sex, etc. Some people (regardless of gender or sexual orientation) do genuinely like &amp; enjoy those practices. I can understand that if you have a bad anal experience or a bad rough sex experience it could maybe ruin it for someone, but that doesn’t discount the experiences of people who have done those things and had a positive experience. 

I feel bad for women who have partners who do more intense things without prior consent, and of course women who are actually killed from intense sexual practices (it’s rare but can happen). But some people into kinky sex are informed about consent and aftercare, etc. and have kinky sex doesn’t *always* equal abuse.",PalmFruitWine,2020-11-16 19:32:43,2020-11-17 12:13:14,/r/exfds/comments/j0efdy/why_so_much_kink_shaming_on_fds/gciyi2u/,t3_j0efdy,exfds,2,0,2020-11-17 12:13:14

425,"Once you work past the first stages of poly that everyone goes through, assuming you don't get with somebody abusive (which, unfortunately, just by nature of pure statistics is more likely with multiple partners and is something the community attempts to be very mindful of) women will end up with very supportive relationships with men who don't feel pressured to be your ""one and only""

More people fulfilling more roles and no person being subjected to the ""one and only"" mindset means that the relationships can be MORE fulfilling. And there being less emphasis on those factors results in less degradation of women by forcing them into the boxes that patriarchal culture places on them. It has a disproportionate amount of people across the LGBT spectrum. It also teaches men that jealousy and toxic male traits are antithetical to the lifestyle

A woman where I do pay the knows I'm being courteous on the first few dates and when she's my girlfriend, it's way of showing my affection.

494,"1. I think it depends on many factors. The truth is that they ARE a lot of men in dead end jobs or no jobs with no ambition, even before the pandemic. If you're a student, dating another poor student doesn't make him a LVM or you a pick-me. If someone has fallen on hard times, despite their efforts, that's not a LVM. Someone who is just starting out their career and doesn't have much money isn't necessarily LVM. A serious and legit entrepreneur who is just starting out on a shoe-string budget isn't necessarily a LVM. I think they're whole idea of a man taking out a woman on a lavish first date grew out of frustration from men refusing to go on dates with women. Millennials and younger are notorious for this. It's like pulling teeth trying to get a guy to ask you out, take you on a nice date (""nice"" means pleasant time, not necessarily fancy restaurant). Instead, they ask you to come over to netlfix and chill and to pick up beer on the way. The point isn't for the man to take the woman out on crazy expensive dates, but to put in the effort and show that he likes her, he cares about her, he wants to show that he cares about the relationship. If a man doesn't have a lot of money, a nice ice cream date, or dinner at an inexpensive place or a picnic is ok. But then this snowballed into the expensive dinners FDS demands now. Another thing is that after a certain age, if a man truly cannot afford to take a woman out to more than ice cream or coffee, then he really needs to be focusing on getting his financial and career situation in order, rather than trying to date women. If a man is in a dire financial situation, yet is trying to date women, then I do question his motives. I personally want a committed, exclusive, long term relationship that will lead to marriage and children. A man who can't afford more than coffee won't be able to afford marriage, a stable home, and children. So this man likely isn't looking for anything serious, but is more likely looking for casual sex, which I'm not interested in. And even if he WAS looking for marriage, then I question his judgement: looking for a wife when he can't even afford dinner for two at an inexpensive restaurant. I need my partner to be intelligent and pragmatic. Someone who spends time looking dates instead of working on improving their own life does not exhibit those qualities. Again, this is after a certain age. It's different for college students and recent college grads because they don't have a career or have barely started one. So I think there is a seed of truth, but the FDS blows it up into ridiculous proportions.
2. Yes, I would imagine HVM would be turned off by FDS. I don't think they are turned off by a woman having standards and boundaries - both in dating and in life in general.

865,"honestly same.  i was going to write an article about their tactics, but amy dyess' articles and other ex-gc cult members' articles already pretty much cover the same tactics they use, so i was just like, you know what, fuck it, i have better things to do lmao

it's just that being a part of that subreddit is so cringey.  but i'm definitely more peaceful without having to talk to most current FDS users besides the ones that show up here occasionally wanting to defend their ""beautiful high value fellow FDSers"" like shut the fuck up nobody cares omgg

okay i should probably stop typing before i start rambling about them again.  it's interesting how i was only on there for about 4 months tops, but i'm still trying to undo some of the shitty platitudes they threw at me.  i was watching this documentary about scientology yesterday and it suddenly hit me how FDS can be as harmful emotionally when you get indoctrinated.  even the pyramidal structure of information flow within their cult is analogous to scientology's, like first they rein you in with ""feminist"" sounding optimistic platitudes, then they turn you against men, then they turn you against trans women, then they create this atmosphere of fear around trans women even though the chances you'll meet a trans woman in your lifetime are almost zero (since they make up less than 1% of the total world population right now), then they use that to convince you that they're the only group of people you're safe with, then they ""ask"" you to join their discord and provide them with your real name, address, and a fucking **voice recording.**   like what the fuck is up with that?  it pisses me off that all these women (some of whom may be gender non-conforming and can't express that part of themselves because FDS tells them they won't be ""high value"" if they do that) don't realize this.  i guess that's a realization they'll have to come at themselves.  we can just help from the sidelines.  

i do feel proud of myself for being able to leave.  and quite frankly, once i really introspected and realized that FDS didn't know my guy friends as well as i did (usually when someone spouts misogynistic rhetoric i just drop them, i don't have time for all that bullshit) and read a few posts about FDS that weren't *from* FDS, it tool me only a week to properly leave.  it was a little surprising to me how clear-headed i felt afterwards.  i mean, it's not like my circumstances magically improved, but i stopped molding myself to what other people wanted me to be.

like, you don't need to be an FDSer to be feminist.  in fact their particular flavour of fake feminism is just being afraid of phalluses for some reason (genuine question: if you're afraid of dicks why do you wanna fuck cis men? lmao) and of trans people for whatever bogus reasons they've made up in their heads.  they just cite the jessica yaniv example and ignore the fact that most trans women want nothing to do with her.  FDS is a bunch of hypocrites.

875,"A screenshot was posted from askreddit. A user said she had an autistic boyfriend who she saw once a week. They basically just watch TV and talk about work. She talks to him daily on the phone. She also admits that her last relationship was violent and abusive. She said she was happy with this relationship.  So this is what I said (I have is saved cause i was talking about this with a friend yesterday) :

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; What's the intention here? This is someone who by her own admission was abused. She's dealing with a lot of trauma. She's emotionally unavailable. And who are we to say ""you aren't happy""? She may well be happy with this arrangement. It allows to her to have some level of male company without being heavily invested or worrying about abuse. Perhaps that's not the most healthy thing on planet earth, I don't know, I'm not qualified to say. However, I know sometimes people have other preferences in their life. This is at worst two emotionally unavailable people keeping each other at arm's length. Maybe I'm going soft here, but I don't see the point in laughing at her. 

Of course, FDS was going in on ""she can't actually be happy"". I had the top comment and then I got banned lol. The problem I kept seeing was this insistence that the preferences of women there were universal - there is literally no other way to be happy except to be with who the kind of men they idealize (and it is in an ideal). They have a cartoonish view of the rich to boot. It's laughable. Maybe that's not your idea of a fulfilling relationship, but women who have gone through abuse tend to value safety over excitement. I'm not going to pile on a woman for that or advocate for people to do that. I mean, in the end, I find they've just devolved into being judgey ass people, for the most part, these days.",oldncranky1982,2020-10-25 13:35:48,2020-10-25 13:36:00,/r/exfds/comments/jh7875/randomly_got_banned_from_fds_for_possibly/ga2056r/,t1_ga1g2vp,exfds,1,0,2020-10-25 13:36:00

I'm not going to lie, some of the content on MGTOW does make me laugh and some makes me sick to my stomach, but overall by browsing MGTOW, FDS, and WGTOW I have learned things that cannot be unlearned, and this information has helped me identify and avoid certain problematic individuals and situations in life. 

I don't hate anyone or want anybody to get hurt in any way nor do I ask anybody for anything, however I myself am guilty of contributing to the ""exposing of female nature"", as you have so put it, by uploading my own screenshots of other subreddits, partly because I am fascinated by the bizarre things that go on in the heads of some people, and partly because it is nice to see what other like-minded people think.

886,"I am also a MGTOW lurker. I often see the type of argument you listed here. Usually it mentions self improvement and that at its core MGTOW is really about going your own way and avoiding putting yourself in legal situations that favor women. 

This inherently doesn't sound bad until you spend 5 minutes browsing the subreddit. Sure there are the occasional posts asking about career advice, the occasional post about travel that gets stickied, the occasional post about motorcycles or cars or something like that, but the vast majority of posts are obviously about bitching about women or taking screen grabs and talking about how ridiculous they are.

Usually when this gets pointed out the follow-up argument is that it is ""exposing true female nature"" but I view this as a cop out. Sometimes a guy gets frustrated or wants to vent or thinks that some hardcore progressive thing has gone too far and it's fun to poke fun at. It's like junk food, you know it's not good for you but sometimes it's comforting, and I imagine that this is true for women on the other side of the fence in their own way with FDS. They are doing many of the same things under the guise of ""exposing true male nature"".

Because of this I agree with u/PM_me__hard_nipples that it is its own blend of these other subs. They still idealize and want to lock down a HVM which is a very blue pill concept but they are also mixing in a lot of the ""men bad"" ice cream flavor into the mix along with a dash of how to manipulate, control and get what you want from TRP.

As this sub grows I think the current mods should recognize that they will see some clashing between these two groups as people discuss these issues from the FDS screen grabs that get posted.

Other reasons of course include general things that all of humanity strives to get away from e.g. manipulation tactics, being used, being physically/emotionally abused and neglected as a vital part of society, even demonized.

933,"For any FDS user here visiting. Going over these arguments one by one.

""Women never tried to blackmail me into sending nudes.

Women don't speak over me when I'm trying to say something.

The person who leaked my bikini pics to 4chan wasn't a lady.

The pedophiles who targeted me when I was 16, were not women.

A female friend never violated my physical boundaries.

I don't have to worry about how I dress in front of my female relatives.

Women never tried to dox me and search for my house on Google Earth.

Women never broke my heart with no regrets.

No woman has ever ghosted me.

No girl has ever tried to drug my drink at a nightclub.

No girl has ever inappropriately groped me"".

&amp;#x200B;

1. Its very unlikely a woman would blackmail with nudes, but baby trapping is a thing. Both things are unlikely to deal with to you as an individual. The mindset of thinking one crime is worse than the other is marginal in group bias. I'll argue both sides of the margin for the sake of fairness. A. Men are more likely to black mail. B. Baby trapping is far worse than nudes on the internet no one gives a shit about.
2. I have most certainly been spoken over by overly enthusiastic female conversationalists. I have also spoken over others. Mansplaining actually has scientific studies on it which imply an inappropriate name. Men are more likely to interrupt a woman than men are to men, however men are less likely to interrupt a woman compared to women talking to woman.
3. Involuntary pornography is illegal, I don't share nudes of girls received in DM personally, but it does happen. Women also enjoy going in depth with other women verbally about what men are like. Once again marginal in group bias.
4. First off its pronounced ephebophile. Also r/mensrights has plenty of stories of women doing the same to men. It would be impossible to compare numbers as crimes related to age of consent likely go unreported. Per marginal in group bias arguments. 1. Men are more likely to attempt. 2. Women are more likely to succeed. Either complain number 1 makes men worse than women, or number 4 here makes men worse. You only get to pick one though.
5. Men are more likely to be sexual predators. Women also commit some crimes more than others. r/pussypass and r/pussypassdenied will argue that women are much more likely to hit men, than men hit women. The comparison of the two is again prone to marginal in group bias, but there are certainly female dominated crimes.
6. Women go naked in front of each other yes. Umm, this is men's fault? We wear clothes and dress differently when trying to attract too.
7. Is she seriously trying to claim that no woman doxxes? Or that she even knows the gender of the doxxer?
8. Huh? She's trying to claim women never break hearts, on a sub literally devoted to nexting guys overly infatuated with them? Ok....
9. I don't get it is she bi? Women literally promote ghosting men and in general on reddit, while men say its better to deliver a single hit that hurts once.
10. Yes sexual crimes are more common with men. See number 5.
11. See post 10 and 5,",muhsoginyist,2020-10-24 06:29:22,2020-10-24 07:18:22,/r/exfds/comments/jgpiag/according_to_fds/g9v5rnb/,t3_jgpiag,exfds,1,0,2020-10-24 07:18:22

955,"&gt;psychological term for it, but when you keep reaffirming your hurtful past you literally hurt your brain.

Is it called retraumatization?  Or rumination?  I remember reading about this somewhere, but I'm not too sure.  But my counsellor at uni also told me (when I brought up that I was bored thinking about a traumatic event that I'd gone through) that after a point going back over and over traumatic events in your head stops being helpful in terms of processing the events.  

And with the specific flair types that FDS in particular has, and from how the content itself is arranged, I think highly traumatized individuals can also conflate their trauma with other people's trauma (which might be worse than theirs alone), leading to a rewiring of sorts where they conflate the people who abused them with other, worse people.  E.g. back when I dumped my abusive ex, I knew he was a misogynist head-to-toe, but I also knew he wasn't a pedophile or a murderer.  Reading about all those shittier people on those ""depravity"" flairs made me believe things in the relationship were worse than they really were.  That's not to say his behaviour wasn't traumatizing; of course it was, but I didn't like that staying on FDS was making me lose sight of my own truth, so to speak.",phantom_0007,2020-11-14 15:05:08,2020-11-14 15:05:18,/r/exfds/comments/jtxkk3/not_sure_who_needs_to_hear_this_but_your/gc99i7k/,t1_gc95te5,exfds,1,0,2020-11-14 15:05:18

So when a woman enters a relationship and becomes the manager of the above jobs, she expects the man to contribute equally but that's really hard since 'men's jobs' (taking out the bin, fixing a car, changing the light bulb, assembling furniture) are very infrequent and are not daily tasks like how cooking is for example (3x a day) or child care (all day) or cleaning (every day). Women then expect men to pay for everything so they can feel some sort of relief and feel they are being compensated. This is also the case with sex. It might seem equal in today's society but you'd be surprised at how ignorant men are about women's sexuality. It's rare to find a man who really understands how a clitoris works or that women need foreplay so even sex becomes a chore for most since 70% do not reach orgasm through penetration alone. I don't like a lot of things about that sub but this one I can understand. It's so bad these days that women do all the above as well as work and be sucked into the ""split the bills"" mentality when they are already doing 90% of the free labour already.

990,"That's just it, though, right?  You can't reduce people (or just men either) to a monolithic group.  Dating isn't a game that you have to win, it's literally just people meeting people and figuring out whether or not they're compatible over a series of meetings.  There is no universal dating strategy that ""helps you get a good guy"" besides the more obvious things, like being on the lookout for red flags in a partner, being trustworthy, being ready to take on a role of equal partnership in the relationship (which FDS still stands vehemently against for some weird reason.  Note that I said 'equal' so the issue of your partner not pulling their weight isn't being talked about here), being able to talk about emotional vulnerabilities without clamming up like an oyster.  And like, you don't need FDS to tell you that.  Just ask anyone in a healthy relationship, they'll give you good advice.  I find that the majority of ""dating advice"" comment sections on FDS just devolves into clowning around being like ""oh we're all Queens we deserve to have a thousand dollar birthday bash every year blah blah"" which is just bullshit because we're not ""queens"" as such, we're just people.  We don't have to eulogize ourselves or demean other people to recognize our humanity.  I'm actually curious what advice you found on FDS that's unique to FDS and can't be found anywhere else.

It’s funny that you said that people who are good at dating aren’t on FDS or other dating forum and you’re right! You see prior to FDS, I was the girl watching Youtube videos, taking personality quizzes, subscribed to all of the dating advice subreddits because the whole thing seemed like rocket science. Guess what? Since FDS I no longer feel the need to do that. I feel like I now have a good foundational understanding, and I draw from this knowledge now, instead of constantly asking people for advice.

Listen, I am being honest with you. Though i still have not yet find Mr. right, my experience dating, before and after are remarkably different, less stressful and i feel more in control. And that to me is already enough.

992,"Hey, I understand what you're going through, and I understand in terms of dating or life in general it's best to have a strategy than to have no strategy, as strategies help us navigate through difficult territory. 

Many of the people who are good at dating are either busy dating or out of dating due to life being busy, finding a S.O, etc. I'm sure many people who are really good at dating aren't on FDS giving people dating strategies this also goes to r/dating as well. 

I didn't want to bring this up but, I'm sure you are aware of     Red Pill, they claim to be the 1% to know how to date and know relationship secrets that the world is blinded too. Think about it do you really think those relationship strategies are going to work on you? Perhaps not.

I honestly don’t care to discuss comments, posts or FDS mods. They’re all suck. I have already said above they suck.

995,"Wait, are you seriously trying to say FDS isn't a hate subreddit?  I just need clarification for that one point of yours.  Because that Center you're talking about isn't an authority on hate subreddits either (I haven't even heard of it, actually, do you have a link?).  

We aren't aiming to ""convert"" people.  This is just a safe space for people to discuss how they've been hurt by TERF cults in the past.  Reddit admins have acknowledged r/AgainstHateSubreddits in the past, it's the most reliable resource on Reddit to find hate subreddits.  AHS has already covered TERF and TERF adjacent subreddits using logical arguments and studies.  I'll reiterate that we're not out here to convince people FDS is bad, any reasonable individual would know that themselves, this discourse is all over the place, on Twitter, Facebook, actual studies, etc.  You can type ""trans exclusionary radical feminism"" into Google Scholar and you'll get a bunch of hits.  Most of us have other things to do, and personally I don't want to waste my time trying to convince someone FDS is a TERF subreddit if they aren't open to reading well-documented TERF post compilations (from FDS) themselves.  We literally have disgruntled FDSers reporting screenshot posts here, taken from their own sub, as misinformation.  And we get the occasional butthurt FDS mod too.  If they weren't a hate subreddit, they would ignore us entirely because we wouldn't be worth their time.  TwoX mods don't go around brigading random subs like FDSers do.

(And by the way, AHS also has anti-MGTOW posts.  So they're not the stereotypical incel basement dwellers. I've made a post on AGS about TERFs myself.  I can state categorically that I'm not a basement dweller.  I live in a very well ventilated house.)

Oh, and while we're at it, how do we know you're not a basement dweller?  Lol.

Anyway, jokes aside, my main point is that we can't do your deprogramming work for you.  I'll try to collect a masterlist of posts pointing out certain bad things about FDS, but that'll take me a lot of time and I might even forget about it, so yeah.  I can point you to some off-Reddit resources though.  Amy Dyess' articles and Gemma Stone's Medium articles are good.  Pink News has some articles about TERF recruiting tactics.  And I follow a bunch of Twitter accounts like GC Homophobia, GC Racism etc.  If you look through their posts and compare those with FDS posts, you'll notice some similarities.  The issue with debunking TERF rhetoric is that it's so filled with dogwhistles that it takes a lot of time to debunk even one paragraph.  Any attempt to call them out is seen as misogyny (if other trans-inclusive cis women so it, they say we have internalized misogyny...lmaoo) so that's usually where the discussion stops because most not-TERF folks realize by then that there's no point engaging in actual conversation with a TERF.  They're like Nazis (they have, in fact, colluded with far right hate groups in the past, who also hate LGBTQ+ people.  Pink News has some articles about that too).",phantom_0007,2020-11-12 05:58:31,2020-11-12 06:01:51,/r/exfds/comments/jsllf8/fds_women_should_take_a_look_at_themselves_with/gc0kz47/,t1_gc0ftby,exfds,1,0,2020-11-12 06:01:51
996,"My point is that you are concern trolling about ""women from 3rd world countries"" lemme break this down.  First off, not all 3rd world countries have problems with education and hygiene.  Second off, just because we're women from South Asian countries doesn't mean some of us don't have class/ religious privilege.  Most Indian women you see on FDS have jobs, are Hindu, some even live in the US (which doesn't have universal healthcare and has terrible class disparity yet somehow isn't classified as a third world country because... reasons and imperialism I guess).  I don't remember the specifics of what you said in your comment, but I did pick up on an eagerness on your part to blame men from all these countries for these women on FDS being extremists.  These aren't your run-of-the-mill occasional ""i hate men"" Facebook shitposter feminists who want to vent after a tiring day being catcalled outside.  These are women who are homophobic, racist (because White women on the sub who are racist homophobic TERFs agree that they're oppressed, so they feel the need to agree with them.  If you read studies about 60s White separatist feminism, you'll get a better idea of what I'm talking about here, I can't articulate it properly) and TERFs.  The only excuse they have to be hateful is themselves.  Don't you think, given the abuse I've been through in my life (since you took the liberty to see my post history), I should have become a man hating ""feminist"" as well?  On FDS, the hatred directed towards Indian men (for example) comes from a White TERF perspective.  Indian women (like myself) tend to agree with that hatred because 1.  there's no denying we are oppressed, obviously and 2.  we don't want to get kicked out of FDS for defending men of colour from that kind of racist hatred, because FDS labels that as excessive male sympathizing.  There are very few active spaces for Indian women on Reddit, and most of us have experienced sexual harassment to some degree, which is what FDS capitalizes on as a TERF recruiting ground.

In your comment, you've generalized POC culture entirely, which is racist.  That's what I was trying to get at.  It's one thing to acknowledge nuances (which, again, you are not doing because you just painted us all with a very broad brush.  Black women, Latino women, South Asian women, Native American women, East Asian women, Middle Eastern women etc all face different kinds of misogyny and even that depends on a whole lot of other factors) and another to say something that makes all POC cultures look the same.  Usually the racist evangelical Christian patriarchy we have to face when we emigrate to Western countries is also upheld by White women (just look at voting stats by demographic in the recent US election).

I get that you're concerned I'm a moderator because of my past (well, and present) and you seem to insinuate that being anxious makes me somehow unfit to moderate a subreddit...which is a very ableist and ageist notion, but let's not go there.  I'm intentionally sitting out my ""drunk on power"" phase of moderating here.  It'll go away in a few days when the novelty wears off.  I already got called a ""White man's whore"" because I decided to remove some polygynous dickhead's comment because he thought I wouldn't date him because (apparently) he was Black.  Sweet Jesus Reddit has really done a great job toning down on the hate speech, huh. /s 

The reason I said pro FDS brownie points was that you are regurgitating the exact rhetoric not-White TERFs have used on FDS to hate on South Asian trans women.  I'm sure you can understand why I wouldn't be too happy about that.  I'm genderfluid and I take that shit personally because it literally fuels hate based on identity.  It's very triggering to read something like that because TERFs have sent me hate online and have tried to dox me in the past.  I have no interest in sympathizing with them because they are the kinds of women who uphold the patriarchy in South Asian countries while claiming to fight against it.

I do have a question for you though: are you White?  Because so far I haven't seen any BIPOC feminist woman have this unintersectional a take, neither in real life nor on major subs like TwoX.",phantom_0007,2020-11-12 05:31:12,2020-11-12 05:42:51,/r/exfds/comments/jsllf8/fds_women_should_take_a_look_at_themselves_with/gc0i99y/,t1_gc0deuq,exfds,1,0,2020-11-12 05:42:51

You can tell which ones are from these countries due to the abundance of low quality men they talk about/date and the low education rates, poor hygiene issues, and little availability of a career (however this is also typical of immigrants in the states and POC because they come from these countries). However, I can tell which ones are from the states because they are what we would call ""welfare queens"" because they leach off one system or another. They have this constant need to validate themselves because, in the states, black women are usually rated fairly low for attractiveness and desirability. But I can also tell if they are immigrants to the states because of their internalized misogyny and cultural differences with American men.  They have expectations to be taken care of as a vestige of their previous culture but can't reconcile the women's liberation movement here in America. Culturally they are told they need to be married and they need materialistic things, but here in the states, that's not our philosophy so much anymore. most white Americans (Gen Z and millennials) prefer to live a minimal lifestyle and do not want to feed the corporate machine of expensive dinners and dates.",Mellymel1030,2020-11-12 03:19:10,2020-11-12 03:58:44,/r/exfds/comments/jsllf8/fds_women_should_take_a_look_at_themselves_with/gc057py/,t1_gc02qjy,exfds,1,0,2020-11-12 03:58:44

1054,"I mean, FDS is a TERF misogynistic (and misandrist) subreddit, nothing is going to change that.  FDS is hardly the paragon of ""screening men"" or whatever because it does that from a radical ""feminist"" (lol) bioessentialist perspective, and they body shame everyone who doesn't fit, ironically, the jacked alpha male stereotype because that's just the kind of people they are.  You're not telling me anything I don't already know... This is where it gets complicated because this subreddit should ideally be framed as a TwoX style one, to keep out both TERFs and incels/ mgtow.  And since the subreddit is kinda growing we need more moderators, looks like.  

""Anti-XY thing"" doesn't even begin to cover the hatred I've had to face as a genderfluid woman who didn't conform to FDS (TERF) ideals of what it means to be a woman.  My internalized transphobia got much worse because of that subreddit, and if I'd stayed there, given what else I was going through at the time, I'd have legit offed myself, most probably.  FDS mods used to follow me everywhere because I was posting against them and calling them out.  It's not as innocuous as the Newbies would have you believe.

My understanding is that you can autoban people who are part of a certain subreddit if they try to post here.  If we get that set up then we won't have as much of an overlap with mgtow and it'll be clear to them they're not welcome here.  Just because we despise FDS doesn't mean we're anti feminist, which is something FDS loooves to say about us.  I pointed out their transphobia and got called a scrote and a low value man, which is really really interesting considering I don't even have a penis. 🙄 Lol

I really don't have time in my life for FDS apologists.

1076,"I didn’t claim I’ve had orgies. I got kicked out of r/twoXsex because some middle aged woman did EXACTLY what you just did. Woman are all the same. You all resort to calling me an incel and threatening me with “no access to women” for being disagreeable and non compliant. She called me an incel. So I looked at her profile, found out her “intellectually gifted” daughter is having sex and was caught with magnum condoms in her possessions and mocked her and told her she’ll be doing amateurish low budget porn like OnlyFans in 3 years when she turns 18. 

As for not caring whether I’m black or not, here’s my little question to you, how many ethnic men have you dated. I’m willing to bet it’s a big fat ZERO. I on the other hand have had sexual experiences with women from practically every race (western &amp; Eastern European, Indian, Chinese, Latina) and dated women from all parts of Africa (North, South, West, East and Central). 

So I’ll rest well at night knowing your racist ass would never consider me anyway. 

As for the studies, I can give you the links, I’m not gonna try and prove the validity of my lived experiences, what I can observe as a man among other fellow males and hard statistics from reputable sources.

1077,"This concerns me as a current FDS follower: I joined hoping to get some insight and advice upon entering the dating scene for the first time in my life.

I noticed their ""XY"" not allowed policy. Before I saw this, I thought their ""female-only space"" policy was inclusive of trans-women. Now I feel disappointed, since trans-women also experience misogyny from both men and women. Trans-women also struggle a lot in the dating scene because of transphobia and misogynistic hate crimes, and could benefit from **some** advice FDS has to offer (that isn't transphobic). 

Another point - even though I don't find sex-work empowering and find it mostly exploitative/inhumane, I don't like to see FDS members dunk on sex-workers and sex-work. This is because sex-workers already face so much stigma and have even more difficulty getting out of the industry, and the last thing sex-workers need is to be derailed for simply trying to make a living/survive.

I'm okay with being labeled a ""libfem"" or a ""pickmeisha""; I'd rather be labeled that than be a TERF.

I was only 800 miles away so I was closer! So much for not wanting to date long distance. 🙄 It was a huge punch in the gut. I blocked him... It was very hard for me.

Thanks! I think I will eventually. He was my first love. I was young. 16 and a half when I met him. The friendship ended when I was 21 and a half. A few weeks before my birthday.

I'll be honest, I grew up in a dysfunctional family. My mom cheated on my dad for many years in their marriage and they always fought. My dad was a doormat and put up with her poor treatment until she basically walked out on him when I was almost 17. They divorced. My dad worked on himself then got remarried to a good woman a year later. He is no longer a doormat and his marriage with my step mom is an equal one.

If she wants to be official then I’ll give her gifts, spend lots of time with her, be fully honest with her, not keeping secrets, help her out. As long as she reciprocates and show me the same love and treatment I’m giving her. As a guy I will never want to be in a relationship if the woman think the relationship is all about her or one sided.

If they expect to be paid and be showered with gifts and love without returning the favor for the man? No I’ll avoid women like that like a plague. If I see women who sees me as her equal and wants to show love and care to me then I’ll love to be with her because she knows that the relationship won’t work out if she thinks it’s all about her. The part of being a good man is to accept rejection, that don’t hurt women or degrade them, who don’t yell at them or be abusive/narcissistic towards them. A good man is who make sure he’s receiving the same treatment from the woman and not be treated like an ATM.

1144,"Mangoes are the god tier of fruits that's why :D Ah I know it must've sucked in the moment but you didn't do anything wrong regardless of whether you have autism or not.

I mean I'd say, if you're conflicted about the right path for you, just learn what you picked up from FDS on dealing with timewasters and looking out for red-flags and do your own thing. Take all the time you need to heal from your ex, especially if he was a narcissist. 

I was very taken aback when I got banned because I was on board with a lot of FDS' general principles. I was never comfortable with the idea of the guy being a provider in a relationship because I grew up in a conservative household and I saw having financial power gave more scope to be abusive. So I'm all for doing everything equally in a relationship. One thing I never got about FDS was they said the man should provide but then the relationship as a whole should be equal? Seemed quite antithetical.

I'm currently going through a no sex phase myself and I understand why some women would be like that. But personally I could never shame anyone for wanting to do things like casual sex because it's not really my sex life to comment on. I got told by one girl from FDS I'd get date raped because I used to sleep around at the start of college. Like you rightly said, if you're not willing to support all women, don't call yourself a feminist because you're not, you're just a hypocrite in so many ways.

Do whatever is best for you mentally. If you feel like staying on FLS will take its toll on you then leave.

Yeah same here. That's how I feel about it. They are not feminist if they are gonna hate on sex workers, women who love sex/kink, and trans women. 

Yeah. When I first joined, I thought that maybe they hated only ""bad men."" Nope! After my ban I realized that they hated ALL men. Even HVM.

Mainly because I am kinda a sensitive person, and I beat myself up because I am autistic, so I am not always the best at reading social cues, so I thought ""Great. I missed another social cue and it got me in trouble lol."" 

I am doing better now lol. Though I am conflicted on the right path for me. I was hurt badly by chasing men and being a doormat, but I got banned by FDS so now I am just like... What way is the right way? 🤣 I am better off without that subreddit. I got upset at them for telling me to just get over my ex FWB first love in a *snap* of a finger. It don't work that way, unfournately. Especially with how deeply I loved him. It is going to take me some time. They said I was never discarded, yet, my ex was a most likely covert narcissist. 

Wow! Sorry to hear you got banned too and I will have to read your post. I consider getting banned from there a blessing. I don't really get the hate on liberal feminism in my opinion. I really don't think you can be a true feminist if you are against anything a woman does. Her body. Her choice. And this includes casual sex, and sex work. Women have the right to choose. And the anti sex attitude... Maybe you don't like certain sex acts but you have no right to tell a woman what she can and can't enjoy. 

I agree with you! I like some of the FDS ideas but the ban was coming sooner than later because I don't quite agree with or follow FDS 100%. In all honesty, they shouldn't even call it a dating subreddit. Most of it is just bashing and I don't even get why they made it if it isn't really about dating. :/ I am not sure if I am going to stay on FLS to be honest.

There was a sex work thread posted there recently cross posted in one of our sex worker subs and one FDS poster came in bashing us, calling us liars, etc because the men we see dont abuse us or treat us bad. All men are 'shit' so we are just liars. Oh and 'white privileged'.

No, we just know how to vet men so we dont see bad guys and they cant seem to grasp not all men are pieces of crap.
