I come from a western country but still a bit conservative and I grew in a rural area so traditions are very much engrained. My grandmother was a homemaker (she did work but then retired early), I was raised being told the importance of being a homemaker, cleaning the house, cooking. My mom still tries to put me down saying I am not good at those things (except for cooking I am frankly better than she is at everything, and even cooking if I stop being lazy I can do much better than she does, but ok). I am the first one from my extended family to ever go to college, honestly the only educated people I met in my life were my teachers at school.

I was bullyed throughtout my childhood due to my looks mostly by guys. I spent my teen years with so much body issues, depression and anxiety. I craved so much male attention yet I thought I was so ugly no man would ever look at me. When I finally started exploring the dating world (only when I was 23-24) I had such a low self esteem. I remember being so worried about getting to know the guy, what he wants sexually, because I wanted to be a cool girl that would treat him so well, not like those bitchy women. I felt unworthy when an handsome guy liked me and felt I needed to try to do the right stuff and try extra hard to please him.

Now I sometimes read some reddits posts from the subreddits I used to go and...something changed. When a guy says I want X, Y, Z I no longer feel inferior for not having all what he asks. I just think he is full of shit and are happy I don't have to put up with that crap lol.

I still have some troubles saying no and feel guilty when I turn down a guy. I can't help but have those annoying thoughts in the back of my head saying I am not that good so I shouldn't be as picky otherwise I'll end up alone and some day I'll regret it... Problem is, this fear is no longer enough to make me want to give my freedom to tolerate bullshit.

Sometimes my body issues come back, but then I am like... ""who cares?"". I just been finding some very cute plus sized models on instagram. Today I found one who filmed a tiktok video with a guy asking her to rate herself in a scale of 1 to 10 and she was like, with no doubt ""I am a 10"" and the guy kept trying to put her down questioning her ""are you sure? to be a 10 you need to be flawless"" and she was like ""yap I am a 10"" with so much confidence. According to her, it pissed a lot of dudes on tiktok. But I just loved it! and also her body shape is similar to mine and when I was younger I would never image I'd see someone with a body similar to mine being a model...

I used to feel inferior due to my lack of sexual and relationship experience, now, since my last failed crush, not even that bothers me that much anymore. I feel like if I meet someone and that's an issue for that person, than that person should go see a shrink and get the fuck out of my life, because I don't have a problem with it so neither should he LOL I am a bit worried if this is repressed emotions or something and will blow out later. Not sure. But I just don't feel a lot of drive to pursue those things as much as before.

I am sure I am still damaged and have a lot of emotional traumas, but I think I was able to grow some self esteem thanks to communities like this one and others that I found along the way.

Do you have any placements that you feel contribute to going your own way? 

I'll start.

I have Saturn in my 7th house (in Capricorn lol) which Saturn in the 7th means a delay in relationships/marriage and you're not supposed to get married after your Saturn return. In my last relationship which was happening through my Saturn return (which was fucking horrible btw lol) I told myself if this doesn't work out that's it I'm done. Now I'm so glad I didn't get married. Some say the delay makes it until your 40s but I say never!! Also have Neptune in my 7th which makes me not see others clearly which I can definitely say has been a pattern of mine and part of the resulting trauma is why I'm just not interested in any of that anymore.

Another placement I feel is related is Venus in the 11th. This is interesting because the cookie cutter description of this is basically that you find more value or love through the 11th house of friends/fans/society etc. I really feel like this is me because I have struggled with friends/boundaries (see previous about Saturn in the 7th!) and Saturn is supposed to teach us those lessons so we learn and are rewarded. My hope is to build a large network of community instead of relying on partnership (the nuclear family truly seems like isolated hell can't believe we're so brainwashed).

Lastly I have Pluto in the 5th. This is a malefic representing death/transformation and the 5th house is literal conception via sex but also creativity. I feel this is wgtow-ish because I have been childfree and I am channeling that energy into the figurative art vs the literal children of the 5th house.

I know we could discuss oppositions and all that other stuff but I'm fairly new to those so feel like I don't have too much to say about them yet.

Out of morbid curiosity I browsed an MGTOW sub today for a few minutes looking at their top posts. I know that's a toxic pastime but I was genuinely curious what their logic was. In their top few posts, I saw the following:

1. A meme about how women, animals and babies are all loved unconditionally but men are only loved if they can provide something.

2. A comedian talking about how women would not be able to keep their man around if they were no longer able to provide them with sex (or ""pussy"" as the video calls it) say, due to a horrible accident or something.

Aside from totally discounting the fact that women are expected to provide sex, children, a clean household, home cooked meals, and now income as well....seeing those two posts side by side was hilarious to me.",True,False,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,7131,public,top,self,,,MGTOW Insanity,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wgtow/comments/n58er8/mgtow_insanity/,,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He immediately came off as *very* friendly and multiple times just came up to me and started saying ""woke"" things about feminism, how women have it hard trying to stay safe from men etc. Somewhat odd but I brushed it off.

However today he made a joke that creeped me out. There was a huge, beautiful bird on the deck and he began insisting on showing me an album of bird photos he took. He said he could put them on a USB stick for me then says ""that is, if you'd trust a stick from me...and I don't mean the kind that wears a condom"" then burst out laughing.

Um...WTF dude. Out of freakin' nowhere. I am still stuck alone with this guy for two more days.

I know I seem like a bad friend, but like I'm hoping some of you ladies might understand? 

The man she is getting married to has gone to strip clubs and paid for strippers, and swiped right on me on Tinder at 3am when him and my friend were fighting.. it just makes me so mad. Like how is my friend even considering this. It disgusts me.. hes so emotionally abusive to her and is pushy with sex.. 

Maybe it's hard for me to stay friends with married couples because the ones I've known have been so toxic. It just doesnt make sense to me. I feel like I suddenly have nothing at all in common with these people that have decided to prioritize this other person over absolutely every other thing in their life. It confuses and disgusts me.

This is a scene from Girls on HBO. It gets me everytime, I laughed so hard the first time i saw it. And something clicked with me that, we don't get to see much representation of female rage and female anger in movies and TVs. Or at least when it has nothing to do with a romantic plot, or because a man has broke her heart.  
(This scenes was criticized for giving a bad look to staten islanders lol)

Another one is in a movie called ""Welcome Home"" with Aaron Paul. I don't want to spoil but there is some female rage happening towards the end which made the movie 10X more enticing. It's not a good movie lol, but that scene alone makes it worth it.

When I decided to have sex, I knew it was gonna be on my terms. Which meant no PIV, which I not only see as degrading but it gives me dysphoria as well, and no sucking his dick. It was going to be me-centered. And it was. 

We made out for a long time, kissed etc. Every time. I made him give me oral while I was standing as well as lying down. He once asked for a BJ but I refused. He also fingered me till I orgasmed. I reciprocated by giving him a handjob once because I was curious. 


After that, I got on with my life. I stopped obsessing over getting a bf, soul-draining projects that relationships are and men in general. I just stopped caring about that stuff.

I mean that‚Äôs what most people do when they‚Äôre married . Is that the point of dating? What is the point? 
But I cannot see myself ever getting married or liking marriage. 
I mean you‚Äôd have to live with a man. Like if you got married you‚Äôd have to share everything. I‚Äôd literally want my own room ; own space. I don‚Äôt want to share a room. I‚Äôd like to have my own bed, and my own dresser etc. I also could never see myself actually loving a man so much where I‚Äôd want to be around and next to him 24/7. Like obviously if I married  a guy I‚Äôd like him, and want to cuddle and kiss etc, do things with him but I‚Äôd also like to back off and be alone or hangout with my friends. And I don‚Äôt want a guy to feel entitled to my body like he can have sex and do whatever he pleases just because we‚Äôre married. 
What if one day I just don‚Äôt wanna talk to anyone? What if after a long day at work I wanna just watch a reality show alone with no one to bother me? If you‚Äôre married and living with someone you can‚Äôt really do that cuz you‚Äôd be an asshole. Then you‚Äôre not only worrying about yourself u gotta worry about what ur husband is doing or if you cook something for yourself you‚Äôd have to share with him. 
Another thing; I do not want kids. Never want to be pregnant because of my views on life. So I guess I could just date a guy for a long time and explain I never want marriage or live with him.

You can also buy it [here](https://www.amazon.com/Starter-12800mAh-Portable-Engines-Battery/dp/B07NPL6MJP) and [here](https://www.ebay.com/itm/383849711393?chn=ps&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;mkevt=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;mkcid=28).

It plugs into your cigarette lighter plug in your car and reads your battery level. You have to download an app for it. It records the level of your battery when you start your car.

I distanced myself because she essentially couldn't stand me being single and would try setting me up against my will with dudes that had situation-ships already going on with other women. She was dating this guy who always made her cry and belittled her... and she ended up recently marrying him. 

Anyways, I was checking out their wedding photos they posted! My friend looked so beautiful and elegant!

And then I looked aside her at her husband. They had a traditional religious wedding and part of the ceremony involves sitting before the minister and then all the people are watching them. She was sitting up, at attention, and looked focused on the Minister. Her hands were folded nicely. Her husband was extremely slouching to the point where his hurt jacket didn't even look like it was on all the way and his eyes were off to outer space dating off... and his one hand was grabbing near his crotch! I was horrified and feel secondhand embarrassed for the bride. The groom looks like one of the slobby class clowns from high school goofing off and not paying attention during class, like the kid that always gets sent to the principles office...

They looked like night and day. In the rest of the photos he was making faces and didn't take it seriously at all while she was trying to be mature and professional. 

I dont believe in marriage and haven't been dating, and when I am out in public I ignore men that start hitting on me. Seeing her husband slouch and zone out and be in his crotch in front of a minister and whole church of people made me feel literally so sick. He was the one that proposed to her. Why is he already acting so miserable and like he doesn't want to be at his own wedding? He asked her. And then to pose like that? 

My friend is like a many others who dream of their wedding and white dress their whole life. He knew that and he doesn't care to even pretend to pay attention at his own wedding. Im glad she is a former friend because I couldn't handle hearing any more of her stories about how awful he was during their time dating. 

The wedding she had though made me loose even more hope for myself. It feels so abysmal. To be honest I distanced myself hard when she got engaged because I just didn't have the heart to be there and pretend to act happy for her when I can see the truth. I do hope he gets better for her but I doubt that will happen. 

Her husband is an extreme example but still most guys never seem to excited for their weddings, they act sort of like its a chore and boring.

For most of my life I have idealized having a relationship. Guys would be down to have casual sex, or be my friend, but ‚Äúgetting‚Äù them into a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù was really difficult. Almost like a feat. You had to get to know him, go on several dates where you played a part, smiling, feminine, and then he deemed you worthy of being his girlfriend. I know this isn‚Äôt 100% of cases but it seems to be the mainstream. 

In the few cases I did have a boyfriend, we were obviously alone a lot and he wanted to do sexual things. All the time. And I was his girlfriend, and that‚Äôs what the girl offends did unless they were waiting until marriage - and *then* they did the sexual things. 

Sure, there is love and cuddles too. Texting, hand-holding, events, spending time with friends. But what is this structure? Why can‚Äôt we have all these things without so much regular sex? 

Men whine about wanting love and connection. Empathy. A partner. But they also want a sex moppet. And I can tell you, during all of my relationships it was mostly him who wanted all the physical intimacy, and I just went along with it because I was supposed to trust him. Because he was my boyfriend, and that‚Äôs just *what you do* in a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù.

I am not american, abortion is legal in my country and I think free (never had to use it, luckily). Contraception is also free, they even have condoms sometimes there in the health center for people to take. The most recent attack we had was the leader of a conservative party (a woman) saying women should pay a fee to have an abortion to limit the number of abortions they could have and to prevent people from using abortion as contraception. 

In the US it seems that 1) contraception is not free, sometimes even very expensive which limits access to poorer people and 2) religious groups stalk and harass abortion clinics and now apparently are ceasing the opportunity.

Celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment with stories about the people and events that led to the passage of women‚Äôs suffrage in the United States.

Nannie Helen Burroughs, who was a leading educator, feminist and suffragist in the Washington, D.C., area throughout the early 20th century, founded a school for girls and women and was an active member in her community.

Early Life:

Burroughs was born on May 2, 1879, in rural Orange, Virginia. Both of her parents were formerly enslaved, and her father passed away when Burroughs was a young girl. She and her mother subsequently moved to Washington, D.C., where Burroughs spent the majority of her childhood.

She was an exemplary student and graduated with honors from the M Street High School, now the Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. Though she excelled academically, she was denied a teaching job in the Washington, D.C., public school system ‚Äì however, this setback would not hinder her goal to further the education of those in need.

Nannie Training School:

Training School:

Burroughs then decided to establish her own school to educate and train African American women who could not pursue a traditional educational path. Burroughs brought her proposal to the National Baptist Convention, and the organization decided to support her idea. The group bought six acres of land in the Lincoln Heights area of Northwest Washington, D.C., but this was only the beginning of her journey to open the school. Not wanting to rely on wealthy white donors, Burroughs gained the support of small donations from African American women and children to raise the funds to open the school. Once the fiscal matters were in order, Burroughs was able to open the National Training School for Women and Girls in 1909.

Originally operating out of a small farmhouse on the property, the school was popular and well-attended through the first half of the 20th century. The curriculum at the school was rigorous, including courses both vocational and academic, such as dressmaking, power machine operation, music, and physical education. Students could also participate in activities such as the school newspaper. Most of the students came from working-class backgrounds and hailed both from the Washington, D.C., area and other countries around the world.

Early supporters of the school included Black history scholar Dr. Carter G. Woodson and president of the National Association of Colored Women, Mary McCleod Bethune, who also spoke at the dedication ceremony. Burroughs outlined her goals for the school as training women for jobs both in and outside of the traditional female job sphere, and aiming for each student to become ‚Äúthe fiber of a sturdy moral, industrious and intellectual woman.‚Äù In 1928, the school saw an expansion, and a larger building ‚Äì called Trades Hall ‚Äì was constructed, with 12 classrooms, three offices, an assembly hall, and a print shop.

Woman‚Äôs Convention of the National Baptist Convention:

At the same time as Burroughs lead her school and students, she was also an activist and advocate. Notably, she was involved in supporting greater civil rights and suffrage for African Americans and women. She wrote and spoke extensively on these topics, highlighting the need for African American and white women to work together to achieve the right to vote for all. She also emphasized that suffrage for African American women was key in protecting them in a persistently prejudiced and discriminatory society.

Starting early in her career, she was active in the Woman‚Äôs Convention of the National Baptist Convention, many of whose members were fellow suffragists and who discussed suffrage topics at their meetings. In 1900 she delivered a speech at the group‚Äôs annual meeting entitled ‚ÄúHow Sisters Are Hindered from Helping,‚Äù and at the 1905 First Baptist World Alliance meeting in London, gave a speech called ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Part in the World‚Äôs Work.‚Äù Burroughs also served as the corresponding secretary of the Woman‚Äôs Convention for 48 years and helped the organization grow its membership to 1.5 million by 1907.

Legacy:

Throughout her life she also became part of the vibrant community of African American women suffragists, advocating for the cause alongside Coralie Franklin Cook, Anna Julia Cooper, Angelina Weld Grimk√©, Lucy Diggs Slowe, and Mary Church Terrell. African American women‚Äôs clubs were a strong network in Washington, D.C., and Burroughs was also active in these groups, including the National Association of Colored Women, the National Association of Wage Earners, and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History.

Burroughs served as president of her school until her death on May 20, 1961, and three years later, the school changed its name to the Nannie Helen Burroughs School in her honor.

An educator and humanitarian, Clarissa ‚ÄúClara‚Äù Harlowe Barton helped distribute needed supplies to the Union Army during the Civil War and later founded the disaster relief organization, the American Red Cross.

Born on December 25, 1821 in Oxford, Massachusetts, Barton was the youngest of Stephen and Sarah Barton‚Äôs five children. Her father was a prosperous farmer. As a teenager, Barton helped care for her seriously ill brother David‚Äîher first experience as a nurse.

Barton‚Äôs family directed their painfully shy daughter to become a teacher upon the recommendation of renowned phrenologist L.N. Fowler, who examined her as a girl. She began teaching at age 18, founded a school for workers‚Äô children at her brother‚Äôs mill when she was 24, and after moving to Bordentown, New Jersey, established the first free school there in 1852. She resigned when she discovered that the school had hired a man at twice her salary, saying she would never work for less than a man.

In 1854 she was hired as a recording clerk at the US Patent Office in Washington, DC, the first woman appointed to such a post. She was paid $1,400 annually, the same as her male colleagues. However, the following year, Secretary of the Interior Robert McClelland, who opposed women working in government, reduced her to copyist with a lower salary. In 1857, the Buchanan Administration eliminated her position entirely, but in 1860, she returned as copyist after the election of President Abraham Lincoln.

When the Civil War began in 1861, Barton quit her job and made it her mission to bring supplies to Union soldiers in need‚Äîamong them, men of the 6th Massachusetts Infantry. This started a life-long career of aiding people in times of conflict and disaster. In 1862, she received official permission to transport supplies to battlefields and was at every major battle in Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina, where she also tended to the wounded and became known as the ‚Äúangel of the battlefield.‚Äù She was officially named head nurse for one of General Benjamin Butler‚Äôs units in 1864, even though she had no formal medical training. She joined Frances Gage in helping to prepare slaves for their lives in freedom. After the war, Barton helped locate missing soldiers, mark thousands of graves, and testified in Congress about her wartime experiences.

In 1869, Barton traveled through Europe to regain her health. While in Switzerland, she learned about the International Red Cross, established in Geneva in 1864. Returning to the US, Barton built support for the creation of an American society of the Red Cross by writing pamphlets, lecturing, and meeting with President Rutherford B. Hayes. On May 21, 1881, the American Association of the Red Cross was formed; Barton was elected president in June. In 1882, the US joined the International Red Cross.

Barton remained with the Red Cross until 1904, attending national and international meetings, aiding with disasters, helping the homeless and poor, and writing about her life and the Red Cross. She was also an ardent supporter of women‚Äôs suffrage. In 1904, she established the National First Aid Association of America, an organization that emphasized emergency preparedness and developed first aid kits. Her Glen Echo, Maryland home became a National Historic Site in 1975, the first dedicated to the achievements of a woman.",True,False,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,7220,public,top,self,,,Clara Barton (1821-1912) (WGHOW),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wgtow/comments/nfiand/clara_barton_18211912_wghow/,,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I always had low self esteem and had Imposer Syndrome even when I was working on research in my original field of study... This was only accentuated since I started working in IT because: 1) in IT it's  impossible to know everything , 2) I don't have a degree in this area... not that it seems to matter, lots of successful people in this area don't have degrees, but still when I don't know something I think it's because I don't have a degree. So then to alleviate my counsciousness I decided to take online courses from a bachelor degree in computer science, though I am only doing it part time so it will take me ages to finish. After the first year I still feel like I don't know anything.

I always thought my male classmates were better than me at mathematics, I thought they had a faster reasoning, whilst I would have to study a lot to achieve good results and that's why I didn't pursue an engineering field when I was 18... even though I had top grades in mathematics, I thought I wasn't smart enough. In IT, as you might imagine most people are guys, most inventions in this field were made my men (I rejoice everytime I read about a woman inventor like Ada Lovelace or Grace Hopper).

I feel inferior because I come from a family that never stimulated me to study, I am the first in my extended family to ever graduate college, my parents are not even slighty proud I finished my degree, in fact even prefer to pay compliments to my brother who decided to go work after high school, saying he is smarter, because studying didn't take me anywhere whilst my brother already has a car and a girlfriend. Then I feel inferior because I a woman and because I don't have a degree in my field. 

Also doesn't help that I am not much of a people person and I am a socialist, sympathizer with the communist party of my country so as you may imagine corporate procedures do not make me feel very enthusiatic. I don't like working that much because most corporate jobs are a bit useless and don't add anything valuable to society and also they always try to rob you anyway they can in your salary (at least in my country). I completely oppose working more than 8h a day, in fact feel like 8h is already too much and lately spend way too much time on reddit honestly. 
I feel stagnated and bored in my current job but I've been postponing seeking another job because I am afraid I'll just end up in a worst place (at least my current place is in government, so less corporate BS) and also I hate interviews with those phony human resources people full of their corporate big words and shit. 

My dream would be to accumulate as much money as possible in the next decade working in corporate positions (because unfortunately that's where the money is) so I can buy property and once I pay it off I'll retire, travel and eventually go to academia to study some social science or even pursue a PhD. 

Socialist, anti-work, feminist, anti-corporate, introvert, suffering from chronic depression due to crapy traumatic childhood with bullying and mentally ill parents, Virgo, strong opionioated personality and a woman. Guess they didn't have more curses to pass on me hehe

I'm not sure how I got the weight back, but I decided not to care anymore. When I was little my mom would joke that I was getting fat when I never was. When I was losing a lot of weight because I was on some ADHD medication. The woman then wanted to act concerned that I was losing weight. Before I left for the military my dad said I ate too much food and I needed to lose weight. 

Why does a woman need to weigh a certain amount just to be seen as attractive? Of course I'm not going to let myself get overweight. It's just all my life my parents would point out how much I was eating, that it's going to make me gain weight. It was annoying.

It doesn't help that she's South Asian and grew up on very... problematic... Soap operas and scandalous movies. 

But all SSC can talk about is how she's totally a feminist and her stories are all about women fighting the patriarchy and the caste system while still finding love! üíï I'm at my wits end and could use some book, movie, show recommendations for healthy romances, non-romances, and women with freaking agency!!!

Overall issues: 

Action Heroines with No Action. We are writing fantasy and action-adventure, genres with few well developed female characters as is. When I was younger I used to write entire outlines of the character as male and then switch them to female when I wrote my first draft, in order to prevent any preconceived notions of what a female story should look like from affecting my writing. Sweet Summer Child has no self-awareness. She will insist her female MCs are the heroes -- assassin princesses, superheroines, and Goddess Avatars -- and STILL have every conflict wrapped up with men saving them. Not only that, she can't write them training. She never seems to know what weapons her female warriors use. She does NOT have these problems for male warriors, she's written several scenes of males training, fighting, getting hurt.

I HAVE pointed out to her that if writing women as warriors really does make her uncomfortable, she doesn't HAVE to write it. She could write a Baggins-type story about a sweet non-action hero who saves the day being their sweet pacifist selves. 

Romance stories with no romance: I asked SSC what her favorite ships are and she said Joker and Harley Quinn, Light Yagami and Misa, Anakin Skywalker and Ashoka, Gin and Matsumoto, and Sasuke and Sakura. If you know even a DROP of Geek culture, then you can extrapolate that every single one of these relationships is abusive. Technically, none of them are even relationships. Every single one of these is the man NOT wanting a romantic relationship with the woman, and the only attention he gives the woman is to use her trust for his own benefit. But SSC is OBSESSED with the ""She can change him"" narrative. If she said that her favorite Star Wars ship was Han Solo and Leia or even Kylo Ren and Rey, I could WORK with that and introduce her to much healthier ""brooding anti-heroes"". But saying her favorite ship is Darth Vader with his old student shows that she is mainly attracted to 100% emotional unavailability and incompatibility. 

Even the ONE wholesome ship I got her to name was simply two middle-aged mentors with a long-standing cordial, but distant relationship, minor characters in someone else's story. The Romantic leads of the novel (and some short stories) I have been helping her with are based off this couple. She projects their completely platonic relationship as ""very shy and feeling unworthy of love"", decades of repressed feelings and has mirrored them exactly in her story. THAT'S  how attracted she is to people with emotional attachment issues.

Actually, SSC needs a therapist more than a book rec. I've broached the subject with her. Girl don't disagree! Does anyone know any good articles that address these issues holistically, about attachment disorders and adrenaline rushes, as well as any recommendations about projecting violence onto females to make them feel worthy and strong? 

I try to bounce between serious topics and pleasant ones to keep her comfortable and talking. ""So... I noticed that every father written in your stories eventually becomes abusive, even if they didn't start that way..."" Followed up with ""So, what magic system do you want the princess to use: an innate one or a conjuring one?""

Nevertheless, I want to ask for your perspective if you've had serious romantic relationships before.   


My whole life, I've always had a really hard time with feeling inferior/subordinated to the romantic partners of the people I love, particularly as a single person. When I think about being single for life, one of the toughest things about it for me emotionally is the concept of never being anyone else's most important person, favorite person, primary companion, priority, etc. I have never believed that I should have to be romantically coupled to be that for someone, and I'm not going to spend my life in a series of difficult, temporary romantic relationships just to access that feeling. But if most women spend life coupled up and they all put their spouses/lovers far above everyone else they know, then odds aren't good for me ever being someone's most important person, unless I can find a permanently single woman to be my best friend, which would thrill me.   


When you were in a serious romantic relationship in the past, how did you honestly feel about your female best friend, other friends, sister(s), etc., compared to how you felt about your lover?

I also knew I was a lesbian at a young age but felt i needed to date men because i had so little self esteem that I felt I needed to be like my friends at that time and do what they were doing. I realise now what a huge mistake that was. 

When I hear about me who say women 'hit the wall' after a certain age, it makes me so angry, especially when a lot of these guys are far from oil paintings themselves. Even though I'm queer and have gone my own way anyway, I still find it hard to not internalise and take in this misogyny because I listened to it for a long time.

I think this is a great idea and I would love a list, but I am struggling to think of any movies to add!

What a sad reflection on the world.

Edit: The movie Wild *almost* but not quite counts, since she does have flashbacks to leaving her husband.

Honestly it‚Äôs going to sound dumb but I LOVED Frozen!

It was one of the few Disney movies I‚Äôve actually connected with because it‚Äôs not about romance primarily

Even as a little girl I only liked the music and songs in Disney cartoons but not the romance/prince/princess stuff

I think Frozen is empowering because it‚Äôs about family, friendship, sacrifice, sisterhood idk I really liked it and I had no kids to watch it for heheh

I then procceeded to read the wikipedia page about it, mostly to learn about the sociological and anthropological justifications of this macabre act: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation

And found this controversial analysis

&gt;The opposition to the practice is not without its critics, particularly among anthropologists, who have raised difficult questions about cultural relativism and the universality of human rights.[11]

&gt;Anthropologists have accused FGM eradicationists of cultural colonialism, and have been criticized in turn for their moral relativism and failure to defend the idea of universal human rights.[239] According to critics of the eradicationist position, the biological reductionism of the opposition to FGM, and the failure to appreciate FGM's cultural context, serves to ""other"" practitioners and undermine their agency‚Äîin particular when parents are referred to as ""mutilators"".[240]
Africans who object to the tone of FGM opposition risk appearing to defend the practice. The feminist theorist Obioma Nnaemeka, herself strongly opposed to FGM, argued in 2005 that renaming the practice female genital mutilation had introduced ""a subtext of barbaric African and Muslim cultures and the West's relevance (even indispensability) in purging [it]"".[241] According to Ugandan law professor Sylvia Tamale, the early Western opposition to FGM stemmed from a Judeo-Christian judgment that African sexual and family practices, including not only FGM but also dry sex, polygyny, bride price and levirate marriage, required correction. African feminists ""take strong exception to the imperialist, racist and dehumanising infantilization of African women"", she wrote in 2011.[242] Commentators highlight the voyeurism in the treatment of women's bodies as exhibits. Examples include images of women's vulvas after FGM or girls undergoing the procedure.[243] The 1996 Pulitzer-prize-winning photographs of a 16-year-old Kenyan girl experiencing FGM were published by 12 American newspapers, without her consent either to be photographed or to have the images published.[244]
The debate has highlighted a tension between anthropology and feminism, with the former's focus on tolerance and the latter's on equal rights for women. According to the anthropologist Christine Walley, a common position in anti-FGM literature has been to present African women as victims of false consciousness participating in their own oppression, a position promoted by feminists in the 1970s and 1980s, including Fran Hosken, Mary Daly and Hanny Lightfoot-Klein.[245] It prompted the French Association of Anthropologists to issue a statement in 1981, at the height of the early debates, that ""a certain feminism resuscitates (today) the moralistic arrogance of yesterday's colonialism"".

And this disturbing data

&gt;Dahabo Musa, a Somali woman, described infibulation in a 1988 poem as the ""three feminine sorrows"": the procedure itself, the wedding night when the woman is cut open, then childbirth when she is cut again.[105] Despite the evident suffering, it is women who organize all forms of FGM.[106][r] Anthropologist Rose Oldfield Hayes wrote in 1975 that educated Sudanese men who did not want their daughters to be infibulated (preferring clitoridectomy) would find the girls had been sewn up after the grandmothers arranged a visit to relatives.[111] Gerry Mackie has compared the practice to footbinding. Like FGM, footbinding was carried out on young girls, nearly universal where practised, tied to ideas about honour, chastity, and appropriate marriage, and ""supported and transmitted"" by women.
FGM practitioners see the procedures as marking not only ethnic boundaries but also gender differences. According to this view, male circumcision defeminizes men while FGM demasculinizes women.[114] Fuambai Ahmadu, an anthropologist and member of the Kono people of Sierra Leone, who in 1992 underwent clitoridectomy as an adult during a Sande society initiation, argued in 2000 that it is a male-centred assumption that the clitoris is important to female sexuality. African female symbolism revolves instead around the concept of the womb.[113] Infibulation draws on that idea of enclosure and fertility. ""[G]enital cutting completes the social definition of a child's sex by eliminating external traces of androgyny,"" Janice Boddy wrote in 2007. ""The female body is then covered, closed, and its productive blood bound within; the male body is unveiled, opened, and exposed.""[115]
In communities where infibulation is common, there is a preference for women's genitals to be smooth, dry and without odour, and both women and men may find the natural vulva repulsive.[116] Some men seem to enjoy the effort of penetrating an infibulation.[117] The local preference for dry sex causes women to introduce substances into the vagina to reduce lubrication, including leaves, tree bark, toothpaste and Vicks menthol rub.[118] The WHO includes this practice within Type IV FGM, because the added friction during intercourse can cause lacerations and increase the risk of infection.[119] Because of the smooth appearance of an infibulated vulva, there is also a belief that infibulation increases hygiene.[120]
Common reasons for FGM cited by women in surveys are social acceptance, religion, hygiene, preservation of virginity, marriageability and enhancement of male sexual pleasure.[121] In a study in northern Sudan, published in 1983, only 17.4 percent of women opposed FGM (558 out of 3,210), and most preferred excision and infibulation over clitoridectomy.[122] Attitudes are changing slowly. In Sudan in 2010, 42 percent of women who had heard of FGM said the practice should continue.[123] In several surveys since 2006, over 50 percent of women in Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gambia, and Egypt supported FGM's continuance, while elsewhere in Africa, Iraq, and Yemen most said it should end, although in several countries only by a narrow margin.[124]

I'm not a homeowner, sure, but my modest studio apartment is comfortable to me. It's all I need in this phase of my life. It blew my mind to think, people out there have a *goal* to be who I am. 

I'm 26 years old, I have a master's degree in a STEM field, I support myself, I save for retirement and to pay down my student debts, I have a loving cat, and many hobbies I am deeply passionate about. In fact, they compete for all the time in my life I don't spend with friends and family. My life on paper is so delightful, and I even *consciously built this life*. So why do I find myself so often wondering why I'm not ""good enough"" for a partner? Why am I not ""good enough"" for the life script? Why am I not ""good enough"" to be the woman my parents trained me to be? 

It seems silly, but it is so incredibly hard to escape those expectations that have been socialized into us. I *know* that they are wrong, I *know*, deep in my knowing, meeting those expectations was never for me, it was never going to serve me. So why is it so hard to stop defining myself by them? 

Anyway, seeing someone say that my life is a goal to them was extremely validating, and allowed me to take on a new perspective on the life I've built, and start celebrating it.

‚ÄòHe who cares the least owns the most power in the relationship‚Äô

I think it's about time we took a critical eye to the way we treat victims. If you feel like I‚Äôm preaching to you I don‚Äôt care, give me clout by talking about it. I mean this beyond the general conversations we have about rape which let me emphasize IS important, NEEDS to be discussed, and we ALL need to believe victims first before siding with a potential rapist.

But fundamentally my essay is questioning WHY that should even be said in the first place? If someone is stealing or doing something wrong, does it make sense to blame the shop owner for having products? That She should have been more responsible over Her things and assume the ill will of every fucking human being that crosses Her path?

No. The one who is in the wrong, is the one who decides to commit the social offense. The asshole who is not abiding by the rules, causing harm to another and disrespecting their autonomy. The monster is not the person being bullied (who shouldn‚Äôt have to go through so much effort to prove it), it's the asshole who thinks he has the right to disrespect another human being with whom he shares this planet.

Let me take it a bit further in context that may be more palatable - let's talk about race.

Disclaimer \* I‚Äôm about to generalize here, if you don‚Äôt like it sucks to suck you‚Äôre part of the problem.

It should not be the responsibility of people of color to take on the mental and emotional labour of the burden of the white man or woman. It wasn't MY ancestors that fucked everything up, I didn‚Äôt and haven't decided that over the course of generations that the only people that matter are a minority of people without color who are truly the odd ones because THEY are melanin deficient (seriously baffling to me but that‚Äôs a separate conversation).

No JOHN I‚Äôm not going to explain equality to you or why touching my goddamn hair is wrong, get literate and READ or use fucking google. You (yes you) not taking responsibility for yourself and your actions is a copout. Also, stop looking at me during black history month to see my response, I‚Äôm looking at YOU because your entire race and class are full of genocidel monsters.

I‚Äôm not arguing with an incel or a men‚Äôs rights activist about feminism. Why? Because again, women are not the perpetrators here (feel however you want about that). We understand ‚Äònot all men‚Äô (but definitely you), we understand that there are many male rape victims (many of which are children or in prison), we understand your arguments about war and personhood and all that.

But feminism isn‚Äôt the reason why you‚Äôve been oppressed. The guilty party is OTHER MEN not Susan who turned you down when you asked her for a date. Don‚Äôt believe me? If you‚Äôre truly a men's rights activist then I‚Äôm sure you know about the existence of Men‚Äôs studies and have read passionately upon the subject. Be a REAL advocate for men by standing up for THEIR RIGHTS not wasting time by trying to force your opinions (which are 100% wrong by the way and I‚Äôm not going to apologize for saying that, cry me a river.) on others. Stop silencing them, stop intimidating them, YOU are the minority dickhead.

I HIGHLY HIGHLY doubt the trolls read down this far, but if you did know that I‚Äôm not trying to change your opinion, what I said isn't up for debate.

They don't lack information. After all, men tell us everyday and in million different ways (on micro and macro levels) that they despise us and don't give a shit abt us. Whether it's through politics, through rape and other forms sexual violence, by letting men who abuse women off the hook, by disrespecting us in different ways.

I really don't understand why. This is just my experience of wgtow and being childfree.

I hate having to bond over parenthood or pregnancy. Although I like my neices. I think they're fun. I cannot find even the faintest way to talk to my sister and build a relationship with her through the raising of her child. Well I do try to but it feels like she would rather talk to her twin about that sort of thing anyway. Its all my twin sisters talk about. Which is fine we go out to dinner sometimes, hang out sometimes, I like playing with her kid but.... Although we get along really well and like each other she does not even know how to talk about say... books, or movies, or art. I always end up talking with her husband about it so its meh whatever.. Still I feel like those are general topics of conversation anyone can get into.

Still thats not the point. Not sure what it is with me. What is wrong with me with how much I hate motherhood so much anyway? I have no idea where it comes from. I live in Texas and they're trying to ban abortion after 6 weeks. It really outrages me, it really makes me realize I live such a thin line away from disgust and hate. If I had to live with a pregnancy I would become bitter. My entire story would turn inside out and I would really lose my mind. I HATE the idea of ever having to become a mother. Honestly maybe it would even be worse than rape to me, because I'd have to deal with it for 20 years or more. I'm sorry if that's insensitive. Its the ultimate nightmare scenario. Just how deep is this hate of motherhood and pregnancy etc all that supposed to go? I usually don't think about it much but I felt really black today...

I don‚Äôt know how much of a popular or well known opinion this is, but I honestly just can‚Äôt help but feel so cheated as to how capitalism and women‚Äôs rights seem to be so damn incompatible with one another and just how much capitalism has screwed over women as a whole. It‚Äôs truly the system that has positioned men and women in an unequal economic relationship with employers, unequal positions within their own households and jobs, unequal positions when it comes to what society considers the ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù of men and women within nature, unequal positions in terms of authority and independence and power, unequal authority when it comes to equality of true opportunity, and just a certain sense of unfairness that infects all the other aspects of their relationships. Capitalism is a system that makes women giving birth to their oppressors, degrading themselves whilst seeing it as ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù, accepting this type of unfairness when it comes to division of labour and value of individual labour, accepting mistreatment and being put in inherent subservient positions within their own homes, and being unable to reach their true potential solely due to being unable to thrive in an economy which encourages female inferiority and devaluing women as a whole whilst being specifically catered to ‚Äúmasculine ideals‚Äù and the male-standard of success to thrive only. Capitalism and the general nature of what it values, how it functions, and what it takes to thrive within a capitalist society, all end up devaluing women as a whole and invalidating female-specific strengths and capitalizing off of women‚Äôs insecurities along with throwing marriages/relationships off balance as a whole.

Within a capitalist system, the select few privileged 1% of men and anyone who is a ‚Äúman‚Äù willing to give up their dignities and lives to chase the bad, whereas the rest of everyone else (women and minorities) are all exploited and abused. And for this reason, they‚Äôll never be able to truly be seen as equals within our society.

The economy and modes of production affect our sociology as human beings and our thoughts, ideas, behaviors, and innovations more so than the other way around. Humans adapt and evolve consistently to fit into the specific environment that the economy creates for them solely in order to be able to keep the slaves of the genes going properly. Even if it‚Äôs not preferable and harms human beings as a whole, throughout history and even today, humans have and continued to do what they needed to do to survive themselves and eventually end up reproducing according to the conditions that the economy has set up for them. Human beings evolve and change depending on our material reality, and the economy plays a huge part in shaping our culture and behaviors as a whole.

Women especially are affected by this as a whole, because historically, they were the ones that were oppressed and typically weaker and too agreeable and didn‚Äôt have much power within life. For this reason, a lot of them had to resort to trying to conform into society solely to survive and learn to please males solely in order to have any bit of power within life and to fulfill what people thought was their true purpose in life; motherhood. Women are the ones whose brains are designed to quickly adapt to change, adapting and evolving to the worlds that their men build and destroy with no second thought. The ones who adapt and are socialized to fit into the specific culture of specific countries which are mediated by the specific economic environment of those specific places. And for this reason, a lot of their behaviors and interests and life choices are heavily mediated by this solely in order to survive and to eventually give birth and raise children. Job choices, potential, education, IQ, personality, feminism, interests, etc. are all aspects of women that have the ability to change depending on a variety of factors and have the ability to be directly affected by the economy alone. That plus women being more risk-averse on average, most of them won‚Äôt go up and far to change the world nor chase their dreams, and instead stick to a solid and predictable path to guarantee optimal success when it comes to what society wants them to be and in order to assure their own security within life. For a lot of women, security &gt;&gt;&gt; freedom; one of the various aspects of women that capitalism isn‚Äôt meant to accommodate for nor does it allow women to truly reach their full potential and finally be equals within society.

What does capitalism value exactly?

Capitalism is a system that values the gaining and pursuit of profit over all else. It‚Äôs an establishment that prioritizes those that can exploit others, especially minorities, to gain more money and privilege within their own hands. It awards those who are psychopathic enough to pursue a life in which they feel like either working 80+ hours a week to survive is ‚Äúrewarding‚Äù and ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù, and to those who build and destroy without a care in the world about those affected. Anything that can‚Äôt make profit === un-valuable and useless. It‚Äôs a system that strives for individuality above all else, devaluing familial and humanistic values that would be beneficial to people as a whole and strives to provide ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù for the select minority of men over the equality of whole nations. And yes, ‚Äúmen‚Äù in particular.

‚ÄúMan‚Äù, or more specifically the concept of a ‚Äúman‚Äù, is someone with a lot of power. Someone who is a natural materialist; valuing wealth and money over all else. Someone who's driven and impacted by ego as opposed to society, willing to take massive risks without regard to any other aspect of their lives solely in order to get to the top, greedy, valuing freedom over security, career over family, profit over altruism, individualism over community identity, and someone who lives with a constant drive to dominate things in the field of power and status. All of these traits are ones that rule the ‚Äúestablishments‚Äù of the current day and are specifically designed to support a male-lead and male-dominated world first and foremost, accentuating ‚Äúmale strengths‚Äù and traits and devaluing anyone who doesn‚Äôt fit into the specific requirements to succeed in this capitalist world. And women are the most noteworthy victims of this.

The ‚Äúrules‚Äù of the establishment are those that are meant to keep the power imbalance between the sexes high and ‚Äúin their proper place‚Äù, which eventually leads to striving to keep women in a continuous state of servitude; whether it be to massive corporations who don‚Äôt care at all about their interests nor autonomy and care only to exploit women for bigger gain of wealth. Or within the own home in which a woman is expected to act as a glorified domesticated servant to her husband and kids, lacking the financial independence and true freedom of opportunity to do much else, but choosing to stay any way because it‚Äôs what ultimately ends up being better for the family. In order to keep family-dynamics stable and in place, women need to give up their autonomy and independence and inherent power within their lives. In order to have a successful career, women have to give up any idea of love and family along with their identities, respect dignity, and having to whore out to bosses and managers and everyone else in positions of authority solely in order to move up, only to get cruelly pushed aside later on when they are no longer considered ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù to the male gaze that rules our society (which is further accentuated by the nature of capitalism as a whole that encourages the viewing of women‚Äôs bodies and youth as a commodity).

When you realize that as a woman, you truly have the choice to only choose between 2 extremes, a lot of them revert back to their typical ‚Äúrole‚Äù within society that was mediated by the patriarchy and the history of their oppression since the beginning of time; the role as someone inferior, subservient to men in their own household and within most jobs, the only valuable accomplishments being motherhood regardless if whether it means giving up your sanity and bodily autonomy as a whole, an inherently objectfied being whose body is sought and sold as a commodity for male pleasure only (except this time it's in the guise of being ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúempowering‚Äù, even if it‚Äôs downright regarding and dehumanizing), and all other derogatory things that hold women back and keep them from reaching their true potential in every aspect of their lives. The reason that women tend to revert back to the motherhood role is because it‚Äôs something that the patriarchal standards emphasis by our capitalist economy supports and encourages way more so than the latter and because women as a whole need to do so solely in order to ‚Äúcontribute to society‚Äù in the way it truly needs and the way women think that they are capable of, whilst refusing to do anything about it because by the nature of evolution alone, most women are destined to always live beneath men and lack the power to make a true change.

It‚Äôs what women have evolved within this specific mode of production to be more interested in, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed to be done, it's what women see as what they realistically can do better at as opposed to trying to ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù, and it;s the only way that they are told they can truly contribute to society as a whole due to not being fit to being able to survive and continue the human race otherwise. However, motherhood as a whole is incredibly cucked and messed up, and even more so within our society today and just how it‚Äôs run. It‚Äôs pretty much a scam and something thrown off balance altogether by our system, even if women continue to freely participate in it as a form of voluntary slavery.

Motherhood doesn‚Äôt have inherent value in a capitalist economy, and yet it‚Äôs still seen as something that women should be expected to do as a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù due to the male standards that rule our society along with the traits that are typically associated with being a good mother, aren‚Äôt traits that bode well with being successful in the eyes of capitalism and prevents women from various high-powered careers and leadership positions for this reason, along with finding out that being considered the mothers and caretakers of society first and foremost, doesn‚Äôt do much to further benefit how they are treated and whether they are respected or not. Women are the ones that do most of the ‚Äúunpaid‚Äù labor of society, all of which obviously doesn‚Äôt make profit, which leads to it lacking the respect it truly deserves, which in turn only harms the progression of women‚Äôs rights as a whole and prevents women from truly being seen as equals within society. That along with the fact that since most people simply aren‚Äôt satisfied with their careers in general, women end up being the ones that end up being the ones to take care of their families due to economic restrictions that prevent them from being able to achieve any other dreams in a way that‚Äôs enjoyable, advances society, and isn‚Äôt a complete scam. Regardless of whether motherhood is their dream or not, it‚Äôs what this male dominated society needs women to do, and since what women do typically doesn't result with them having much actual ‚Äúpower‚Äù in society, they all end up falling victim to the trap of this economy and it‚Äôs true patriarchal roots.

Men do not appreciate ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù or women as a whole and all the labour that they provide, and never did. In a capitalist society especially, despite the fact that unpaid labour is one of the most important types of labour required in order to keep the world running, since it can‚Äôt make any actual profit , it‚Äôs instead used as a tool to keep women ‚Äúin their place‚Äù as opposed to being something that‚Äôs genuinely respected. All of this to prevent women from being equals in society and to have power, and since women as a whole have evolved to adapt to the worlds that men make and since many aren‚Äôt actually interested in climbing the corporate ladder until their limbs fall off and don‚Äôt really have that drive to dominate things and due to gender roles instilled within us by nature that a woman‚Äôs greatest value is to be able to give birth and raise children, naturally most women are unable to truly gain the power to run this country on their own terms, and the ones that end up being able to do so often tend to be no better than their male counterparts. Companies run by women aren‚Äôt guaranteed better maternity leave nor work-life balance or lack of discrimination against female counterparts, nor are women capitalists somehow more ‚Äúempathetic‚Äù and less likely to exploit minorities. And even women that may have started out that way, realized that a) it wasn‚Äôt compatible with the system and then just quit or b) realized it wasn‚Äôt compatible and instead decided to continue acting like men and chasing the bag until they reached their goal. A lot of the times, women that are unsuccessful with their careers or creating their own business often become mothers, either by choice or just by chance, and fall back onto that if they ever fail as it‚Äôs what society is willing to encourage more as opposed to women being able to ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù, cause that‚Äôs virtually impossible. And in turn, all of this continues and encourages the cycle of dependency that has held women back since forever.

Motherhood? Lack of respect, loads of cultural hatred and misogyny being directed towards you, being expected to do everything without any real payoff and unappreciated effort, financial dependence that makes you more susceptible to abuse, people criticizing your every move as now kids are expected to be your entire life with no identity of your own and your now expected to be a teacher, social worker, therapist, and counselor to your kids full time as opposed to them just being an extension of your life, the overwhelming costs of raising a child and being able to afford childcare, the sheer side effects of pregnancy on your body along with lack of funding for women‚Äôs health and the medical field which basically treats women like the smaller versions of men when it comes to creating medicines or treatments as women‚Äôs hormones are apparently too ‚Äúmessy‚Äù to study with and due to the lack of female scientists who are willing to advocate for this and the women who just accept this as the reality as they don‚Äôt have much of the power to do much else.

Now when it comes to the concept of ‚Äúpower‚Äù, this is actually another reason as to why a lot of women choose motherhood. I mentioned that men were the ones that were mainly money-hungry and power-seeking, but realistically, human beings as a whole all want power in some way shape or form. And women are no exception, except for the fact that on average, women don‚Äôt exactly have the same way of gaining access to said power in the way that men do. Men who typically show signs of narcissistic behavior typically go into leadership positions to gain control of people that way. Men without a strong sense of identity tend to be the ones that slave away to their careers the most. Women with a lack of identity and/or narcissistic and ‚Äúbully‚Äù tendencies, typically end up becoming mothers and going into jobs where they have direct access to toil with human lives as a whole along with the ability to cause emotional pain and physical pain to those who are vulnerable and weak. Some of the worst women you‚Äôll ever meet tend to be people like mothers, teachers, nurses, social workers, etc. They can have the power to abuse and ruin the lives of human beings they bring onto the world as a way to try to gain power, or they can raise their children to cater to them and increase their own status, both of which are the more ‚Äúfemale-standard‚Äù paths to success that society can encourage. Want power? Marry a rich man who will provide and have his children to prove your status statement.

Power as a whole, however, is also something that‚Äôs culturally and historically known to be something women can also gain specifically by subscribing to and conforming to the patriarchal ideas of femininity as a whole. Why do you think so many women are trying to paint degrading yourself sexually for male pleasure as something ‚Äúempowering‚Äù and ‚Äúgood‚Äù for women? Why are so many derogatory things trying to be disguised as something ‚Äúpositive‚Äù anyway? A lot of women consider it ‚Äúempowering‚Äù because being able to experience some of the niceties under the patriarchal system is what women throughout history had been shown as the pinnacle of true ‚Äúpower‚Äù and ‚Äúautonomy‚Äù they could reach, and it‚Äôs stayed that way in today‚Äôs society. Mediated by the traumas of female socialization and expectations from a young age to view themselves as nothing but whores, it‚Äôs a coping for a lot of women as well. The reason why it‚Äôs seen as good is because sexually exploiting oneself can be a lucrative way to gain profit within our economy as women‚Äôs bodies are often bought and sold as commodities and objects with no other purpose than to conform to the male gaze in order to make money. Motherhood may be nature, but being sex workers and being sexually exploited is also something women had to endure throughout history and to a lot of foolish women, they view it as gaining control over these patriarchal standards when in reality, they‚Äôre just falling prey to it. Living your life under the rules of standards of male expectations is not ‚Äúpower‚Äù and you‚Äôre not getting anything from it except for another path to oppression. Women throughout all cultures and countries throughout history have also had to experience their insecurities heightened and exploited by big corporations solely in order to sell a product, and in turn, women fall victim to this scam solely in order to mold themselves into the male standards of beauty in order to be attractive. Attractive so they can reproduce and so they can gain ‚Äúpower‚Äù in a way that still conforms to the patriarchy for their own security, even if it doesn‚Äôt actually give them any freedom, independence, happiness, or power.Women benign weaker throughout history and with their entire value being reduced down to child-bearing ability, naturally they‚Äôd need to conform solely in order to survive like I mentioned before, and of course part of that conforming aspect has to deal with conforming solely in order to get a man to reproduce with and for them to be ‚Äúprotected‚Äù, even though men are more likely to be their oppressors and abusers as opposed to ‚Äúprotectors‚Äù.

And males of course, stay crying mutiny and creating whole movement trashing and inciting violence against women solely because they hear a few women online saying they like ‚Äú6-inch dicks‚Äù instead of ‚Äú5 inch‚Äù or that they like men that \*gasp\* look attractive to them, and decide that that‚Äôs a violation of their own human rights to sex with a woman and hence become incels, red-pill, mgtow-ers, etc. etc. Truthfully, the audacity of males never fails to baffle me.

Unable to gain power through their careers especially, women typically fall into these set of behaviors in order to even pretend they have autonomy within their own lives and would much rather live in darkness than except the truth that they are just as much of victims and slaves to the capitalist machine as their male counterparts albeit in a much different way a lot of the times, and within a lot of situations of which they themselves brought upon themselves.

And back to the topic, what about when it comes to women‚Äôs careers as a whole? Do that somehow make them more miserable than motherhood? Honestly, nobody truly loves their careers as much as this capitalist society likes to shove down our throats. Realistically, even if you do something you love, you‚Äôll come to realize that trying to monetize a passion is the best way to get bored and tired of it quickly. You need a stable salary in order to truly live a decent life as nobody will be willing to support you otherwise, and that of course means prioritizing making a profit when it comes to your ‚Äúdream career‚Äù. All careers, even those that are about ‚Äúhelping others‚Äù and altruism, become corporatism at some point in time. The more well paying it is, the more money-hungry people who don‚Äôt actually care about other people and are just looking to fill their own pockets fill these jobs And not to mention most of the times they also get male dominated and get created into an environment in which you basically have to be ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù to succeed, and is unable to accommodate for women as a whole with this culture, which leads to women not being able ti prosper in these careers and eventually nature comes in and makes it so women as a whole are no longer interested in these careers solely because our sociology itself is so affected my the economy at hand. We are influenced by our material reality and the modes of production of the economy when it comes to our thoughts, history, idea, innovation, etc. and not the other way around. And of course, if a job is lower paid and lacks job security and benefits, a lot of talented and passionate people in these field eventually leave and get burned out because they realize their talent is not sustainable in the long run. Research and science itself is an industry that‚Äôs a huge victim of this. The majority of genuinely talented and smart people who want to go into the science field, realize that it‚Äôs pretty much a scam and working there wouldn't call for ‚Äúground-breaking‚Äù innovation and the advancement of society as a whole, but more so a way to slave away whilst not being able to make a proper living for themselves and instead peddle money for the rich all whilst realizing people are willing to hinder a lot of scientific advancements if it means making more profit from just ‚Äúimproving‚Äù already existing profits, and with the realization that even with many technological advancement, the majority of people probably wouldn't have access to a lot of the improvement that could be granted by scientific innovation any way due to the economy in which most of the wealth belongs to the top 1%. Realistically, having more women in STEM within this economy would not change or improve shit.

And again, this is another one of the reasons why there aren‚Äôt more women in certain careers in the first place. This along with the terrible lifestyle and work-life balance and having to basically choose between career and family, in which most women choose the latter. Our workplace as a whole is built with the typical ‚Äúcareer man whose willing to work 60+ hours a week cause he has no responsibilities when it comes to child-rearing nor focusing on family‚Äù in mind as the vision of the ‚Äúaverage worker‚Äù, and naturally capitalists are wanting to increase their profit over all else and overworking their workers like slaves is the best way to do so, with no concern in the world for women and mothers with children who are also wanting to enter the workforce. Realistically speaking, if we had things like paid extended maternity leave, public childcare, and more understanding of work-life balance and benefits to people working part-time, then a lot of women would want to actively be in the work-force way more as opposed to giving it up to raise children, but that‚Äôs not going to happen any time soon.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, capitalism cares about women...About exploiting them just like men. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am not going down the path of ‚ÄúfEmInIsM rUinEd eVeRyThiNg‚Äù by allowing women in the workforce, because that‚Äôs not the case at all. Women have always had it unfair when it comes to work, and there has never been a time when they stayed home and did nothing (and not even in the 50s where the whole circle jerk of ‚Äúhappy housewives‚Äù created by the manosphere apparently took place). The difference between then and now, is that then women were forced to work low-paying menial jobs they didn‚Äôt want and having a tiring job and raising children was a requirement as opposed to a choice like now. Women who were housewives either worked equally hard or were depressed (Peak the popularity of ‚ÄúFeminine Mystique‚Äù, overwhelming percentage of valium addiction, ‚ÄúMommy‚Äôs Little Helper‚Äù, higher child abuse rates, etc). And again, this phenomenon in the 50s was another result of the economy at this time. Economy throughout history has been the driving force of society and the influence of women‚Äôs rights and feminism. At certain points in time, division of labor was necessary to the point where absolutely no ‚Äúfeminist thinking‚Äù would have been able to increase gender equality as humans need to adapt themselves still to fit in with their material surroundings, and a lot of that does in fact result in a power imbalance between men and women. Women weren‚Äôt allowed in the work-force in the first place due to feminism in the US, but due to WWII in which women working jobs that men previously held was basically a necessity. Of course afterwards when they were forced back into the kitchen, they had a whole movement for it, but the economy after WWII changed a lot of things about society as a whole and was a huge mediator in creating and shaping our current day economy. Hell at one point women would have probably entered the workforce anyway due to geopolitical reasons alone. If the economy wasn‚Äôt fit for it, no amount of ‚Äúfeminism‚Äù would have been able to change anything.

Speaking of careers, a lot of women often see their careers as a way to gain ‚Äúequal rights' ' and ‚Äúequality‚Äù, and in a way it is. I mean being able to be in a successful career == you are able to be a ‚Äúman‚Äù enough to gain power within this economy as a whole and hence, men have no choice but to see you as even slightly equal to them. Which again, shows how men do not actually appreciate ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù nor what women do as a whole. In the least gender equal countries, women often make up greater percentages of STEM careers and leadership positions and women see having a career as a way to be empowered and independent, as being successful in any pursuit other than motherhood is the way for the men to see them as even remotely equal to them. Now this of course, doesn't change how women can be equally exploited within capitalism as a whole, because they do. But sadly, until women stop working under the system and somehow choosing the tolerate the patriarchy if they get to experience some of the superficial temporary ‚Äúbenefits'' given out by men due to fulfilling their ‚Äúnatural role‚Äù (which of course wears out by the time they secede reproductive age), and instead work the system and gain power within a way that both allows them to make an executive change for the better, our situation will never change. But of course, realistically speaking, women as a whole aren‚Äôt really equipped to ‚Äúwork the system‚Äù as a whole, and economic values mixed in with our Western culture in particular which enforced the typical ‚Äúgender roles'' because that seems to be the only way to even remotely be happy/seen as the better option within the societal expectations that dictate a man or woman‚Äôs role in society, prevent this from happening even more.

Men of course, are the ones that continue to be the ones that work full time to fulfill their role as ‚Äúprovider‚Äù and to prove they made it as a man in society (which of course is easier as capitalism as a whole is made to accommodate who ‚Äúman‚Äù by nature is more so than women). This of course leads to a variety of problems in reality as the ‚Äúnuclear family model‚Äù truthfully is a scam on both sides. It leads the man to be a work-crazy psychopath with no care about other people or time with his own family, and leads the women to be financially dependent, unfulfilled, with no way to gain education nor emotional security. The amount of men in real life that would rather be cramped up in offices all day solely to avoid their ‚Äúnagging wife and kids‚Äù is staggering. Capitalism affects men very negatively, which in turn affects women negatively as well. And of course, like I mentioned back before, women continue to encourage this type of stuff equally.

Porn for example and the objectification of women online is a billion dollar industry and it‚Äôs currently a very lucrative business for women as a whole to be able to make money. It‚Äôs been shown, in every culture and every country, that men are 1000 times better when they are NOT exposed to porn and yet...people still encourage porn. It truly doesn‚Äôt help how much social media as a whole has revolutionized this industry dedicated to women objectifying themselves for the male gaze, and then people online being fed the narrative that it;' somehow ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù and ‚Äúempowering‚Äù, and the increased existence of liberal feminism as a whole which encourages this. Because of course, slaving away to capitalism is a much better and more lucrative way to live than encouraging women to have basic self-respect. Then of course you have various companies that continue to profit off of women‚Äôs insecurities along with creating a culture that supports buying and selling women's bodies as objects and a sexualized series of body parts regardless of how that negatively affects people as a whole. All of this mixed together truly makes women believe that they have no purpose other than whoring out to men and trying to justify it as being something positive. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where things like ‚Äúvaginal cosmetic surgeries‚Äù so much as exist, because women are willing to try to make themselves pleasurable to men. It honestly disgusts me just how much all these negative aspects of female socialization is so much encouraged and that seeing women as nothing but objects is able to be translated into genuine business ideas. And of course, let‚Äôs not forget how much of a scam the current new popular ‚Äútradwife trend‚Äù and glorification of the ‚Äúnuclear family dynamic‚Äù is. Like I mentioned, it leads men to having no humanistic values or placing no importance on family as a whole which throws off family dynamics and the quality of relationships as they give up their lives to work, whereas the woman stays being considered inferior in so many other aspects within life and unable to truly have the freedom to do anything else.

Honestly, I just despise the way society is run as a looking back at it, until our economy radically changes one day, no matter what cultural change people try to push and no matter what type of new technology tries to claim that it will ‚Äúimprove‚Äù the lives of others, until we get radical changes to our economy first and foremost, I do not ever see women being able to break past this cycle. And as long as they continue to give birth to their oppressors and keep the slaves of genes going in a world where everyone ends up being a mere victim to the system, a cog in the machine, and existing in a life where the only thing guaranteed is pain and sorrow...Nothing will ever change for the better.",True,False,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,7748,public,top,self,,,capitalist clownery ü§°,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wgtow/comments/o5slzm/capitalist_clownery/,,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,

It‚Äôs truly the system that has positioned men and women in an unequal economic relationship with employers, unequal positions within their own households and jobs, unequal positions when it comes to what society considers the ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù of men and women within nature, unequal positions in terms of authority and independence and power, unequal authority when it comes to equality of true opportunity, and just a certain sense of unfairness that infects all the other aspects of their relationships. Capitalism is a system that makes women giving birth to their oppressors, degrading themselves whilst seeing it as ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù, accepting this type of unfairness when it comes to division of labour and value of individual labour, accepting mistreatment and being put in inherent subservient positions within their own homes, and being unable to reach their true potential solely due to being unable to thrive in an economy which encourages female inferiority and devaluing women as a whole whilst being specifically catered to ‚Äúmasculine ideals‚Äù and the male-standard of success to thrive only. Capitalism and the general nature of what it values, how it functions, and what it takes to thrive within a capitalist society, all end up devaluing women as a whole and invalidating female-specific strengths and capitalizing off of women‚Äôs insecurities along with throwing marriages/relationships off balance as a whole. \n\nWithin a capitalist system, the select few privileged 1% of men and anyone who is a ‚Äúman‚Äù willing to give up their dignities and lives to chase the bad, whereas the rest of everyone else (women and minorities) are all exploited and abused. And for this reason, they‚Äôll never be able to truly be seen as equals within our society. \n\nThe economy and modes of production affect our sociology as human beings and our thoughts, ideas, behaviors, and innovations more so than the other way around. Humans adapt and evolve consistently to fit into the specific environment that the economy creates for them solely in order to be able to keep the slaves of the genes going properly. Even if it‚Äôs not preferable and harms human beings as a whole, throughout history and even today, humans have and continued to do what they needed to do to survive themselves and eventually end up reproducing according to the conditions that the economy has set up for them. Human beings evolve and change depending on our material reality, and the economy plays a huge part in shaping our culture and behaviors as a whole.\n\nWomen especially are affected by this as a whole, because historically, they were the ones that were oppressed and typically weaker and too agreeable and didn‚Äôt have much power within life. For this reason, a lot of them had to resort to trying to conform into society solely to survive and learn to please males solely in order to have any bit of power within life and to fulfill what people thought was their true purpose in life; motherhood. Women are the ones whose brains are designed to quickly adapt to change, adapting and evolving to the worlds that their men build and destroy with no second thought. The ones who adapt and are socialized to fit into the specific culture of specific countries which are mediated by the specific economic environment of those specific places. And for this reason, a lot of their behaviors and interests and life choices are heavily mediated by this solely in order to survive and to eventually give birth and raise children. Job choices, potential, education, IQ, personality, feminism, interests, etc. are all aspects of women that have the ability to change depending on a variety of factors and have the ability to be directly affected by the economy alone. That plus women being more risk-averse on average, most of them won‚Äôt go up and far to change the world nor chase their dreams, and instead stick to a solid and predictable path to guarantee optimal success when it comes to what society wants them to be and in order to assure their own security within life. For a lot of women, security &gt;&gt;&gt; freedom; one of the various aspects of women that capitalism isn‚Äôt meant to accommodate for nor does it allow women to truly reach their full potential and finally be equals within society.\n\nWhat does capitalism value exactly?\n\nCapitalism is a system that values the gaining and pursuit of profit over all else. It‚Äôs an establishment that prioritizes those that can exploit others, especially minorities, to gain more money and privilege within their own hands. It awards those who are psychopathic enough to pursue a life in which they feel like either working 80+ hours a week to survive is ‚Äúrewarding‚Äù and ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù, and to those who build and destroy without a care in the world about those affected. Anything that can‚Äôt make profit === un-valuable and useless. It‚Äôs a system that strives for individuality above all else, devaluing familial and humanistic values that would be beneficial to people as a whole and strives to provide ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù for the select minority of men over the equality of whole nations. And yes, ‚Äúmen‚Äù in particular. \n\n‚ÄúMan‚Äù, or more specifically the concept of a ‚Äúman‚Äù, is someone with a lot of power. Someone who is a natural materialist; valuing wealth and money over all else. Someone who's driven and impacted by ego as opposed to society, willing to take massive risks without regard to any other aspect of their lives solely in order to get to the top, greedy, valuing freedom over security, career over family, profit over altruism, individualism over community identity, and someone who lives with a constant drive to dominate things in the field of power and status. All of these traits are ones that rule the ‚Äúestablishments‚Äù of the current day and are specifically designed to support a male-lead and male-dominated world first and foremost, accentuating ‚Äúmale strengths‚Äù and traits and devaluing anyone who doesn‚Äôt fit into the specific requirements to succeed in this capitalist world. And women are the most noteworthy victims of this.\n\nThe ‚Äúrules‚Äù of the establishment are those that are meant to keep the power imbalance between the sexes high and ‚Äúin their proper place‚Äù, which eventually leads to striving to keep women in a continuous state of servitude; whether it be to massive corporations who don‚Äôt care at all about their interests nor autonomy and care only to exploit women for bigger gain of wealth. Or within the own home in which a woman is expected to act as a glorified domesticated servant to her husband and kids, lacking the financial independence and true freedom of opportunity to do much else, but choosing to stay any way because it‚Äôs what ultimately ends up being better for the family. In order to keep family-dynamics stable and in place, women need to give up their autonomy and independence and inherent power within their lives. In order to have a successful career, women have to give up any idea of love and family along with their identities, respect dignity, and having to whore out to bosses and managers and everyone else in positions of authority solely in order to move up, only to get cruelly pushed aside later on when they are no longer considered ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù to the male gaze that rules our society (which is further accentuated by the nature of capitalism as a whole that encourages the viewing of women‚Äôs bodies and youth as a commodity).\n\nWhen you realize that as a woman, you truly have the choice to only choose between 2 extremes, a lot of them revert back to their typical ‚Äúrole‚Äù within society that was mediated by the patriarchy and the history of their oppression since the beginning of time; the role as someone inferior, subservient to men in their own household and within most jobs, the only valuable accomplishments being motherhood regardless if whether it means giving up your sanity and bodily autonomy as a whole, an inherently objectfied being whose body is sought and sold as a commodity for male pleasure only (except this time it's in the guise of being ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúempowering‚Äù, even if it‚Äôs downright regarding and dehumanizing), and all other derogatory things that hold women back and keep them from reaching their true potential in every aspect of their lives. The reason that women tend to revert back to the motherhood role is because it‚Äôs something that the patriarchal standards emphasis by our capitalist economy supports and encourages way more so than the latter and because women as a whole need to do so solely in order to ‚Äúcontribute to society‚Äù in the way it truly needs and the way women think that they are capable of, whilst refusing to do anything about it because by the nature of evolution alone, most women are destined to always live beneath men and lack the power to make a true change.\n\nIt‚Äôs what women have evolved within this specific mode of production to be more interested in, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed to be done, it's what women see as what they realistically can do better at as opposed to trying to ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù, and it;s the only way that they are told they can truly contribute to society as a whole due to not being fit to being able to survive and continue the human race otherwise. However, motherhood as a whole is incredibly cucked and messed up, and even more so within our society today and just how it‚Äôs run. It‚Äôs pretty much a scam and something thrown off balance altogether by our system, even if women continue to freely participate in it as a form of voluntary slavery.\n\nMotherhood doesn‚Äôt have inherent value in a capitalist economy, and yet it‚Äôs still seen as something that women should be expected to do as a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù due to the male standards that rule our society along with the traits that are typically associated with being a good mother, aren‚Äôt traits that bode well with being successful in the eyes of capitalism and prevents women from various high-powered careers and leadership positions for this reason, along with finding out that being considered the mothers and caretakers of society first and foremost, doesn‚Äôt do much to further benefit how they are treated and whether they are respected or not. Women are the ones that do most of the ‚Äúunpaid‚Äù labor of society, all of which obviously doesn‚Äôt make profit, which leads to it lacking the respect it truly deserves, which in turn only harms the progression of women‚Äôs rights as a whole and prevents women from truly being seen as equals within society. That along with the fact that since most people simply aren‚Äôt satisfied with their careers in general, women end up being the ones that end up being the ones to take care of their families due to economic restrictions that prevent them from being able to achieve any other dreams in a way that‚Äôs enjoyable, advances society, and isn‚Äôt a complete scam. Regardless of whether motherhood is their dream or not, it‚Äôs what this male dominated society needs women to do, and since what women do typically doesn't result with them having much actual ‚Äúpower‚Äù in society, they all end up falling victim to the trap of this economy and it‚Äôs true patriarchal roots. \n\nMen do not appreciate ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù or women as a whole and all the labour that they provide, and never did. In a capitalist society especially, despite the fact that unpaid labour is one of the most important types of labour required in order to keep the world running, since it can‚Äôt make any actual profit , it‚Äôs instead used as a tool to keep women ‚Äúin their place‚Äù as opposed to being something that‚Äôs genuinely respected. All of this to prevent women from being equals in society and to have power, and since women as a whole have evolved to adapt to the worlds that men make and since many aren‚Äôt actually interested in climbing the corporate ladder until their limbs fall off and don‚Äôt really have that drive to dominate things and due to gender roles instilled within us by nature that a woman‚Äôs greatest value is to be able to give birth and raise children, naturally most women are unable to truly gain the power to run this country on their own terms, and the ones that end up being able to do so often tend to be no better than their male counterparts. Companies run by women aren‚Äôt guaranteed better maternity leave nor work-life balance or lack of discrimination against female counterparts, nor are women capitalists somehow more ‚Äúempathetic‚Äù and less likely to exploit minorities. And even women that may have started out that way, realized that a) it wasn‚Äôt compatible with the system and then just quit or b) realized it wasn‚Äôt compatible and instead decided to continue acting like men and chasing the bag until they reached their goal. A lot of the times, women that are unsuccessful with their careers or creating their own business often become mothers, either by choice or just by chance, and fall back onto that if they ever fail as it‚Äôs what society is willing to encourage more as opposed to women being able to ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù, cause that‚Äôs virtually impossible. And in turn, all of this continues and encourages the cycle of dependency that has held women back since forever.\n\nMotherhood? Lack of respect, loads of cultural hatred and misogyny being directed towards you, being expected to do everything without any real payoff and unappreciated effort, financial dependence that makes you more susceptible to abuse, people criticizing your every move as now kids are expected to be your entire life with no identity of your own and your now expected to be a teacher, social worker, therapist, and counselor to your kids full time as opposed to them just being an extension of your life, the overwhelming costs of raising a child and being able to afford childcare, the sheer side effects of pregnancy on your body along with lack of funding for women‚Äôs health and the medical field which basically treats women like the smaller versions of men when it comes to creating medicines or treatments as women‚Äôs hormones are apparently too ‚Äúmessy‚Äù to study with and due to the lack of female scientists who are willing to advocate for this and the women who just accept this as the reality as they don‚Äôt have much of the power to do much else.\n\nNow when it comes to the concept of ‚Äúpower‚Äù, this is actually another reason as to why a lot of women choose motherhood. I mentioned that men were the ones that were mainly money-hungry and power-seeking, but realistically, human beings as a whole all want power in some way shape or form. And women are no exception, except for the fact that on average, women don‚Äôt exactly have the same way of gaining access to said power in the way that men do. Men who typically show signs of narcissistic behavior typically go into leadership positions to gain control of people that way. Men without a strong sense of identity tend to be the ones that slave away to their careers the most. Women with a lack of identity and/or narcissistic and ‚Äúbully‚Äù tendencies, typically end up becoming mothers and going into jobs where they have direct access to toil with human lives as a whole along with the ability to cause emotional pain and physical pain to those who are vulnerable and weak. Some of the worst women you‚Äôll ever meet tend to be people like mothers, teachers, nurses, social workers, etc. They can have the power to abuse and ruin the lives of human beings they bring onto the world as a way to try to gain power, or they can raise their children to cater to them and increase their own status, both of which are the more ‚Äúfemale-standard‚Äù paths to success that society can encourage. Want power? Marry a rich man who will provide and have his children to prove your status statement. \n\nPower as a whole, however, is also something that‚Äôs culturally and historically known to be something women can also gain specifically by subscribing to and conforming to the patriarchal ideas of femininity as a whole. Why do you think so many women are trying to paint degrading yourself sexually for male pleasure as something ‚Äúempowering‚Äù and ‚Äúgood‚Äù for women? Why are so many derogatory things trying to be disguised as something ‚Äúpositive‚Äù anyway? A lot of women consider it ‚Äúempowering‚Äù because being able to experience some of the niceties under the patriarchal system is what women throughout history had been shown as the pinnacle of true ‚Äúpower‚Äù and ‚Äúautonomy‚Äù they could reach, and it‚Äôs stayed that way in today‚Äôs society. Mediated by the traumas of female socialization and expectations from a young age to view themselves as nothing but whores, it‚Äôs a coping for a lot of women as well. The reason why it‚Äôs seen as good is because sexually exploiting oneself can be a lucrative way to gain profit within our economy as women‚Äôs bodies are often bought and sold as commodities and objects with no other purpose than to conform to the male gaze in order to make money. Motherhood may be nature, but being sex workers and being sexually exploited is also something women had to endure throughout history and to a lot of foolish women, they view it as gaining control over these patriarchal standards when in reality, they‚Äôre just falling prey to it. Living your life under the rules of standards of male expectations is not ‚Äúpower‚Äù and you‚Äôre not getting anything from it except for another path to oppression. Women throughout all cultures and countries throughout history have also had to experience their insecurities heightened and exploited by big corporations solely in order to sell a product, and in turn, women fall victim to this scam solely in order to mold themselves into the male standards of beauty in order to be attractive. Attractive so they can reproduce and so they can gain ‚Äúpower‚Äù in a way that still conforms to the patriarchy for their own security, even if it doesn‚Äôt actually give them any freedom, independence, happiness, or power.Women benign weaker throughout history and with their entire value being reduced down to child-bearing ability, naturally they‚Äôd need to conform solely in order to survive like I mentioned before, and of course part of that conforming aspect has to deal with conforming solely in order to get a man to reproduce with and for them to be ‚Äúprotected‚Äù, even though men are more likely to be their oppressors and abusers as opposed to ‚Äúprotectors‚Äù. \n\nAnd males of course, stay crying mutiny and creating whole movement trashing and inciting violence against women solely because they hear a few women online saying they like ‚Äú6-inch dicks‚Äù instead of ‚Äú5 inch‚Äù or that they like men that \\*gasp\\* look attractive to them, and decide that that‚Äôs a violation of their own human rights to sex with a woman and hence become incels, red-pill, mgtow-ers, etc. etc. Truthfully, the audacity of males never fails to baffle me.\n\nUnable to gain power through their careers especially, women typically fall into these set of behaviors in order to even pretend they have autonomy within their own lives and would much rather live in darkness than except the truth that they are just as much of victims and slaves to the capitalist machine as their male counterparts albeit in a much different way a lot of the times, and within a lot of situations of which they themselves brought upon themselves.\n\nAnd back to the topic, what about when it comes to women‚Äôs careers as a whole? Do that somehow make them more miserable than motherhood? Honestly, nobody truly loves their careers as much as this capitalist society likes to shove down our throats. Realistically, even if you do something you love, you‚Äôll come to realize that trying to monetize a passion is the best way to get bored and tired of it quickly. You need a stable salary in order to truly live a decent life as nobody will be willing to support you otherwise, and that of course means prioritizing making a profit when it comes to your ‚Äúdream career‚Äù. All careers, even those that are about ‚Äúhelping others‚Äù and altruism, become corporatism at some point in time. The more well paying it is, the more money-hungry people who don‚Äôt actually care about other people and are just looking to fill their own pockets fill these jobs And not to mention most of the times they also get male dominated and get created into an environment in which you basically have to be ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù to succeed, and is unable to accommodate for women as a whole with this culture, which leads to women not being able ti prosper in these careers and eventually nature comes in and makes it so women as a whole are no longer interested in these careers solely because our sociology itself is so affected my the economy at hand. We are influenced by our material reality and the modes of production of the economy when it comes to our thoughts, history, idea, innovation, etc. and not the other way around. And of course, if a job is lower paid and lacks job security and benefits, a lot of talented and passionate people in these field eventually leave and get burned out because they realize their talent is not sustainable in the long run. Research and science itself is an industry that‚Äôs a huge victim of this. The majority of genuinely talented and smart people who want to go into the science field, realize that it‚Äôs pretty much a scam and working there wouldn't call for ‚Äúground-breaking‚Äù innovation and the advancement of society as a whole, but more so a way to slave away whilst not being able to make a proper living for themselves and instead peddle money for the rich all whilst realizing people are willing to hinder a lot of scientific advancements if it means making more profit from just ‚Äúimproving‚Äù already existing profits, and with the realization that even with many technological advancement, the majority of people probably wouldn't have access to a lot of the improvement that could be granted by scientific innovation any way due to the economy in which most of the wealth belongs to the top 1%. Realistically, having more women in STEM within this economy would not change or improve shit. \n\nAnd again, this is another one of the reasons why there aren‚Äôt more women in certain careers in the first place. This along with the terrible lifestyle and work-life balance and having to basically choose between career and family, in which most women choose the latter. Our workplace as a whole is built with the typical ‚Äúcareer man whose willing to work 60+ hours a week cause he has no responsibilities when it comes to child-rearing nor focusing on family‚Äù in mind as the vision of the ‚Äúaverage worker‚Äù, and naturally capitalists are wanting to increase their profit over all else and overworking their workers like slaves is the best way to do so, with no concern in the world for women and mothers with children who are also wanting to enter the workforce. Realistically speaking, if we had things like paid extended maternity leave, public childcare, and more understanding of work-life balance and benefits to people working part-time, then a lot of women would want to actively be in the work-force way more as opposed to giving it up to raise children, but that‚Äôs not going to happen any time soon.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, capitalism cares about women...About exploiting them just like men. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am not going down the path of ‚ÄúfEmInIsM rUinEd eVeRyThiNg‚Äù by allowing women in the workforce, because that‚Äôs not the case at all. Women have always had it unfair when it comes to work, and there has never been a time when they stayed home and did nothing (and not even in the 50s where the whole circle jerk of ‚Äúhappy housewives‚Äù created by the manosphere apparently took place). The difference between then and now, is that then women were forced to work low-paying menial jobs they didn‚Äôt want and having a tiring job and raising children was a requirement as opposed to a choice like now. Women who were housewives either worked equally hard or were depressed (Peak the popularity of ‚ÄúFeminine Mystique‚Äù, overwhelming percentage of valium addiction, ‚ÄúMommy‚Äôs Little Helper‚Äù, higher child abuse rates, etc). And again, this phenomenon in the 50s was another result of the economy at this time. Economy throughout history has been the driving force of society and the influence of women‚Äôs rights and feminism. At certain points in time, division of labor was necessary to the point where absolutely no ‚Äúfeminist thinking‚Äù would have been able to increase gender equality as humans need to adapt themselves still to fit in with their material surroundings, and a lot of that does in fact result in a power imbalance between men and women. Women weren‚Äôt allowed in the work-force in the first place due to feminism in the US, but due to WWII in which women working jobs that men previously held was basically a necessity. Of course afterwards when they were forced back into the kitchen, they had a whole movement for it, but the economy after WWII changed a lot of things about society as a whole and was a huge mediator in creating and shaping our current day economy. Hell at one point women would have probably entered the workforce anyway due to geopolitical reasons alone. If the economy wasn‚Äôt fit for it, no amount of ‚Äúfeminism‚Äù would have been able to change anything.\n\nSpeaking of careers, a lot of women often see their careers as a way to gain ‚Äúequal rights' ' and ‚Äúequality‚Äù, and in a way it is. I mean being able to be in a successful career == you are able to be a ‚Äúman‚Äù enough to gain power within this economy as a whole and hence, men have no choice but to see you as even slightly equal to them. Which again, shows how men do not actually appreciate ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù nor what women do as a whole. In the least gender equal countries, women often make up greater percentages of STEM careers and leadership positions and women see having a career as a way to be empowered and independent, as being successful in any pursuit other than motherhood is the way for the men to see them as even remotely equal to them. Now this of course, doesn't change how women can be equally exploited within capitalism as a whole, because they do. But sadly, until women stop working under the system and somehow choosing the tolerate the patriarchy if they get to experience some of the superficial temporary ‚Äúbenefits'' given out by men due to fulfilling their ‚Äúnatural role‚Äù (which of course wears out by the time they secede reproductive age), and instead work the system and gain power within a way that both allows them to make an executive change for the better, our situation will never change. But of course, realistically speaking, women as a whole aren‚Äôt really equipped to ‚Äúwork the system‚Äù as a whole, and economic values mixed in with our Western culture in particular which enforced the typical ‚Äúgender roles'' because that seems to be the only way to even remotely be happy/seen as the better option within the societal expectations that dictate a man or woman‚Äôs role in society, prevent this from happening even more. \n\nMen of course, are the ones that continue to be the ones that work full time to fulfill their role as ‚Äúprovider‚Äù and to prove they made it as a man in society (which of course is easier as capitalism as a whole is made to accommodate who ‚Äúman‚Äù by nature is more so than women). This of course leads to a variety of problems in reality as the ‚Äúnuclear family model‚Äù truthfully is a scam on both sides. It leads the man to be a work-crazy psychopath with no care about other people or time with his own family, and leads the women to be financially dependent, unfulfilled, with no way to gain education nor emotional security. The amount of men in real life that would rather be cramped up in offices all day solely to avoid their ‚Äúnagging wife and kids‚Äù is staggering. Capitalism affects men very negatively, which in turn affects women negatively as well. And of course, like I mentioned back before, women continue to encourage this type of stuff equally.\n\nPorn for example and the objectification of women online is a billion dollar industry and it‚Äôs currently a very lucrative business for women as a whole to be able to make money. It‚Äôs been shown, in every culture and every country, that men are 1000 times better when they are NOT exposed to porn and yet...people still encourage porn. It truly doesn‚Äôt help how much social media as a whole has revolutionized this industry dedicated to women objectifying themselves for the male gaze, and then people online being fed the narrative that it;' somehow ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù and ‚Äúempowering‚Äù, and the increased existence of liberal feminism as a whole which encourages this. Because of course, slaving away to capitalism is a much better and more lucrative way to live than encouraging women to have basic self-respect. Then of course you have various companies that continue to profit off of women‚Äôs insecurities along with creating a culture that supports buying and selling women's bodies as objects and a sexualized series of body parts regardless of how that negatively affects people as a whole. All of this mixed together truly makes women believe that they have no purpose other than whoring out to men and trying to justify it as being something positive. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where things like ‚Äúvaginal cosmetic surgeries‚Äù so much as exist, because women are willing to try to make themselves pleasurable to men. It honestly disgusts me just how much all these negative aspects of female socialization is so much encouraged and that seeing women as nothing but objects is able to be translated into genuine business ideas.  And of course, let‚Äôs not forget how much of a scam the current new popular ‚Äútradwife trend‚Äù and glorification of the ‚Äúnuclear family dynamic‚Äù is. Like I mentioned, it leads men to having no humanistic values or placing no importance on family as a whole which throws off family dynamics and the quality of relationships as they give up their lives to work, whereas the woman stays being considered inferior in so many other aspects within life and unable to truly have the freedom to do anything else. \n\nHonestly, I just despise the way society is run as a looking back at it, until our economy radically changes one day, no matter what cultural change people try to push and no matter what type of new technology tries to claim that it will ‚Äúimprove‚Äù the lives of others, until we get radical changes to our economy first and foremost, I do not ever see women being able to break past this cycle. And as long as they continue to give birth to their oppressors and keep the slaves of genes going in a world where everyone ends up being a mere victim to the system, a cog in the machine, and existing in a life where the only thing guaranteed is pain and sorrow...Nothing will ever change for the better."", 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TW: Long, Incohesive mess of thoughts that probably don&amp;#39;t even make sense, but whatever it&amp;#39;s just a rant&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know how much of a popular or well known opinion this is, but I honestly just can‚Äôt help but feel so cheated as to how capitalism and women‚Äôs rights seem to be so damn incompatible with one another and just how much capitalism has screwed over women as a whole. It‚Äôs truly the system that has positioned men and women in an unequal economic relationship with employers, unequal positions within their own households and jobs, unequal positions when it comes to what society considers the ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù of men and women within nature, unequal positions in terms of authority and independence and power, unequal authority when it comes to equality of true opportunity, and just a certain sense of unfairness that infects all the other aspects of their relationships. Capitalism is a system that makes women giving birth to their oppressors, degrading themselves whilst seeing it as ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù, accepting this type of unfairness when it comes to division of labour and value of individual labour, accepting mistreatment and being put in inherent subservient positions within their own homes, and being unable to reach their true potential solely due to being unable to thrive in an economy which encourages female inferiority and devaluing women as a whole whilst being specifically catered to ‚Äúmasculine ideals‚Äù and the male-standard of success to thrive only. Capitalism and the general nature of what it values, how it functions, and what it takes to thrive within a capitalist society, all end up devaluing women as a whole and invalidating female-specific strengths and capitalizing off of women‚Äôs insecurities along with throwing marriages/relationships off balance as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within a capitalist system, the select few privileged 1% of men and anyone who is a ‚Äúman‚Äù willing to give up their dignities and lives to chase the bad, whereas the rest of everyone else (women and minorities) are all exploited and abused. And for this reason, they‚Äôll never be able to truly be seen as equals within our society. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The economy and modes of production affect our sociology as human beings and our thoughts, ideas, behaviors, and innovations more so than the other way around. Humans adapt and evolve consistently to fit into the specific environment that the economy creates for them solely in order to be able to keep the slaves of the genes going properly. Even if it‚Äôs not preferable and harms human beings as a whole, throughout history and even today, humans have and continued to do what they needed to do to survive themselves and eventually end up reproducing according to the conditions that the economy has set up for them. Human beings evolve and change depending on our material reality, and the economy plays a huge part in shaping our culture and behaviors as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women especially are affected by this as a whole, because historically, they were the ones that were oppressed and typically weaker and too agreeable and didn‚Äôt have much power within life. For this reason, a lot of them had to resort to trying to conform into society solely to survive and learn to please males solely in order to have any bit of power within life and to fulfill what people thought was their true purpose in life; motherhood. Women are the ones whose brains are designed to quickly adapt to change, adapting and evolving to the worlds that their men build and destroy with no second thought. The ones who adapt and are socialized to fit into the specific culture of specific countries which are mediated by the specific economic environment of those specific places. And for this reason, a lot of their behaviors and interests and life choices are heavily mediated by this solely in order to survive and to eventually give birth and raise children. Job choices, potential, education, IQ, personality, feminism, interests, etc. are all aspects of women that have the ability to change depending on a variety of factors and have the ability to be directly affected by the economy alone. That plus women being more risk-averse on average, most of them won‚Äôt go up and far to change the world nor chase their dreams, and instead stick to a solid and predictable path to guarantee optimal success when it comes to what society wants them to be and in order to assure their own security within life. For a lot of women, security &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; freedom; one of the various aspects of women that capitalism isn‚Äôt meant to accommodate for nor does it allow women to truly reach their full potential and finally be equals within society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does capitalism value exactly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Capitalism is a system that values the gaining and pursuit of profit over all else. It‚Äôs an establishment that prioritizes those that can exploit others, especially minorities, to gain more money and privilege within their own hands. It awards those who are psychopathic enough to pursue a life in which they feel like either working 80+ hours a week to survive is ‚Äúrewarding‚Äù and ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù, and to those who build and destroy without a care in the world about those affected. Anything that can‚Äôt make profit === un-valuable and useless. It‚Äôs a system that strives for individuality above all else, devaluing familial and humanistic values that would be beneficial to people as a whole and strives to provide ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù for the select minority of men over the equality of whole nations. And yes, ‚Äúmen‚Äù in particular. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúMan‚Äù, or more specifically the concept of a ‚Äúman‚Äù, is someone with a lot of power. Someone who is a natural materialist; valuing wealth and money over all else. Someone who&amp;#39;s driven and impacted by ego as opposed to society, willing to take massive risks without regard to any other aspect of their lives solely in order to get to the top, greedy, valuing freedom over security, career over family, profit over altruism, individualism over community identity, and someone who lives with a constant drive to dominate things in the field of power and status. All of these traits are ones that rule the ‚Äúestablishments‚Äù of the current day and are specifically designed to support a male-lead and male-dominated world first and foremost, accentuating ‚Äúmale strengths‚Äù and traits and devaluing anyone who doesn‚Äôt fit into the specific requirements to succeed in this capitalist world. And women are the most noteworthy victims of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ‚Äúrules‚Äù of the establishment are those that are meant to keep the power imbalance between the sexes high and ‚Äúin their proper place‚Äù, which eventually leads to striving to keep women in a continuous state of servitude; whether it be to massive corporations who don‚Äôt care at all about their interests nor autonomy and care only to exploit women for bigger gain of wealth. Or within the own home in which a woman is expected to act as a glorified domesticated servant to her husband and kids, lacking the financial independence and true freedom of opportunity to do much else, but choosing to stay any way because it‚Äôs what ultimately ends up being better for the family. In order to keep family-dynamics stable and in place, women need to give up their autonomy and independence and inherent power within their lives. In order to have a successful career, women have to give up any idea of love and family along with their identities, respect dignity, and having to whore out to bosses and managers and everyone else in positions of authority solely in order to move up, only to get cruelly pushed aside later on when they are no longer considered ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù to the male gaze that rules our society (which is further accentuated by the nature of capitalism as a whole that encourages the viewing of women‚Äôs bodies and youth as a commodity).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you realize that as a woman, you truly have the choice to only choose between 2 extremes, a lot of them revert back to their typical ‚Äúrole‚Äù within society that was mediated by the patriarchy and the history of their oppression since the beginning of time; the role as someone inferior, subservient to men in their own household and within most jobs, the only valuable accomplishments being motherhood regardless if whether it means giving up your sanity and bodily autonomy as a whole, an inherently objectfied being whose body is sought and sold as a commodity for male pleasure only (except this time it&amp;#39;s in the guise of being ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúempowering‚Äù, even if it‚Äôs downright regarding and dehumanizing), and all other derogatory things that hold women back and keep them from reaching their true potential in every aspect of their lives. The reason that women tend to revert back to the motherhood role is because it‚Äôs something that the patriarchal standards emphasis by our capitalist economy supports and encourages way more so than the latter and because women as a whole need to do so solely in order to ‚Äúcontribute to society‚Äù in the way it truly needs and the way women think that they are capable of, whilst refusing to do anything about it because by the nature of evolution alone, most women are destined to always live beneath men and lack the power to make a true change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs what women have evolved within this specific mode of production to be more interested in, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed to be done, it&amp;#39;s what women see as what they realistically can do better at as opposed to trying to ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù, and it;s the only way that they are told they can truly contribute to society as a whole due to not being fit to being able to survive and continue the human race otherwise. However, motherhood as a whole is incredibly cucked and messed up, and even more so within our society today and just how it‚Äôs run. It‚Äôs pretty much a scam and something thrown off balance altogether by our system, even if women continue to freely participate in it as a form of voluntary slavery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Motherhood doesn‚Äôt have inherent value in a capitalist economy, and yet it‚Äôs still seen as something that women should be expected to do as a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù due to the male standards that rule our society along with the traits that are typically associated with being a good mother, aren‚Äôt traits that bode well with being successful in the eyes of capitalism and prevents women from various high-powered careers and leadership positions for this reason, along with finding out that being considered the mothers and caretakers of society first and foremost, doesn‚Äôt do much to further benefit how they are treated and whether they are respected or not. Women are the ones that do most of the ‚Äúunpaid‚Äù labor of society, all of which obviously doesn‚Äôt make profit, which leads to it lacking the respect it truly deserves, which in turn only harms the progression of women‚Äôs rights as a whole and prevents women from truly being seen as equals within society. That along with the fact that since most people simply aren‚Äôt satisfied with their careers in general, women end up being the ones that end up being the ones to take care of their families due to economic restrictions that prevent them from being able to achieve any other dreams in a way that‚Äôs enjoyable, advances society, and isn‚Äôt a complete scam. Regardless of whether motherhood is their dream or not, it‚Äôs what this male dominated society needs women to do, and since what women do typically doesn&amp;#39;t result with them having much actual ‚Äúpower‚Äù in society, they all end up falling victim to the trap of this economy and it‚Äôs true patriarchal roots. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men do not appreciate ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù or women as a whole and all the labour that they provide, and never did. In a capitalist society especially, despite the fact that unpaid labour is one of the most important types of labour required in order to keep the world running, since it can‚Äôt make any actual profit , it‚Äôs instead used as a tool to keep women ‚Äúin their place‚Äù as opposed to being something that‚Äôs genuinely respected. All of this to prevent women from being equals in society and to have power, and since women as a whole have evolved to adapt to the worlds that men make and since many aren‚Äôt actually interested in climbing the corporate ladder until their limbs fall off and don‚Äôt really have that drive to dominate things and due to gender roles instilled within us by nature that a woman‚Äôs greatest value is to be able to give birth and raise children, naturally most women are unable to truly gain the power to run this country on their own terms, and the ones that end up being able to do so often tend to be no better than their male counterparts. Companies run by women aren‚Äôt guaranteed better maternity leave nor work-life balance or lack of discrimination against female counterparts, nor are women capitalists somehow more ‚Äúempathetic‚Äù and less likely to exploit minorities. And even women that may have started out that way, realized that a) it wasn‚Äôt compatible with the system and then just quit or b) realized it wasn‚Äôt compatible and instead decided to continue acting like men and chasing the bag until they reached their goal. A lot of the times, women that are unsuccessful with their careers or creating their own business often become mothers, either by choice or just by chance, and fall back onto that if they ever fail as it‚Äôs what society is willing to encourage more as opposed to women being able to ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù, cause that‚Äôs virtually impossible. And in turn, all of this continues and encourages the cycle of dependency that has held women back since forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Motherhood? Lack of respect, loads of cultural hatred and misogyny being directed towards you, being expected to do everything without any real payoff and unappreciated effort, financial dependence that makes you more susceptible to abuse, people criticizing your every move as now kids are expected to be your entire life with no identity of your own and your now expected to be a teacher, social worker, therapist, and counselor to your kids full time as opposed to them just being an extension of your life, the overwhelming costs of raising a child and being able to afford childcare, the sheer side effects of pregnancy on your body along with lack of funding for women‚Äôs health and the medical field which basically treats women like the smaller versions of men when it comes to creating medicines or treatments as women‚Äôs hormones are apparently too ‚Äúmessy‚Äù to study with and due to the lack of female scientists who are willing to advocate for this and the women who just accept this as the reality as they don‚Äôt have much of the power to do much else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now when it comes to the concept of ‚Äúpower‚Äù, this is actually another reason as to why a lot of women choose motherhood. I mentioned that men were the ones that were mainly money-hungry and power-seeking, but realistically, human beings as a whole all want power in some way shape or form. And women are no exception, except for the fact that on average, women don‚Äôt exactly have the same way of gaining access to said power in the way that men do. Men who typically show signs of narcissistic behavior typically go into leadership positions to gain control of people that way. Men without a strong sense of identity tend to be the ones that slave away to their careers the most. Women with a lack of identity and/or narcissistic and ‚Äúbully‚Äù tendencies, typically end up becoming mothers and going into jobs where they have direct access to toil with human lives as a whole along with the ability to cause emotional pain and physical pain to those who are vulnerable and weak. Some of the worst women you‚Äôll ever meet tend to be people like mothers, teachers, nurses, social workers, etc. They can have the power to abuse and ruin the lives of human beings they bring onto the world as a way to try to gain power, or they can raise their children to cater to them and increase their own status, both of which are the more ‚Äúfemale-standard‚Äù paths to success that society can encourage. Want power? Marry a rich man who will provide and have his children to prove your status statement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Power as a whole, however, is also something that‚Äôs culturally and historically known to be something women can also gain specifically by subscribing to and conforming to the patriarchal ideas of femininity as a whole. Why do you think so many women are trying to paint degrading yourself sexually for male pleasure as something ‚Äúempowering‚Äù and ‚Äúgood‚Äù for women? Why are so many derogatory things trying to be disguised as something ‚Äúpositive‚Äù anyway? A lot of women consider it ‚Äúempowering‚Äù because being able to experience some of the niceties under the patriarchal system is what women throughout history had been shown as the pinnacle of true ‚Äúpower‚Äù and ‚Äúautonomy‚Äù they could reach, and it‚Äôs stayed that way in today‚Äôs society. Mediated by the traumas of female socialization and expectations from a young age to view themselves as nothing but whores, it‚Äôs a coping for a lot of women as well. The reason why it‚Äôs seen as good is because sexually exploiting oneself can be a lucrative way to gain profit within our economy as women‚Äôs bodies are often bought and sold as commodities and objects with no other purpose than to conform to the male gaze in order to make money. Motherhood may be nature, but being sex workers and being sexually exploited is also something women had to endure throughout history and to a lot of foolish women, they view it as gaining control over these patriarchal standards when in reality, they‚Äôre just falling prey to it. Living your life under the rules of standards of male expectations is not ‚Äúpower‚Äù and you‚Äôre not getting anything from it except for another path to oppression. Women throughout all cultures and countries throughout history have also had to experience their insecurities heightened and exploited by big corporations solely in order to sell a product, and in turn, women fall victim to this scam solely in order to mold themselves into the male standards of beauty in order to be attractive. Attractive so they can reproduce and so they can gain ‚Äúpower‚Äù in a way that still conforms to the patriarchy for their own security, even if it doesn‚Äôt actually give them any freedom, independence, happiness, or power.Women benign weaker throughout history and with their entire value being reduced down to child-bearing ability, naturally they‚Äôd need to conform solely in order to survive like I mentioned before, and of course part of that conforming aspect has to deal with conforming solely in order to get a man to reproduce with and for them to be ‚Äúprotected‚Äù, even though men are more likely to be their oppressors and abusers as opposed to ‚Äúprotectors‚Äù. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And males of course, stay crying mutiny and creating whole movement trashing and inciting violence against women solely because they hear a few women online saying they like ‚Äú6-inch dicks‚Äù instead of ‚Äú5 inch‚Äù or that they like men that *gasp* look attractive to them, and decide that that‚Äôs a violation of their own human rights to sex with a woman and hence become incels, red-pill, mgtow-ers, etc. etc. Truthfully, the audacity of males never fails to baffle me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unable to gain power through their careers especially, women typically fall into these set of behaviors in order to even pretend they have autonomy within their own lives and would much rather live in darkness than except the truth that they are just as much of victims and slaves to the capitalist machine as their male counterparts albeit in a much different way a lot of the times, and within a lot of situations of which they themselves brought upon themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And back to the topic, what about when it comes to women‚Äôs careers as a whole? Do that somehow make them more miserable than motherhood? Honestly, nobody truly loves their careers as much as this capitalist society likes to shove down our throats. Realistically, even if you do something you love, you‚Äôll come to realize that trying to monetize a passion is the best way to get bored and tired of it quickly. You need a stable salary in order to truly live a decent life as nobody will be willing to support you otherwise, and that of course means prioritizing making a profit when it comes to your ‚Äúdream career‚Äù. All careers, even those that are about ‚Äúhelping others‚Äù and altruism, become corporatism at some point in time. The more well paying it is, the more money-hungry people who don‚Äôt actually care about other people and are just looking to fill their own pockets fill these jobs And not to mention most of the times they also get male dominated and get created into an environment in which you basically have to be ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù to succeed, and is unable to accommodate for women as a whole with this culture, which leads to women not being able ti prosper in these careers and eventually nature comes in and makes it so women as a whole are no longer interested in these careers solely because our sociology itself is so affected my the economy at hand. We are influenced by our material reality and the modes of production of the economy when it comes to our thoughts, history, idea, innovation, etc. and not the other way around. And of course, if a job is lower paid and lacks job security and benefits, a lot of talented and passionate people in these field eventually leave and get burned out because they realize their talent is not sustainable in the long run. Research and science itself is an industry that‚Äôs a huge victim of this. The majority of genuinely talented and smart people who want to go into the science field, realize that it‚Äôs pretty much a scam and working there wouldn&amp;#39;t call for ‚Äúground-breaking‚Äù innovation and the advancement of society as a whole, but more so a way to slave away whilst not being able to make a proper living for themselves and instead peddle money for the rich all whilst realizing people are willing to hinder a lot of scientific advancements if it means making more profit from just ‚Äúimproving‚Äù already existing profits, and with the realization that even with many technological advancement, the majority of people probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have access to a lot of the improvement that could be granted by scientific innovation any way due to the economy in which most of the wealth belongs to the top 1%. Realistically, having more women in STEM within this economy would not change or improve shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And again, this is another one of the reasons why there aren‚Äôt more women in certain careers in the first place. This along with the terrible lifestyle and work-life balance and having to basically choose between career and family, in which most women choose the latter. Our workplace as a whole is built with the typical ‚Äúcareer man whose willing to work 60+ hours a week cause he has no responsibilities when it comes to child-rearing nor focusing on family‚Äù in mind as the vision of the ‚Äúaverage worker‚Äù, and naturally capitalists are wanting to increase their profit over all else and overworking their workers like slaves is the best way to do so, with no concern in the world for women and mothers with children who are also wanting to enter the workforce. Realistically speaking, if we had things like paid extended maternity leave, public childcare, and more understanding of work-life balance and benefits to people working part-time, then a lot of women would want to actively be in the work-force way more as opposed to giving it up to raise children, but that‚Äôs not going to happen any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt get me wrong, capitalism cares about women...About exploiting them just like men. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am not going down the path of ‚ÄúfEmInIsM rUinEd eVeRyThiNg‚Äù by allowing women in the workforce, because that‚Äôs not the case at all. Women have always had it unfair when it comes to work, and there has never been a time when they stayed home and did nothing (and not even in the 50s where the whole circle jerk of ‚Äúhappy housewives‚Äù created by the manosphere apparently took place). The difference between then and now, is that then women were forced to work low-paying menial jobs they didn‚Äôt want and having a tiring job and raising children was a requirement as opposed to a choice like now. Women who were housewives either worked equally hard or were depressed (Peak the popularity of ‚ÄúFeminine Mystique‚Äù, overwhelming percentage of valium addiction, ‚ÄúMommy‚Äôs Little Helper‚Äù, higher child abuse rates, etc). And again, this phenomenon in the 50s was another result of the economy at this time. Economy throughout history has been the driving force of society and the influence of women‚Äôs rights and feminism. At certain points in time, division of labor was necessary to the point where absolutely no ‚Äúfeminist thinking‚Äù would have been able to increase gender equality as humans need to adapt themselves still to fit in with their material surroundings, and a lot of that does in fact result in a power imbalance between men and women. Women weren‚Äôt allowed in the work-force in the first place due to feminism in the US, but due to WWII in which women working jobs that men previously held was basically a necessity. Of course afterwards when they were forced back into the kitchen, they had a whole movement for it, but the economy after WWII changed a lot of things about society as a whole and was a huge mediator in creating and shaping our current day economy. Hell at one point women would have probably entered the workforce anyway due to geopolitical reasons alone. If the economy wasn‚Äôt fit for it, no amount of ‚Äúfeminism‚Äù would have been able to change anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of careers, a lot of women often see their careers as a way to gain ‚Äúequal rights&amp;#39; &amp;#39; and ‚Äúequality‚Äù, and in a way it is. I mean being able to be in a successful career == you are able to be a ‚Äúman‚Äù enough to gain power within this economy as a whole and hence, men have no choice but to see you as even slightly equal to them. Which again, shows how men do not actually appreciate ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù nor what women do as a whole. In the least gender equal countries, women often make up greater percentages of STEM careers and leadership positions and women see having a career as a way to be empowered and independent, as being successful in any pursuit other than motherhood is the way for the men to see them as even remotely equal to them. Now this of course, doesn&amp;#39;t change how women can be equally exploited within capitalism as a whole, because they do. But sadly, until women stop working under the system and somehow choosing the tolerate the patriarchy if they get to experience some of the superficial temporary ‚Äúbenefits&amp;#39;&amp;#39; given out by men due to fulfilling their ‚Äúnatural role‚Äù (which of course wears out by the time they secede reproductive age), and instead work the system and gain power within a way that both allows them to make an executive change for the better, our situation will never change. But of course, realistically speaking, women as a whole aren‚Äôt really equipped to ‚Äúwork the system‚Äù as a whole, and economic values mixed in with our Western culture in particular which enforced the typical ‚Äúgender roles&amp;#39;&amp;#39; because that seems to be the only way to even remotely be happy/seen as the better option within the societal expectations that dictate a man or woman‚Äôs role in society, prevent this from happening even more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men of course, are the ones that continue to be the ones that work full time to fulfill their role as ‚Äúprovider‚Äù and to prove they made it as a man in society (which of course is easier as capitalism as a whole is made to accommodate who ‚Äúman‚Äù by nature is more so than women). This of course leads to a variety of problems in reality as the ‚Äúnuclear family model‚Äù truthfully is a scam on both sides. It leads the man to be a work-crazy psychopath with no care about other people or time with his own family, and leads the women to be financially dependent, unfulfilled, with no way to gain education nor emotional security. The amount of men in real life that would rather be cramped up in offices all day solely to avoid their ‚Äúnagging wife and kids‚Äù is staggering. Capitalism affects men very negatively, which in turn affects women negatively as well. And of course, like I mentioned back before, women continue to encourage this type of stuff equally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Porn for example and the objectification of women online is a billion dollar industry and it‚Äôs currently a very lucrative business for women as a whole to be able to make money. It‚Äôs been shown, in every culture and every country, that men are 1000 times better when they are NOT exposed to porn and yet...people still encourage porn. It truly doesn‚Äôt help how much social media as a whole has revolutionized this industry dedicated to women objectifying themselves for the male gaze, and then people online being fed the narrative that it;&amp;#39; somehow ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù and ‚Äúempowering‚Äù, and the increased existence of liberal feminism as a whole which encourages this. Because of course, slaving away to capitalism is a much better and more lucrative way to live than encouraging women to have basic self-respect. Then of course you have various companies that continue to profit off of women‚Äôs insecurities along with creating a culture that supports buying and selling women&amp;#39;s bodies as objects and a sexualized series of body parts regardless of how that negatively affects people as a whole. All of this mixed together truly makes women believe that they have no purpose other than whoring out to men and trying to justify it as being something positive. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where things like ‚Äúvaginal cosmetic surgeries‚Äù so much as exist, because women are willing to try to make themselves pleasurable to men. It honestly disgusts me just how much all these negative aspects of female socialization is so much encouraged and that seeing women as nothing but objects is able to be translated into genuine business ideas.  And of course, let‚Äôs not forget how much of a scam the current new popular ‚Äútradwife trend‚Äù and glorification of the ‚Äúnuclear family dynamic‚Äù is. Like I mentioned, it leads men to having no humanistic values or placing no importance on family as a whole which throws off family dynamics and the quality of relationships as they give up their lives to work, whereas the woman stays being considered inferior in so many other aspects within life and unable to truly have the freedom to do anything else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I just despise the way society is run as a looking back at it, until our economy radically changes one day, no matter what cultural change people try to push and no matter what type of new technology tries to claim that it will ‚Äúimprove‚Äù the lives of others, until we get radical changes to our economy first and foremost, I do not ever see women being able to break past this cycle. And as long as they continue to give birth to their oppressors and keep the slaves of genes going in a world where everyone ends up being a mere victim to the system, a cog in the machine, and existing in a life where the only thing guaranteed is pain and sorrow...Nothing will ever change for the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'Female_Antinatalism', 'subreddit_id': 't5_319ugl', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/Female_Antinatalism', 'subreddit_subscribers': 328, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'Capitalist clownery', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 10, 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Female_Antinatalism/comments/o5faqx/capitalist_clownery/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': None, 'wls': None}]",self.Female_Antinatalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/wgtow/comments/o5pshw/absolutely/,{},o5pshw,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,,[],,,dark,text,False,False,False,2,0,False,some_ads,/r/wgtow/comments/o5pshw/absolutely/,False,,,7,1624375775,1,,True,False,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,7745,public,top,default,,,absolutely,0,[],1.0,/r/Female_Antinatalism/comments/o5faqx/capitalist_clownery/,/r/Female_Antinatalism/comments/o5faqx/capitalist_clownery/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,

It‚Äôs truly the system that has positioned men and women in an unequal economic relationship with employers, unequal positions within their own households and jobs, unequal positions when it comes to what society considers the ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù of men and women within nature, unequal positions in terms of authority and independence and power, unequal authority when it comes to equality of true opportunity, and just a certain sense of unfairness that infects all the other aspects of their relationships. Capitalism is a system that makes women giving birth to their oppressors, degrading themselves whilst seeing it as ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù, accepting this type of unfairness when it comes to division of labour and value of individual labour, accepting mistreatment and being put in inherent subservient positions within their own homes, and being unable to reach their true potential solely due to being unable to thrive in an economy which encourages female inferiority and devaluing women as a whole whilst being specifically catered to ‚Äúmasculine ideals‚Äù and the male-standard of success to thrive only. Capitalism and the general nature of what it values, how it functions, and what it takes to thrive within a capitalist society, all end up devaluing women as a whole and invalidating female-specific strengths and capitalizing off of women‚Äôs insecurities along with throwing marriages/relationships off balance as a whole. \n\nWithin a capitalist system, the select few privileged 1% of men and anyone who is a ‚Äúman‚Äù willing to give up their dignities and lives to chase the bad, whereas the rest of everyone else (women and minorities) are all exploited and abused. And for this reason, they‚Äôll never be able to truly be seen as equals within our society. \n\nThe economy and modes of production affect our sociology as human beings and our thoughts, ideas, behaviors, and innovations more so than the other way around. Humans adapt and evolve consistently to fit into the specific environment that the economy creates for them solely in order to be able to keep the slaves of the genes going properly. Even if it‚Äôs not preferable and harms human beings as a whole, throughout history and even today, humans have and continued to do what they needed to do to survive themselves and eventually end up reproducing according to the conditions that the economy has set up for them. Human beings evolve and change depending on our material reality, and the economy plays a huge part in shaping our culture and behaviors as a whole.\n\nWomen especially are affected by this as a whole, because historically, they were the ones that were oppressed and typically weaker and too agreeable and didn‚Äôt have much power within life. For this reason, a lot of them had to resort to trying to conform into society solely to survive and learn to please males solely in order to have any bit of power within life and to fulfill what people thought was their true purpose in life; motherhood. Women are the ones whose brains are designed to quickly adapt to change, adapting and evolving to the worlds that their men build and destroy with no second thought. The ones who adapt and are socialized to fit into the specific culture of specific countries which are mediated by the specific economic environment of those specific places. And for this reason, a lot of their behaviors and interests and life choices are heavily mediated by this solely in order to survive and to eventually give birth and raise children. Job choices, potential, education, IQ, personality, feminism, interests, etc. are all aspects of women that have the ability to change depending on a variety of factors and have the ability to be directly affected by the economy alone. That plus women being more risk-averse on average, most of them won‚Äôt go up and far to change the world nor chase their dreams, and instead stick to a solid and predictable path to guarantee optimal success when it comes to what society wants them to be and in order to assure their own security within life. For a lot of women, security &gt;&gt;&gt; freedom; one of the various aspects of women that capitalism isn‚Äôt meant to accommodate for nor does it allow women to truly reach their full potential and finally be equals within society.\n\nWhat does capitalism value exactly?\n\nCapitalism is a system that values the gaining and pursuit of profit over all else. It‚Äôs an establishment that prioritizes those that can exploit others, especially minorities, to gain more money and privilege within their own hands. It awards those who are psychopathic enough to pursue a life in which they feel like either working 80+ hours a week to survive is ‚Äúrewarding‚Äù and ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù, and to those who build and destroy without a care in the world about those affected. Anything that can‚Äôt make profit === un-valuable and useless. It‚Äôs a system that strives for individuality above all else, devaluing familial and humanistic values that would be beneficial to people as a whole and strives to provide ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù for the select minority of men over the equality of whole nations. And yes, ‚Äúmen‚Äù in particular. \n\n‚ÄúMan‚Äù, or more specifically the concept of a ‚Äúman‚Äù, is someone with a lot of power. Someone who is a natural materialist; valuing wealth and money over all else. Someone who's driven and impacted by ego as opposed to society, willing to take massive risks without regard to any other aspect of their lives solely in order to get to the top, greedy, valuing freedom over security, career over family, profit over altruism, individualism over community identity, and someone who lives with a constant drive to dominate things in the field of power and status. All of these traits are ones that rule the ‚Äúestablishments‚Äù of the current day and are specifically designed to support a male-lead and male-dominated world first and foremost, accentuating ‚Äúmale strengths‚Äù and traits and devaluing anyone who doesn‚Äôt fit into the specific requirements to succeed in this capitalist world. And women are the most noteworthy victims of this.\n\nThe ‚Äúrules‚Äù of the establishment are those that are meant to keep the power imbalance between the sexes high and ‚Äúin their proper place‚Äù, which eventually leads to striving to keep women in a continuous state of servitude; whether it be to massive corporations who don‚Äôt care at all about their interests nor autonomy and care only to exploit women for bigger gain of wealth. Or within the own home in which a woman is expected to act as a glorified domesticated servant to her husband and kids, lacking the financial independence and true freedom of opportunity to do much else, but choosing to stay any way because it‚Äôs what ultimately ends up being better for the family. In order to keep family-dynamics stable and in place, women need to give up their autonomy and independence and inherent power within their lives. In order to have a successful career, women have to give up any idea of love and family along with their identities, respect dignity, and having to whore out to bosses and managers and everyone else in positions of authority solely in order to move up, only to get cruelly pushed aside later on when they are no longer considered ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù to the male gaze that rules our society (which is further accentuated by the nature of capitalism as a whole that encourages the viewing of women‚Äôs bodies and youth as a commodity).\n\nWhen you realize that as a woman, you truly have the choice to only choose between 2 extremes, a lot of them revert back to their typical ‚Äúrole‚Äù within society that was mediated by the patriarchy and the history of their oppression since the beginning of time; the role as someone inferior, subservient to men in their own household and within most jobs, the only valuable accomplishments being motherhood regardless if whether it means giving up your sanity and bodily autonomy as a whole, an inherently objectfied being whose body is sought and sold as a commodity for male pleasure only (except this time it's in the guise of being ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúempowering‚Äù, even if it‚Äôs downright regarding and dehumanizing), and all other derogatory things that hold women back and keep them from reaching their true potential in every aspect of their lives. The reason that women tend to revert back to the motherhood role is because it‚Äôs something that the patriarchal standards emphasis by our capitalist economy supports and encourages way more so than the latter and because women as a whole need to do so solely in order to ‚Äúcontribute to society‚Äù in the way it truly needs and the way women think that they are capable of, whilst refusing to do anything about it because by the nature of evolution alone, most women are destined to always live beneath men and lack the power to make a true change.\n\nIt‚Äôs what women have evolved within this specific mode of production to be more interested in, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed to be done, it's what women see as what they realistically can do better at as opposed to trying to ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù, and it;s the only way that they are told they can truly contribute to society as a whole due to not being fit to being able to survive and continue the human race otherwise. However, motherhood as a whole is incredibly cucked and messed up, and even more so within our society today and just how it‚Äôs run. It‚Äôs pretty much a scam and something thrown off balance altogether by our system, even if women continue to freely participate in it as a form of voluntary slavery.\n\nMotherhood doesn‚Äôt have inherent value in a capitalist economy, and yet it‚Äôs still seen as something that women should be expected to do as a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù due to the male standards that rule our society along with the traits that are typically associated with being a good mother, aren‚Äôt traits that bode well with being successful in the eyes of capitalism and prevents women from various high-powered careers and leadership positions for this reason, along with finding out that being considered the mothers and caretakers of society first and foremost, doesn‚Äôt do much to further benefit how they are treated and whether they are respected or not. Women are the ones that do most of the ‚Äúunpaid‚Äù labor of society, all of which obviously doesn‚Äôt make profit, which leads to it lacking the respect it truly deserves, which in turn only harms the progression of women‚Äôs rights as a whole and prevents women from truly being seen as equals within society. That along with the fact that since most people simply aren‚Äôt satisfied with their careers in general, women end up being the ones that end up being the ones to take care of their families due to economic restrictions that prevent them from being able to achieve any other dreams in a way that‚Äôs enjoyable, advances society, and isn‚Äôt a complete scam. Regardless of whether motherhood is their dream or not, it‚Äôs what this male dominated society needs women to do, and since what women do typically doesn't result with them having much actual ‚Äúpower‚Äù in society, they all end up falling victim to the trap of this economy and it‚Äôs true patriarchal roots. \n\nMen do not appreciate ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù or women as a whole and all the labour that they provide, and never did. In a capitalist society especially, despite the fact that unpaid labour is one of the most important types of labour required in order to keep the world running, since it can‚Äôt make any actual profit , it‚Äôs instead used as a tool to keep women ‚Äúin their place‚Äù as opposed to being something that‚Äôs genuinely respected. All of this to prevent women from being equals in society and to have power, and since women as a whole have evolved to adapt to the worlds that men make and since many aren‚Äôt actually interested in climbing the corporate ladder until their limbs fall off and don‚Äôt really have that drive to dominate things and due to gender roles instilled within us by nature that a woman‚Äôs greatest value is to be able to give birth and raise children, naturally most women are unable to truly gain the power to run this country on their own terms, and the ones that end up being able to do so often tend to be no better than their male counterparts. Companies run by women aren‚Äôt guaranteed better maternity leave nor work-life balance or lack of discrimination against female counterparts, nor are women capitalists somehow more ‚Äúempathetic‚Äù and less likely to exploit minorities. And even women that may have started out that way, realized that a) it wasn‚Äôt compatible with the system and then just quit or b) realized it wasn‚Äôt compatible and instead decided to continue acting like men and chasing the bag until they reached their goal. A lot of the times, women that are unsuccessful with their careers or creating their own business often become mothers, either by choice or just by chance, and fall back onto that if they ever fail as it‚Äôs what society is willing to encourage more as opposed to women being able to ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù, cause that‚Äôs virtually impossible. And in turn, all of this continues and encourages the cycle of dependency that has held women back since forever.\n\nMotherhood? Lack of respect, loads of cultural hatred and misogyny being directed towards you, being expected to do everything without any real payoff and unappreciated effort, financial dependence that makes you more susceptible to abuse, people criticizing your every move as now kids are expected to be your entire life with no identity of your own and your now expected to be a teacher, social worker, therapist, and counselor to your kids full time as opposed to them just being an extension of your life, the overwhelming costs of raising a child and being able to afford childcare, the sheer side effects of pregnancy on your body along with lack of funding for women‚Äôs health and the medical field which basically treats women like the smaller versions of men when it comes to creating medicines or treatments as women‚Äôs hormones are apparently too ‚Äúmessy‚Äù to study with and due to the lack of female scientists who are willing to advocate for this and the women who just accept this as the reality as they don‚Äôt have much of the power to do much else.\n\nNow when it comes to the concept of ‚Äúpower‚Äù, this is actually another reason as to why a lot of women choose motherhood. I mentioned that men were the ones that were mainly money-hungry and power-seeking, but realistically, human beings as a whole all want power in some way shape or form. And women are no exception, except for the fact that on average, women don‚Äôt exactly have the same way of gaining access to said power in the way that men do. Men who typically show signs of narcissistic behavior typically go into leadership positions to gain control of people that way. Men without a strong sense of identity tend to be the ones that slave away to their careers the most. Women with a lack of identity and/or narcissistic and ‚Äúbully‚Äù tendencies, typically end up becoming mothers and going into jobs where they have direct access to toil with human lives as a whole along with the ability to cause emotional pain and physical pain to those who are vulnerable and weak. Some of the worst women you‚Äôll ever meet tend to be people like mothers, teachers, nurses, social workers, etc. They can have the power to abuse and ruin the lives of human beings they bring onto the world as a way to try to gain power, or they can raise their children to cater to them and increase their own status, both of which are the more ‚Äúfemale-standard‚Äù paths to success that society can encourage. Want power? Marry a rich man who will provide and have his children to prove your status statement. \n\nPower as a whole, however, is also something that‚Äôs culturally and historically known to be something women can also gain specifically by subscribing to and conforming to the patriarchal ideas of femininity as a whole. Why do you think so many women are trying to paint degrading yourself sexually for male pleasure as something ‚Äúempowering‚Äù and ‚Äúgood‚Äù for women? Why are so many derogatory things trying to be disguised as something ‚Äúpositive‚Äù anyway? A lot of women consider it ‚Äúempowering‚Äù because being able to experience some of the niceties under the patriarchal system is what women throughout history had been shown as the pinnacle of true ‚Äúpower‚Äù and ‚Äúautonomy‚Äù they could reach, and it‚Äôs stayed that way in today‚Äôs society. Mediated by the traumas of female socialization and expectations from a young age to view themselves as nothing but whores, it‚Äôs a coping for a lot of women as well. The reason why it‚Äôs seen as good is because sexually exploiting oneself can be a lucrative way to gain profit within our economy as women‚Äôs bodies are often bought and sold as commodities and objects with no other purpose than to conform to the male gaze in order to make money. Motherhood may be nature, but being sex workers and being sexually exploited is also something women had to endure throughout history and to a lot of foolish women, they view it as gaining control over these patriarchal standards when in reality, they‚Äôre just falling prey to it. Living your life under the rules of standards of male expectations is not ‚Äúpower‚Äù and you‚Äôre not getting anything from it except for another path to oppression. Women throughout all cultures and countries throughout history have also had to experience their insecurities heightened and exploited by big corporations solely in order to sell a product, and in turn, women fall victim to this scam solely in order to mold themselves into the male standards of beauty in order to be attractive. Attractive so they can reproduce and so they can gain ‚Äúpower‚Äù in a way that still conforms to the patriarchy for their own security, even if it doesn‚Äôt actually give them any freedom, independence, happiness, or power.Women benign weaker throughout history and with their entire value being reduced down to child-bearing ability, naturally they‚Äôd need to conform solely in order to survive like I mentioned before, and of course part of that conforming aspect has to deal with conforming solely in order to get a man to reproduce with and for them to be ‚Äúprotected‚Äù, even though men are more likely to be their oppressors and abusers as opposed to ‚Äúprotectors‚Äù. \n\nAnd males of course, stay crying mutiny and creating whole movement trashing and inciting violence against women solely because they hear a few women online saying they like ‚Äú6-inch dicks‚Äù instead of ‚Äú5 inch‚Äù or that they like men that \\*gasp\\* look attractive to them, and decide that that‚Äôs a violation of their own human rights to sex with a woman and hence become incels, red-pill, mgtow-ers, etc. etc. Truthfully, the audacity of males never fails to baffle me.\n\nUnable to gain power through their careers especially, women typically fall into these set of behaviors in order to even pretend they have autonomy within their own lives and would much rather live in darkness than except the truth that they are just as much of victims and slaves to the capitalist machine as their male counterparts albeit in a much different way a lot of the times, and within a lot of situations of which they themselves brought upon themselves.\n\nAnd back to the topic, what about when it comes to women‚Äôs careers as a whole? Do that somehow make them more miserable than motherhood? Honestly, nobody truly loves their careers as much as this capitalist society likes to shove down our throats. Realistically, even if you do something you love, you‚Äôll come to realize that trying to monetize a passion is the best way to get bored and tired of it quickly. You need a stable salary in order to truly live a decent life as nobody will be willing to support you otherwise, and that of course means prioritizing making a profit when it comes to your ‚Äúdream career‚Äù. All careers, even those that are about ‚Äúhelping others‚Äù and altruism, become corporatism at some point in time. The more well paying it is, the more money-hungry people who don‚Äôt actually care about other people and are just looking to fill their own pockets fill these jobs And not to mention most of the times they also get male dominated and get created into an environment in which you basically have to be ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù to succeed, and is unable to accommodate for women as a whole with this culture, which leads to women not being able ti prosper in these careers and eventually nature comes in and makes it so women as a whole are no longer interested in these careers solely because our sociology itself is so affected my the economy at hand. We are influenced by our material reality and the modes of production of the economy when it comes to our thoughts, history, idea, innovation, etc. and not the other way around. And of course, if a job is lower paid and lacks job security and benefits, a lot of talented and passionate people in these field eventually leave and get burned out because they realize their talent is not sustainable in the long run. Research and science itself is an industry that‚Äôs a huge victim of this. The majority of genuinely talented and smart people who want to go into the science field, realize that it‚Äôs pretty much a scam and working there wouldn't call for ‚Äúground-breaking‚Äù innovation and the advancement of society as a whole, but more so a way to slave away whilst not being able to make a proper living for themselves and instead peddle money for the rich all whilst realizing people are willing to hinder a lot of scientific advancements if it means making more profit from just ‚Äúimproving‚Äù already existing profits, and with the realization that even with many technological advancement, the majority of people probably wouldn't have access to a lot of the improvement that could be granted by scientific innovation any way due to the economy in which most of the wealth belongs to the top 1%. Realistically, having more women in STEM within this economy would not change or improve shit. \n\nAnd again, this is another one of the reasons why there aren‚Äôt more women in certain careers in the first place. This along with the terrible lifestyle and work-life balance and having to basically choose between career and family, in which most women choose the latter. Our workplace as a whole is built with the typical ‚Äúcareer man whose willing to work 60+ hours a week cause he has no responsibilities when it comes to child-rearing nor focusing on family‚Äù in mind as the vision of the ‚Äúaverage worker‚Äù, and naturally capitalists are wanting to increase their profit over all else and overworking their workers like slaves is the best way to do so, with no concern in the world for women and mothers with children who are also wanting to enter the workforce. Realistically speaking, if we had things like paid extended maternity leave, public childcare, and more understanding of work-life balance and benefits to people working part-time, then a lot of women would want to actively be in the work-force way more as opposed to giving it up to raise children, but that‚Äôs not going to happen any time soon.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, capitalism cares about women...About exploiting them just like men. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am not going down the path of ‚ÄúfEmInIsM rUinEd eVeRyThiNg‚Äù by allowing women in the workforce, because that‚Äôs not the case at all. Women have always had it unfair when it comes to work, and there has never been a time when they stayed home and did nothing (and not even in the 50s where the whole circle jerk of ‚Äúhappy housewives‚Äù created by the manosphere apparently took place). The difference between then and now, is that then women were forced to work low-paying menial jobs they didn‚Äôt want and having a tiring job and raising children was a requirement as opposed to a choice like now. Women who were housewives either worked equally hard or were depressed (Peak the popularity of ‚ÄúFeminine Mystique‚Äù, overwhelming percentage of valium addiction, ‚ÄúMommy‚Äôs Little Helper‚Äù, higher child abuse rates, etc). And again, this phenomenon in the 50s was another result of the economy at this time. Economy throughout history has been the driving force of society and the influence of women‚Äôs rights and feminism. At certain points in time, division of labor was necessary to the point where absolutely no ‚Äúfeminist thinking‚Äù would have been able to increase gender equality as humans need to adapt themselves still to fit in with their material surroundings, and a lot of that does in fact result in a power imbalance between men and women. Women weren‚Äôt allowed in the work-force in the first place due to feminism in the US, but due to WWII in which women working jobs that men previously held was basically a necessity. Of course afterwards when they were forced back into the kitchen, they had a whole movement for it, but the economy after WWII changed a lot of things about society as a whole and was a huge mediator in creating and shaping our current day economy. Hell at one point women would have probably entered the workforce anyway due to geopolitical reasons alone. If the economy wasn‚Äôt fit for it, no amount of ‚Äúfeminism‚Äù would have been able to change anything.\n\nSpeaking of careers, a lot of women often see their careers as a way to gain ‚Äúequal rights' ' and ‚Äúequality‚Äù, and in a way it is. I mean being able to be in a successful career == you are able to be a ‚Äúman‚Äù enough to gain power within this economy as a whole and hence, men have no choice but to see you as even slightly equal to them. Which again, shows how men do not actually appreciate ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù nor what women do as a whole. In the least gender equal countries, women often make up greater percentages of STEM careers and leadership positions and women see having a career as a way to be empowered and independent, as being successful in any pursuit other than motherhood is the way for the men to see them as even remotely equal to them. Now this of course, doesn't change how women can be equally exploited within capitalism as a whole, because they do. But sadly, until women stop working under the system and somehow choosing the tolerate the patriarchy if they get to experience some of the superficial temporary ‚Äúbenefits'' given out by men due to fulfilling their ‚Äúnatural role‚Äù (which of course wears out by the time they secede reproductive age), and instead work the system and gain power within a way that both allows them to make an executive change for the better, our situation will never change. But of course, realistically speaking, women as a whole aren‚Äôt really equipped to ‚Äúwork the system‚Äù as a whole, and economic values mixed in with our Western culture in particular which enforced the typical ‚Äúgender roles'' because that seems to be the only way to even remotely be happy/seen as the better option within the societal expectations that dictate a man or woman‚Äôs role in society, prevent this from happening even more. \n\nMen of course, are the ones that continue to be the ones that work full time to fulfill their role as ‚Äúprovider‚Äù and to prove they made it as a man in society (which of course is easier as capitalism as a whole is made to accommodate who ‚Äúman‚Äù by nature is more so than women). This of course leads to a variety of problems in reality as the ‚Äúnuclear family model‚Äù truthfully is a scam on both sides. It leads the man to be a work-crazy psychopath with no care about other people or time with his own family, and leads the women to be financially dependent, unfulfilled, with no way to gain education nor emotional security. The amount of men in real life that would rather be cramped up in offices all day solely to avoid their ‚Äúnagging wife and kids‚Äù is staggering. Capitalism affects men very negatively, which in turn affects women negatively as well. And of course, like I mentioned back before, women continue to encourage this type of stuff equally.\n\nPorn for example and the objectification of women online is a billion dollar industry and it‚Äôs currently a very lucrative business for women as a whole to be able to make money. It‚Äôs been shown, in every culture and every country, that men are 1000 times better when they are NOT exposed to porn and yet...people still encourage porn. It truly doesn‚Äôt help how much social media as a whole has revolutionized this industry dedicated to women objectifying themselves for the male gaze, and then people online being fed the narrative that it;' somehow ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù and ‚Äúempowering‚Äù, and the increased existence of liberal feminism as a whole which encourages this. Because of course, slaving away to capitalism is a much better and more lucrative way to live than encouraging women to have basic self-respect. Then of course you have various companies that continue to profit off of women‚Äôs insecurities along with creating a culture that supports buying and selling women's bodies as objects and a sexualized series of body parts regardless of how that negatively affects people as a whole. All of this mixed together truly makes women believe that they have no purpose other than whoring out to men and trying to justify it as being something positive. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where things like ‚Äúvaginal cosmetic surgeries‚Äù so much as exist, because women are willing to try to make themselves pleasurable to men. It honestly disgusts me just how much all these negative aspects of female socialization is so much encouraged and that seeing women as nothing but objects is able to be translated into genuine business ideas.  And of course, let‚Äôs not forget how much of a scam the current new popular ‚Äútradwife trend‚Äù and glorification of the ‚Äúnuclear family dynamic‚Äù is. Like I mentioned, it leads men to having no humanistic values or placing no importance on family as a whole which throws off family dynamics and the quality of relationships as they give up their lives to work, whereas the woman stays being considered inferior in so many other aspects within life and unable to truly have the freedom to do anything else. \n\nHonestly, I just despise the way society is run as a looking back at it, until our economy radically changes one day, no matter what cultural change people try to push and no matter what type of new technology tries to claim that it will ‚Äúimprove‚Äù the lives of others, until we get radical changes to our economy first and foremost, I do not ever see women being able to break past this cycle. And as long as they continue to give birth to their oppressors and keep the slaves of genes going in a world where everyone ends up being a mere victim to the system, a cog in the machine, and existing in a life where the only thing guaranteed is pain and sorrow...Nothing will ever change for the better."", 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TW: Long, Incohesive mess of thoughts that probably don&amp;#39;t even make sense, but whatever it&amp;#39;s just a rant&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know how much of a popular or well known opinion this is, but I honestly just can‚Äôt help but feel so cheated as to how capitalism and women‚Äôs rights seem to be so damn incompatible with one another and just how much capitalism has screwed over women as a whole. It‚Äôs truly the system that has positioned men and women in an unequal economic relationship with employers, unequal positions within their own households and jobs, unequal positions when it comes to what society considers the ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù of men and women within nature, unequal positions in terms of authority and independence and power, unequal authority when it comes to equality of true opportunity, and just a certain sense of unfairness that infects all the other aspects of their relationships. Capitalism is a system that makes women giving birth to their oppressors, degrading themselves whilst seeing it as ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù, accepting this type of unfairness when it comes to division of labour and value of individual labour, accepting mistreatment and being put in inherent subservient positions within their own homes, and being unable to reach their true potential solely due to being unable to thrive in an economy which encourages female inferiority and devaluing women as a whole whilst being specifically catered to ‚Äúmasculine ideals‚Äù and the male-standard of success to thrive only. Capitalism and the general nature of what it values, how it functions, and what it takes to thrive within a capitalist society, all end up devaluing women as a whole and invalidating female-specific strengths and capitalizing off of women‚Äôs insecurities along with throwing marriages/relationships off balance as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within a capitalist system, the select few privileged 1% of men and anyone who is a ‚Äúman‚Äù willing to give up their dignities and lives to chase the bad, whereas the rest of everyone else (women and minorities) are all exploited and abused. And for this reason, they‚Äôll never be able to truly be seen as equals within our society. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The economy and modes of production affect our sociology as human beings and our thoughts, ideas, behaviors, and innovations more so than the other way around. Humans adapt and evolve consistently to fit into the specific environment that the economy creates for them solely in order to be able to keep the slaves of the genes going properly. Even if it‚Äôs not preferable and harms human beings as a whole, throughout history and even today, humans have and continued to do what they needed to do to survive themselves and eventually end up reproducing according to the conditions that the economy has set up for them. Human beings evolve and change depending on our material reality, and the economy plays a huge part in shaping our culture and behaviors as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women especially are affected by this as a whole, because historically, they were the ones that were oppressed and typically weaker and too agreeable and didn‚Äôt have much power within life. For this reason, a lot of them had to resort to trying to conform into society solely to survive and learn to please males solely in order to have any bit of power within life and to fulfill what people thought was their true purpose in life; motherhood. Women are the ones whose brains are designed to quickly adapt to change, adapting and evolving to the worlds that their men build and destroy with no second thought. The ones who adapt and are socialized to fit into the specific culture of specific countries which are mediated by the specific economic environment of those specific places. And for this reason, a lot of their behaviors and interests and life choices are heavily mediated by this solely in order to survive and to eventually give birth and raise children. Job choices, potential, education, IQ, personality, feminism, interests, etc. are all aspects of women that have the ability to change depending on a variety of factors and have the ability to be directly affected by the economy alone. That plus women being more risk-averse on average, most of them won‚Äôt go up and far to change the world nor chase their dreams, and instead stick to a solid and predictable path to guarantee optimal success when it comes to what society wants them to be and in order to assure their own security within life. For a lot of women, security &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; freedom; one of the various aspects of women that capitalism isn‚Äôt meant to accommodate for nor does it allow women to truly reach their full potential and finally be equals within society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does capitalism value exactly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Capitalism is a system that values the gaining and pursuit of profit over all else. It‚Äôs an establishment that prioritizes those that can exploit others, especially minorities, to gain more money and privilege within their own hands. It awards those who are psychopathic enough to pursue a life in which they feel like either working 80+ hours a week to survive is ‚Äúrewarding‚Äù and ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù, and to those who build and destroy without a care in the world about those affected. Anything that can‚Äôt make profit === un-valuable and useless. It‚Äôs a system that strives for individuality above all else, devaluing familial and humanistic values that would be beneficial to people as a whole and strives to provide ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù for the select minority of men over the equality of whole nations. And yes, ‚Äúmen‚Äù in particular. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúMan‚Äù, or more specifically the concept of a ‚Äúman‚Äù, is someone with a lot of power. Someone who is a natural materialist; valuing wealth and money over all else. Someone who&amp;#39;s driven and impacted by ego as opposed to society, willing to take massive risks without regard to any other aspect of their lives solely in order to get to the top, greedy, valuing freedom over security, career over family, profit over altruism, individualism over community identity, and someone who lives with a constant drive to dominate things in the field of power and status. All of these traits are ones that rule the ‚Äúestablishments‚Äù of the current day and are specifically designed to support a male-lead and male-dominated world first and foremost, accentuating ‚Äúmale strengths‚Äù and traits and devaluing anyone who doesn‚Äôt fit into the specific requirements to succeed in this capitalist world. And women are the most noteworthy victims of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ‚Äúrules‚Äù of the establishment are those that are meant to keep the power imbalance between the sexes high and ‚Äúin their proper place‚Äù, which eventually leads to striving to keep women in a continuous state of servitude; whether it be to massive corporations who don‚Äôt care at all about their interests nor autonomy and care only to exploit women for bigger gain of wealth. Or within the own home in which a woman is expected to act as a glorified domesticated servant to her husband and kids, lacking the financial independence and true freedom of opportunity to do much else, but choosing to stay any way because it‚Äôs what ultimately ends up being better for the family. In order to keep family-dynamics stable and in place, women need to give up their autonomy and independence and inherent power within their lives. In order to have a successful career, women have to give up any idea of love and family along with their identities, respect dignity, and having to whore out to bosses and managers and everyone else in positions of authority solely in order to move up, only to get cruelly pushed aside later on when they are no longer considered ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù to the male gaze that rules our society (which is further accentuated by the nature of capitalism as a whole that encourages the viewing of women‚Äôs bodies and youth as a commodity).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you realize that as a woman, you truly have the choice to only choose between 2 extremes, a lot of them revert back to their typical ‚Äúrole‚Äù within society that was mediated by the patriarchy and the history of their oppression since the beginning of time; the role as someone inferior, subservient to men in their own household and within most jobs, the only valuable accomplishments being motherhood regardless if whether it means giving up your sanity and bodily autonomy as a whole, an inherently objectfied being whose body is sought and sold as a commodity for male pleasure only (except this time it&amp;#39;s in the guise of being ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúempowering‚Äù, even if it‚Äôs downright regarding and dehumanizing), and all other derogatory things that hold women back and keep them from reaching their true potential in every aspect of their lives. The reason that women tend to revert back to the motherhood role is because it‚Äôs something that the patriarchal standards emphasis by our capitalist economy supports and encourages way more so than the latter and because women as a whole need to do so solely in order to ‚Äúcontribute to society‚Äù in the way it truly needs and the way women think that they are capable of, whilst refusing to do anything about it because by the nature of evolution alone, most women are destined to always live beneath men and lack the power to make a true change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs what women have evolved within this specific mode of production to be more interested in, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed to be done, it&amp;#39;s what women see as what they realistically can do better at as opposed to trying to ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù, and it;s the only way that they are told they can truly contribute to society as a whole due to not being fit to being able to survive and continue the human race otherwise. However, motherhood as a whole is incredibly cucked and messed up, and even more so within our society today and just how it‚Äôs run. It‚Äôs pretty much a scam and something thrown off balance altogether by our system, even if women continue to freely participate in it as a form of voluntary slavery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Motherhood doesn‚Äôt have inherent value in a capitalist economy, and yet it‚Äôs still seen as something that women should be expected to do as a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù due to the male standards that rule our society along with the traits that are typically associated with being a good mother, aren‚Äôt traits that bode well with being successful in the eyes of capitalism and prevents women from various high-powered careers and leadership positions for this reason, along with finding out that being considered the mothers and caretakers of society first and foremost, doesn‚Äôt do much to further benefit how they are treated and whether they are respected or not. Women are the ones that do most of the ‚Äúunpaid‚Äù labor of society, all of which obviously doesn‚Äôt make profit, which leads to it lacking the respect it truly deserves, which in turn only harms the progression of women‚Äôs rights as a whole and prevents women from truly being seen as equals within society. That along with the fact that since most people simply aren‚Äôt satisfied with their careers in general, women end up being the ones that end up being the ones to take care of their families due to economic restrictions that prevent them from being able to achieve any other dreams in a way that‚Äôs enjoyable, advances society, and isn‚Äôt a complete scam. Regardless of whether motherhood is their dream or not, it‚Äôs what this male dominated society needs women to do, and since what women do typically doesn&amp;#39;t result with them having much actual ‚Äúpower‚Äù in society, they all end up falling victim to the trap of this economy and it‚Äôs true patriarchal roots. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men do not appreciate ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù or women as a whole and all the labour that they provide, and never did. In a capitalist society especially, despite the fact that unpaid labour is one of the most important types of labour required in order to keep the world running, since it can‚Äôt make any actual profit , it‚Äôs instead used as a tool to keep women ‚Äúin their place‚Äù as opposed to being something that‚Äôs genuinely respected. All of this to prevent women from being equals in society and to have power, and since women as a whole have evolved to adapt to the worlds that men make and since many aren‚Äôt actually interested in climbing the corporate ladder until their limbs fall off and don‚Äôt really have that drive to dominate things and due to gender roles instilled within us by nature that a woman‚Äôs greatest value is to be able to give birth and raise children, naturally most women are unable to truly gain the power to run this country on their own terms, and the ones that end up being able to do so often tend to be no better than their male counterparts. Companies run by women aren‚Äôt guaranteed better maternity leave nor work-life balance or lack of discrimination against female counterparts, nor are women capitalists somehow more ‚Äúempathetic‚Äù and less likely to exploit minorities. And even women that may have started out that way, realized that a) it wasn‚Äôt compatible with the system and then just quit or b) realized it wasn‚Äôt compatible and instead decided to continue acting like men and chasing the bag until they reached their goal. A lot of the times, women that are unsuccessful with their careers or creating their own business often become mothers, either by choice or just by chance, and fall back onto that if they ever fail as it‚Äôs what society is willing to encourage more as opposed to women being able to ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù, cause that‚Äôs virtually impossible. And in turn, all of this continues and encourages the cycle of dependency that has held women back since forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Motherhood? Lack of respect, loads of cultural hatred and misogyny being directed towards you, being expected to do everything without any real payoff and unappreciated effort, financial dependence that makes you more susceptible to abuse, people criticizing your every move as now kids are expected to be your entire life with no identity of your own and your now expected to be a teacher, social worker, therapist, and counselor to your kids full time as opposed to them just being an extension of your life, the overwhelming costs of raising a child and being able to afford childcare, the sheer side effects of pregnancy on your body along with lack of funding for women‚Äôs health and the medical field which basically treats women like the smaller versions of men when it comes to creating medicines or treatments as women‚Äôs hormones are apparently too ‚Äúmessy‚Äù to study with and due to the lack of female scientists who are willing to advocate for this and the women who just accept this as the reality as they don‚Äôt have much of the power to do much else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now when it comes to the concept of ‚Äúpower‚Äù, this is actually another reason as to why a lot of women choose motherhood. I mentioned that men were the ones that were mainly money-hungry and power-seeking, but realistically, human beings as a whole all want power in some way shape or form. And women are no exception, except for the fact that on average, women don‚Äôt exactly have the same way of gaining access to said power in the way that men do. Men who typically show signs of narcissistic behavior typically go into leadership positions to gain control of people that way. Men without a strong sense of identity tend to be the ones that slave away to their careers the most. Women with a lack of identity and/or narcissistic and ‚Äúbully‚Äù tendencies, typically end up becoming mothers and going into jobs where they have direct access to toil with human lives as a whole along with the ability to cause emotional pain and physical pain to those who are vulnerable and weak. Some of the worst women you‚Äôll ever meet tend to be people like mothers, teachers, nurses, social workers, etc. They can have the power to abuse and ruin the lives of human beings they bring onto the world as a way to try to gain power, or they can raise their children to cater to them and increase their own status, both of which are the more ‚Äúfemale-standard‚Äù paths to success that society can encourage. Want power? Marry a rich man who will provide and have his children to prove your status statement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Power as a whole, however, is also something that‚Äôs culturally and historically known to be something women can also gain specifically by subscribing to and conforming to the patriarchal ideas of femininity as a whole. Why do you think so many women are trying to paint degrading yourself sexually for male pleasure as something ‚Äúempowering‚Äù and ‚Äúgood‚Äù for women? Why are so many derogatory things trying to be disguised as something ‚Äúpositive‚Äù anyway? A lot of women consider it ‚Äúempowering‚Äù because being able to experience some of the niceties under the patriarchal system is what women throughout history had been shown as the pinnacle of true ‚Äúpower‚Äù and ‚Äúautonomy‚Äù they could reach, and it‚Äôs stayed that way in today‚Äôs society. Mediated by the traumas of female socialization and expectations from a young age to view themselves as nothing but whores, it‚Äôs a coping for a lot of women as well. The reason why it‚Äôs seen as good is because sexually exploiting oneself can be a lucrative way to gain profit within our economy as women‚Äôs bodies are often bought and sold as commodities and objects with no other purpose than to conform to the male gaze in order to make money. Motherhood may be nature, but being sex workers and being sexually exploited is also something women had to endure throughout history and to a lot of foolish women, they view it as gaining control over these patriarchal standards when in reality, they‚Äôre just falling prey to it. Living your life under the rules of standards of male expectations is not ‚Äúpower‚Äù and you‚Äôre not getting anything from it except for another path to oppression. Women throughout all cultures and countries throughout history have also had to experience their insecurities heightened and exploited by big corporations solely in order to sell a product, and in turn, women fall victim to this scam solely in order to mold themselves into the male standards of beauty in order to be attractive. Attractive so they can reproduce and so they can gain ‚Äúpower‚Äù in a way that still conforms to the patriarchy for their own security, even if it doesn‚Äôt actually give them any freedom, independence, happiness, or power.Women benign weaker throughout history and with their entire value being reduced down to child-bearing ability, naturally they‚Äôd need to conform solely in order to survive like I mentioned before, and of course part of that conforming aspect has to deal with conforming solely in order to get a man to reproduce with and for them to be ‚Äúprotected‚Äù, even though men are more likely to be their oppressors and abusers as opposed to ‚Äúprotectors‚Äù. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And males of course, stay crying mutiny and creating whole movement trashing and inciting violence against women solely because they hear a few women online saying they like ‚Äú6-inch dicks‚Äù instead of ‚Äú5 inch‚Äù or that they like men that *gasp* look attractive to them, and decide that that‚Äôs a violation of their own human rights to sex with a woman and hence become incels, red-pill, mgtow-ers, etc. etc. Truthfully, the audacity of males never fails to baffle me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unable to gain power through their careers especially, women typically fall into these set of behaviors in order to even pretend they have autonomy within their own lives and would much rather live in darkness than except the truth that they are just as much of victims and slaves to the capitalist machine as their male counterparts albeit in a much different way a lot of the times, and within a lot of situations of which they themselves brought upon themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And back to the topic, what about when it comes to women‚Äôs careers as a whole? Do that somehow make them more miserable than motherhood? Honestly, nobody truly loves their careers as much as this capitalist society likes to shove down our throats. Realistically, even if you do something you love, you‚Äôll come to realize that trying to monetize a passion is the best way to get bored and tired of it quickly. You need a stable salary in order to truly live a decent life as nobody will be willing to support you otherwise, and that of course means prioritizing making a profit when it comes to your ‚Äúdream career‚Äù. All careers, even those that are about ‚Äúhelping others‚Äù and altruism, become corporatism at some point in time. The more well paying it is, the more money-hungry people who don‚Äôt actually care about other people and are just looking to fill their own pockets fill these jobs And not to mention most of the times they also get male dominated and get created into an environment in which you basically have to be ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù to succeed, and is unable to accommodate for women as a whole with this culture, which leads to women not being able ti prosper in these careers and eventually nature comes in and makes it so women as a whole are no longer interested in these careers solely because our sociology itself is so affected my the economy at hand. We are influenced by our material reality and the modes of production of the economy when it comes to our thoughts, history, idea, innovation, etc. and not the other way around. And of course, if a job is lower paid and lacks job security and benefits, a lot of talented and passionate people in these field eventually leave and get burned out because they realize their talent is not sustainable in the long run. Research and science itself is an industry that‚Äôs a huge victim of this. The majority of genuinely talented and smart people who want to go into the science field, realize that it‚Äôs pretty much a scam and working there wouldn&amp;#39;t call for ‚Äúground-breaking‚Äù innovation and the advancement of society as a whole, but more so a way to slave away whilst not being able to make a proper living for themselves and instead peddle money for the rich all whilst realizing people are willing to hinder a lot of scientific advancements if it means making more profit from just ‚Äúimproving‚Äù already existing profits, and with the realization that even with many technological advancement, the majority of people probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have access to a lot of the improvement that could be granted by scientific innovation any way due to the economy in which most of the wealth belongs to the top 1%. Realistically, having more women in STEM within this economy would not change or improve shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And again, this is another one of the reasons why there aren‚Äôt more women in certain careers in the first place. This along with the terrible lifestyle and work-life balance and having to basically choose between career and family, in which most women choose the latter. Our workplace as a whole is built with the typical ‚Äúcareer man whose willing to work 60+ hours a week cause he has no responsibilities when it comes to child-rearing nor focusing on family‚Äù in mind as the vision of the ‚Äúaverage worker‚Äù, and naturally capitalists are wanting to increase their profit over all else and overworking their workers like slaves is the best way to do so, with no concern in the world for women and mothers with children who are also wanting to enter the workforce. Realistically speaking, if we had things like paid extended maternity leave, public childcare, and more understanding of work-life balance and benefits to people working part-time, then a lot of women would want to actively be in the work-force way more as opposed to giving it up to raise children, but that‚Äôs not going to happen any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt get me wrong, capitalism cares about women...About exploiting them just like men. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am not going down the path of ‚ÄúfEmInIsM rUinEd eVeRyThiNg‚Äù by allowing women in the workforce, because that‚Äôs not the case at all. Women have always had it unfair when it comes to work, and there has never been a time when they stayed home and did nothing (and not even in the 50s where the whole circle jerk of ‚Äúhappy housewives‚Äù created by the manosphere apparently took place). The difference between then and now, is that then women were forced to work low-paying menial jobs they didn‚Äôt want and having a tiring job and raising children was a requirement as opposed to a choice like now. Women who were housewives either worked equally hard or were depressed (Peak the popularity of ‚ÄúFeminine Mystique‚Äù, overwhelming percentage of valium addiction, ‚ÄúMommy‚Äôs Little Helper‚Äù, higher child abuse rates, etc). And again, this phenomenon in the 50s was another result of the economy at this time. Economy throughout history has been the driving force of society and the influence of women‚Äôs rights and feminism. At certain points in time, division of labor was necessary to the point where absolutely no ‚Äúfeminist thinking‚Äù would have been able to increase gender equality as humans need to adapt themselves still to fit in with their material surroundings, and a lot of that does in fact result in a power imbalance between men and women. Women weren‚Äôt allowed in the work-force in the first place due to feminism in the US, but due to WWII in which women working jobs that men previously held was basically a necessity. Of course afterwards when they were forced back into the kitchen, they had a whole movement for it, but the economy after WWII changed a lot of things about society as a whole and was a huge mediator in creating and shaping our current day economy. Hell at one point women would have probably entered the workforce anyway due to geopolitical reasons alone. If the economy wasn‚Äôt fit for it, no amount of ‚Äúfeminism‚Äù would have been able to change anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of careers, a lot of women often see their careers as a way to gain ‚Äúequal rights&amp;#39; &amp;#39; and ‚Äúequality‚Äù, and in a way it is. I mean being able to be in a successful career == you are able to be a ‚Äúman‚Äù enough to gain power within this economy as a whole and hence, men have no choice but to see you as even slightly equal to them. Which again, shows how men do not actually appreciate ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù nor what women do as a whole. In the least gender equal countries, women often make up greater percentages of STEM careers and leadership positions and women see having a career as a way to be empowered and independent, as being successful in any pursuit other than motherhood is the way for the men to see them as even remotely equal to them. Now this of course, doesn&amp;#39;t change how women can be equally exploited within capitalism as a whole, because they do. But sadly, until women stop working under the system and somehow choosing the tolerate the patriarchy if they get to experience some of the superficial temporary ‚Äúbenefits&amp;#39;&amp;#39; given out by men due to fulfilling their ‚Äúnatural role‚Äù (which of course wears out by the time they secede reproductive age), and instead work the system and gain power within a way that both allows them to make an executive change for the better, our situation will never change. But of course, realistically speaking, women as a whole aren‚Äôt really equipped to ‚Äúwork the system‚Äù as a whole, and economic values mixed in with our Western culture in particular which enforced the typical ‚Äúgender roles&amp;#39;&amp;#39; because that seems to be the only way to even remotely be happy/seen as the better option within the societal expectations that dictate a man or woman‚Äôs role in society, prevent this from happening even more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men of course, are the ones that continue to be the ones that work full time to fulfill their role as ‚Äúprovider‚Äù and to prove they made it as a man in society (which of course is easier as capitalism as a whole is made to accommodate who ‚Äúman‚Äù by nature is more so than women). This of course leads to a variety of problems in reality as the ‚Äúnuclear family model‚Äù truthfully is a scam on both sides. It leads the man to be a work-crazy psychopath with no care about other people or time with his own family, and leads the women to be financially dependent, unfulfilled, with no way to gain education nor emotional security. The amount of men in real life that would rather be cramped up in offices all day solely to avoid their ‚Äúnagging wife and kids‚Äù is staggering. Capitalism affects men very negatively, which in turn affects women negatively as well. And of course, like I mentioned back before, women continue to encourage this type of stuff equally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Porn for example and the objectification of women online is a billion dollar industry and it‚Äôs currently a very lucrative business for women as a whole to be able to make money. It‚Äôs been shown, in every culture and every country, that men are 1000 times better when they are NOT exposed to porn and yet...people still encourage porn. It truly doesn‚Äôt help how much social media as a whole has revolutionized this industry dedicated to women objectifying themselves for the male gaze, and then people online being fed the narrative that it;&amp;#39; somehow ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù and ‚Äúempowering‚Äù, and the increased existence of liberal feminism as a whole which encourages this. Because of course, slaving away to capitalism is a much better and more lucrative way to live than encouraging women to have basic self-respect. Then of course you have various companies that continue to profit off of women‚Äôs insecurities along with creating a culture that supports buying and selling women&amp;#39;s bodies as objects and a sexualized series of body parts regardless of how that negatively affects people as a whole. All of this mixed together truly makes women believe that they have no purpose other than whoring out to men and trying to justify it as being something positive. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where things like ‚Äúvaginal cosmetic surgeries‚Äù so much as exist, because women are willing to try to make themselves pleasurable to men. It honestly disgusts me just how much all these negative aspects of female socialization is so much encouraged and that seeing women as nothing but objects is able to be translated into genuine business ideas.  And of course, let‚Äôs not forget how much of a scam the current new popular ‚Äútradwife trend‚Äù and glorification of the ‚Äúnuclear family dynamic‚Äù is. Like I mentioned, it leads men to having no humanistic values or placing no importance on family as a whole which throws off family dynamics and the quality of relationships as they give up their lives to work, whereas the woman stays being considered inferior in so many other aspects within life and unable to truly have the freedom to do anything else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I just despise the way society is run as a looking back at it, until our economy radically changes one day, no matter what cultural change people try to push and no matter what type of new technology tries to claim that it will ‚Äúimprove‚Äù the lives of others, until we get radical changes to our economy first and foremost, I do not ever see women being able to break past this cycle. And as long as they continue to give birth to their oppressors and keep the slaves of genes going in a world where everyone ends up being a mere victim to the system, a cog in the machine, and existing in a life where the only thing guaranteed is pain and sorrow...Nothing will ever change for the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'Female_Antinatalism', 'subreddit_id': 't5_319ugl', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/Female_Antinatalism', 'subreddit_subscribers': 328, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'Capitalist clownery', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 10, 'upvote_ratio': 0.92, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Female_Antinatalism/comments/o5faqx/capitalist_clownery/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': None, 'wls': None}]",self.Female_Antinatalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/wgtow/comments/o5pr62/capitalist_clownery/,{},o5pr62,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,,[],,,dark,text,False,False,True,2,0,False,some_ads,/r/wgtow/comments/o5pr62/capitalist_clownery/,False,,,7,1624375675,1,,True,False,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,7745,public,top,default,,,Capitalist clownery,0,[],1.0,/r/Female_Antinatalism/comments/o5faqx/capitalist_clownery/,/r/Female_Antinatalism/comments/o5faqx/capitalist_clownery/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,

I'm only 26, but I knew I needed to go my own way from as young as 16. I was raised in a fundamentalist, cult-like environment, and I started removing myself from that situation at 16-17. I continued to try to fit in with the ""lifescript"" throughout my early 20s, but over the past few years I have really identified that what I need is deprogramming. 

The problem with deprogramming, or determining what is NOT for me, what I DON'T want to center my life around, is that it doesn't automatically tell me what I SHOULD be focusing on. That is an entirely other beast. 

So, I'm curious to ask you, if you are willing to share, what you feel your purpose is. I'm big on journaling about my values, and writing down ways I can live out those values and hopefully find fulfillment. I see a lot of posts and comments here that seem to take a hedonistic view of life, that taking pleasure in being alive is the best way to live. Perhaps that is true! And still yet I see comments from religious women, women connected to nature, and many others...

Queue being 20 years old and 3/4 of my friend group getting nose jobs, preventative Botox, and fillers.

When I was 18, I worked for her dad (the surgeon) and my dad suggested I get a boob job. ‚ÄúThink of the doors it will open!‚Äù I asked for a consultation but ultimately backed out because having a childhood friend dad see my boobs made me want to vomit.

Thank god I did. That would set the stage for my experience and confusion when it came to my looks. 

When I turned 30 (last april) my friends told me I should treat myself to Botox and filler. I have a faint brow furrow, but honestly, I‚Äôm constantly mistaken for being in my younger 20s.

These are my very first signs of aging. Am I really going to start fighting this now? That means I will be fighting it for the rest of my life. And for who? 

I sort of bought into ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù and the boss b*** aesthetic for a while‚Äîdespite it being completely against my personality. ‚ÄúWhatever I need to do for power,‚Äù I told myself.

Last week, I watched a YouTube video where a woman takes down the Asian school girl stereotype. She talked about how the girls portrayed are ultimately written by men. And so women are lied to and told that as a young girl they can hold power by seducing older men, being sexually free, and wielding sex as power. But she pointed out that in reality, a high schooler having sex with an older man is always a case of a predator and prey.

Despite knowing this on some level, her pointing it out blew my mind. Because I had 100% bought into these tropes as a high schooler, and I also 100% became preyed upon‚Äîbut I never connected the dots that this was a well laid path dictated to me by media since I was a child.

And so, what is ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù? This other intangible source of power women somehow have access to? I know the terms comes from femcel language, but they merely labeled something Society constantly tells us is real. I knew it didn‚Äôt exist, because I was conventionally attractive yet hated myself and wanted to disappear from the male gaze. Yet, I was being fed this trope that to be a successful career women‚ÄîI must be something I‚Äôm not. That overemphasizing my looks, adjusting my body, wearing makeup that I hate, clothes that are not my style‚Äîthat somehow this would give me a competitive edge. But does it really? When I was younger and wore nice clothes (because we had to) and makeup to the office, all I got was harassment.

The final straw was hearing about the toxins found in makeup. Surely injecting botulism has SOME sort of long standing effect. And what kind of ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù do I really have if I have to inject botulism in my face to be taken seriously?

I‚Äôve had the appointment for a month, and I called today to cancel. I threw a thousand bucks in my IRA instead. Wealth is a power I can respect, having some intangible advantage of the male gaze by injecting fillers and toxins into my face are not. 

I feel extremely relieved, happy, and at peace not falling for the fiction society tells me will give me material power.",True,False,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,7645,public,top,self,,,Just canceled an appointment for Botox and fillers and feel SO RELIEVED,0,[],0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/wgtow/comments/o26irj/just_canceled_an_appointment_for_botox_and/,,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,False,,1623961310.0,

Internal peace.

When I was in relationships, I had no peace and it was all a bit manic, being used and manipulated really disturbed me but now, colors are brighter, I really listen to the lyrics of fun upbeat songs, spontaneity has returned. 

I was walking back from the store today and all I heard was beautiful bird song and I just stood there for a few minutes, sunshine hitting my face, warm air cuddling me. My elderly neighbour smiling at me, really smiling with her eyes too. Trying to distinguish the birds by their call. I feel FREE! 

No irritating texts or emails, no one trying to use me as an emotional tampon. No one trying to drag me down. 

If this is what liberation and freedom feels like then I am never giving it up.

Femininity lacks the freedom I desire. It really doesn\'t help how associated it is with motherhood, raising children, being social and people-oriented, being beautiful, and seems to be all centered around a woman\'s ability to give birth first an foremost. You can give birth = you need to be the primary caretakers of children, you need to be emotionally intelligent and interested in people and emotions in general, empathetic, nurturing, social, graceful, kind, supportive, provide unpaid labor, be inherently more anxious and calm and boring, being agreeable, being expected to be okay with being secondary, lack a strong sense of internal identity, be inherently submissive, to not chase any other dreams other than motherhood, to put others before oneself, to always be concerned about others, to consistently worry about appearances, Don\'t be aggressive, be domestic, etc.etc. All while of course, being able to look like a complete 10/10 because being ugly does not equate to femininity regardless of how much you fit the other traits. It sounds so exhausting tbh. \n\n Now I\'m not saying that that\'s all to femininity as a concept, because I genuinely do believe their is a strength in it as well, and it doesn\'t have to be nearly the same or as restricting as our patriarchal culture tries to make it to be, but this is what the current societal expectations are and what women are expected to adapt to in order to attract men and be considered valid as a woman. In countries where there are different expectations of femininity, women try to fit in to that as well. Femininity/womanhood, for a lot of woman in my experience, was something that was forced onto them the minute they reached childbearing age (or even before actually). Society socializes and molds women into fitting the current concept of womanhood. Just take a look at the trends for women\'s bodies; One minute it was heroin chic, the other minute it\'s all about being ""thick"" or having that Instagram baddie look. One minute women are made fun of for having big boobs, but another moment it\'s what women spend thousands of dollars of plastic surgery on. Women\'s body parts literally go in and out of style. I\'ve met a woman who was harassed at puberty for having big breasts and hated them to the point of getting a reduction...and then actually so much as getting *implants* to make them bigger later on. It\'s such a shame that our society puts so much value on women\'s bodies and values us for our fertility and looks first and foremost. Learning from a young age that society values you only for being able to produce children before anything and eventually programming yourself into fitting the molds of society\'s expectations so you can feel like you have a true purpose in life as a woman, really holds a lot of talented women back from reaching their full potential.\n\n Female socialization also includes Not ever being taught to be assertive, confident, stand up for yourself, learn to put yourself first, learn to be able to truly express your own individuality without caring what others think and creating an identity for yourself outside of relations with others (wife, mother, sister, etc.), learn to chase your biggest dreams and become somebody as opposed to just ""finding somebody"", and instead learning to accept abuse and degrading things (such as sexualziing oneself for male pleasure and selling your body online) all while being gaslit into thinking it\'s good and ""empowering"" by modern day feminists, truly makes me feel a deep sense of disdain for the state of the world today. Female socialization == being sexualized relentlessly from a young age by creepy older men until you finally accept that you\'re worth nothing but being a whore, and of course, since ""modern day women"" see this act of accepting the patriarchy as ""empowering"" and ""Good"", it\'s no wonder so many women themselves reduce their worth down to their bodies and looks and basically learn to treat themselves like disposable wombs from day one.\n\nI truly wish that one day this will change, but sadly I don\'t know If we\'ll ever see true equality in this lifetime. One thing that\'s for sure, is that the best thing (or only thing) that anyone can do at the moment, is to never give birth (not to daughters and not to the oppressors) that continue this depressing cycle of events and this cruel and unfair system created solely to keep the slaves of the genes going. One day, may all women stop being simps and cucks for men and realize the true nature of evolution and society as a whole, and realize that ""benefitting"" under the patriarchy is not the same as destroying the entire system altogether, and may we all one day be able to rise up and finally take our lives and culture into our own hands, and finally find a cure to this disease that we are all predisposed to from birth, mediated by the history of our own oppression.

Until then, I don&amp;#39;t know if women will ever achieve true &amp;quot;egalitarianism&amp;quot; as long as this society that&amp;#39;s dominated by males itself still exists.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'Female_Antinatalism', 'subreddit_id': 't5_319ugl', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/Female_Antinatalism', 'subreddit_subscribers': 322, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'Female socialization is literal brain cancer', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 20, 'upvote_ratio': 0.96, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Female_Antinatalism/comments/o0iz4u/female_socialization_is_literal_brain_cancer/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': None, 'wls': None}]",self.Female_Antinatalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/wgtow/comments/o0j4zw/as_it_always_has_been/,{},o0j4zw,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,#a06324,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion ‚ú®'}]",ae241832-3b10-11eb-80c6-0e2cc9fc2afb,Discussion ‚ú®,light,richtext,False,False,True,4,0,False,some_ads,/r/wgtow/comments/o0j4zw/as_it_always_has_been/,False,,,7,1623807865,12,,True,False,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,7525,public,top,default,,,As it always has been,0,[],0.94,/r/Female_Antinatalism/comments/o0iz4u/female_socialization_is_literal_brain_cancer/,/r/Female_Antinatalism/comments/o0iz4u/female_socialization_is_literal_brain_cancer/,some_ads,7,moderator,,,,,,,,,,False,,,

 Spinster Science

The science and art of creating yarn and fabric through wool preparation has long been associated with women, even lending the professional title of ‚Äúspinster‚Äù to old, unmarried women in Western society. As an industry, spinning has created independence and income for many women, while allowing them to adhere to strict boundaries and gendered expectations of a patriarchal society. The chemical and physical process of turning animal fleece into fabric requires skill and knowledge, and spinsters and their products have been crucially important to the development of many societies and cultures for thousands of years

¬†Among the goods in a 26,000 year old [grave found in the Czech Republic](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/abs/upper-palaeolithic-fibre-technology-interlaced-woven-finds-from-pavlov-i-czech-republic-c-26000-years-ago/CD78BC4A39E2DD6958ACA29BA1BA30DA), archaeologists discovered the remains of a drop spindle alongside the remains of natural fibers meant to be used with the spindle. While there have been examples of both genders taking part in these crafts, spinning and fiber production was often conducted by women, starting as early as the Iron Age in Europe. In fact, some archaeologists have suggested that the presence of spindles within ancient burial pits can help identify the gender of the human remains even [before skeletal analysis](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5986/1634.2) has been performed.¬†

Spinning is the physical process of turning fiber‚Äîfrom plant, animal, or even mineral sources‚Äîinto string material that can be processed into fabric. Those natural fibers have been [cultivated](https://books.google.com/books?id=v1pwdjw5zoUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) since the beginning of farming. Spinning materials have been used since the Upper Paleolithic period and were continuously developed into different methods of creating yarn and thread for fabric making. In order to be spun, a strand of fiber must easily ‚Äúcatch‚Äù to another, forming a continuous string. This is why the fibers from many [ungulates](https://www.britannica.com/animal/ungulate), such as sheep, can be spun into yarn, but human hair cannot. Using both tension and the weight of the yarn, the spinner pulls out a longer thread and winds the completed yarn onto a spool. The yarn or thread can then be processed through hanging and stretching, usually with a variety of different chemicals such as lye, soap, dye, and even human urine. The processed yarn is typically wound [into a ball](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/325/5946/1329.1) or other form of wrapped containment to allow knitter or weaver to keep it in order while making fabric. Ultimately, the fabric is made into clothing, bedding, and other household goods.

How spinning became women‚Äôs work is a complex phenomenon. Spinning was often done in quiet environments at home, allowing the worker to stop and start as needed, and as a result, the task often fell to women. Naturally, this craft required skilled practice and to be done in a fairly controlled environment, a kind of home textiles laboratory. Anthropologist Judith Brown in her 1970 paper,  [""Note on the Division of Labor by Sex](https://www.jstor.org/stable/671420?seq=1),‚Äù argues that in early human cultures the art of spinning was best attuned to the members of a society who were constantly doing multiple tasks at once that require routine practice. For women, the creation of fabric was a task that could be combined with childcare. Spinning and weaving could be picked up and put down as needed, and it was relatively easy to do at the side of other activities such as attending children or nursing a baby. Textiles scholar Elizabeth Barber also argues for this, saying that if one is responsible for a wide variety of tasks, such as food preparation, child care, and housework, having tasks that are easily stopped and started again at the same place helped lead to production of a finished item that could be used for practical purpose.¬†

 

Barber has shown that [unmarried or widowed women](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Women_s_Work_The_First_20_000_Years_Wome/UanOCQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1) often found themselves picking up extra money by spinning on the side. Even though women were being paid for this [skilled and important labor](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Prehistoric_Textiles/HnSlynSfeEIC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1), their male counterparts who worked with the yarns they made often received credit for women‚Äôs design and industry. In the 18th century, for example, [complaints](https://www.google.com/books/edition/No_Idle_Hands/8dFMltjhi0YC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover) from male weaving guilds in England indicated that American textile workers, mostly women at home, were a threat to their dominance in the textile industry, and to Britain‚Äôs control over America.¬†

Spinning became a factory-oriented process during the Industrial Revolution, and women spinners were ultimately replaced by machines. But the creation of threads and fabric was still dominated by a working class of women, many of them children and immigrants working in textile factories. Like spinning from the previous century, industrialized textile production allowed unmarried girls and women the ability to earn a small amount of pay. However, the conditions couldn‚Äôt be more different from those of home-spinners. Factory workers had to quickly learn patterns, identify fibers, and work with complicated, dangerous machinery, often for very low pay in poor conditions. When spinning and fabric-making moved from the hearth to the factory, the profits of women‚Äôs labor still accrued to the men who owned the companies and factories.¬†

Traditional modes of yarn-making and hand-spinning, like many complex skills developed largely by women, have been relegated to the craft and hobby realm. After the advent of machines and the rise of leisure activities, spinning was no longer a sign of a women‚Äôs knowledge, rather it indicated that she had ample free time to focus on crafting. While many still view spinning, knitting, and sewing as a novelty craft, some [women scientists](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/science/math-physics-knitting-matsumoto.html) are reevaluating the craft through the lens of science, showing that these skills are mathematically and technologically complex. Even though it shouldn‚Äôt take science to tell women what they‚Äôve known about this skill for centuries, it‚Äôs refreshing to see people take women‚Äôs work seriously as something much more than a frivolous pastime.¬†",True,False,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,7517,public,top,self,,,Spinster Science,0,[],0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/wgtow/comments/nzed25/spinster_science/,,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,

I‚Äôm fully aware men are only polite to me when they think I will have sex with them. Once I let them know I‚Äôm not interested, they become rude or hostile or uninterested in me as a person. The cycle continues and it‚Äôs exhausting. 

2) People naturally evolve, even if they are well meaning in the beginning. I listen to the way my mom talks about my dad, and she would have never thought he would‚Äôve turned into the person he is now. It‚Äôs like the escalation of commitment. She‚Äôs already given 35 years to this relationship and that‚Äôs feels like an accomplishment. Never mind having a healthy relationship. I don‚Äôt want to be my mother. 

3) I refuse to serve a man. I‚Äôm in the southern part of the US, so this is practically a social expectation. I‚Äôm not going to be anyone‚Äôs personal porn star, housekeeper, chef, bank account, nanny, etc. Just no. It honestly disturbs me that men genuinely expect all of this in a long term relationship. 

Okay, technically I could meet the ideal man who doesn‚Äôt apply to all of the above. But I also understand the odds of this happening is very low, and I‚Äôve accepted that.

However, I will admit this and I sound annoyed at myself but depe down it is ""Okay, what if I find the right guy, would I give him a chance"" I find myself mad thinking that, and I snap out of it *real* quick.

My whole life, I have been programmed into wanting a man or being married. My Mother also sternly pushed that I need a man, not want but *need* so deep down I still yearn for that validation from relationships. I really want to 100% break from this mindset. I know romantic relationships are intensely enforced and pushed onto women, and irs pretty much been brainwashed into from a young age, so it's no surprise that I find myself falling into the rabbit hole.

I‚Äôm temporarily living with my mom &amp; her long term boyfriend of about 12 years. I was in between apartment leases (the lease for my better &amp; more affordable apartment begins in September &amp; my old lease ended at the end of May). My mom encouraged me to move in with them for the summer to save some money. We enjoy each other‚Äôs company &amp; she LOVES spending time with her ‚Äúgranddoggy‚Äù (my almost three year old, 7 lb Yorkie) so I agreed. I was a little nervous about living with a straight guy as all of my straight male roommates have been shit. They‚Äôve all exhibited annoying or even dangerous behaviors like leaving the door unlocked, stealing my food, hitting on me, etc. My mom‚Äôs BF (let‚Äôs call him Sam) would never in a million years hit on me but he is a man so he doesn‚Äôt have great emotional intelligence. I agreed to live with them anyway because my mom said it would be fun for us to live together, and I could save money. She reminded me that I can always ignore Sam if I wanted to: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I do when I‚Äôm mad at him!‚Äù

Fast forward to yesterday. My mom is out of town for a few days. I found out that Sam gave my little Yorkie, Bijou, TWO cooked pork bones without asking me! In case you don‚Äôt know, pork bones are very dangerous for dogs &amp; can kill them. I spent the entirety of yesterday crying &amp; worrying about my baby. Sam didn‚Äôt apologize. He said he would ‚Äúcover it‚Äù if she needed to go to the vet &amp; he told me it would be okay but he never apologized. So typical for a man to never apologize, right?

I called the vet who said to feed her bland food &amp; take her for frequent walks to help any bone shards move through her little GI system. There‚Äôs a record-breaking heat wave in my state but of course we take frequent walks outside in the grass anyway so her paws don‚Äôt get burnt on the concrete. Luckily we‚Äôre staying near a park with a huge grassy area.

She‚Äôs been acting completely normally. I think we‚Äôre in the clear but of course I‚Äôm still worried about her. I had a dream last night that she died.

I usually do the dishes in the morning as I‚Äôm waiting for my coffee to cool off. It‚Äôs just a habit from living by myself. I didn‚Äôt do the dishes yesterday morning because I was too upset so Sam did them. He washed my pretty pink Starbucks mug that I really liked &amp; now there‚Äôs a hairline crack in it! Are you ducking serious? I really like my Starbucks mugs &amp; I collect them (yeah I‚Äôm basic, I don‚Äôt care). The one time a guy washes my mug he ruins it &amp; doesn‚Äôt even notice or tell me.

To top it all off, yesterday was my freaking Saturday. My plan for the day was to run errands then watch a movie. But I couldn‚Äôt leave my dog alone, especially not with Sam in the house. Also like I said it‚Äôs a heat wave &amp; Sam owns his own boat building business so he‚Äôs just ‚Äúworking‚Äù from home (aka playing video games) until the heat wave ends. So I‚Äôm trapped with this fool alone during my weekend. 

I could be mad at him but I‚Äôm just relieved that my dog seems to be okay. This is just a reminder that living with straight men is annoying at best but is usually dangerous for myself, my pet, and my belongings. I put myself in this situation. If I left my car unlocked &amp; my purse on the driver‚Äôs seat, I wouldn‚Äôt be mad at whoever stole it. I would be upset at myself for forgetting my purse &amp; forgetting to lock my car. This is just what happens when you live with men. Bad things happen when you live with them. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôve known them for over a decade. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre practically family. I won‚Äôt ever let myself forget that ever again.",True,False,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,7758,public,top,self,,,Living with a man temporarily is a great reminder of why I aspire to be WGTOW,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wgtow/comments/o7ajty/living_with_a_man_temporarily_is_a_great_reminder/,,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,

It\'s long so I have not given all the points! Some are:\n\n\n1) The arranged dating: Conservative families can fool themselves into thinking they are being modern by arranging dates for their daughters. One of my friend had this done for her. Being extremely beautiful, the first ""date"" she had, turned into a marriage offer. After the marriage was done and dusted, the husband became insecure about the very beauty he was attracted to in the first place. He beat her and forbade her to go out, even for dropping her children to the school bus or buying groceries. Everyday he would abuse her, saying that she wanted the attention of other men. They are still married as a divorce would ostracize her from her society. \n\n\n2) The work dates: Often the women from small towns come to big cities after landing a job. This opens up many avenues for them. They can meet and date men without having the restrictions of a small town or family member. Many friends of mine have gone through this method. One notable example: her new boyfriend lived with his roommate. They were good friends and she started becoming more comfortable with him. Turns out the boyfriend and roomate were family friends. She becomes even more comfortable and starts living with him even though shes paying rent for her own personal apartment. One day boyfriend comes home late, the roommate rapes her. When she tells the boyfriend, he begs her not to share it with anyone else as his (roomates) family will be very ashamed of him. He says he will do anything for her if only she doesn\'t share. She dumps him. She\'s now married to someone else. \n\n\n3) The tinder (other online ) dates: India\'s tinder will give you very few choices of good men (if at all tinder has them). The men in Indian tinder are desperate and exhilarated at the same time because they have finally found an app where the woman ""has to sleep with them as she\'s on tinder for one thing and one thing only"". Cases of stalking are common, as men feel any and all rejection of them is unsubstantiated. Personally, I have no friends who were severely sexually harassed but the news says otherwise. \n\n\n4) The trap dating: Women have very few things working for us in India. If we meet a man who just helps us out, there can be overwhelming feelings of gratitude. The men know that they can take advantage of this. So some of them will target financially or emotionally weaker women and overwhelm them with ""help and kindness"". Most cases, they are not being kind. After sleeping with them, they blackmail these women with a sexually explicit photo or videos of them. And if not this, then emotionally guilt-trip them to take more advantage. \n\n\n5) The high-ranking official: It is common knowledge that men in the position of power are attractive. They know that. They even know how far they can push. India values positions like IAS, IPS, collectors, etc. Families will encourage the daughters to dream big and study so that she can land a well placed IAS officer. That is fine. However the issue starts when the marriage talks begin. The families usually ask for more dowry than is normally asked. After marriage there are (unfortunately too many) cases of the wife\'s simply being killed off and the husband marrying again. Because of their high rank, no justice can touch them. \n\n\nThese are just a few points, but as its already long I will stop here. I know that ""not all men"" are the same.

And if not this, then emotionally guilt-trip them to take more advantage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) The high-ranking official: It is common knowledge that men in the position of power are attractive. They know that. They even know how far they can push. India values positions like IAS, IPS, collectors, etc. Families will encourage the daughters to dream big and study so that she can land a well placed IAS officer. That is fine. However the issue starts when the marriage talks begin. The families usually ask for more dowry than is normally asked. After marriage there are (unfortunately too many) cases of the wife&amp;#39;s simply being killed off and the husband marrying again. Because of their high rank, no justice can touch them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are just a few points, but as its already long I will stop here. I know that &amp;quot;not all men&amp;quot; are the same. There will be a few exceptions.

Since I am not dating (obviously, hence this sub) I have not had sex in a very long time. On top of that, as many others in this sub do, I find porn very misogynistic and difficult to watch so I cut that out a long time ago as well. The issue is, in all honestly sometimes I genuinely miss having these sexual outlets. Please don't judge me for this - while sex with pornsick men has mostly been awful, there were a handful of times I had a blast having sex with certain men. I was also unfortunate enough to have pornsickness as a woman when I was a teenager and didn't overcome it until a few years ago, so while I do not partake in watching it anymore, I still have urges sometimes. 

By no means am I trying to justify porn, I just have a conflicted feeling that I'm depriving myself by never having sex, watching any explicit videos and basically having so sexual entertainment outlet. I did just buy a new vibrator which I think will help a lot but I don't know I can say it will satisfy me completely with no stimulation. I hope this post isn't coming off as pro-porn because I absolutely am not. I just find having no real sex and watching zero porn very difficult after years of endless amounts of both. 

I hope someone gets what I'm saying and if you have suggestions please let me know. Once again, I hope this isn't coming off the wrong way.

i've tried googling and youtubing women going their own way, and surprisingly i didn't find many results. search results would autocorrect to MGTOW and man-dominated results. it's as if going your own way is only a man's thing... maybe for now it is male dominated, but i'm shocked to find so little about the woman's perspective of the matter.


for context, i want to go my own way because i found that marriage is not what i expected it to be. i thought marriage was the ultimate commitment of true love and companionship. But i see, that most people are more unhappy married than single. There are so many issues regarding lack of commitment, societal expectations of woman in marriages, issues of career vs. family priorities, etc. I only date to marry, but now that i'm rethinking the whole idea of marriage, i figure, why even date?


So, i'm looking for more resources on how i can reshape my beliefs and expectations about my future into prioritizing me, and not the idea of having a partner or kids. I want to learn more about the GYOW lifestyle from perspectives of only women! I'll take anything and everything.

Really appreciate it, especially considering how hard it is to build female-centred subs on Reddit!

Personally I am someone who is ambivalent about dating for a variety of reasons, but one of them is that I'd like to do some things in my life that I would struggle to do if I had to play the role of wife/mom. In the words of Cruella De Vil, ""More good women have been¬†lost to marriage...than to war, famine,¬†disease, and disaster."" What a line!!

What I want is to...

- reach a high status in my career. Lots of women do manage that while dating and having kids, but often their lives just become domestic work and career with nothing else. And many others don't manage it being held back by partners who don't pull their weight their whole lives. That's why being single can be a blessing!

- comission a statue or a mural of [Ruth Coker Burks](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/16/all-the-young-men-by-ruth-coker-burks-review-an-uplifting-memoir) (and hopefully other women I admire as well, providing I can amass enough money for it!)

- put out a heavy album!! I really want to write a feminist metalcore or hardcore album. I was listening to some old riot grrrl bands and I was struck by a sense of loss over the feminist consciousness raising we had in the past...I wish we could bring some of that energy back.

Thinking about my dreams and the progress I'm making towards them gives me a buzz inside. The first goal is simple, though not easy. If I continue as I am I should be able to make it even if there are setbacks. The statue/mural is something that will come with my career as well, hopefully I'll earn enough to comission it before Ruth passes away (she's 62 so I hope I still have some time).

The album tho...I'm making progress on my vocals but I still have to learn to play guitar, write melodies, lyrics, program drums/bass and mix! It's a hell of a lot of work! This one feels the most fantastical to me, like there's a slim chance I'll be able to pull it off. I'm not getting any younger and life will only get harder as I leave the student life behind. I am kinda disappointed in myself for not waking up and seizing the day earlier. But no use crying over split milk, I'll keep chipping away at it and maybe many years from now I'll have a work of my own.

It's suffocating because there's no freedom to do anything, you're never really an individual but a woman trapped in the web of complex societal expectations: wear this, do this, marry him, have kids and you execute all these commands because there really aren't many other options for you. You're a lady in reduced circumstances, so, you make the best of them and concede for your survival.

But women in the west, they have options. Or at least that's what we like to think. They're not trapped in the same sense - they can own property, have careers and be someone. But even these women are a victim of ''mind forged manacles'' - their bodies are free however, their minds are shackled. They're convinced that empowerment comes through 'attracting' the male gaze - being the cool kink loving girl, the girlfriend who pays for everything and dates men old enough to be their father. 

Being a gen z, it's kind of horrifying seeing the path my generation is going down, how are you expected to sustain healthy relationship with men who actively consume ''school girl'' ''barely legal'' and other degrading porn? instead of standing up against this, women like always concede and accept their reduced circumstances. Younger and Younger girls are lured into sex work to appeal to the male gaze while older women slowly fade into nothingness or pay thousands of dollars to hold onto their youth because they're aging but the girls in their husband's porn stash never do. So are we really free, even in the West?

We're not free because our minds are tied down. We glamourize our oppression and embrace it with full arms: spending our hard earned money on procedures to make us look beautiful, wearing make up for men and shaving for men (as for the ladies, who like to argue that they do make-up or shave for themselves, I seriously find it hard to believe this because unless, your make up and shavers are laced with MDMA, I don't see what there is to enjoy about all these laborious rituals - men complain when they have to shave their balls but women find it very enjoyable to pluck every single hair off their body -- strange). Also, the repercussions for not conforming to all these expectations are severe - unattractive women are alienated and shunned into conforming to these rituals for their own survival. So, would we ever be free? not in this life time -- you see patriarchy is build upon pillars of male solidarity, men protect each other and stick up for each other while collectively looking down on women, they love their masculine power meanwhile, there is no such thing as female solidarity, it is merely an illusion, women constantly compete and put down each other in order to get 'picked' and rewarded by men. Younger women readily replace older women without ever thinking that one day they will be consumed and turn old too.

*Sacha Tarkovsky advises women to not use the missionary position when having sex for the first time, stating, ""You are not in control, and it will be more painful and you cannot do anything but lay \[sic\] there and take it.*""

‚ÄúNot in control‚Äù

‚ÄúPainful‚Äù

‚ÄúLay there and take it‚Äù

When it comes to heterosexual sex, even being ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù doesn‚Äôt come without it‚Äôs consequences. This quote in general really strikes a cord, but more importantly, it really gets me thinking on the true nature of having sex with a man in general. Are you ever in control? Can it not be painful? When it comes to the act of heterosexual sex, ‚Äúlaying there and taking it‚Äù, seems to be a pretty good way to describe what exactly it‚Äôs like for women. The inner dynamic within heterosexual sex is that the person being ‚Äúpenetrated‚Äù automatically becomes ‚Äúinferior‚Äù and ‚Äúlesser than‚Äù, and just lays there and takes the aggression of the person who is penetrating without any real control or power over what happens to their body. Sure, it can be consensual, but at the same time, when you‚Äôre physically weaker your safety and power is not at all a guarantee. If that other person gets even a bit selfish, you can end up mentally and physically harmed. 

No matter what you do or how you act, regardless of whether your being the one that‚Äôs technically ‚Äúdominant‚Äù, regardless of how much you want it or not, as long as you‚Äôre inherently weaker and aren‚Äôt actively the one penetrating the other person, you‚Äôll always be seen as inherently ‚Äúinferior‚Äù. A penis, regardless of whether you‚Äôre submissive or on top or not, is the thing that acts as a weapon penetrating your own body and actively hurting you in some way and leaving you with inherently less power. ‚ÄúRape‚Äù in itself denotes to the act of active penetration without consent, because a penis or just an object similar to it being put inside another person (with or without consent), is much more of a ‚Äúweapon‚Äù and has much more of a harmful mental and physical affect which a vagina just doesn‚Äôt have. A vagina and being the one that penetrates the other person, you‚Äôre never truly just as much of a ‚Äúvictim‚Äù or just as much as the one that‚Äôs being harmed and dehumanized as the person that‚Äôs being penetrated. I know this is probably an unpopular opinion, and I realize that sexual assault is equally as dehumanizing, but mind you I‚Äôm not really talking about the act of rape, but more so the culture behind consensual sex itself and how that in itself can feel so dehumanizing. Even if this is a person you love and consent to having sex with, I just feel like this type of dynamic will always exist to an extent. 

The unwritten rule when it comes to heterosexual sex is that the person being penetrated get reduced to nothing but an object in the eyes of the man to degrade and that the woman just has to accept her role as being inherently ‚Äúsubmissive‚Äù and the importance of pleasing her man before even so much as prioritizing her own pleasure. ‚ÄúHaving sex‚Äù, as a woman is also seen as a must nowadays in our culture, especially due to the stupid ‚Äúsexual liberation movement‚Äù, in which women are blamed if they do, but also blamed if they don‚Äôt. Having to have sex, but not enjoy it. Having sex, but being sure not to actively seek it out as that makes you a ‚Äúslut‚Äù. 

Beyond that, There is nothing that‚Äôs ‚Äúempowering‚Äù about Sex that‚Äôs inherently associated with being seen as automatically as nothing but a series of sexual parts whereas the other person, whose stronger and has more power over you due to being the one penetrating, is the person who still gets to be fully human and actually enjoy this act of sex and be left feeling with a sense of pride after being able to use your body as a cumrag to increase his own ego whereas you‚Äôre just left with a feeling of shame.

‚ÄúShame‚Äù. It seems as though a lot majority of heterosexual sex relies on the feeling of shame first and foremost. You are *shamed* if you cannot‚Äîor do not wish to‚Äîperform in a way that is satisfactory for a man. First they attack your character‚Äîcalled cold, boring, prudist, immature, childish. Then comes the comparison between yourself and these proverbial ""other women"" who will contort themselves into all sorts of shapes in order to please a man that lets you know you are lesser than them, because obviously a woman that doesn‚Äôt know her ‚Äútrue place‚Äù in life will always be seen as ‚Äúlesser than‚Äù, even though that ‚Äúplace‚Äù in general is already seen as inferior.

I remember DJ Khaled going on a radio show talking about how he doesn't go down on his wife, but of course she goes down on him and to infer that it's an eye for an eye type thing would be stupid.

Can you imagine if a woman were to openly talk about her disdain and/or outright refusal to suck dick? The amount of backlash she'd face for even daring to say such a thing would be extreme.

I remember when a video popped up on my FYP of this girl (who looked to be a teenager) talking about how she thinks giving head is gross and she'd never do it. And in the comments you had hordes of women telling her that she'll end up liking it, and they felt the same way at first. A lot of the people in her comments were *adults* which is an issue in itself, but also more of an issue is that so many people see it as  **unfathomable for a woman to not want to fulfil a sexual act for a man, but** ***understandable*** **for a man to do the same.** People see men talking about not wanting to eat pussy as something *funny*, but as soon as a woman states she doesn't want to give head she's a prude, she's childish and she needs to get over herself, grit her teeth and just do it because, ""It makes him feel good "" and god forbid a man not have an orgasm‚Äîwhen women regularly go without having one at all‚Äìespecially one that has him seeing stars and hearing the heavens up above. Speaking of the ‚Äúorgasm‚Äù, one of the things that‚Äôs never talked about when it comes to the topic is the inherent ‚Äúorgasm gap‚Äù between the sexes and what it truly means in society as a whole. 

It seems as though the entire act of heterosexual sex is built around pleasing males first and foremost. It seems as though the entire worth that a woman has is built around being sexually desirable, being objectified, and pleasing males first and foremost. The male orgasm and putting dick on a pedestal is a common theme amongst our generation today, and The current trend of pegging and performing oral and digital sex on a man's anus and other gross things has really shun a light on this aspect. Anytime a woman is understandably grossed out or hesitant about something, they're met with a chorus of ""But his G-spot is up there!""

And this little phrase implies that a man would not enjoy sex otherwise unless you do something with his ass during the act and it's just not true. One of the few guarantees in life is a man's orgasm. It's very well known that men will fuck anything, including animals and inanimate objects, showing it clearly doesn't take much for them to climax. It seems as though women are the ones that have to put on a porn-star-esque performance and always look like a 10/10 sex doll ready to get fucked at all times to please a man, when we all know that men can go with even just a 2 second hand job. If anything, women are the ones with the complex biological makeup and anatomy, and YET, men refuse to learn what they like or dislike and just how to please her.

Truthfully, women, when it comes to facing what society and males see as their place in life and the only way they can even remotely have any worth ‚Äîwe all consciously know that we're worth more than a man's opinion, however we have gone through years worth of conditioning that has trained our minds to care about what they think of us. Our entire lives we're reared to seek out male approval. We're told that our value begins and ends with our beauty‚Äîthe vice that gives us access to male attention‚Äîhence why many women are instilled with the fear of aging, the process which is unanimously known to take away someone's beauty, and the subsequent attention of men.

What is a woman without a man? If you do not please men, if men do not want you, what place do you have? It's this relationship between shame and comparison that makes women feel as if we *have* to do these things. It's perverse, the way that society calculatedly breaks us down in order to make us conform. The conditioning and socialization along with society's general view of womanhood as a whole, can truly be a burden.

Truthfully, it‚Äôs hard to get rid of the conditioning as it‚Äôs due to a lot of factors mixed together that we have all been brainwashed into believing solely so we can all fall prey to the notion that heterosexual sex and a woman being sexual is inherently ‚Äúempowering‚Äù even though it‚Äôs not. ‚ÄúSex‚Äù feels like something separate, something foreign, something that always puts a certain amount of anxiety within my head and something that feels lie a significant hinderance to truly being able to embrace being in love and in a relationship due to the sheer nature of it. Due to the evolutionary aspect of it, the history of it, the views that people have on women‚Äôs bodies, the risk of it, everything about it just feels like something that can easily end a relationship as opposed to add to it. It seems as though no matter what I do, I‚Äôll always be objectified and reduced down to sexual aspects of myself. No matter how I act, what I wear, where I go, it feels like I‚Äôll always be plagued with the fact that so many people will see me as existing more as a sex object than a person regardless of how I want to be seen. There will always be people that can easily take advantage of me, and many that actively want to. Many that will continue to make crude comments, leer inappropriately, see me as inherently lesser due to my preconceived ‚Äúrole‚Äù within sex itself. The sheer lack of choice and control I feel in this matter triggers the living hell out of me. It makes me actively feel like less of a person even though I‚Äôm not, and it makes me want to take back at least some of the control that I desire to have. 

This desire to regain ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù and the act behind how women‚Äôs bodies are seen as objects for sex, is truly the reason why nowadays a lot of things that are derogatory for women are now being painted in a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù light. Things like sexually degrading yourself for male pleasure, sex work, wearing provocative clothing, hooking up aimlessly, etc. aren‚Äôt things that are inherently empowering for women, but the logic behind it is, ‚Äúif I'm going to be sexually degraded and harassed and seen as nothing but a sex object regardless of what I do, I might as well control the fact that I‚Äôm seen as a sex object and control how I‚Äôm sexualized‚Äù. If I‚Äôm dressing modestly and still being sexualized, that just feels like such a lack of respect over my own bodily autonomy and feels like a huge lack of control. However, if I‚Äôm dressing proactively and getting attention, I feel as though I‚Äôm in control and that I actively want to have sex and be degraded and therefore, not as much of a ‚Äúvictim‚Äù. 

This is not truly empowering, but in social reality, a lot of the time this is the only type of power women can truly have. As long as women are weaker than men and the ones being penetrated, they will never be able to truly have nearly as much power as men do, sexually and within various other aspects of life. People see men having sex as something to be proud of, and women having sex as something inherently degrading and something that makes her ‚Äúlose value‚Äù solely because they‚Äôre not the ones penetrating. People see the act of being penetrated as being inherently ‚Äúused‚Äù, which it kind of is. Add that with making it consensual, and it makes it seem like you‚Äôre allowing yourself to be purposely used, which is worse. A lot of women are shamed for enjoying sex and actively wanting it, and this can also explain the prevalence of rape fantasies amongst women. Since they are shamed for having sex, they then believe that inherently ‚Äúnot wanting it‚Äù, somehow makes it less shameful and less ‚Äúdegrading‚Äù. If you‚Äôre a victim, normal people won‚Äôt see you as a ‚Äúthot‚Äù or ‚Äúwhore‚Äù for the most part. Realistically tho, a lot of people don‚Äôt actively see the act of consensual heterosexual sex as the woman being an inherent ‚Äúvictim‚Äù either, so which them just leaves them to still have a unfavorable view towards it, not for the reason I listed, but mostly due to old-fashioned misogyny and the inherent ‚Äúsuperiority‚Äù that males have when it comes to sex solely for being born with a penis.

Rape fantasies, anal sex, rough head, BSDM‚Äî Many women find submitting to or being dominated by men‚Äîsometimes forcefully‚Äî arousing and I think it links back to the our conditioning for seeking out male approval. The act of submitting and submissive behavior is often intertwined with femininity, and to engage in sexual acts where you submit to a man can be very affirming in terms of your feminine identity. When you're used to receiving a certain type of attention from someone, even if it's negative, that attention can almost feel like love, especially when you go through long periods where they ignore you.

When violence is the only way this person communicates with you emotionally it warps your perception of what genuine love and care is like. And I think so many women are used to seeing men be violent and interact with women in a violent or aggressive way that we classify that as a man really caring about you or being into you‚ÄîYou know, having a violent dad or an overprotective older brother ect. Having a boyfriend that is rough with you or is threatening to kill you or himself if you leave, etc. So when you're in a situation where a man is fucking your face to point that you're throwing up on yourself, in a sick way, it feels like a sign that he really loves you. Just look at the language women use when they're having sex with their partner, they'll often call them ""daddy"". It's very interesting to see how the lines between sex, violence and love are so blurred. It's hard to differentiate one from the other and for a lot of women all of these things are one in the same.

Also, when your own body feels like something to use and reduced down to nothing and no other purpose other than how it can be used to please males and just to please others alone, it can truly make one feel a deep sense of shame and disconnect over various feminine features and make you genuinely feel like that‚Äôs the best way to live. It feels worthless to fight against it, but you also come to the harrowing conclusion that it also doesn‚Äôt work at the same time, so the logic is; why not embrace it? And even more so, why not try to disguise it as ‚Äúpower‚Äù? Sexual liberation and the idea and logic behind it, is just more sad than anything. It‚Äôs a cope at the end of the day.

Being sexualized and growing up to have feminine parts, is way inherently different than men growing up to be big and strong. Bodily changes are parts of growing up, but the inherent view of ‚Äúbecoming a man‚Äù vs ‚Äúbecoming a woman‚Äù are two different things. ‚ÄúBecoming a man‚Äù, or just the notion of how society views it, is seen as gaining power, humanity, maturity, independence, and actively doing things and creating something, and being strong, a provider, and being seen as ‚Äúsomebody‚Äù. It includes bodily changes and puberty, yes, but it‚Äôs far from being reduced down to just that. People do not see a man for his body nor do they reduce him and his worth and his identity down to it. People see ‚Äúhuman‚Äù before they see ‚Äúmale‚Äù, and being a man is seen as the default gender of the world. 

‚ÄúWomanhood‚Äù and how society and people view it however, is completely different. To be a woman, it feels like you can never truly have the ‚Äúpower‚Äù when it comes to being an adult. You get excited to grow up because you think you can be all independent and powerful and strong, but when you actually get to the point, you realize that that‚Äôs not the case at all. You grow up and realize that you are still weak, you‚Äôre still inherently treated like a child, and more importantly you are burdened by even more fears due to the body you have now. You used to be able to go around the world without care, but now you have the possibility of getting pregnant after a rape, getting pregnant in general, extra possibility of getting murdered and not being able to defend yourself, getting harassed, assaulted, looked at inappropriately, cat-called, discriminated and having to face a shit ton of sexism and misogyny, have to deal with never truly being able to be seen as equal in a relationship, and realize just the sheer consequences that having a female body can bring. The majority of women‚Äôs problems are internal and related to their own bodies and beings, such as period, pregnancy, and just having to have the female sex alone and all the challenges that come with that. Therefore, when this aspect is realized, you start to hyper-focus on your own body in its entirety because you realize just how much of your life is tied down and restricted and controlled due to that aspect. Unlike men, freedom, power, security, and control is not a given once you‚Äôre an adult if you‚Äôre born in a female body. Things like plastic surgery, eating disorders, self harm, etc. and things that are internalized forms of coping mechanisms that involve the body in some way shape or form are very common for women as a whole. It‚Äôs hard for women to truly accept their bodies due to the sheer amount of politics behind it.

When it comes to the act of ‚Äúbecoming a woman‚Äù, people see it as the transition from a child to a disposable sexual object to be used by men first and foremost. This does not give women power, because sexual development is more often than not a lack of power for women solely due to the dynamics of heterosexual sex itself. This is the time where society reduces you down to your body, sexual desirability, child-bearing abilities, and there are tons of more consequences to suddenly being seen as a sexual being as a woman. 

As a woman, no matter what you do, you don‚Äôt really have a choice in whether or not you‚Äôre sexual or even seen as sexual. Wear clothing and hide every aspect of yourself, you can still be seen as inherently sexualized even though you don‚Äôt want to. Men can have this choice, and even if men are seen as inherently sexual beings, they aren‚Äôt harassed and degraded and objectified and reduced down to their bodies as much as women. They don‚Äôt have to deal with the sheer crudeness and invasiveness of the male sexuality and the male gaze that ruins almost everything in sight. Why do you think straight men feel so uncomfortable around gay men? It‚Äôs because they realize the sheer disgusting nature of male sexuality and don‚Äôt want it to be directed towards them. What‚Äôs even worse is that as women‚Äôs body parts continue to go in an out of style, certain body types are sexualized even more to te point where women either strive to fit a certain ideal, or harm themselves in order to get rid of any bit of flesh that resembles what men see as usable sex objects because they don‚Äôt want to have to deal with the trauma. Being sexual as a man is something that can give you power and inherently more value, but it‚Äôs not the same way with women.

Oh and let us not forget just the way men act with their own daughters and how entitled they feel to their girl‚Äôs bodies whilst simultaneously being the ones that first end up sexualizing their own daughters in their heads. Mothers don‚Äôt withdraw from hugging their sons solely due to them starting to shave, unlike fathers who hardly ever interacted with their daughters after they grew breasts . Obviously people can‚Äôt run around naked forever, and being more mindful of physical affection along with just growing out of affection due to getting older is pretty normal, but withdrawing from having a relationship with your own daughter altogether and feeling uncomfortable with any sort of physical touch solely due to bodily changes they had no control over is pretty damn gross. Especially when you take into account that fathers can‚Äôt help but see their own daughters in an inherently more sexual way in their heads, and equate just being a sexual being to being an inherently sexualized object in their minds. They write comments such as ‚Äúthis is why I don‚Äôt want a daughter‚Äù under any TikTok video of a girl wearing even semi-revealing clothing, they see their daughters growing up and their bodies changing as ‚Äúuncomfortable truths‚Äù because they realize that they can‚Äôt help but see them in more ‚Äúsexualized‚Äù and ‚Äúobjectified‚Äù ways and don‚Äôt even feel comfortable enough to see them as just adults who will eventually have sex without equating it with reducing them down to just a series of body parts like they do with all women. They themselves view their sons having sex as a good thing, whereas their daughters doing so as inherently degrading. It‚Äôs not a matter of their daughters growing up, it‚Äôs the way sex is set up along with male sexuality that makes them view their girls‚Äô bodies in an uncomfortable and overly-sexual light. Depending on the girl, sometimes if they are skinny without too much development, their fathers will be way more comfortable interacting with them as opposed to a girl with bigger breasts, which proves this point even more. It‚Äôs not just about simply growing apart, it‚Äôs about the way certain body parts dictate how a woman is treated and how males feel about them to such a gross extent. The inherent unfairness of the situation honestly makes me feel bad for many women. So many girls suffer from eating disorders to get rid of their feminine features solely due to how inherently uncomfortable and traumatic existing in such a body can be

Girls feel such a lack of power and choice, that being sexualized and seen as more inherently sexual by men in particular before they are ready, can have drastic consequences on their mental health. Just the nature of male attraction, sex, their bodies, and society‚Äôs views on womanhood alone can be especially dysphoria-inducing. Puberty is the time when most of the horrific shit of being a woman comes into light to a disturbing extent. 

Womanhood, unlike the concept of ‚Äúmanhood‚Äù ,which people see as having a wide range of ways a man can be successful, a woman‚Äôs concept of success is seen as sexual desirability, marriage, and children. It‚Äôs being inherently inferior and submissive to a man, which mimics the role of a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù during sex. It‚Äôs to be grateful and ‚Äúaccept '' what's given to you, as opposed to striving for power and freedom within life. It‚Äôs not about chasing your dreams and making a name for yourself and living life on your own terms either, but often reducing yourself down and defining yourself in relation to others as opposed to being independent. Men are people and individuals, whereas women are ‚Äúwives, daughters, sisters, aunts, etc.‚Äù. In order to survive in the world and even so much as to enjoy sex or to be in a relationship, women often feel the need to mold themselves and adapt to male ideals in order to do so. This aspect of women shows in social reality and the world as we know it.

Femininity as a whole, is still very associated with ‚Äúsubmission‚Äù more importantly first and foremost due to just how sex itself is set up. 

As a woman, to participate in het sex she has to mentally break herself.

Ask a woman why does she love to have het sex and she would give you one of these answers:

(1)That she loves the feeling of closeness, she loves being hugged and kissed, she loves when a man caresses her body, she loves the intimacy, the feeling of fullness (yikes), she loves the ‚Äúmutual‚Äù vulnerability, she loves giving pleasure to her man, she loves to know that she‚Äôs the reason of his orgasm, that she loves to make him feel good, she loves how vulnerable her man is when she sucks his dick because at that moment she‚Äôs the one in control and her man trusts her that she won‚Äôt hurt his sensitive organ with her teeth, that at that moment she‚Äôs a queen with a dick in her mouth, that she doesn‚Äôt care that she‚Äôs never had an orgasm in her life as long as her man is happy, that anal sex is the extension of trust and closeness, and it‚Äôs a bonding experience, that male pleasure turns her on in her head, that being at the absolute mercy of a male is not terrifying but thrilling, and that she loooooooves being vulnerable.

(2)That she‚Äôs a slut and she enjoys being degraded.

Ask a man why does he love to have het sex, and after looking at you as if you were completely nuts, he would give you one of these answers:

(1)He just LOVES TO FUCK.

(2)He loves to degrade ‚Äúbitches‚Äù. And he LOVES TO FUCK.

See, for women it is all about giving, and for men is all about taking and having.

Woman is an accessory to man, there to fulfill his needs, his fantasies, support him in reaching his potential, serve him at home, birth and raise his children. Nothing has really changed. ""Sexual liberation"" = the freedom to be sex object. If feminism really wanted to dismantle gender roles, the entire hetero sex dynamic should've been deconstructed and thrown away, instead it remained the same. The definition of what sexually liberated woman is is indistinguishable from male porno fantasies. We are told that what women choose, what they want and what makes them feel confident and free is to mold themselves into perfect fucktoys for random men. Maybe it's true for some, even most women. But those of us who don't share that fantasy become basically unwoman by default, because there is no other way to be feminine. That isn't true freedom of choice, it's more like ""if you don't like the rules of the game, you need to quit playing entirely"". If you don't want to be submissive sex doll, you need to stop fucking men. Period. There is no escaping that dynamic. Even so-called femdom have that same dynamic just dressed up differently. It's depressing and means denying your natural sexual instincts entirely (unless you are bi and can stick to women), but the only other option is to submit to sex that is humiliating, unfulfilling and ultimately will do psychological damage. It‚Äôs all just another way to reduce women down to how they can sexually please males and males fulfilling their selfish one-sided fantasies.

The only thing that makes heterosexual sex enjoyable to women are their submissive and masochistic tendencies. Hence why so many things such as rape kinks and BDSM and rough sex are on the path to be normalized by women themselves. Just read any discussion about women's trouble in having orgasm, and you see endless reassurances from women that orgasm doesn't matter. It's impossible to imagine a man saying the same thing: ""Sure, I've never cum from sex but I still like it, it feels good and I like giving my partner pleasure"". Absolutely impossible to even picture this happening.

This is such an obvious example of evolutionary biology and how our sexual traits are complimentary in the shittiest way. If women weren't wired to be submissive and masochist, we would simply never willingly have sex with a man, because there are so little chances of being satisfied and such huge risks. But ""luckily"" women are wired to be pleasers, who get enjoyment and fulfillment from giving pleasure without getting anything back. Being used as a sex toy is perfectly fine for most women. Similarly, women enjoy being sex objects who are ogled by the man, but don't have that kind of physical attraction to men. It's only women who have sexy lingerie and who give lap-dances and focus during sex on what she looks like, what she sounds like etc.

Men have complimentary tastes: they want to use women selfishly, they want to objectify but not be in the vulnerable position as an object to be judged, they see fucking a woman as conquest, dominance, and ""defiling"" her, they are universally sadistic to some degree. Men are OBSESSED with anal precisely because they know it's painful and the woman doesn't enjoy it - that's what makes it so much better than PiV. And eating pussy is humiliating because it's submission, it's giving pleasure without getting it which is unacceptable for most men.

Just the view of women alone also continue to tie into how I feel about the culture of being an adult and having sex in of itself. So much of adulthood and milestone within adult life is tied into sex as a whole. Referring to people just by their genitals;Like when men are bragging about getting ""*p\*ssy*"". These people are so deep into sex culture that they don't even realize that it's dehumanizing and that they have reduced themselves to their genitals. That along with the culture of ignoring all the possible side effects such as STD‚Äôs or unwanted pregnancies and possibly getting murdered during a hookup, etc. Heterosexual sex in general is not at all centered around what women want and what they enjoy, and also for women, sex has the ability to have a variety of other consequences. And especially when even ‚Äúnormal‚Äù acts of sex has the ability to have a sur\[rising amount of consequences.

As I mentioned, ‚ÄúVanilla‚Äù sex has it‚Äôs own issues, But these new sexual acts that are being forced on women (anal sex of all forms, golden shower fetish, elements of BDSM, not just giving head but giving head where you can't breathe, are throwing up on yourself, ending up with a busted lip, etc.) are not only unpleasant but come with serious health risks‚Äî

* Anal sex‚Äîcan expose its participants to two principal dangers: **infections due to the high number of infectious microorganisms not found elsewhere on the body**, and physical damage to the anus and rectum due to their fragility.\[14\]\[16\] Unprotected penile-anal penetration, colloquially known as barebacking,\[74\] carries a higher risk of passing on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) because the anal sphincter is a delicate, easily torn tissue that can provide an entry for pathogens.**A condom can break or otherwise come off during anal sex, and this is more likely to happen with anal sex than with other sex acts because of the tightness of the anal sphincters during friction.\[16\]** **Unprotected receptive anal sex (with an HIV positive partner) is the sex act most likely to result in HIV transmission.**
* Oral sex involving the anus‚Äî**Anilingus has potential health risks arising from the oral contact with human feces**. Diseases which may be transmitted by contact with feces include: bacterial diseases including shigellosis (bacillary dysentery); viral systemic diseases including hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, poliomyelitis, human papillomavirus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus; parasites including intestinal parasites; and infections and inflammations chlamydia infection, gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, gonorrhea, lymphogranuloma venereum\[12\] and other sexually transmitted infections. Another recent study suggests **a correlation between oral sex and throat cancer**. It is believed that this is **due to the transmission of HPV** because this virus has been implicated in most cervical cancers.
* Fellatio ‚Äî""Links have been reported between oral sex and oral cancer with HPV-infected people.\[31\] A 2005 research study suggested that performing unprotected oral sex on a person infected with HPV might increase the risk of oral cancer. The study found that 36 percent of the cancer patients had HPV compared to only 1 percent of the healthy control group. A 2007 study suggested a correlation between oral sex and throat cancer. **The study concludes that people who had one to five oral sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity and those with more than five oral sex partners had a 250 percent increased risk.""**
* Facials‚Äî""Any sexual activity that involves contact with the bodily fluids of another person contains the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs). **Semen can be the vehicle for many sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and hepatitis. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration categorizes semen as ""other potentially infectious material"" or OPIM""**.

Realistically, when I weigh all these options and consequences of the act of heterosexual sex alone, I begin to wonder‚Ä¶? Is it really worth it? Because from the sheer reality of it, everything about it just seems so not worth it. Knowing these facts about reality makes it very easy to continue going my own way, is all I have left to say on the matter.",True,False,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,7826,public,top,self,,,Heterosexual sex is cucked,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wgtow/comments/ojvkhn/heterosexual_sex_is_cucked/,,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,

 It's not that those things don't bring any pleasure, but that pleasure is temporary and the negative affects (i.e drama, lack of peace, pain etc) outweighs the benefits. I feel this way about my relationships with guys in general, that whatever temporary feeling of joy I get is overshadowed by the loneliness, lack of empathy, compassion and misogny I experience. I've since chosen to be celibate. But it's hard, because I have a lot of pain and anger. I know part of healing is grieving, feeling the pain but I wish it can come sooner.

I was working home and didn't go out in almost a year so really needed the socialization. Also I am in Europe and my country is extremely safe so I wouldn't say it is dangerous here to stsy in hostel but I am not sure the same can be said about other countries. 

I met some amazing people, most were girls and a few men. From what I observed, a lot of men who lead the hostel/travelling lifestyle only like to party, do drugs and look for hookups with hot women. The most interesting men were already grandads so that tells you something (I couldn't feel any sexual attraction, they were just interesting as people). From young guys in my age range I only liked two honestly, and guys do tend to be the majority in those places. Most of them just try to get the number/instagram/facebook of all the girls they can chat with. I met one who was so pushy, no surprise he has some arab or indian ancestry. 

I met a catholic girl who was friends with atheists and was super nice, yet had two of those so called super progressive men who like to do drugs saying that people who don't do it are boring and are missing out on life. So apparently it seems in these circles the ""progressives"" are more prejudiced than religious people. Also its usually guys who are obsessed with drinking, weed and hashish. 

On one place I stayed there was a girl who had a big personality, one of those that doesn't tolerate BS. There was also another girl who was one of those conventionally hot blondes and another one who was 20 and oh boy she absolutely needed male validation. She tried to please and be nice to all men. 

I had a crush with one of the guys from this place last year (before I even knew about wgtow concept), invited him out and he turned me down, said he was busy. I decided to come back this year to the same place despite this because I liked it, I had met great people there last year. This year the owners of the place were also there helping him out and they had volunteer girls (amazing girls too). The owners I did not like at all, they are from my country and I could sense some of the typical macho BS you find in guys here. The guy who I had a crush on seemed different (different country), absolutely loves the owners, he works there for free basically and is friends with them. 

Anyway in one instance all the owners and this guy were flirting with the blonde girl I mentioned. It was late so the owners said they'd close the garden to avoid noise but when I was going to bed I saw them come down to have drinks with this girl. So other people couldn't stay but they could. They also laughed at the girl who I mentioned had a big personality because she said she washed their clothes that were in the washing machine because she wanted to use it (which was their job to wash the stuff they had on the machine and since they didn't do it, she did it herself). This girl was on the obese side so I could sense they sort of despised her. Btw she was obese because she had cancer recently and her chemo drugs made her gain weight, before of that she was skinny.

I didn't like the blonde girl I thought she was too stood up so next day I chatted with her to see if I was right. Turns out she is super smart, even works in the IT field, has opinions about political issues, has had previous experiences with abusive relationship, she was great. I felt bad that I had felt jealous or envious of her the previous day. And for what? Clearly even if she dates on of those guys including my former crush, she is not gaining a lot. Guys who spend all the time drinking, smoking and who'll flirt with the newest hot woman that arrives. I don't even know what I was thinking when I had this crush, I guess I often think men are more complex and have deeper emotions then they actually are. Most of the times they are just basic sad creatures who just want sex and no commitement. 

I met three other girls who were super beautiful and stylish. They had the sweetest personality ever, I went on day trips and kept in touch with two of them.

I guess the bottom line here is often women envy each other because they see other women as competition or as a threat. This is all a patriarchal construct. I wish I could erase this flaw from my personality of comparing myself to other women and sometimes feeling jealous if they are prettier than me.

I was born and raised in the city, with a lot of people around me. I was born to two immigrant parents whose only focus was to make a living and keep up with social status. 

Growing up, I was constantly told by my peers that I was annoying and ugly, especially this one girl who I thought was my main friend, a sister one would say. She was a year older than me and we met because she was my neighbor. Subconsciously I let her words get to me and I've been realizing this as I allow myself to heal and conquer my present and future. 

I was molested from ages 8-13, from boys on the block who were all friends with each other, these guys also knew my parents very well. Most of these guys were my friends' brothers. I was the only girl on the block who didn't have a brother, I guess I was an easy target for them. They were all older than me and I hate to say this, but I believe I allowed these events to occur because inside, I always felt annoying and ugly, and this type of attention felt good. 

I remember in 7th grade I met a girl who I thought was a good friend because to my mind, she kept it raw and real. She told me and my other friends only ugly girls give head, this made me feel even worse. From birth to 7th grade, I dressed very non-binary because my parents were into the whole ""modesty is the right way"" kind of thing. Funny how the clothes I wore didn't matter, I was still sexualized. 

The same friend from 7th grade persuaded me to dress in tighter and brighter clothes because everyone was saying I was gay behind my back, she wanted me to look prettier (not sure why but I became her personal project). I remember going to the department store with my mom after my dentist appointment and fighting with her to let me buy some girlier/ ""sluttier"" clothes (no slut shaming here). 

I got a boyfriend by 8th grade, a real one (haha) and he was the most feminine dude I ever came across in my life to this day. Getting a boyfriend was my only goal because it made me feel less ugly and more accepted by school members and society (wtf). Also, everyone else had a boyfriend. 

Because of him, EYE stopped all the molesting and sexual abuse from the members on my block, I didn't even realize I could walk away from all this (not saying every women has this choice). I walked away because I wanted to be a loyal gf. And I was so fucking happy to have a boyfriend, it didn't matter who it was. 

He never touched me sexually without asking, he grew up in a great environment. He was very very different from the guys I grew up with. I think I was over sexual with him so I could make him stay for sure. Thinking retrospectively, I think I may have scared him at times. 

We broke up as young kids do, he wasn't full-filling my needs, lol. And then I fell in love with my girl best friend in highschool when I was 14. She was smart, kind, and intuitive.

Things were up and down with her as she kept jumping back and forth with accepting that she loved me in the same way too, to, she only loved me in a best friend kind of way. This went on til I was 24. We graduated highschool, went to different colleges, dated different people, and somehow moved back home from college and drifted back to each other. Again, began the on and off friendship/ relationship. I ended all this about 2 years ago when she, for the umpteenth time, told me she only loves me as a best friend. 

She's now engaged to a man and I have no idea how, but this shouldn't be my concern.

Throughout all this, I had another childhood best friend who was hypersexual due to her environment, kind of like me, and met many many guys in her lifetime. When we got older, we shared stories about how men treat women and essentially, how men have treated her. She's had 70+ sexual partners and she's only ever been satisfied by 1, turns out he's gay. 

With us talking about our experiences, mostly hers, I realize that most men are like the guys from my childhood, she confirms and validates this for me. A lot of those guys from my younger years are married with children, and nobody in their families will ever know what they've done with how ever many young girls. It wasn't only me. 

All the girls I've dated think that great men exist and I'm putting men in a box because of the way I've been treated. No. In fact, I've developed ""man brain"" and this means I know how guys think when they say or do something, I know the intent. I'm fully aware. I'm glad the girls that I've dated don't have this negative outlook on men but what's weird is, they've experienced some of what I've experienced. Most women I know have been sexually assaulted. 

I've constantly questioned if I'm queer by nature vs nurture, I'm still trying to figure it out. I tried to become friends with men, but it seems like no matter how gay I am on the outside, and tell every man, they still want something sexual out of the friendship. A lot of men say they'd like to marry me (why?!). I'm sick and tired of being perceived by men, I can't even have a genuine male friendship. Whether it's at work or somewhere else. I feel crazy for having this outlook on life, and I wonder, how come nobody else sees it the way I do?",True,False,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,7872,public,top,nsfw,,,Reasons why I've joined WGTOW,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wgtow/comments/os1hph/reasons_why_ive_joined_wgtow/,,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,False

It was so fun holding and playing with them however; so I thought I would just enjoy them until they died and I wouldn't buy anymore. 

Then a few weeks later my boss told me that her stepson was giving away a ball python because he was afraid to feed it after it had bitten him. I told her that I would take it in. When it came I was shocked to see the conditions the snake was in. The cage was dirty, it looked underfed, and it had stuck shed that was peeling off. Once I soaked the shed off, I fed it one of my rats. I felt terrible doing it, because I planned on keeping them as pets, but the snake looked like it hadn't eaten in months. Because the rat cage took up most of my apartment and I knew the ball python was going to get big, I decided it was best to put the remaining rats down so I can feed the snake.

I don‚Äôt come from a open  family and didn‚Äôt learn about sex until i was much older. All i learned was that it was something painful for girls and pleasurable for boys. Men always pestered me for it while dating and it seemed to me not to be all that most of the time.

A few years ago I met a man who contributed to my searching for answers online which at first led me to here, then i stumbled upon different forums. I read about so many shared experiences with women everywhere and finally felt i wasn‚Äôt crazy.

The man i dated was incredibly charming, handsome, charismatic and had a very flirty and likable personality. At first everything was going well, until the honeymoon phase was over. I had a whole loving relationship with this man but the small things added up and eventually i found out the truth. It turned out he was Narcissistic  Borderline personality and a liar.  He was bisexual(he never told me), a drug habit and had a daughter he left in the care of his mother and all while he was still having relations with men. Oh and his daughters mother? Was the result of his relationship with a married women-a women married to a Soldier. I asked him about his testing status and paperwork and he told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm clean‚Äù but i couldn‚Äôt trust him anymore.

I was so scared and went to get checked, the only thing i got from him was herpes and that was manageable thank God. Ever since then i swore myself to celibacy.

Only recently did i take the plunge and buy myself some sex toys. My religious upbringing made me think such things are for whores but it took some serious reevaluating to help me get past that mental block.

Things have been better since and I‚Äôm not as interested in relationships with men as before. It‚Äôs been liberating to be able to enjoy my own body and feel less shame.

LOL that's fucking **common sense**. ü§£  Why does that make someone smart if they don't rush into relationships wo vetting or weighing the good and the bad.  
I love cats but if I was allergic to them, I would restrain myself from having one in my apartment.   
The narrative around romance &amp; realtionships is that all common sense should  be thrown out of the window as soon as you get the so-called ""butterflies"".   
It reminds me of that CK Louis sketch, even though this dude is a perv and a douchebag, he laid it down perfectly in one of his sketches, when he said men are the number1 threat to women's safety. And that the propagation of the human species depends on us playing russian roulette with our lives.
