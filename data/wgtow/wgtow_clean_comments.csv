Combine it with the years of being raised by a man much like him, and a mother that agreed and went a long with all of it. Religion, tradition, mental and verbal abuse, gaslighting- all of you know the drill. It makes it very hard to be a WGTOW and liberated. We second guess ourselves, and yes sometimes security does come in the form of an abusive status quo you had no idea had been so deeply ingrained, and in some sense you love and worship it.

Machiavelli wrote that when a Prince takes power, if he needs to kill someone, said Prince should better organize the full bloodshed at once, and then be peaceful and kind. That this would make people hate him less and would create a better impression of him overall in time than needing to attack or kill or imprison enemies regularly during the years. Son of a bitch that he was, because people are stupid, he was right.  


You can be annoyed a 100 times because you want to be polite, and people will keep pushing on you. Be burning hell furious once, and they will remember.  


In short: write what you want to say to your mother until you have clear ideas yourself. Memorize it. Next time she tries to pressure you, you stop her, firmly but politely. If she tries again, you go ballistic, get furious and, in a firm voice but without screaming, explain in the bitchiest way possible why you are NOT going to do what she wants of you, and why if she wants a marriage, partner or kids, she is going to have to do all that herself.

265,"Read **The Intelligent Investor** by Benjamin Graham.

Do not, do NOT, by ANY means, in no way, shape or form, touch the stock market without having read that book, all 600-700 pages, and having UNDERSTOOD it. I am going to give you the shortest possible summary: ""a share has a *value* and a *price*. The value is what it's really worth due to the company's worth. The price is what it sells for. Buy shares when the price is lower than their value. Sell when the value is higher than the price"". The rest of the book is learning to do this.

Do NOT, by any means, no way, never, ride on other people's brains or accept advice from someone else. Do not use ""copy"" systems in traders. And DO NOT, EVER, BY ANY REASON, FOLLOW ANY FASHION, TREND OR HYPE that you see in TV and mass media. N-E-V-E-R.

And the most important rules (though they appear in the book):

1. **Do not** invest money you might need (NEVER invest all of your savings).
2. Be ready for the EMOTIONAL part of investing. Your shares WILL go down, and you must not be scared and sell. They will also go up, you might sell at a great profit... and then find out they are worth even more. If you are not able to deal with this emotional rollercoaster, then do not get into it. The main reason why you should not put all your savings on investments is because if you actually need that money, the fear when the shares go down will kill you. Or, for example, I bought Tesla at 150-200 and within the range, and sold at 400. It went up to 850 (and more, because of a 5:1 split) after that. But I have to think my decision was sound: I still think the company was overpriced at 400, and I paid my mortgage with the profits. I did the right thing. You will NEVER be the person who buys lowest or sells highest, so learn to deal with that. If you cannot deal with that, do not touch the stock market with a ten foot pole.
3. As Warren Buffet said: ""If you wouldn't have them ten years, don't have them ten minutes"". Which can be summarized better in...
4. **Do not speculate. Invest.** Learn the difference. If you do not know what the difference is, stay away from the stock market, buy real state instead.",Waitwhatwhich,2021-04-07 02:11:22,2021-04-07 02:51:43,/r/wgtow/comments/mk25un/what_are_your_practical_life_rules_for_women/gtn61vc/,t1_gtdurax,wgtow,1,0,2021-04-07 02:51:43

I have so much fun on my own, I don’t like people in my space, I don’t like feeling accountable for someone else because if I become their girlfriend all of a sudden I have to fill this “role” that isn’t who I am. Ex kept saying “you don’t act like my girl. You keep trying to haze me like an older brother ” I’m supposed act like some cheerleader who’s super girlish, emotional and attached to him. It’s just not me, again maybe I just haven’t found the one, but yeah. I used to feel bad about it, but that’s who I am, I’m an adventurous, independent and goofy person.. 

In all fairness though I felt like I was only in a relationship because I’m tired of people making me feel weird and asking “where’s your boyfriend?” Not because I actually wanted to be in a relationship with any of the guys, I’ve yet to meet anyone that I’m like “wow, I want to be in a relationship with you”. I mostly did it to get people off my back, and to have someone in my corner looking out for my interests and defending me. 

People have a tendency to see people who are alone as easy targets especially if you’re a woman. I lived with a woman who’s boyfriend basically attacked me if he even thought I looked at his girl sideways, just causing so much issues — his girl was very passive aggressive (long story) but he was aggressive. (We were ‘friends’ so it was weird) I didn’t feel safe so I rushed it with my ex so I could feel like someone was on my side and just running away from a home where I did not feel safe. I wasn’t doing it for an emotional connection.",PiscesPoet,2021-04-29 00:42:49,2021-04-29 07:21:53,/r/wgtow/comments/mztpge/forever_spaghetti_girl/gw8odti/,t1_gw8f59l,wgtow,1,0,2021-04-29 07:21:53

406,"The movie wasn't what I expected or what I wanted, but was still really good nonetheless. It seems to have been directly written in response to the hand-ringing done after #metoo - I thought making a point to distinguish revenge from justice was really poignant and definitely my favorite part of the movie. If women wanted revenge for what has been done to us, it would be so much worse. People should be glad victims are willing to settle just for justice. 

Women are fighting back, as we speak. We have been for centuries. It's pretty offensive to the decades and decades of feminists who directly fought for our current lifestyle to imply that they *didn't* fight back.

Women have always been fighting back.

My point is, at this point it's a cultural thing, not legal.

442,"You don't need to listen to my advice, since it plays a bit of devil's advocate. 

I'm (24F) a full-time math and CS student, Calculus TA, research assistant, and also have a full-time job in network security. I've recently received a substantial pay raise at work. Academically, I'm currently tackling an open problem in mathematics with major breakthroughs. I sold my start up when I was 17 and made a bunch of money. If I wanted to, I'd easily be able to retire before 30. So, you should listen to what I have to say if you want to be extremely financially successful. My advice will likely be, at the very least, monetarily valuable. 

Mostly, I've found social networking in professions like ours to be unavoidable. (i.e LinkedIn profiles are the best way to get recruited and the connections you form will help get you up the ladder). As the saying goes: it's about who you know, not about what you know. Everyone you're competing against also has a degree and a portfolio, but the best jobs in this industry go to the ones with the best connections. Good connections also guarantee job security. I have recruiters who still contact me.

I've built many wonderful professional relationships with men. You can Go Your Own Way without limiting yourself or closing professional doors. I've been invited to everything from talks, lectures, casual coffees, and contracted for private projects. Due to a combination of academic skill and a high degree of personability, numerous Professors have requested me to TA their classes or do research with them every semester. 

That's not to say my time and emotional energy is free. You choose your availability on your own time. Outside of class, students literally venmo me for my advice on personal projects or help on problem sets. One guy was so grateful, he even acknowledged me along with his family in an academic paper. Usually, if I become quiet while trying to figure something out, they'll talk about their personal life as well. I always *seem* readily available because I am often seen around campus doing something with someone. But behind the scenes, I choose the time, duration, and method of contact. If anyone needs me, they email me. I don't give out my phone number. I don't have an Instagram or Snapchat or social media platform. If we venture into a discussion I don't want to have, I shut it down. I set my boundaries.

Once, there was a girl who refused to speak to anybody in one of my classes. I was one of the few people she would talk to. We both had the top grade in the class. The Professor, who was the most senior at the school and very chill, would ask me weekly, like clockwork, if I wanted to do research with him. At first, I said no because I couldn't make time. When he kept asking, I suggested that he ask her instead. He said he wasn't going to because she was too standoffish. He didn't like her demeanor or the way she constantly ignored her classmates. After a month of repetitive requests, I finally decided to work with the Professor which ended up being most fun research experience I've ever had. At the end, he wrote me a glowing recommendation and gave me one of his analysis textbooks from grad school. He's retired, but still likes to keep in contact because he enjoys hearing about major milestones in my life and how I've been doing. 

Another time, two years ago, there was a guy older than me. I helped him a few times in Physics (before I even took the class) while he pursued a degree in AI and Robotics. It was his last class for his degree, he was really struggling to pass, didn't understand the material, there was no TA, and he just couldn't focus. He often vented about his home life. I didn't think he was actually listening to me about the coursework, but he was. Venting helped him focus. A few months ago, he emailed, thanked me for helping him, and told me he was now working with a company that designs affordable, lightweight robotic prosthetics for children. 

Choose wisely who you give your time to. Don't give out your personal information. Don't turn down long term opportunities for short term gain.",Sufficient_Purchase1,2021-04-27 17:25:36,2021-04-27 20:04:53,/r/wgtow/comments/ljcd9t/how_to_avoid_conversations_with_male_coworkers_or/gw2n8z0/,t3_ljcd9t,wgtow,1,0,2021-04-27 20:04:53
443,"I just moved into my new house! First night here last night. It's small and I decided to get a full bed. People ask me what I'll do if a man wants to stay the night. Tell him to leave I said. I don't really have sex, pretty asexual and I don't buy a bed for someone else.

That aside, I'm very excited to get settled in. I bought a house about three years ago but my job changed. So I rented out that house and moved into an apartment. Finally felt stable enough to get something here. I moved three times in 14 months. I am so ready to settle down and stay somewhere for a while!

It has a great kitchen for cooking in despite being small. It's very quiet! Relatively peaceful for being part of a crowded urban area. My other house is silent but very much a food desert. Not walkable to anything. 20 minute drive to the nearest non Walmart non Burger King area. So you make some sacrifices to be walkable to restaurants and stores. I have to remind myself that.

Lots of little things need to be done around the house but I put out feelers for a good handy person. Every so often I think how nice it would be to have a man in my life who is more handy than me. I would be more handy but my dad was a little bit sexist and only taught my brother how to do that kind of thing. I'm learning but I don't want my curtains hung sideways. I want it done right. I finally am financially able to pay someone to do it!

444,"I’m having my first in person therapy session in over a year today (been virtual since the pandemic began) to do some emdr. This isn’t the trauma thread so I won’t get too into it but I realized some stuff from my past wasn’t as ok as I thought it was at the time and now
memories of it and anger at myself for forgiving it have been eating me up a lot the past few weeks. 

Today I’m going to process what happened, accept that it happened, forgive myself for forgiving him and put up a nice sheet of frosted glass between me and those memories. 

I can’t change what happened or how I reacted. I *can* forgive myself. I *can* continue to invest in my own growth and prosperity. I’m going my own way and I can’t keep dragging these ghosts along with me. I need them behind the frosted glass. 

side note I cannot recommend EMDR therapy more to those who have experienced trauma. I’ve gone through it before and have found it incredibly helpful in healing from many different kinds of trauma.

461,"Hey there, sourdough veteran here. I had a sourdough starter for quite a few months and made lots of sourdough bread with it. When I first started I followed [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sTAiDki7AQA) tutorial, and it worked out pretty good. Having a starter is a lot of work, and can be expensive. But I think it can be very rewarding.

A few tips to keep in mind is:
• Use good flour. I bought local artisan flour. I tried to make a starter with bleached &amp; pasteurized store bought flour, and all the yeast was dead so nothing happened.

• it takes about 2-4 weeks of feeding the starter everyday for it to develop flavour. Once you get that going you can put it in the fridge and feed it 1x week.

• Where you live matters. Humidity, temperature, and season will affect your starter’s fermentation. I ended up having to feed my starter 2x a day because of how cold &amp; dry my climate was.

609,"This editor is ass and keeps removing my whole comment.

bell hooks teeters towards the basic tenets of radical feminism rather than liberal feminism. She technically would be since she wants a complete restructuring of society and elimination of male ~~^(superiority)~~ inferiority while accommodating and compensating women in their role within reproduction politically, socially and financially.

She wouldn't be associated with liberal feminism to me since that's more of an offshoot from social contract theory where legal democracy equates to sex equality and personal/private concerns aren't related to the equality of women. She always is making the personal political.

""There's no place in this world that that man can go and say he created peace and harmony. Everywhere he's gone he's created havoc, everywhere he's gone he's created destruction""

What he says can be adapted to the feminist struggle.

Surely if you go to a conservative institution you'll expect to have to tolerate misoginy. But then that's why people become Left wingers and maybe search alterantive life paths, to avoid that. Except even in those places, most of the times, men already went there and ruined it.

The other day I read here a comment from a sister saying that she liked the Wicca community but lately it has just become a place where women go to prey on women. The same about communes, it could be a place to recover from emotional trauma, or to do organic gardening or to be a vegan or whatever. But most often than not, men go there and transform it into ugly polyamour communes. 

Meetups are a great way to have people to do some stuff with you, like a hike, a book club, a film. Or just to chat with foreigners, know different cultures, go to a different restaurant. Of course men have to go there to try to hookup with women, they need to go and make everything sexual.

Even a date can just be about two people going on a hike, going to the beach, enjoying a landscape. Of course a man will try at least to kiss, most likely to have sex with you if not the first date, then the second or the third or whenever he has a change.

Wherever men go, they ruin everything because they are unable to control their sexual urges.",Shadowgirl7,2021-05-16 16:26:22,2021-05-17 03:20:02,/r/wgtow/comments/ndoe2y/what_do_you_enjoy_best_about_going_your_own_way/gyc7ehh/,t1_gybyren,wgtow,11,1,2021-05-17 03:20:02

This is for me the ultimate defiance of the traditional oppressive instutions. Feminism meeting black rights activism. As someone who has communist blood on the veins this just gives me goosebumps. 

I think more and more that you don't choose to become a communist. You are either one or you're not. A communist from my country once say ""For a communist, the fight never ends"". 

That's what being a communist is. True communism is not the Communist regime that was installed in Czech Republic after the nazis were defeated. True communism is the story of Milada, a czech female politician who was sent to a nazi concentration camp, survived, was arrested and executed by the communist regime that she opposed. If you are a communist you always fight injustice, you have no alliegance to any party, you only have alliegance to truth and justice.

660,"I didn't know Sarah Paulson was lesbian. 

I watched the movie Carol yesterday and she is in it. Really liked the movie. 

It made me wonder a few things. First of all the guys seem to tolerate when the women are lesbian. The husband of the main character didn't mind she had an affair with another woman, he just got upset when she left him. But honestly it was her that took the initiative because she was tired of being repressed. If she had put up with it more, he probably would close his eyes... So apparently dudes don't feel threatened by women, only by other men. 

And then both main characters of the movie had relationship with men and liked women... So are they lesbians and were repressed by society and forced to find a man? Are they bisexual?

I personally feel like I am not a lesbian. I am interested in men but not enough to tolerate bullshit. If I wanted to be a lesbian I could freely pursue other women in the city, nobody would judge me because nobody knows me, my family isn't there so they wouldn't even have to know... But I don't feel the need to. Maybe I am just asexual or something because I like men but I am not willing to tolerate certain behaviours and thus I prefer to stay single. If I was an highly sexual person I'd either put up with certain behaviors to have a sexual partner or I'd seek a woman.

This reminds of the movie Shame. The guy was straight and a sex addict. At one point he was so desperate for sex he went into a gay club and had a guy doing him a blowjob. So his despair for sex actually made him go outside his sexual orientation...

If you want to learn a little more about your placements besides the 'big three' you mentioned you can get your full birthchart and find out where the other planets are placed and what houses/signs they are in that should give you some more clarity!

That is quite the interesting combo you have - Gemini rising so you come off chatty/extroverted but really you are pretty serious with the Scorpio/Capricorn.

Scorpio rules things like astrology and the taboo occult etc. so you'd probably enjoy learning more about it!

As far as your Capricorn moon your moon is said to be how you get your emotional needs met. So Capricorn is working hard, structure, 'the father', rules time etc. So the shadow side of that would be wanting a man/patriarch etc to fulfill you emotionally.

It's frightening if you think about it: Today is the best it's ever been for women in a patriarchal society.

As imperfect as our life is right now, a woman **does not** have to look a certain way to be successful and happy. Some of the most powerful women in the world right now are not ""lookers"" in any sense of the word. But of course it's not easy to shake off that particular conditioning...

If it makes other women happy to focus on being beautiful, all the power to them. But after much back and forth, I eventually decided that something this superficial and temporary is not for me.

I've felt this. Everything else you wrote doesn't apply to me, but I used to feel powerless in that I wanted women's approval when I was a young man. I didn't know this was going on in my mind, but it came out in the form of being the ""nice guy"". When the women I liked didn't like me back other than as a friend, I was then resentful, which led to anger. 

It took a lot of work and some therapy, but I finally got over all that resentment and anger and, most importantly, the need for women's approval.",MajIssuesCaptObvious,2021-04-25 12:53:48,2021-04-25 13:33:38,/r/wgtow/comments/mxgrer/women_who_think_they_can_mold_their_son/gvtap1c/,t1_gvsz1wr,wgtow,1,0,2021-04-25 13:33:38
1354,"&gt;I'm not exactly sure why they hate women so much.... I suspect it's because they feel powerless with other men most of the time and they need to feel powerful over a woman. They need to degrade women to feel like they have power. If anyone has another theory, I'd like to hear it.

It's several things. It starts with upbringing. For some men it's resentment for not feeling accepted by a female figure as a boy; some experience abandonment, others are raised by emotionally unavailable mothers. Others, it's being raised around negative male role models or keeping bad friends as company. Then, there's parental abuse/neglect. These experiences lead to an underdeveloped emotional brain (Limbic System) because they weren't taught to deal with negative emotions (such as the feeling of rejection) other than by screaming and fighting. They project what they felt as a child onto the women around them.

Then there's the ancient instinct of conquest built into complex thinking species, especially males, e.g. apes, lions, etc. People who have a strong instinct for this will exploit anything they view as a weakness (lack of strength, emotions, vulnerability, niceness).",MajIssuesCaptObvious,2021-04-25 12:40:50,2021-04-25 13:22:57,/r/wgtow/comments/mxgrer/women_who_think_they_can_mold_their_son/gvt9jx1/,t1_gvqkxip,wgtow,1,0,2021-04-25 13:22:57

1416,"I'm just an asexual/aromantic and kind of an eccentric lady. My childhood was also kind of 'stolen' from me.  Because of that especially, I think I owe it to myself to enjoy the rest of my life. 

I'm told all the time I'm a pretty girl, and seem to have no trouble being charming, I'm just.. weird, and always preferred to go it alone. I have actually never accepted even a date with a man because I know my personality will disappoint most romantically and sexually, and it'll be a mutual waste of time. I've been in one relationship with a woman, a friend- but there was a lot of disharmony between our attraction and love language. I found her 'too much', and she found me 'cold'.

 I do have some very close friends, both male and female, but the kind of people I tend to keep in contact with are chill and we give each other lots of space. I can't imagine wanting a close relationship or love. I can't imagine I'd make a good mother, and maybe it's a selfish reason but I don't think any of it is worth the stress, on my mind or body. I'm 24 and still have the same energy and figure as when I was 18 and I'd like to keep myself that way for as long as I can ;)

1527,"609.344 CRIMINAL SEXUAL CONDUCT IN THE THIRD DEGREE.
Subdivision 1.Crime defined. A person who engages in sexual penetration with another person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the third degree if any of the following circumstances exists:

(d) the actor knows or has reason to know that the complainant is mentally impaired, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless;

This is literally what the law is, and in it it says that if your partner gets a bit tipsy and you sleep together, you're a rapist. If You're tipsy too, they're a rapist too. 


&gt;The legislative definition of “mentally incapacitated,” as set forth in Minn.
Stat. § 609.341, subd. 7 (2020), does not include a person who is voluntarily intoxicated by alcohol. 

*The state charged Khalil with two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and two counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct. Two of the charges against Khalil-count 1 (first degree) and count 3 (third degree)-involve sexual activity with a person when ""the actor knows or has reason to know that the complainant is mentally impaired, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless."" Minn. Stat. §§ 609.342, subd. 1(e)(ii), .344, subd. 1(d) (2016).*

It does not appear that anything was changed, though I'll admit it has very poor optics. These sorts of laws are very complicated and require a very careful vetting and application process. While I agree that it appears this guy appears to be a rapist, the law is very poorly written as a whole. There is an excellent chance that according to it, you and I and most everyone we know collectively are rapists. It also suggests that Khalil need only say that he was also drunk, and was therefore also a victim of rape. The young lady blacking out is not a relevant detail to her ability to commit a crime. 

These cases tried in the public domain often fall victim to emotional bias, and this is a commonly proven thing; people are more likely to believe whom they empathize with, regardless of facts. For all I know the man also blacked out and the woman slept with him without his knowledge, this is exactly what the trial is for.

1627,"This might be controversial, but I would suggest reading the Unibomber Manifesto as it gives perspective to the phenomena of modern life. 

Throughout most of human history, we were all some type of farmer (or hunter/scavenger). We derive pleasure from simple things such as the scent of coffee or tending to plants because they progress us forward despite no obvious longtime reward; they are meant to encourage our survival. 

These mechanisms have been manipulated against us to make us more complacent in the current system, productive; it was intentionally engineered to be a an addicting cycle, like social media. 

We have such large, longterm goals, we have been deprived of simple pleasures in the here and now. Although they are technically still in front of us, the mental patterns we have all developed make that excruciatingly difficult. Dopamine is responsible for motivation, but if it is overused via too much sensory input (invasive phones, computers, advertisements), in becomes weakened, as does our drive. It takes a long time to deprogram, and one must be aware. 

Unlike the comments offering surrogate activities (hobbies) after work, you might actually want to abandon society altogether. A slower life as a farmer or tradesperson in a small community of close and likeminded people who look out for each other can bring so much peace. Mind you there is a buffer time and it is difficult at first.

It was drilled into your mother that a woman's best chances of finding a husband is up until her early 20s *at the latest*. 

You see this a lot in regency romances too, where any heroine that isn't married off during her first season, is considered in danger of being ""left on the shelf"".

The problem with this concept is that women rush to settle with incompatible men. Her daughter will be married, but at what cost? Many of her generation got divorced and having to start all over again at  40 and from the sound of it, that includes your mother too.

1648,"**It feels a lot like women have two options in a capitalist society: either become a mother and/or excel in your career.**   


Biologically speaking, you have one combined role reproduction and validation, men have one combined role too, resource production and security.   


Capitalism is the market name for ""survival of the fittest""; that's it. Capitalism and nature are very much in agreement with each other, and capitalism and ""survival of the fittest"" have proven to be the most effective methods of governance outside of beneficial dictatorships, which are unicorns.   


  **What are those of us who don't prioritize family/kids OR a career supposed to do?**   


You're not going to like this answer, I wouldn't even be surprised if it got me banned from this sub, but lack of honest and logical discourse is most of the problems today. **You're supposed to die**. You don't reproduce, and your genes and these decisions die off with you, because the species needs reproducers, not ""sit around and do nothing'ers""  


Men are in their own version of this dilemma, and they didn't choose to be here.   
""what should I do if no one will allow me to produce for them and they don't want my security"". In the past, a man might go and take a mate, but that option has been legislated away, so they find themselves in a dilemma they didn't agree to.  


The answer for men is different, because violence is always the final solution. Men are expected to fight and take what they want to secure reproduction, or die, for the same reasons I gave for yourself.   


On the bright side, you have the unique position of considering what the value of your life is if you strip away biology; its a rather divine moment for you in my opinion.   


What are you supposed to do? Look at what you like doing, and figure out how to do as much of it as possible, and what how much you're willing to whore your body out for compensation to make those things happen.",DownvoteMe2021,2021-04-05 04:51:27,2021-04-05 04:51:37,/r/wgtow/comments/mk0jcc/what_are_those_of_us_who_dont_prioritize/gtf7joi/,t3_mk0jcc,wgtow,1,0,2021-04-05 04:51:37

1653,"- don't allow anything that gives someone else power over you 
- take up space in public - don't make yourself small
- don't feel the need to be polite if you are not comfortable somewhere - leave 
- don't be afraid of seeming rude if you are standing up for yourself
- don't give in to someone asking you something multiple times (are you sure, are you sure) - stand firm on your no, and call them out on it if you want
- do not ever put yourself down or self- deprecate
- do work on yourself, realize your flaws and work on improving them 
- do not take a partner with the hopes that they will 'complete' you. Build yourself up to who you want to be, and then find a partner that will complement you and make you a better person (growth), and someone who you do the same for
- be with someone that will challenge you to be a better person
[- find someone with traits that you may lack? But do not let them control you....]
- if someone is doing sometimes they you aren't down for, speak up. Don't stay silent for fear of it being awkward. Be firm, be confident
- do not try and change someone, they will be who they are. Build yourself up, find the ones that are compatible, not necessarily meaning the exact same as you, but have the same core values and morals 
- you do not owe anyone anything. You don't need to do anything just to be nice, and if you change your mind about something, that's fine
- listen to your gut, don't feel the need to be polite and stay somewhere where you don't feel comfortable
- walk with confidence and don't smile if you don't want to
- do not be afraid to say 'no'. Just no and nothing else, you don't need to explain yourself
- do not put yourself in a position where people can take advantage of you (eg being inebriated)
- do not allow someone to talk you out of saying no (eg by asking you the same thing, are you sure, come on just one, etc) - people will take this as you being able to be coerced even if you don't want something. Be the person that is blunt if you need to be, but be firm

ON YOUR INNER SELF
- make sure you are able to count on yourself, first and foremost
- be kind to yourself, and be honest to yourself about your shortcomings 
- thinking or yourself as your first best friend, the one you can rely on over anyone elae
- spend time with yourself - go on walks and to restaurants and make memories with yourself
- have adventures with yourself - find a hobby that you can do with yourself (photography, biking, martial arts) 

General life
- look at things in perspective and always try to look at both sides of something
- judge people's actions on their intentions, but do not sell yourself short or make excuses for their bad behaviour (example?)
- have empathy, especially towards those who do not have as much as you, but do not be empathetic to the point of it eating into yourself. You can only help others once you are solid. You cannot pour from an empty cup
- be kind but do not be a pushover or put up with bs
- don't look for validation or worth in outside sources
- do not ever let anyone do anything physically in anger, even if they claim it was out of anger (this points to deeper issues indicating they have anger issues, you don't want to be with someone who is prone to instability). Do not think or let them claim it is 'out of passion'
- beware of people that apologize/saying they understand but do not change their behaviour after you've communicated something to them 
- it's ok to lose yourself sometimes, as long as you find yourself again. Know what is wrong and what is right, learn what your moral are, and stick to them

On Appearance/ clothing
- do not allow yourself to be objectified - dressed up like a doll with pretty clothes/hair/makeup and lack agency (the ability to act on your own and make your own choices)
- do not allow yourself to fall to external pressures such as the beauty, diet and fashion industries (this perpetuates objectification)
- do not be submissive, be assertive
- Your appearance should not be your substance - it should simply be an extension of who you are 
- dress modestly, but do not oppress yourself - we live within a system that puts us at a disadvantage because of our biology in many realms, and we must explicitly understand that
- putting emphasis on appearance and being passive takes away capacity for action and thought (because you are distracted by things that do not matter). This in turn gives you less power, because you have less knowledge
- women's clothes constrain their movement and comfort, and they are encouraged to spend large amounts of time and money on their superficial self
- Do not wear clothes that advertise you as a sexual object for consumption
- ""what is wrong with your face. Why do you think that you have to create a false image of yourself to be attractive but men don't? That's what I want women to think about. Why are men's faces and bodies good enough, buy you're not?"" 

On boys
- you need to be mindful of the situations you get yourself into, relative to men
- never send compromising pictures of yourself to boys
- do not exist in relation to someone else (fulfill their needs or dreams and neglect your own)
- do not date boys who are much older than you, because they often want to date someone younger because they want power/dominance over you. Date the same age (more or less), or younger 
- think about the consequences of your actions because you are the one they will have to bear it 
- never allow double standards in a relationship
- do not let someone control you 
- do not let your partner try and control your finances 
- don't let things be one sided - eg don't always be the one making plans, deciding what to do, doing the emotional and mental labor in the relationship
- if you decide to be with someone, after awhile ask them why they like you - if they can't name things that make you you (your personality, passions, goals, values) and simply say they like you because of how kind/nice you are or how much you love them, you need to ask yourself if they really love and respect you as an individual or simply because you are someone that is there for THEM
- make sure you find a partner that you can share your genuine thoughts and self with without having to hold back or feel embarrassed or uncomfortable
- a person you decide to be with should first and foremost be your FRIEND. if you take out the romantic/sexual aspect, there should be something of substance there
- do not allow men to use reverse psychology. Eg they ask for something and you say no, then they make it about them (you don't like me, you don't want me, etc) to make you feel compelled to then soothe them and give in
- do not fake stupidity or put yourself down to make someone (especially a guy) look smarter/better than you.

Our gut feelings have literally evolved over thousands of years to keep us alive they know what they’re doing even if we’re not consciously aware of it. The book “the gift of fear” goes more into this. Women’s intuition is especially strong bc we didn’t necessarily have the physically strength to protect ourselves we had to outwit. Self preservation is incredibly important. Being selfish and putting yourself first another thing we are trained out of doing. The word selfish has turned into such a dirty negative word but it’s not you have to put yourself first if you want to have any chance at being able to help others or else you get burnt out and can’t help anyone. Also financial independence which has been my issue that I’m working on now so will let other ladies speak to that but it’s super important.

1662,"Keep in mind that the two options you cited - being a mother and/or excelling in your career - are societal expectations.  They're not reality and don't have to be yours.  Your life and what you make of it are based on one thing only - your choices and what has meaning for you.

As \_level\_up\_ wrote, having a purpose can be important, and it sounds like THAT's what you're looking for: a purpose, a meaning to your life and existence.  But that purpose DOESN'T have to be any kind of societal expectation like motherhood or going to the top of your career, or even having a career.

What you need to do is figure out what's important to you, what gives meaning to your life.  Based on what you have written here, it sounds like you've already figured some of that out - namely, not having a career that you're devoted to.  A career is not just a job, but a lifepath, an occupation you do that you want to excel in, learn more about, develop more skills, and get to the top level if you choose.  For example, someone who starts out as a nursing assistant, but gets further education and experience to become a licensed nurse, then a registered nurse, and then may eventually decide to become a nurse administrator, or go to med school to become a doctor.  That's a career.

A job, on the other hand, is not a career.  A job is an occupation, meaning something you do to occupy your time and have no interest in learning more about the job, developing new skills or certifications to move up the job food chain.  A job is generally something you do to pay the bills, to survive.  Some people go from job to job, willing to do different kinds of work for short periods of time to make money, move on, and do other things that are important to them.  Other people have 1 or 2 jobs throughout their lives that they do on a daily basis, put in their 8 hours to get a paycheck, and then use the rest of their time on other things that are important to them.

So that's what you need to figure out for yourself.  Do you like the idea of doing different jobs for a few months, maybe a year, and then moving on to another job, whatever you can do to make money, and then spend the rest of your time on other things that give meaning to your life?  Or do you like the idea of finding 1 job that fulfills your financial needs, and spending the rest of your time on other things?

Secondly, the other thing you need to figure out is what gives meaning to your life?  Do you like to volunteer?  To you like to help people build things? Feed people?  Care for animals? Rescue animals?  Training people on how to care for animals?  Do you like to garden? Do you like to help people grow things, build a community garden?  Do you like to create art?  Volunteer with city beautification, paint a local mural?  Or create other kinds of art that you donate to community centers, craft fairs, etc, just to make people happy?  Or for community centers to sell so they can make more money to help their clients.

Those are just some examples and you may not have interest in any of them.  The only way you'll learn what interests you, if you don't have an idea already, is by trying things out and seeing what brings meaning to you.  Another way to do that is by visiting a community counseling or career center yourself and seeing if you can get some career counseling.  Not necessarily to find a career, if that's not what you want, but in maybe finding the kind of job that might be the best fit for you, and also figuring out what your other interests are to bring meaning to your life.

It can be tough to figure out those things without guidance, which is why I suggest seeking it out, because it can only help you get a clearer picture of who you are and what you want for yourself.  Career counselors can offer all kinds of assessment tools and questionnaires to help you figure out your interests.  Their focus is NOT just on career, but on job skills and personal interests, which are things you need to figure out.  You can discuss with a career counselor exactly what you've shared here - that you're not interested in a career where you learn new skills, advance, get certifications, etc, and move up the career food chain, but are interested in simply finding a job that's a good fit for you, where you can make the kind of money you want, and then focus the rest of your time on your interests.

You might even want to consider temping for a while, which can offer you the ability to try different jobs in a temporary setting, and you might find something that seems relatively tolerable to you, that you think you could do for a while to make money while you figure out what else you want to do with your time.

Many community centers offer sliding scale fees for counseling services, meaning you pay what you can afford.  You can pay as little as $5 to $10 per hour at some centers, so it won't cost you a lot of money to find some guidance to help you learn more about yourself, your interests, what gives meaning to your life and how you want to spend your time.  Don't do it all on your own when there are people available to help you, people who are trained to help you find the best answers to those questions for yourself.",Ruby_5lipper,2021-04-04 22:37:23,2021-04-04 22:37:34,/r/wgtow/comments/mk0jcc/what_are_those_of_us_who_dont_prioritize/gte5v31/,t3_mk0jcc,wgtow,1,0,2021-04-04 22:37:34

I feel like she was a very romantic person, but she didn't like what reality had to offer in terms of love and romance. She also made a comment about how the success of your marriage depends on chance. I feel like I can relate to her. I'm more comfortable treating romance as a fantasy. As reality its not appealing.

I feel like she was a very independent person and a free spirit. Especially for her time. She spoke her mind and was very witty. I admire that.

1673,"A question that frequently comes up, is how do I know if I'm doing the right thing.

This might sound strange, but I feel that life has a way of rewarding us for doing the right thing. 

Whenever I stopped associating with the wrong people or quit the wrong jobs, things had a way of improving immediately.  

Whenever I made the right decisions, opportunities arose out of nowhere, doors were promptly opened. I even met kinder people.

This eventually made me stop fearing failure. That job, that friendship, that exam did not work out for a good reason and I will understand in due time. Instead I now pay attention to what works and put all my efforts in that direction.

Specifically this means: struggle love is the wrong love. A job/major that drives you to despair is the wrong job/major.

This isn't saying the right path can't be difficult or a struggle, but life always made sure I was rewarded regularly for staying on that path.",journey2serenity,2021-04-04 21:05:14,2021-04-04 21:05:25,/r/wgtow/comments/mk25un/what_are_your_practical_life_rules_for_women/gtdvgvm/,t3_mk25un,wgtow,1,0,2021-04-04 21:05:25

She went through a series of tests and my father pleaded the doctors to let her come home for an hour; they strongly did not want her to because they suspected heart failure, but allowed it as he promised to take her back if they called.

Her symptoms were getting worse and she wanted to go back, but my father told her to suck it up. The hospital called and said she needed to go back because she *was* in heart failure, but my dad asked ""Can't it wait another week?"" to my pleading grandmother. She was losing her speech, stuttering like a toddler, unable to breathe, etc. She asked why I wasn't there, ""Why can't u/siberianfrost take me?"" My father told her I didn't care about her or if she died. **WHAT THE FUCK.** 

I know he said this because I no longer visit her; she has issues with boundaries. I have told my dad bluntly I cannot stand her or him as they fight like cats and dogs. I would still take her to the hospital if she needs it, and I certainly don't wish death on her. The only one who doesn't care if she dies is him because she needed to go and the hospital quite literally said she was dying. My mom called to tell me everything above, and that he begrudgingly took her long after the call. 

I wish I visited her today because I had a gut feeling something was wrong!! I would have taken her and spared her the anxiety she was feeling making her symptoms worse.

2114,"I never felt unsafe here and last summer I went to an hostel and slept in a mixed dorm. 

But I was told in the US things are a bit different, like hostels for example sometimes attract some peculiar folks (like drug addicts or drunks). Also some coworkers went to LA and they got lost and asked instructions and the dude started yelling they couldn't be there it wasn't safe... pretty strange shit for us to have like those unsafe areas. They said they started running LOL
Here I was also lucky because I didn't stay in a party hostel or even if it was a party hostel due to pandemic it wasn't full of people. It was ideal for me, since it was my first time solo travelling. 

My country ranks as the 3rd or 2nd safest country in the world so I don't know how it would be like in the US. I mean rape and sexual assault happens here too and there's misogynism, but in the stats we are considered quite safe so maybe those things don't happen as often. 

I think here things would be stricter, like you can't just park your van everywhere, usually there's specific parks and you can get fined if you don't respect that. The guy I met didn't respect it and he didn't have problems but I think he changed spot sometimes because there's a limit fo time of how long you can stay. In the movie they were like in the nowhere land, in the middle of the desert.

In Europe you don't have nowhere land like in the US (maybe Siberia? lol). There's houses mostly everywhere here lol. 

I'd run if I spotted a vandweller using drugs.

2151,"It's really not the same. Buying goods and essentials that you bought with your own money, whether that's from work or even benefits that are made out to you in your name because you personally qualify for them is _way_ different than having an individual man support you materially, that is jeopardized by not being in a relationship that he wants and you don't- meaning SEX- and being concerned to the point that if you cut him off because you reject his romantic advances that you have literal concern about violence and that you will struggle on some level, is not the same thing as choosing to participate in society that we have in place. Say what you want about patriarchy, but the two aren't the exact same thing, and what I mean is that you can be WGTOW in our (presumptually assuming that you are US or western in general) culture because of the rules we have in place for our game, much more so than women do in other parts of the globe. There are no written laws in our society that bar women from being independent and legitimately going their own way- it is easier to follow the herd, but it is not impossible or beyond difficult, like it used to be.

That is not the same thing as going to a butcher because you do not want to hunt and slaughter your own game, or having a plumber to fix your toilet or sink because you just simply don't know the skills- and no one person can be a master of all skills, even though they might be a jack of all trades, you will at some point need assitance from your fellow human, man or woman, unless you are a legit hermit in the woods or far out in the country completely alone that may even die a premature death because of isolation. Actually, I see no reason why a strong female friendship that is mutually beneficial could not be formed and cohabitate.

None of these professions are specific to men- they may be highly populated by them, but women are not excluded from really any profession or trade at this point... that is different than an individual man in your life specifically giving _you_ material assistance because you have a disability that makes life more difficult than the average person, and especially because you are in a vulnerable position because of said support, which is the aspect that is putting you at real risk for emotional blackmail or potential physical violence if he is rejected and takes it too far.",HeroForHire369,2021-05-04 00:41:25,2021-05-04 11:16:28,/r/wgtow/comments/n3d0w2/male_friend_obsessing_over_me_despite_me_telling/gwun98z/,t1_gwudsss,wgtow,2,1,2021-05-04 11:16:28

I do know that in learning more about my Capricorn Moon and after coming out of a 5 year relationship (not the guy I mentioned above) I can def see how I am full of deep regrets for not putting myself first. I even picked a particular degree because of that relationship (well it was one of the reasons).

2185,"Oh man! I didn't even think about how much domestic stuff woman do for free! It really would negatively impact society if women abandoned those roles; but that's why I value marriage and having children so highly and don't want it for myself. Mothers are obviously the backbone of any society, so the greatness of all societies is dependent on the mothers (the women raising the children). If every child is well-raised, you're going to get a really awesome society of people; but if every mom was lazy, selfish, and ill-equipped to take care of her children; you'd most likely end up with a society of broken people: criminals, narcissists, rude people, depressed, insecure, aggressive, etc. men and women who are destructive and raising people who are like themselves or worse.

Looking back at all the stuff my mom did for us when I was child, I think it's crazy how much we took her for granted. She worked, cooked, cleaned, picked us up and dropped us off, took care of us when we were sick, planned all our doctor/dentist appointments and vacations... She did everything for us. When something happened at school, she was the one who was called, not our dad.

For a brief period of my childhood, I remember her ""going on strike"". She said no one appreciated her, and would yell at our teachers if they called her. She'd say, ""LOSE MY NUMBER! I WROTE THEIR FATHER'S NAME ON THE SLIP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR! CALL HIM! I WORK TOO!"" At parent teacher conference, my female teachers nodded sympathetically like they knew exactly what she was going through. I didn't know then, but I know now. We really didn't appreciate her, and she's gone now. My dad is dating again, and I'm sure he realizes at this point that he will never find another woman like my mom, because the stuff that woman did to take care of us and keep everyone happy WA ridiculous! Like, I remember being 3 and waking up in the middle of the night hungry. I could ask her to cook whatever I wanted, and she would prepare the whole meal in the kitchen for me!!! At 2am! For a 3 year old!

There's no way I would be making chicken strips, mashed potatoes, and pink lemonade in the middle of the night. I would hand that child a slice of bread and some water, and send them back to bed! She was on a different level. Just another reason why I don't feel that marriage and motherhood are right for me.

And true, she did seem like she wanted to validate her decision to marry or something. I've been seeing this often. Some women have been telling me how marriage isn't all its cracked up to be, and I shouldn't expect certain things; but I know they're only saying that because their own marriages are awful. They rushed into it with a gut they barely knew, they married someone who was abusive even though they knew he wouldn't change, etc etc, so they tell other women not to hope for a good marriage and that it's all about struggling, and that's real love.

I don't know if she's a holier-than-thou-type, but she has constantly made assumptions about my sinfulness and given me unsolicited advice to fix myself. I'm not even sure where some of her assumptions come from half the time, but she seems to think she's doing an act of charity by lecturing me on my imaginary faults.",chasteandfree,2021-05-13 00:52:03,2021-05-13 13:17:58,/r/wgtow/comments/nb21gr/why_do_people_assume_that_if_you_dont_want_to/gxxa80n/,t1_gxx4uhm,wgtow,1,1,2021-05-13 13:17:58
2186,"&gt;is taoism the same thing that the tao te ching book comes from?

Yes. I haven't read the book myself, just read about Tao and Confuciusism. 

&gt;are literally ones that create life and nature is a greater force/god.

Yes. I absolutely agree. If anyone should be put up on a pedestal it is women. I know in Islam, (at least from what I've read in the Quran) is that ""Women are the next closest thing to God besides angels."" And I think that is really beautiful and power. I just wish that society treated women as such. 

""Pagan"" is a termed coined by the Romans that essentially mean ""barbarian"" and anyone not Christian (as it was coined during the Christian times of Rome). ""Pagan"" meant ""Not Christian/ Not as intelligent."" It's kinda like the equivalent of calling someone a ""Redneck."" 

Don't be afraid of Heathenry. If you check out r/heathenry, they don't condone white supremacy. They are very against those who are what they call ""Folkish."" 
I'm actually a Kemetic (Ancient Egyptian religion) and I don't have an African background. The spirit is without flesh and thus without color. Of course, always be respectful to the cultures in which the religions came from and make sure it isn't a closed religion. Heathenry and Kemeticsm are not closed religions. I know there are some Afro centric communities in Kemeticism (some that can be toxic (by the men) from what I've read from black women of the community) though at the time when it was a live religion, Egypt had converts all the time and meshed with Greek/Roman and had ideas from Mesopotamia because it wasn't closed.",Hmtnsw,2021-05-13 00:43:46,2021-05-13 13:07:43,/r/wgtow/comments/nax4s8/do_yall_consider_religion_to_be_wgtow_friendly/gxx96nu/,t1_gxx60mp,wgtow,1,1,2021-05-13 13:07:43

2189,"Well to be fair, in the movie they separated men from women and mostly killed the men because they were blamed for fighting against the Serbs.

So if I was a guy, I could use the movie as a proof that men have it harder. That is of course if you think that death in this case is the worst or if it's much hard for those who stay and have to deal with the loss for the rest of their lives. 

More than the women issues, I think this decision is just coward and dumb. They had the chance to bring awareness about a shameful genocide that happened under UN watch but nop. Actually I think in 94/95 the whole UN must have been on vacations because they allowed at least two genocides and did nothing (yes Rwanda genocide).

If the movie had won the prize maybe some people who didn't watch it yet would. Maybe some cinemas would display the movie. It would maybe reach more people that would become aware of what happened.

But nop. Four middle aged drunk dudes. That's what's important and interesting. I thought immediately that whoever picked this it was mostly men, because I as a woman (who doesn't drink) could not relate the slightest with Druk.

Taosim allowed women to hold Priestley positions because it was believed that women could ""talk""/associate with deities easier than men (probably due to being seen as more ""pure""). I would not be surprised if these Taoist societies were matriarchal- which may be why Confuciusism became more popular because it created that gender role (stripping women of their ""divine power"") and not to mention probably due to allowing easier control of the masses via religion/ politics and flipped society to be patriarchal.

2200,"This woman in my chastity group has constantly accused me of having issues with men and hangups about marriage. I don't.

I clearly stated my reasons for wanting to be a nun: wanting to marry Jesus, wanting to live in a monastery where the Blessed Sacrament is, being able to focus my life on prayer and studying theology, being able to work on arts and live in a community of sisters (the monastery I chose has nuns who are really artistically talented and make all kinds of religious arts and crafts), wanting to give my life wholly to God, not wanting to worry about worldly things anymore (life is simpler when you garden, raise livestock, and have less material things due to vows of poverty).

However, I did mention that I think I'm not cut out for being a wife or mother. I don't want to screw up a child, and I see how serious a calling marriage and child rearing is. I don't think it's a light job at all. Also, I don't think I could handle the pain of giving birth, and that terrifies me. Much more frankly, I only want marriage for sex, and that's not a good reason to go into it.

She told me that my reasons for not wanting to get married were ""bad reasons"" and that these were ""hangups"" I needed to get over, or I was choosing to be a nun out of fear and duress. 

I told her she came off very rude, and that my reasons for not wanting marriage were absolutely good reasons. I also told her that she seemed elitist about marriage, like every woman who chose not to marry was wasting her life, had something wrong with her, or hated men (she's accused me before of having issues with men, which I don't). We're kind of not talking at this point. I feel that I may have been too harsh, but I got really fed up with her.

Oh, about the flower thing. St. Therese sometimes sends people flowers when they ask her intercession. A guy who was discerning if he should be a priest or married, asked for a white rose if he should be celibate and a red rose if he should marry. He got a white rose with an invitation for a wedding in the mail, and took it as a sign. I prayed a similar prayer, and got a red rose; but it was in a way that I couldn't discern if it was a sure sign or not; so I asked for prayer about it.

The good thing that came out of the woman's comment was that it solidified my decision to stay single and/or be a nun. Even if I don't become a nun, I still want to stay single and not get married. I don't feel like marriage is some obligatory thing that I have to do.",chasteandfree,2021-05-12 23:23:41,2021-05-13 11:33:48,/r/wgtow/comments/nb21gr/why_do_people_assume_that_if_you_dont_want_to/gxwz4l2/,t3_nb21gr,wgtow,3,1,2021-05-13 11:33:48
2201,"It depends on the religion.

Becoming Catholic, I've found the faith to be very in favor of non-marriage/celibacy in a way that the non-religious world and Protestantism aren't.

Catholicism has ceremonies for ""consecrated virgins"" and of course nuns and sisters who never get married. Consecrated virgins are different in that they can still live in the world without marriage. They are married to Jesus, but don't live in a convent and don't have to take vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

Being a consecrated virgin isn't absolutely necessary though. You could just be a woman who decides not to marry or join religious life and I think that will be well understood. If anyone gives you flack about it, you could point out the fact that Jesus said it's literally better to stay single than to get married.

&gt; The disciples said to him, “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.” But he said to them, “Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.  For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.” (Matthew 19:10‭-‬12)

Remaining single, according to Jesus, is preferential; but most people don't like the thought of being single forever. I think Catholics generally see the choice to remain unmarried as a noble thing.

Most Protestants are a different story. By the age of 19, it was like people were constantly trying to marry me off, and asking me why I'm not dating. I think at the ripe age of 26, now, (not dating or married) people assume I'm a hussy or a lesbian. Clearly, I must be up to no good, sleeping around with men from sex apps, and that's why I haven't settled down yet.

The secular, non-religious world pities me as sad, selfish, or man-hating (I'm not). They think I will regret my decision when I'm ""old and ugly"", and I'll be miserable because no one will want me then.

So yeah, I think Catholics have a better view on wgtow than most religious or non-religious groups, but it really depends on the faith and the people. I've come across Catholics who also seem angry at the idea of a woman not marrying. The world accepts this as a norm and must, so I think you will find people who are opposed in and out of religion.",chasteandfree,2021-05-12 22:58:02,2021-05-13 11:03:55,/r/wgtow/comments/nax4s8/do_yall_consider_religion_to_be_wgtow_friendly/gxwvwku/,t3_nax4s8,wgtow,1,1,2021-05-13 11:03:55

2204,"Not Abrahamic Religions. 

Traditional Pagan religions were more woman friendly. Look at Norse Mythology. Everyone knows of Odin and Valhalla. Then there are the Valkries (beautiful objectives women who help pick the soldiers to go to Valhalla). 

But a lot of people don't know about Freya. She is not of the same race as Odin and comes from a magical race. SHE hand picks soldiers FIRST to go to her domain known as Folkvang. Going to Folkvang is more prestigious than Valhalla but everyone thinks Valhalla is the absolute Hall of Honor. Nope. 

Women of Scandanavia could own land and other forms of property. They could essentially come and go as they pleased unlike the women of Greek culture who basically had to get permission from their husbands to do so. 

Ancient Egypt had certain Temples that were runned by all women. I can't remember where in Egypt, but Hathor had a temple with all women priestess. A.E was also the first culture to allow/ accept gay marriage and the first homosexual marriage was a lesbian couple. One of the Goddesses, Isis, has a story of being so clever, so tricked Ra (sometimes seen as the ""All-Father"") to give her some of his power, thus in turn making her [more powerful] one of the most powerful Netjeru (Gods). She had a massive following and still does to this day.  A.E women could own property as well. 

I also think Taosim is women friendly. It is like Buddhism but embraces worldly things. Be in connection with all and have peace with all. ""Be like water""  while Buddhism restricts all worldly things to achieve ""Enlightment.""

2230,"&gt;Why do they single shame women so much?

I think the answer is pretty obvious, but uncomfortable. Independent creatures can make their own decisions, objects or things to possess are supposed to do what they're told. Why do you think people get so angry when their computer, car, television, phone, etc, breaks or doesn't do exactly what they want in that moment. The woman is usually has her career end or suffer, she is the one who usually uproots her whole life if her man gets a job and wants to relocate the family, she has 100% of the reproductive labor and has the damn kid attached to her for nourishment for up to like two years, typically. Men made marriage- public prostitute or private prostitute, that is absolutely the historical purpose up until like five minutes ago. Marrying for romantic love is extremely recent, as far as the human timeline for its existence is concerned. How do we even know that men and women truly see marriage the same? Globally, the perspectives and incentives are very, very different, and western women have the privilege to have the choice to both marry and to marry for love.

You are supposed to have your life male (and [nuclear] family) centered, your career, education, and travel are the garnish on top that makes you more appealing. It's a nice small window of time to have those experiences but the ultimate goal is to reproduce and be available for sex- not my words, though, the actions done over and over and over again are enough to show and know that this much is obvious.",HeroForHire369,2021-05-12 01:19:44,2021-05-12 12:29:38,/r/wgtow/comments/n9i1c2/i_feel_like_i_wasted_my_20s/gxsvgxy/,t1_gxrx15k,wgtow,1,1,2021-05-12 12:29:38

2268,"Thank you for mentioning this. I'm sure that husband is a major contributor to the situation, but it is still really important to recognize that a mental health crisis induced by having to be both parents to a high maintenance kid is ultimately still a mental health episode and needs to be treated as such.

If she's stressed enough for her hair to be falling out, then this goes far past ""ugh look at what trash men are"". This woman needs help ASAP. and not to get too dark, but *especially* because shes the primary caregiver to a young child. Unfortunately it's a well known pattern that women will become mentally ill but not receive diagnosis or help because it's always dismissed as stress and it's allowed to exacerbate up until the point she kills her child. It's an invisible epidemic becuase of how taboo it is to discuss infanticide.

My dad is schizoaffective and that sudden strong urge to retreat into the wilderness always coincided with psychosis, during which he would became very erratic and aggressive. And this is a man with male presentation of symptoms -- it's strongly suspected were under diagnosing these types of symptoms in women.  This isn't married life, this is trauma piled on top of trauma sprinkled with physical exhaustion. This goes far past the normal degree of marital stress a woman in a bad marriage would experience. 

It's also the time of year where depression often gives way to energy which leads to violence (it's why were seeing SO MANY shootings. Suicide also spikes in that march-may window). She's consciously thinking about exist strategies.

OP, Im sure you already are, but I would be taking this situation incredibly seriously. She's verbally admitting she wishes she could abandon her child to others, which often means that she's progressed past the point of feeling these things to being *so* entrenched in them that she's not even bothering to hide it (or perhaps doesn't realize it is a major taboo). 

If you can find any kind of group to help round-robin provide childcare assistance so she can exist outside a caretaker and take care of herself for the first time in a long time, even a few hours a week can be such a big deal. Threaten her POS husband to get his shit together and pull his weight in helping. Encourage her to get medical care, etc.

Keep an eye on her, both for her health and for the little girls safety. ""She would never do that"" kind of stuff goes out the window if there's psychosis. Never thought I'd hope someone just has PTSD...",Bitter_Froyo_6742,2021-05-10 23:10:01,2021-05-11 09:12:46,/r/wgtow/comments/n962io/my_mother_wants_to_shave_her_hair_and_to_live_in/gxo0mvc/,t1_gxmm6hf,wgtow,4,1,2021-05-11 09:12:46

2274,"Agreed. It's heavily due to socialization. Women put their worth into being able to say a man is committed to them; they want to be chosen and have a ride-or-die.

I can only speak as an American, but there's a culture around secluding women: men not being allowed to have women friends, and women are not to have men. What it leads to is men using their wives as therapists (especially if a man is a loner to begin with), and women being segregated to social circles of other wives who may also be living in the same isolation. It leads to negative feedback loops, only being around others who share the same miserable viewpoint, that you are each other's only friends and cannot seek alternative methods to meeting your needs.",LightSpinster,2021-05-24 20:47:13,2021-05-25 19:35:54,/r/wgtow/comments/njzrwg/what_is_a_relationship_anyway/gzbdhx0/,t1_gzaxdff,wgtow,11,1,2021-05-25 19:35:54

2276,"I was raised in a very religious environment, but despite leaving, I still take some lessons with me into adulthood.

I always knew when I was little, pre-school little, that I was ""different"" somehow. Even though I knew I was not gay, when I would hear strangers or relatives talk negatively about it, I felt neutrality and solidarity with LGBT somehow. I knew I was never going to marry. I liked the idea of a soulmate, but there was always a gut instinct telling me, ""You're not like them. There are people in the world like me, I just didn't know their name, or if they have one yet."" I would go on to discover asexuality and aromanticism.

I bring this up because I bought an ""engagement"" ring. I knew some day I was going to buy these for myself, specifically for what they mean to me. I wanted to wear a piece of authentic gold jewelry with gemstones of the 12 tribes (of Israel), back then I still thought stones had magical properties (as with nature around me; I was very obsessed with witchcraft, sages, and mysticism). I also wanted to carry something that had ""I am"" written on it, as it was my favorite verse.

I felt a strong solidarity with the sentence ""I am that I am."" I am what I will be, what I always have been. I know God made me the way that I am for a reason (should God exist), and that my current state is how it was divinely planned to be at that moment. I grew up with narcissists who made me doubt my every movement, this phrase is the most powerful I had heard in my life and I don't think anything compares with it, it was the first moment I had felt unconditional love.

He suffers a lot of abuse and manipulation at their hand too but still has a connection with them. I don’t know why. It’s a big red flag and I guess I just feel bad for him. But he’s much older now so he really should just say goodbye honestly. Maybe he thinks it’s normal to manipulate people.

I feel better. I don’t feel like it’s my fault so much anymore and I know he’s manipulative and controlling. He was just so sweet during our relationship and he was never forceful when we were intimate. 

One weird thing he did though was... he told me that when he wasn’t around me his depression and anxiety came back and when we were together, it went away. So at one point he wanted to spend time apart so he could “become more like himself”. I was really upset because we had such a close connection and he was saying this very strange and confounding stuff. I wonder if it was a type of manipulation tactic, but who knows what it was meant to achieve. Probably just to make me feel bad for some reason. 

... I really idealized our relationship for such a long time. I miss waking up next to him. I didn’t see the bad parts at all and I am so grateful every time he just talks to me. And I feel bad talking to him because I know he is seeing somebody but he still talks back. I even un-friended him on FB like 3 times and every time he accepted my friend request immediately. 

I wish I could completely move on or at least see the bad parts of him more clearly.",goddessmoneta,2021-05-24 15:54:33,2021-05-25 12:27:10,/r/wgtow/comments/n65pr0/trauma_megathread/gza97q9/,t1_gz8ztum,wgtow,1,1,2021-05-25 12:27:10

I was never interested in one when younger; my gut when it told me that there was something ""off"" about most men.

I could have gone my life without it; I'd've probably been better for it. It was less than a friendship, with a lot of emotional labor and hourly unwanted sexual passes. After the second guy (+ witnessing the abuse my mother &amp; grandmothers went through), I saw a pattern and bailed.

2298,"About land, well, ideally I'd want a house with a garden in a specific place in my country... however, I have fancy taste, it happens this specific place of my country is the most expensive place of my country LOL So not sure if a house with garden will be possible before my dogs die. After they die, then really the motivation to have all that space will be lower and a 1 bedroom apartment will do. 

This is the most expensive place in my country for a reason though, it's 20 min to the capital where all jobs are, there's tons of stuff to do, 15 mins from beaches. You don't need a car because there's a lot of public transportations, it's extremely safe and clean and it's full of rich people that probably pay huge property taxes (because the houses are like mansions) which makes them have cool programs like free transportation in the area or free covid tests, among other things.  
Maybe one day I'll get tired of the city or will want to move abroad, in that case I can sell or rent with profit. It's a very dynamic housing market so you always have people looking to buy or rent there. It's also a bit touristic and a hot spot for digital nomads so you can do short term rental.

Housing market is just stupid here, though. A 1 bedroom I'll be lucky if I find for 110k in the area. If I save 5k/year in 4-5 years I'll have enough for downpayment and then maybe if I pay like 300€/month to the bank I'll pay it in 20 some yrs. House with garden would be at least 300k (for that price, it would need some construction work). It's a bit impossible to be able to afford that before my dogs die :( 

Maybe after they die I'll venture myself in the US and get me some money to come back, get a house with garden and retire earlier. But that won't happen until I am in my 40s, my youngest puppy is 5 yrs, so hopefully she'll still have at least 10 or 15 more years to live and I don't want to be that far from them (also they are house dogs, they are used to space, I wouldn't dare putting them on a flat).",Shadowgirl7,2021-05-24 14:38:14,2021-05-25 10:49:44,/r/wgtow/comments/njtq1e/whats_your_long_term_life_plan/gz9zc0z/,t1_gz9x7cz,wgtow,2,1,2021-05-25 10:49:44

Sorry if I'm being a little vague in the rest of my post I've just learned to keep certain goals to myself because it's more of a motivation personally that way.

I'm just getting into astrocartography which is a subset of astrology that shows where different planets are on different locations and the experiences you may have. Looking back on the past before I knew what it was it was eerie and pretty cray seeing how things lined up with my different experiences. I had always been drawn to a particular city that has a reputation for being 'lame' haha but I always thought the architecture was so beautiful and it turns out it's literally like right on my Venus line and I've never lived anywhere near that range so I want to move there and see what happens. 

As far as career goes I think I read this on this sub or similar that really inspired me but I really want to actually challenge myself. I want to do something really hard that I will be proud of myself for achieving. It is a total mindset shift for me because before I wanted more of an easy skate through kind of life which don't get me wrong I still do in some ways but I want to see my potential. I'm really excited to pursue these goals without feeling the pressure or distraction of men :)",level_up_always,2021-05-24 14:21:11,2021-05-25 10:29:09,/r/wgtow/comments/njtq1e/whats_your_long_term_life_plan/gz9x7cz/,t3_njtq1e,wgtow,4,1,2021-05-25 10:29:09
2300,"And the cherry on top after the breakup is that I texted my ex's aunt and showed her the screenshots proving they lost their job because they lied about one of THEM dying, and told Auntie that she knows how difficult it is to try to be there for her niece. Could she please, please help me pay for rent.

I had moved out MONTHS ago and had accepted paying half of my rent at my old place and my new rent. With only two months left on the lease, my ex asked me to pay their rent WHILE I ALSO PAID MY OWN RENT. So my ex's aunt secretly sent me a check, but when my ex had asked her the same thing, she'd said she couldn't afford it. (""He doesn't have a job. I'm not loaning him anything."")

I've been working overtime and collecting a plethora of part-time jobs to get by, while my ex has had to accept that they can't launch a full-time Twitch career in three months. They sat me down and whimpered, whined, and cried about all of the stress that they were putting me through, saying they still loved me as a sister and a friend and hoped that one day we could come back together as friends. I very empathetically said I could not return those feelings. Somehow, the way I said it was polite enough that they cried some more and called themselves ""undeserving of my kindness and respect"".

Absolutely unacceptable. You should have cut contact that day.

&gt;*.... When we broke up I told him I’d have his kids  ....I mentioned it a few years ago to him because I was having “baby fever” because I was 24 and terrified of “running out of time""*  
&gt;  
&gt;.... *I told him that I still had feelings for him via the FB “vanish mode” and he saw it but of course didn’t say anything.*

You are telling this man that it is okay to disrespect you, that despite the fact he's ben callous by being aloof or bait-and-switching in his messages to you, you'd still have his children. Absolutely never share this kind of information with a man you are not in a serious committed relationship with.

&gt;*...he dangled a carrot and took it away. I ended up begging him again but he just didn’t say anything ...At this point he had a GF who he’s suuuper in love with etc*

He is putting on this performance to see your reaction: jealousy, hurt, etc.

&gt;*he watches like 90% of my insta and FB stories religiously.*

He's controlling. He wants to see what you're up to despite him not being there. 

&gt;*....it felt like he wanted me to come over and sleep with him? That was just my intuition but it felt so absurd I wrote it off.*

Listen to your gut. It's right. It's not the first time he's done this to you according to your comment. 

&gt;... *maybe he doesn’t even think I’m that attractive.*

Yes he does. Women have a tendency to turn inward: self-blame when trying to reason unjustifiable behavior. His behavior has absolutely nothing to do with you.

&gt;When we broke up he said something like “well I just did it for the regular sex” and it was such a traumatic thing for him to say 

It was traumatic to say. Even if he were flatly lying, the immaturity of saying something like that is something you should never associate with. 

He sounds like he has NPD and/or is a sociopath. You also sound like you have low self-esteem with is a lethal combo with someone like that.

I'd be with him until I got tired of his BS, then I'd leave (say 1 month maybe? 1 year? depends how much time I'd actually have to spend with him). And that would probably be the best relationship I'd ever have because he would have given something useful in return, which can't be said for most. lol

The nice guys I meet I can't stand honestly. Some criticize everything about how I think. Since I am not romantic, do not want kids, do not want to share my finances with them, they see this as extremely offensive, because I am a woman so I should buy into disney romances and do stupid stuff for love. They are nice people, not cheaters, have jobs, no adictions, know how to handle responsablity... but then they bring conservativism with them. I can't feel attracted to them no matter how much I try, I just feel suffocated.",Shadowgirl7,2021-05-23 21:57:28,2021-05-24 20:38:40,/r/wgtow/comments/njfyu7/does_anyone_else_feel_like_you_can_finally_be/gz7hv7j/,t3_njfyu7,wgtow,9,1,2021-05-24 20:38:40
2339,"So basically me and my ex broke up 5 years ago, I was a senior in college and graduating and he had taken a year off so, even though he was only a year younger than me, he was a sophomore and still had two years. We went out on-and-off for like nine months, and for the first 4-5 I was in a poly relationship with this guy (5 years older than me) who lived an hour away who was engaged and I was his “girlfriend”, and she had a “boyfriend” who I was dating - like a poly square. Yes I know. Barf. 

Anyway, this boyfriend was in my major the first few months - we actually met in February and starting dating around August. So until December I was a computer science major just like him, we had like 2-3 overlapping classes and he slept over my apartment all the time, which was 20 minutes to our college as opposed to his commute which was like an hour. 

So we had A LOT of sex and at some point I realized his friend (we were part of a friend group) had r-ped me because I was blacked out when we did it and I couldn’t remember. To this day I can’t even confirm if we did but he bragged about it to no end to the other friends. This was May. We went out for a week because I had a “no sex without dating rule” but he was a pathological liar so I dumped him (didn’t wanna go out with him anyway). 

My boyfriend, who is STILL his best friend, said he “wasn’t going to take sides” which is pretty messed up but I forgave him at the time. 

Anyway, when we broke up 5 years ago I told him maybe we could go out again in 5 years, when he has a stable job etc. since at that point he was just a broke college sophomore. 

This guy was also really good looking and I felt really insecure at the time and grateful he went out with me. 

So these past 5 years I go traveling around the world and doing fun stuff while he graduates and gets a boring computer science job (I dropped the major and took a bunch of random music classes my last semester. He actually said he wanted a “brand new start” that next semester as if I was interchangeable with semesters, and also probably because we didn’t share classes anymore). 

Throughout these past five years we have been talking on and off mostly on Facebook. When we broke up I told him I’d have his kids (mostly to make him feel better about being dumped) and then I mentioned it a few years ago to him because I was having “baby fever” because I was 24 and terrified of “running out of time”. But at this point he had a GF who he’s suuuper in love with etc. 

Well anyway so I come back to the city we went to college in, kind of my home city, and I’m broke and in trouble and I ask him if I can stay with him and his gf. Well he says “oh that’s funny my gf is out of town for 2 weeks” and I said “oh ok I’ll be over tomorrow” and he said “nah she wouldn’t be ok with you staying here alone for obvious reasons”. I thought maybe COVID but also that he would cheat??? It was so weird. Like he dangled a carrot and took it away. I ended up begging him again but he just didn’t say anything although he did reply when I asked him where I could pick up 🍃. 

Anyway so he sent me this long rambling message two months ago about how his girlfriend is moving across the country at the end of this month and he’s going to have to find another place. I don’t know why he told me this. Is he trying to tell me they’re going to break up? They’ve been together like 3-4 years. Right now he is searching for a new place with a mutual friend of ours. 

Recently I told him that I still had feelings for him via the FB “vanish mode” and he saw it but of course didn’t say anything. He is aloof like this a lot and very selectively responsive. 

Oh, and he watches like 90% of my insta and FB stories religiously. I don’t know why he does it. He’s probably watched like 50 of my stories so it’s not a coincidence and it’s fairly recent. He even did after I told him I still liked him. So it’s kind of annoying. 

So basically I am having this trauma of wondering, was our whole relationship a lie? All of that sex and cuddling and saying I love you, was that all so he could have a lot of sex? Did he not really like me the whole time? To brag to his friends? When we broke up he said something like “well I just did it for the regular sex” and it was such a traumatic thing for him to say that I thought he was just being bitter but I’m realizing maybe it’s true. And when he said his gf was going to be gone for two weeks it felt like he wanted me to come over and sleep with him? That was just my intuition but it felt so absurd I wrote it off. 

Anyway I think about this ex a lot and I miss our love and our cuddles but I feel like all the love was a lie. And he probably talks smack about me all the time and maybe he doesn’t even think I’m that attractive. Anyway I just need to get this off my chest because I’m still going through it. Thanks all.",goddessmoneta,2021-05-23 20:56:44,2021-05-24 19:18:15,/r/wgtow/comments/n65pr0/trauma_megathread/gz7a8lq/,t3_n65pr0,wgtow,1,1,2021-05-24 19:18:15

I didn't have a dryer for a while and I just air dried. Very hard in a humid environment, though, but no longer in that wasteland anymore.

Not cooking meals also helps with having less kitchen clutter and appliances.

If I had a dollar each time someone tried to victim blame and/or proceed to try and excuse away rape like it was something minor, akin to a spilled drink, I'd be a millionaire by now.  There is absolutely no instance whatsoever where rape is acceptable, reasonable, or expected.  It is illegal, criminal behavior that men are knowingly and actively electing to partake in against women.  They continue with abandon across the globe, knowing there will be little to no repercussions for their behavior especially if they're well connected financially, politically, and/or socially.

Men and brainwashed women will excuse this shit to the death to protect their own interests and/or to appease men.  If men were being raped constantly by one another and under threat of possible sexual violence every time they went out, as happens to women, there would be an immediate change in tune.  They would not take kindly if we turned around and started saying, ""Oh, it must have been what he was wearing"", ""He shouldn't of been shirtless!"", ""He shouldn't of been there"", ""He knows not to walk alone after dark"", ""He was drunk, you know how that goes"", ""Take it as a compliment that he found you attractive"" and so forth.",cidazdl,2021-04-19 14:48:53,2021-04-19 15:06:03,/r/wgtow/comments/mu08t3/take_care_of_yourselves/gv352v8/,t3_mu08t3,wgtow,1,0,2021-04-19 15:06:03

Pride and Prejudice +200yrs old and mr Wickham is a shit. It’s funny to think that family names use to be handed down by the woman’s line, cause you always know your mum. Jesus was probably married to Mary 
Magdalene but the first catholic pope turned her from Jesus’ equal and rich in her own right, (being quite likely a high priestess) to being made a bit part and a whore.

3233,"Hi sis, first of all you're very young. I would highly highly recommend you spend your twenties invested in education, developing your skills, schooling (STEM if you can), reading and gaining knowledge, and cultivating relationships with strong older women and those your age if you can find them.

With regards to your mom, that's ok! There is probably a generational gap, but as long as there is love you don't need to agree on everything! Always cherish your mom as you seem to 🥰

Now the other thing is that you should rethink what it means to 'be alone'. Just because you may not be married or have kids (btw you can still have or adopt kids down the line without a guy), doesn't mean you're alone. As a single 30 year old, the most cherished relationships for me are those with my fellow female friends who are like my sisters. Society has really done a number in convincing us that if you're not in a hetero nuclear family, you're ""alone"". It's bs that simply reinforces the patriarchy.

Now , I'd also recommend reading, so you can become more confident in your choice. The obvious recommendations are authors like Simon de Bouvier, Dworkin, to help you solidify your beliefs. 

But in terms of coping, I'd highly recommend looking into Stoicism. It's a worldview that emphasizes being virtuous, relying on oneself, and not allowing outside influences to affect you. If you can start getting into Stoicism at 18 I promise you will be ahead of the curve. 

Finally and most importantly, learn to enjoy your own company. Go on adventures with yourself, in nature, in the city, whatever. Learn to think of yourself as being WITH yourself and opposed to BY yourself. Become the type of person you are proud of.

You seem intelligent and thoughtful and I'm sure you will do great. Keep in mind that as you get into your twenties you may feel isolated because that's when young women typically do start to get into more serious relationships etc but don't let that away you.

3244,"I am a few years older than you and not firmly WGTOW yet, and I think that's okay.

But I do believe that it is a very real possibility that I chose to spend my life alone atm. For me it is very empowering for the following reasons

1) I know I would not end up in a relationship just for the appearance and social value. Every women in my life who is in a bad relationship didn't want to end up alone. Now, going through emotional abuse, they wish their partner would leave them alone.

2) I have learned to enjoy my own company and learning more and more about myself every day. The amount of fun that a woman can have by herself is one of the best kept secrets lol. I mean I do not support incel like mentality. I have friends from all genders that I adore and enjoy spending time with. But at the end of the day I know there is one person who truly has my back and that's myself. 

3) Finally, knowing that fear of ending up alone wouldn't make me beg for men or suffer through things that I shouldn't have to suffer through, it is a peaceful thought. 

For me WGTOW is not necessarily cutting off all men from my life right away, but realizing how my life would continue to be sweet af if I don't chose the traditional marriage and kids route.

3335," Androcentrism has affected my life through the person of my mother. My mom was a beautiful, smart and sassy woman, whose psyche was destroyed by the strongly sexist culture and family environment in which she was born and spent the first twenty years of her life.  She was born in Southern Italy, in a family where only male children were valued. She was the second daughter, so in my grandmother's fantasy she had to be born a boy. He never got over the disaffection received from his mother and the probable abuse. So she ended up developing a narcissistic  disorder.  And, unfortunately, she too, more or less consciously, would have liked to have a son. She was more affectionate than my grandmother, but that is the essence.

3611,"A bit of a mix of radfem and libfem. Imho, almost all gender differences are the result of socialisation. The way boys and girls/men and women are treated by others is so different, we might as well be different species. Most men will never understand the way women are treated in society (unless maybe they're extremely self-reflective about society and their own upbringing). The large majority of men just can't be feminists because they don't get the female experience. As a result, there are very few men who are truly empathetic, simply because they never have to be (quite the opposite, sensitive men are put down by other men...). 

I'm against pornography and prostitution,  but I'm not sure if the Nordic model is the best way to deal with it. As long as economic inequalities exist, some women will turn to forms of sex work and illegality will make them more vulnerable (even if it's only the men being prosecuted - they're their way of making money, after all). Ending economic inequalities and giving all women financial stability should be the first goal in ending sex work. 

I think all feminism catering to men or trying to get men on the board is mostly useless. The majority of men simply benefits from patriarchy in too many ways. Even the soft, more feminine types. There are ways in which men would benefit from a more egalitarian society (such as spending more time with their kids, more true emotional connections,...), but these are things  most men don't value enough to give up their chance for money and power over. 

I think governments should do a lot more to enforce gender equality. Such as making it mandatory that parental leave is split 50/50 (or else part of it expires - with exceptions for single parents, of course). Single earner/SAHP households should not get any tax benefits, but rather pay more taxes, unless both parents stayed at home for an equal amount of time. That said, marriage should not grant people tax benefits at all, but rather having children (if at all). Honestly, I'd abolish marriage altogether. Having companies that don't have 50/50 quotas in higher positions have to PROVE that the man they hired actually fits the hiring criteria than the women who applied. Same for people of colour/different cultural backgrounds (on a quota based on the distribution of inhabitants of a country). Giving all women free and safe access to birth control and abortion. Giving lesbians and single women access to adoption and IVF. Not releasing drugs that were not tested on women. 

More women in police force/governmental positions/judicature positions. Harsher sentences for violent men. Laws that protect women from crimes such as under-skirting, sharing nudes, revenge-porn,... (where they are not already in action).  Measures to  combat economic inequalities, such as finally taxing the rich and guaranteeing working people fair wages. Inheriting anything of larger monetary value should simply be illegal - children of rich people already have large benefits due to better education etc., no reason to allow them to gain a large amount of resources they never had to work for. Investing in good quality schools and preschools to give all children access to good education. Not allowing companies that use slave labour or exploit poorer countries to sell their products. All these points are from a pretty European perspective, in other countries, different measures might be useful. 

That said, none of this is going to happen, as pretty much all governments/executive/judicature orders are deeply rooted in patriarchy and no real change will be allowed.",Environmental_Bread7,2021-05-01 09:54:50,2021-05-01 16:18:18,/r/wgtow/comments/n1rik4/which_type_of_feminism_do_you_identify_with/gwixsyf/,t3_n1rik4,wgtow,1,1,2021-05-01 16:18:18

I've never been protected by any man, including my 'father'. so sometimes there is that infantile wish to just be taken care of. but I snap out of it when I take care of myself. bc I do a much better job at it than any man could.

also, men are never as good as you want them to be. there is this guy that I thought was okay (he looks beautiful and is smart and he laughs at my jokes). but yesterday a woman told me that he's apparently quite arrogant and annoying LMAO. I applauded her for putting him in his place. so yeah. I take it as a compliment when he stares at me (which is also kinda hilarious), but I would not take him home. men, in general, are disappointing. they are clowns.

It's important to become your own person. I do that by having hobbies that I LOVE!! I am writing my own short stories (and eventually a book). I am becoming so much better at it. why would I spend my valuable free time on a man? I want and need that time to become better at my hobby. that's much more fulfilling than being in a relationship.

Also, I love getting to know who I am. I think other people distract you from yourself. that's why so many people are addicted to relationships. I need and want to work through years of neglect, abuse and other traumas. I want to get to know myself. I need solitude for that. all of this can be painful but it's necessary. I don't want to be a vapid person who is addicted to romance. Nah. I can do better than that.

you can figure it out. don't romanticize men. don't glorify them. value yourself. build self esteem. you got this. and don't be hard on yourself when you do end up obsessing over them. like I said, it's a process.",tidalgrief,2021-05-01 07:22:31,2021-05-01 14:42:54,/r/wgtow/comments/n2bwln/how_do_i_stop_being_so_obsessed_with_men/gwiohfz/,t3_n2bwln,wgtow,3,1,2021-05-01 14:42:54

Actually I have a question I made in AskHistorians and AskFeminists and nobody replied. It was about the relationship between the black people rights movements and feminism and also asking if its typical that civil rights leaders reject the help from whites.

This was based on my observation of Malcom X movement. Obviously nation of Islam was against race integration so naturally they'd refuse a black man to date white women. But then I found an article saying that Malcom X actually mistreated white women (slapping them and stealing money because they could always go ask more to daddy according to him) while never doing that to black women. He took revenge on white women and thought getting a white girl was like a trophy because he'd be ""stealing"" the girl from the white men who for centuries raped black women.

Also then I found another article of a black activist saying he often got the question from whites asking what they could do to help... And according to him it was mostly from white women. I was curious, why mostly women? Do black people consider white women were equally or less guilty for things like slavery and systemic racism? Also Malcom X yelled for the ""death"" of white men. Not sure that includes white women too.  A black activist of my country said something like that recently and everyone was offended but I was like ""weeeellll, he said white men... I am a woman"" lol

I do personally tend to be more complacent with black men because I feel like we both belong to oppressed classes...

3712,"It might seem strange but I’m not afraid to die. I don’t give a fuck if I’m dead and oddly enough, im not suicidal(anymore). I learned to get over the fear of dying alone by thinking of all the cool shit I would do. I’m going to learn to fish, fight, paint, make diy projects travel to wherever the fuck I want, eat healthy, go to the beach, learn a new language, study things that I care about, read, possibly start my own business. Sure it gets lonely sometime because I wish that I had someone to share my viewpoint with but then I realized that people are work. When you get involved with people, your freedom becomes more limited. That’s why I’m extra picky on being alone. I have a whole lot of shit I want to do and if I don’t get to do it, I’m okay with that because I like my company. I’m comfortable being alone in a room of silence. I feel peaceful. I have more energy to do the things I want when I’m alone because no one is there to suck the energy out of me.

Also, this may sound morbid/strange, but I imagine myself dying alone at old age. It doesn’t seem so bad because I’m already used to being alone so I know what it feels like. Besides, if other people are there while I’m dying, it’ll straight up annoy me lol. I guess I’m just extremely introverted.

3714,"&gt;though some would say that is what 'they' want

Nah, we're oppressed because 'they' want us to have babies. Take a look at what the Chinese govt is doing right now which is censoring feminists telling women not to have children or the countries with abortion bans or the ones chopping off 800 girls clits per day, marrying them off to grown men and saying you aren't a real woman without having children. The capitalists need their labor class. Anti natalistists are very rare and seen as crazy, it's definitely not what the majority wants even though the result is sparring children from forcing them to experience pain, suffering and inevitable death they didn't ask for. 

&gt;humans are in between beasts and gods - enough to have existential angst but not enough to do anything about it. 

That's very apt actually

All books are in PDF form. If you want access, please send me a chat/message and I will happily add you as a viewer on the drive, after ensuring you're genuine (I'll have a look at your history). 

I hope you can all gain some knowledge, there are some really good reads in there. I'm trying to read one book per month this year, and I encourage you all to make some sort of reading goal for yourself!

&gt;The film tells the personal stories of rural women who make their way to Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, seeking treatment for obstetric fistula, a life-shattering complication of childbirth. Filmed in a starkly beautiful landscape, the documentary juxtaposes the isolated lives of village women who are outcasts because of their medical condition, with the faraway hospital that offers a miracle after a long and arduous trek—a “walk to beautiful.”    
&gt;  
&gt;Rejected by their husbands and ostracized by their communities, these women are left to spend the rest of their lives in loneliness and shame. Instead they make the long and arduous journey to Fistula Hospital in Addis Abba where they reclaim their lost dignity. The trials they endure–and their attempts to rebuild their lives–tell a universal story of hope, courage, and transformation.

3792,"Lol I hear you, but this story should make you feel better about yourself and all the bullets you're dodging by pursuing this lifestyle. 

I'd suggest maybe getting off social media, especially if you're at the age when many of your acquaintances are getting married/having kids, and if you feel like it may have an impact on how you feel about yourself (although your stance seems very strong, it can be easy to see all these pictures that feed into the traditional societal narrative and think very briefly ""damn, am I f'ng up?""). The answer is, no, you're not. 

If you're looking for some words of support/validation here they are: you are literally making one of the best decisions a woman can make. To decide to be unencumbered by the traditional tropes that very often pull women down (marriage/kids), is one of the most liberating things you can do. The road will be lonely at times, but the satisfaction of knowing that you won't have to put up with a ton of bs that comes with the normal narrative and that you'll have the freedom to do whatever the hell you want with few strings, is incredibly powerful. If you want some quotes:

To live alone is the fate of all great souls  - Schopenhauer

The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself. - Kipling.

Also this whole sexual liberation thing was important but at this point it just serves the interest of men.

Not so amazing for the women who then later, after some unpleasant experiences, find out casual sex for us women is not that good or beneficial.

But still some men contacted me with that sole purpose because they thought that's what ""open minded"" meant. And when I refused they were like ""oh you are not so open minded then"".

Obviously they're male-identified women, most of them have sons and/or husbands and believe men can be changed. They believe men aren't consciously exerting their privilege and their power and that maybe if they can make them empathize with the female condition, then maybe, just maybe they might see women as human beings. Ugh, I'm glad I haven't reached this astronomical level of denial.

3885,"Because a woman is inherently more valuable than a man duh 🤷‍♀️ - in evolution female choice matters way more than male does (because we invest in the species more), so misogynistic attitude is a way to humblify women to make them as insignificant as an average male. Like globally to make men equal in contribution to society one must decrease female contribution to society first, and thats very hard to say at least - women as an independent group have so much power that no social structure cant overpower it without oppressing women per se. And individually a low-value man can appear better if he says that women are shit, thus decreasing female confidence in themselves and making them settle for less. 
PS: i dont believe in social causes of male ~issues~ with women, it seems to be inherent - men of different upbringing become mras, males of different cultures/species(!) behave the same, testosterone increases social threat perception and dunning kruger effect and misogyny is more similar to an evil strategy than to a mental illness tbh (like that shit is a global regime - men are greedy not sick in the head).",hethrezen,2021-05-07 15:34:18,2021-05-08 05:14:46,/r/wgtow/comments/mxgrer/women_who_think_they_can_mold_their_son/gxa8l1r/,t1_gvqkxip,wgtow,1,1,2021-05-08 05:14:46

The trans brigade is basically saying that sex does not determine gender. Our problem with that is the full knowledge that women are oppressed based on their sex - not the idea that they *identify* as women. 

Radical feminism is growing among older women, we are going after the men who are passing these anti abortion laws and we are working with other feminists &amp; women in order to ensure the legal protection of women’s bodies and rights. 

There have always been many strands of feminism because contrary to what patriarchy would have everyone believe, women are not a hivemind. Radical feminism embraces that many women may not have such “extreme” beliefs but at the same time, we are the only feminists who openly support segregated spaces for women to ensure that men cannot dull, hijack, play down and “not all men” women who would like to speak openly about their struggles and experiences of women.

4048,"Thank you for sharing your experiences. Having lived in all women house for 5 years I can definitely relate to your stories.

One of the reasons why all women intentional communities fascinate me is because it gives Americans the opportunity to actually experiment with ways of living and see for themselves what it is that they want to do. Ultimately any and all freedom of Choice greatly increases the ability to make and accept any choice that is made. 

For example, when I talk to Americans who criticize the nuclear family and idealize a more blended family structure, I often ask them if they've read up on the draw-backs that come from THAT structure, which is largely that mother-in-laws RULE and younger women feel absolutely no autonomy to make choices in their children's lives.

I don't particularly think that any structure is perfect, or doesn't have its drawbacks. We need to protect the elderly, but we also need to innovate without the elderly burdening us with tradition. We need to protect children, but we also have to let go and accept when children make decisions that we don't agree with. We have to be caregivers, but care giving doesn't pay the bills. We all want the five current generations to be treated with equal dignity without sacrificing any of our self-respect. And we have to eat, cloth, and practice hygiene &amp; healthcare while we're at it!

4054,"Feminism has taken a huge backslide due to third and fourth wave feminism thinking the game had already been won. Now, radical feminists who follow second wave feminism focus on the wrong things as well and seem to have been co-opted by the right. Not ALL but quite a number of radical feminists--which are the only ones willing to still aggressively fight for women's rights--align themselves with right-wing association out of mutual hatred of ""Trans"" people.  


So who is left fighting against men? No one, really. Third and fourth wave feminists spend most of their time trying to educate and coddle men and do the emotional work of healing them from ""toxic masculinity"". Radical feminists show a lot of promise, but get side tracked by ideological hatred of gender situation to the point where they will sometimes SIDE with conservatives--which is fucking mind-blowing to me. 

I believe all of these movement have been co-opted--by men. Liberal men who see third and fourth wave feminism as  a way to refocus women's energy on men and reframing objectification as empowering, and hardly focus on women's issues at all. And then conservative right-wing men who find their way into radical feminist groups and redirect what was originally nuanced conversations about the current state of gender ideology to turn it into outright hatred and bigotry--and they use radical feminists to add legitimacy to their hatred of trans people.   


The latter really disappoints me. Where is the focus on MEN AS A CLASS? radical feminism flirts with it, but ultimately always goes back to freaking out about trans people. Even if their criticism is valid, trans people hold very little power and make up a small percentage of men at large. Why are they not focusing on MEN IN POWER--such as Greg Abbott as well as all of the other conservative politicians and their lobbyists who are now pushing our rights BACKWARDS?   


The problem with feminism has always been that men will find a way to co-opt it and direct it to do their will. Women have been too easily swayed by men's direction in their own movements. For instance, radical feminist groups that I was a part of would \*claim\* to be against all male allies, yet they would allow traditional, conservative men SIMPLY because those men questioned trans issues.

4056,"I've lived in and done work for these communities, specifically in S. Oregon. Fly Away Home is beautiful and has two residents, but they are both incredibly stubborn and I imagine hard to live with, at times. I spent time working there and those two are so set in their ways it can be exhausting. They bought the land as romantic partners, split up shortly after, and have lived there together since the late 70s. They still bicker like they broke up yesterday.  However, I did have the wonderful experience of hiking through the mountains with a 71 year old woman who periodically needed to stop and push her uterus back in. The water line for FAH snakes through the siskiyou mountains about two miles to a spring box they share with neighbors. When it's dry, bears and other animals bite through the line hunting for water. Side note, it gets super dry in S. Oregon so they do this multiple times per summer. Men haven't been on their land in decades. 

The land I lived on was near Grants Pass and Rootworks (but wasn't Rootworks. I do have friends who lived there with Mountaingrove, though) and we ran the production offices for We'Moon out of our main house. We'Moon employed most of the women who lived there, and connected those who didn't work for them to a larger local community. It wasn't quite as strict as FAH when it came to men on the land- we have a good drag queen friend who visited frequently and also had men who were friends visit, though they were few and far between. 

I was able to easily support myself doing odd jobs for other women and lesbians (in particular) in the area. Unfortunately, the location makes it less than friendly to BIPOC. The lack of diversity is noticeable and feels VERY encouraged. It's one reason among many that my wife and I chose to leave the area. 

We still talk about buying a big piece of land and building homes on each corner of it, with a community home in the center. I think the younger generation of women values community, but also has a much stronger need for independence and solitude. Sometimes you don't want to talk about your feelings at the required weekly meeting, but that doesn't mean you're turning your back on your landmates. We've also been conditioned as women to hide our feelings, and that can lead to a whole lot of passive aggressive behavior when living in community. Think someone uses too many dishes when they cook? Let's vote to change the rules about who does dishes when that person cooks because I don't like getting my hands pruny. Have an opinion about how the shower curtain should hang after someone showers? Put it on the weekly meeting agenda, right after ""who ate my raw cashews and spirulina?""

^these are all actual things that happened in my experience. 
The answer to who ate the cashews and spirulina was a dog. A male dog. Which we were allowed to have!

Apparently you can get free BC at the Health Dept in the form of pills. Anything else you gotta pay. I know I was on BC once via my dad insurance and shit was $400 for 3 months. 

I was on the Depo shot and that was $100 every 3 months for the shot. It's doable but not really if you're broke. 

I haven't looked into others because I don't have insurance. I'm not sexually active so it doesn't matter anyway. 

And honestly, I don't understand why people would use abortion as a contraceptive. Like, the point is not to get pregnant in the first place. Not get pregnant THEN do something about it.

About other women and men, I don't feel that because as soon as they want to trap me, I cut off the contact.

If they're not married maybe in some places she won't have as much rights to alimony. I personally wouldn't like to depend on a man and if I ever change my mind about having kids I'll either have to be financially independent enough to be able to raise them alone if the guy leaves, or I'll want guarantees the guy will have to chip in for their education if he leaves.

I agree with your sentiment that women need to stand up for themselves and learn to be more aggressive, but I definitely don’t think that’s a comprehensive solution. In some cases, you might get your way; in some cases, that’s a one-way ticket to the morgue. And the men in your family are not universal specimen. I’ve known women that have absolutely gotten their ass kicked trying to “be more aggressive”. The same way not all women would put up with getting their teeth knocked out, not all men will put up with “getting their teeth knocked out” like your grandpa. 

And that’s not to even bring in the discussions of female socialization/victim blaming and do you even *want* to be in a relationship where you have to constantly be on guard and force someone to respect your boundaries. 

I think learning to pick your battles is the smartest way to go about things.

4328,"i do think it's cultural and to your point structural. i actually looked into this a fair amount as a non-poc myself because of certain personal issues i had to deal with so i learned a lot about the dynamics from an outsiders perspective and it seems the gist of what i learned is that because of white \[male\] supremacy men control more of the resources and therefore women have the choice of the 'patriarchal bargain' and many chose to take it and still do because they view the benefits as being 'worth it' enough although there is more pushback as of late and as you state ww doing what bw have been doing for a while now.

and then in other disenfranchised communities especially or in particular the black community in the us (but can be expanded to others that's just where it's the most pronounced - also to a certain extent the latino community i've noticed albeit not as much) the men don't have the resources to provide that 'patriarchal bargain' with so those women become more independent head of household etc. i did also learn about the smaller amount of black women going the other direction with the divestment/swirler movement (which i know are different things but overlap) but it seems most are going the way in which you say. but i find it interesting that there is this subset of woc/bw in particular now who are going the opposite direction and basically wanting patriarchy perhaps because they didn't experience it from their own group in the way they felt like other women have.  

so long story short i think the reason why they didn't follow was because the 'bargain' was good enough for them and now it's not, or they are realizing it never was to begin with. but i actually think it's more because it's just not good enough anymore because there are a lot of women out there who would sign up for it if they got xyz requirements met, hence also why other women are jumping ship to other social groups i have even seen many say they would only do so if higher xyz requirements were met things that they would not require from their own group (usually in terms of resources money etc.)

4339,"Research the countries that you were looking for, and find out what their residency requirements are.

Normally in order to be resident in a foreign country, you need to have a job. And it’s better to find the job before you move, however the challenges most people won’t hire unless you live there.

So you can either move there and stay on your tourist visa and look for a job, or…

You could go to university in the country, and look for a job, so that when university ends you can switch your visa over to a work visa. 

It’s really hard to move to a foreign country, especially with their residency requirements. Yet if you do it under the University, it would be easier. You’ll just need to check to see how you turn a student visa into a proper work visa so you can maintain residency.

Also check out how long residency requirements are. Many countries state that you are a temporary resident for a certain amount of years… Yet if you live there long enough, become a permanent resident. Which means in most countries you don’t need to have a job in order to stay. So if you lose your job, you can stay.

Also check and see what the language requirements are, as well as how long you need to live there before you can apply for citizenship. And double check and make sure that they allow dual citizenship, that is if you want to maintain your current citizenship. 

For example, to live in Spain, you need to have a job. You could also look and see if you can go there and start your own company, but note that the Spanish job market is shit at the moment. As a US citizen, you can live in Spain for six years, and then after that you have a permanent residency card which means you don’t need a job to stay. And at the 10 year mark you can apply for the Spanish passport, and they do recognize dual citizenship 

Another thought is just bounce around the world, become an online entrepreneur, and stay in the country for as long as you’re allowed to on your tourist visa",dissident-fiend,2021-05-28 18:19:51,2021-05-29 23:57:32,/r/wgtow/comments/nmt2y2/are_there_online_support_groups_for_women/gzsck2m/,t3_nmt2y2,wgtow,8,1,2021-05-29 23:57:32

4880,"I wonder how someone can live 7 years with someone like that. I not trying to be offensive, but I never had a serious real long term relationship so it fascinates me... 

So first of all, no guy would touch my money. I don't share my money with anyone, I would never have a shared account. If I lived with the person for a while (say like 1 or 2 years) I could come to the idea of opening a shared account and charging it with a fixed amount of money monthly for the expenses, but I would NEVER give him access to my personal account. And I know how I am, at the slightest suspicious activity, we'd have a serious problem. I am very territorial about my money lol. 

Second of all, I don't date potheads I don't smoke weed or drink that much, so defintely he would not smoke inside the same house where I lived. Or drink too much for that matter. I don't want drunk guys inside my house much less to share a bed with a drunk dude. I can only imagine for me this would not end well... I'd either hurt him, or he'd hurt me depending on who was stronger. I am a Virgo I don't like messes inside my house and my moon is in Scorpio, so dude, be careful when I have access to knives. lol

Third, I am childfree and that includes not having to provide for a dude. If he doesn't make at least the same or more than me, you can forget it. I live in a country with extremely low salaries (even though I am from STEM but even so they are low) so for a guy to make less than me his job would have to be picking strawberries or oranges on a field anyway. 
If he doesn't have a job like me, you can forget it (that would solve the long hours, I mean if he had a job he wouldn't complain about the long hours because he'd have long hours too). I am also not too fascinated about guys with no college degrees.  

Damn if I have to accept a guy who doesn't work, doesn't have a stable job or career, smokes weed, drinks beer then definetely this is not ever going to happen to me... EVER lol. 

All the guys I ever liked were not like that, they were older, had money/house/car didn't use drugs (probably did when younger but not anymore) and it still didn't work lol. 

My family always said I was stingy so maybe this is my natural blessing. 

Despite that you managed to graduate in a field that seems quite interesting and you have a fascinating career goal...so yeah you are successful already. Definetly if you ever date again, ask for a guy that has at least the same that you can offer.

I had a string of toxic relationships with men, culminating in my final long term relationship where I lived with a man for 7 years. He was emotionally and financially abusive, he would coerce me into sex I didn't want, and expected me to cook and clean while also working part time and doing my MArch. He had enough money for beer and weed, but there wasn't enough money to buy me tampons, or formal clothes when I was defending my thesis. 

My plan now? I'm a registered architect - I'm working towards building a career in sustainable urban planning in order to shift the way that people live in urban areas. I strongly believe that we need to take climate action, and the construction industry is one of the most wasteful and culpable in terms of climate change. 

I didn't come to this actively - honestly I did try to start dating again a few years back. Every time I would meet a new guy, he would be super interested in my career, say some bullshit about how I'm 'not like other girls' and then 1-3 months later he would be upset about how long my work hours are.

4903,"I completely relate to having resentment towards yourself in how you handled things, because just last night my brain decided to take a lil jaunt down remember-how-dumb-you-were lane when I couldn’t sleep. 

I would physically cringe when thinking of how I dealt with men in the past, but be kind to yourself. What you went through is a betrayal, and it must have been so difficult to process in the moment. The way you reacted is completely normal, especially when worried about your living situation. 

It helps me to think of those moments as lessons for how I want to act when moving forward, so you change resentment to determination. You had never been in that position before, and now you’ve learned how dangerous it is to be close with people who consume porn. That’s incredible progress! 

Don’t beat yourself up for things you didn’t know because you’re learning. Once you’ve processed it, don’t look back. Just think of how you want to do things moving forward. And remember that women are conditioned to accept these behaviors, so you are literally fighting against generational conditioning when you go through these situations. It’s not your fault. 

It might be a sore spot for a while, but you’ll get over it. I have. Whether or not you choose to confront him is up to you. I highly doubt you will get a satisfying response from him if you choose to speak to him— his actions show entitlement, and the fact that he was nervous means that he *knows* what he did was wrong but he didn’t care. He chose to do it anyway. I’m not sure if anything you say would change that, especially since he chose to violate you even though you two were so close. 

However, only you know what is best for you. If you want to confront him for yourself and your own peace of mind, then go forward. I’m only saying that I don’t think you’ll get anything from him out of it. 

But overall, forgive yourself. We all do the best we can, and you have come so far since!

I know some people here would have women being 100% perfect and only the victims of men.  However, this is simply not true.  Many, if not most, women are more misogynistic than men.  No, it's not because of ""internalized misogyny,"" but because collectively, men and women fear smart, independent women.  Women, like men, see them as threats to their sense of power.  Every woman has gone through this, especially if she's in a male-dominated field or is unmarried without children.  I have even seen it on this sub.  

As for the original post, what she says *is* true in France and Spain: older women tend to be the apologists for men's bad behavior.  Hell, even in the U.S., it's true.

4967,"I actually just read an article that says the most recent generation only merges assets 52% of the time as opposed to 50-70 year olds who merge them 80% of the time. This shows that women have their own assets/money now and don’t need to rely on their men nor want to. 

I feel like women are waking up and will soon see that marriage is just a ridiculous ceremony that is predicated on the ancient practice of a man rearing his daughter like a pig and selling her off to the highest bidder, which still goes on today as well, in various countries. Yemen being just one example where it’s particularly bad. 

In the Mosuo culture at the foothills of the Himalayas, they don’t even have a word for “father”. The kids just live with the mother’s family and their role models are their mother’s brothers. Romantic relationships and familial matters are 100% separate.

4989,"&gt;perverse need to be in control 

Exactly this. Even when they want to be submissive, they direct everything down to the makeup and the shoes and the script. So much for domination. 

The need truly is perverse. That’s why they like to attack powerful women - actresses, politicians, even a woman who just speaks her opinion. I think they have some sort of envy complex with women being the trump-card holders when it comes to sex. Men are completely ruled by their obsession with the female body - that’s why in some cultures women can’t even show an ankle or a wrist. They hate that they want us so badly. 

They commit suicide at three times the rate of women. At least they know they’re depraved, some of them. I know a lot of it is related to depression and things like this but I have a feeling it’s also related to self-disgust, considering they’re responsible for 98-99% of unspeakable crimes.",saralafontaine,2021-05-24 23:12:46,2021-05-25 22:50:15,/r/wgtow/comments/njzrwg/what_is_a_relationship_anyway/gzbvisv/,t1_gzalkpw,wgtow,7,1,2021-05-25 22:50:15

4994,This happened to an old friend of mine. She always was in terrible relationships and felt like a failure in a lot of ways didn't accomplish much like the true codependent I was always rescuing her from these shitty guys and abusive relationships she had no self identity. Then she got pregnant and became a total mombie literally like the most stereotypical worst stuff like my life is complete I live for him blah blah blah doesn't help she has a son so I think there is some weird displaced energy there. Not saying all moms are like this of course but she is definitely unhinged and I think her son is going to be in a lot of therapy in the future due to the enmeshed relationship you can already tell she has with him.

4996,"I'm a younger generation and the guys in my age group are an odd flavor. Either super liberal or more MGTOW-esque. I don't even know if I can say TRP quite honestly, they go on about how feminism has destroyed everything and gripe about how there aren't very many good women anymore. Which I'd agree with if it was liberal feminism as far as the social disease aspect is concerned, but they use feminism as a catch-all as anything remotely to do with women not being in the household. These are obviously generalizations with the two groups, but they do have bearing IRL because the off-hand comment someone makes IRL usually translates as just scratching the surface of expressing themselves online. Young right wing men are oddly entitled, as well, and have this mild smug moral superiority that reminds me of iamverysmart.

4999,"Just a few thoughts/ramblings on this - I think it may self select for being weaker.  Think about it making babies wasn't exactly consensual in the past. If the person could fight you off you couldn't impregnate them they'd run away. These women weren't voluntarily staying around or at least not voluntarily getting pregnant. Maybe in some situations but most probably didn't actually want to have kids and definitely not the number of kids they did want to have. It's only in the very recent past that things have changes for a longgg time this is how our ancestors were. It's also why the moon has been demonized literally. It syncs with our menstrual cycles or it used to. We'd ovulate with the full moon. It was a way for us to control our fertility. They took that away.

I also heard a story not sure if it's true that originally the wedding ring was made because women would literally be tied up, like elephants are today. Eventually with enough conditioning the elephant can be tied to a balloon or a chair or something lightweight that they could easily run away from but they don't because they are conditioned by the fact that it's tied to believe it can't go anywhere. After women were tied up for so long eventually they just tied a string to their finger as a reminder to stay and that's where wedding rings came from. Whether this is real or not I'm not sure as I said too lazy to look it up lol but either way the metaphor is depressing af.

The story ends with him cheating. Oh! And guess what he broke up with me because of work. Someone else had to tell me he cheated on me. He really tried to go out looking like the good guy. 😂

5009,"I remember someone saying something about this on another forum (not Reddit) about how some women don’t have strong identities so it’s easier for them to just fall into motherhood where they have to sacrifice that sense of self for others because they didn’t have a strong sense of self or boundaries to begin with. Many aren’t ambitious either, and think being SAHM is easier (it’s a 24/7 job with no vacation so I don’t know how it is). 

They don’t have a strong identity so they assume the identity of motherhood easily because it gives them purpose even if it’s draining them. 

Its easier to just follow the traditional path then to think critically. However, I’m seeing things changing. This generation is having less s3x, domestic violence has gone up since lockdown and women are divorcing. I’m seeing more women confident in their decision to just be single and live life. 

I’m reading about movements in Korea and China where women are deciding to create little communes with their friends and just raise their children together. However, I mostly see this online.

I'm mainly talking about western women. A third world shit hole is different. Why a western woman would make it her goal to get married and especially get married and start a family the traditional way, and have her life be male-centered is beyond me. Brainwashing only excuses so much, this isn't the same as some MK Ultra brainwashing where we act like Manchurian candidates whenever we hear trigger words. I feel like most women in these spaces had something that they would consider the ""straw that broke the camel's back"", as far as them snapping to. Many women have had those experiences, but it either doesn't register or they refuse to let it do so.

In my anecdotal experience, I was very, very willful as a child- not a trouble maker, but did not like being told what to do and did not like that I was told, either directly or indirectly, that people grow up and get married and have families. I didn't like the idea of a husband and especially kids. Barring the fact that I was a very big tomboy, the concept of princesses disgusted me, because they seemed so pathetic and I got almost second-hand embarrassment from them. I remember watching some movie on ABC Family when I was ten, it was about some country girl that got pregnant as a teen, sounds bad but it was supposed to be some weird heartfelt movie and she may have given her kid up for adoption. Anyway, she gives birth in a fucking Walmart and I freaked out and started crying to my mom that I didn't want that to happen to me.

Or in personal relationships. “I know we’ve only been dating three weeks, but I love you! Let’s move in together!” It has a financial component, not unlike marriage.

I definitely wish it wasn't this way more than I could ever describe but if it wasn't this way then the idea of our species going exstinct would be worst. Apparently over 90% of the species that have ever existed on Earth are gone now so exstinction is natural. So from that standpoint what gets me is as we approach environmental extinction that some people like the rich will survive to continue to proprogate and will have the technology to control people even more and extend our lifetimes.

I'd say be gentle with yourself as you dare to peek behind the curtain of humanity this way; that the vast majority doesn't, if it doesn't feel somewhat liberating to you to know these things. You're brave and astute to do so but even those kinds of people must practice things like meditation so as to reduce your stress and anxiety by shrinking your amygdala, help ground you in the present and be entirely less reactive.

5092,"Oh yes, the same for me. I was a virgin up until 24 (almost 25) and it was starting to weight me down. 
The stereotype says that girls who are virgins in that age is because they had some sort of sexual trauma (nop never had a sexual trauma, in fact a childhood friend of mine was molested by a family member and she has a LTR stable relationship so definetely not that), are religious (I sympathize with the Communist Party, that'd be an interesting combination lol) or have some sort of disease. I masturbated, I was not religious and never had any sexual trauma. Being a virgin, I felt I'd only attract the religious freaks, guys who like to slut shame women, arabs, and other freaks who want the girl to be a virgin for marriage (nop, not that either I am chilfree and don't believe in the traditional model of family).

So because I didn't like what being a virgin meant, I wanted to lose it. Also to see what's all the fuss about. I met a guy and lost it. I met him a few times in the context of events, we exchanged numbers, texted for a couple of weeks and then had a short weekend thing where I lost it. I didn't see him again after that, he doesn't live in my country, and then he decided to spend time with one of his exes so I told him to fuck off in a very unpolite manner so he blocked me anyway. 

Since then, I never had sex again (3 yrs have passed). I thought that I wanted to. I was chatting with a guy and was excited to meet him when restrictions were lifted, he seemed to be on the same page as me, not very sex driven, chilfree, he said he could live without sex and just wanted to focus on his stuff...that is of course until an available woman moved in to where he was staying. Then he started having sex with her and said that he was actually in love with her, but only told me this after she dumped him. While he was seeing her, he kept chatting with me normally and keeping up the plans to meet and never telling me he was involved with someone else. So I told him to fuck off. If that's what I have to endure to have a sexual partner, then hell no. 


Pre pandemic I used to go to events often, I actually made the first move to ask for number and invite guys I liked. So it's not like I am hiding. But the guys who are interested on me I don't find attractive and the ones I like always have something (either they are commited, or just passing by or not interested).

I am not willing to settle for someone I dislike, my sex libido is not that high, I am chilfree and I am used to being alone, so not very concerned anymore. 

Another thing I should mention is while I was a virgin it was much harder for me to discard men because I was so focus on sex and male approval. After getting some and seeing how useless it is, I just stopped worrying so much about it.",Shadowgirl7,2021-05-02 20:21:14,2021-05-03 05:30:10,/r/wgtow/comments/n3djj2/in_defense_of_no_strings_attached_sexual/gwpf3zj/,t3_n3djj2,wgtow,5,1,2021-05-03 05:30:10

...has been the alternative.

5174,"my obsession with getting approval from men via romantic relationships stems from my ocd so my first piece of advice might not apply to you if that’s not a similar situation for you. I first had to accept that the thoughts were happening and that they weren’t what I actually wanted. just because the thoughts are happening doesn’t make them real. you know in your heart what you want. your brain just needs time to adjust. 

the rest of my advice I think is applicable regardless of where the root of the obsession lies. 

get a female therapist and invest as much of yourself as you can into self improvement. fall in love with yourself and taking care of yourself. 

invest whatever time you’re not investing in self improvement into nurturing female friendships. just because you’re single doesn’t mean you have to be “alone”. I might be biased because I’m currently living with my best friend as roommates, but I never feel alone even though I’m single. if you’re living on your own, try and have at least once a week zoom or in person meetups with female friends. 

get a pet. seriously. I felt so alone before I was able to have my cat with me and now I never feel truly alone. a pet will love you better than any man ever could. 

get a hobby unrelated to your field that you’re proud of. I highly recommend painting or some kind of art creation. don’t worry about it being “good” just enjoy the act of creation.  

know that progress is a journey and it’s not linear. there are peaks and valleys and stops.",faceless-old-woman,2021-05-01 16:20:05,2021-05-01 22:44:43,/r/wgtow/comments/n2bwln/how_do_i_stop_being_so_obsessed_with_men/gwk0h96/,t3_n2bwln,wgtow,3,1,2021-05-01 22:44:43

Of course, these are the specific names for the South Asian Way, but I've found that most religions, philosophies and spiritual practices break down to relatively the same four spiritual developments.

If community service is your primary path, that's great. I love volunteering as well, I've been a nonprofit administrator for five years. Active especially on issues of housing, safety, and food availability.

However, spiritually, my primary path will probably continue to be self-mastery, as hundreds of thousands of nuns before me. I especially respect Amish and Quaker culture. (I'm from Ohio).

5504,"Coming back with some feedback after months of trying to practice having good posture myself. This is what I've done on a daily basis and noticed improvements in my posture within a week :

1. Upper and lower body stretches (especially those that target the thoracic area and lower back, yoga has a lot of these)

2. Identify specific issues you have and address them. eg if you've posture issues like pelvic tilt (I have Anterior Pelvic Tilt), implement the workouts/stretches into your daily routine that target those areas. You can find a ton of those on youtube.

3. (very impotant) If you're working a desk job or have to sit a lot at work, record yourself working while sitting and make corrections to your posture accordingly (did it with my phone or tablet every time for 30 mins). I heard getting lumbar support cushions/ergonomic chairs help a lot but I personally have not used them. 

4. This was pretty difficult for me to implement while in I was working in the office, but I try to go for walks/breaks/stretch my muscles after 30 mins of sitting down. Sitting down continuously for long hours actually strains specific muscles and thus it gets inflamed/achy/painful easily. 

5. Massages. Couldn't afford getting a massage every day so I read up on trigger points and how to effectively massage them. I do this at least once a day targeting problem areas like my neck, chest and back. I usually combine kneading with my hands and leaning against a wall with a lacrosse ball in between.",sulkyscout,2021-04-30 08:13:41,2021-04-30 15:25:15,/r/wgtow/comments/kex0dg/thursday_self_help_day/gweggco/,t1_ggcj1hq,wgtow,2,1,2021-04-30 15:25:15

I wanted (want?) to be in a relationship because I want to feel like someone has my back and cares about me.

So having someone to which I am the priority would be good.

But that doesn't exist really, not for me at least. And maybe it's my ""fault"" because I grew so independent I don't really have a place to be dependent on someone else. I also don't like to be vulnerable because I know most people will just use that to hurt me.

5727,"My friend had amazing wedding pictures. 4 years alter she is getting a divorce because he was a multiple cheater. Lovely wedding photos doesn't mean anything. 

She has turned to me a lot as a shoulder to cry on which is fine. I finally talked her out of dating guys and focus on herself. She finally deleted Tinder and Snapchat after going through some terrible treatment from men she met online. 

She finally got her own place and is paying for the entire divorce herself. I'm just glad she has finally decided to listen to me with dropping men. She says that she had been feeling a lot better by focusing on herself. 

Self healing is an absolute blessing.",Hmtnsw,2021-05-01 14:23:57,2021-05-01 20:04:38,/r/wgtow/comments/n2bbh6/im_looking_at_my_friends_wedding_pics_and_her/gwjk7xa/,t3_n2bbh6,wgtow,7,1,2021-05-01 20:04:38
5728,Go watch videos of them hitting/degrading insulting woman will lose any attraction towards them.They have nothing to offer except misery and suck the last blood of you .Ever visited a hospital you would know these m0r0ns are 7x more likey to leave on there sick partners. Males have nothing no offer absolutely expect misery and violence.,ytuinksoib09,2021-05-01 14:23:00,2021-05-01 20:03:24,/r/wgtow/comments/n2bwln/how_do_i_stop_being_so_obsessed_with_men/gwjk36m/,t3_n2bwln,wgtow,3,1,2021-05-01 20:03:24

5730,"I'm still deprogramming so maybe things will change for me, but I feel somewhere in the middle. Like I agree with a lot of radfem stuff and separatism but also pragmatically in my day to day life there are advantages to some aspects of performative femininity. I think if I had enough money though I wouldn't care. I also may date men for entertainment. I relate more to the concept of 'divestment' but from my understanding that is a black women's movement of which I am not but that word most closely describes my views at the present moment.",level_up_always,2021-05-01 14:14:35,2021-05-01 19:53:30,/r/wgtow/comments/n1rik4/which_type_of_feminism_do_you_identify_with/gwjj2p3/,t3_n1rik4,wgtow,1,1,2021-05-01 19:53:30
5731,"&gt;We're not sad about that though since misanthropy and antinatalism is also apart of this feminism.

I don't understand how you're not sad about it tho :( because you are doing your part to discontinue the species? I agree with you and am antinatalist myself but I still wish it wasn't this way it seems to be the only logical conclusion though. Maybe more deprogramming is needed, but that also tends to make me sadder I can only handle so much at once.",level_up_always,2021-05-01 14:11:18,2021-05-01 19:49:39,/r/wgtow/comments/n1rik4/which_type_of_feminism_do_you_identify_with/gwjioh9/,t1_gwhrzb5,wgtow,1,1,2021-05-01 19:49:39
