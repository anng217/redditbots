The community rules say that’s not the purpose of this subreddit. I replied with an example that, to me, proves it’s wrong to speak in absolutes about these things. And it’s important to me, as a feminist, to also specifically avoid spouting off misandry.

I thought that would be a shared value here. I thought it all would be seen as appropriate to be rational to not commit the same mistakes that so many men make in how so many of them treat us as women (as second-class citizens or lesser people). If the main complaint is that it’s terrible that men can be so sexist, I’d assume people would want to avoid being a hypocrite about hating on the basis of sex...

But it was kind of lame how unwelcoming a couple people were, upset about what I thought was reasonable and acceptable commentary. Because the purpose here is obviously actually *not* to be rational and anti-sexist and avoid hypocritical hate.

[],,ketobillyalaska,,,[],,,,text,t2_9k53uex5,False,False,[],"An insight I gave to one of the more ‘egalitarian’ men there: 

I am the poster there and am banned but would like to enlighten you:
1. Sexuality is very personal for a lot of people. So your idea of it being backward Western ideas is very flawed. If you are anti work because of its exploitative nature, then anti porn/prostitution people too can be for the same reason.

2. I hadn’t mentioned those points initially because I overestimated the capacity of cognition of a lot of commenters there. I was interested in understanding the hypocrisy of consumers of porn/prostitution when it comes to consent and ethics. Any consent given under duress or force is not consent. Exchange of money in itself implies lack of true consent. I had hoped too much for ANs to understand this simple point. Thus, I edited my post to become that long to accommodate such expositions which I assumed ANs, of all people, would understand.

3. As for Amsterdam. You do know that the system can’t be repeated everywhere. No one size fits all. And even it is rife with uncountable loopholes and injustices. Try researching before setting it as an example of a haven for victims of this industry. And thus the need to not further oppress women or give them minimal compensation for their exploitation, but to urge men to not involve themselves in situations where exploitation and violence is a given. Not creating demand would automatically stop supply. If you wish to help such women, provide money or money-generating avenues other than selling bodies - which isn’t just limited to the physical structure but affect psychology, health, well-being and unforgivable acts of creation of children who also become a part of the same rut. I don’t think men who use such victims ever think if they fathered multiple children over the course of their existence and what happened to those children. So the abuse is not as simplistic as equating to capitalist exploitation in jobs. It is a vicious circle unfathomable to so many men because they don’t carry a womb.

4. And while I am not the victim I am someone who has worked for the betterment and rehabilitation and empowerment of such desperate souls. So I know what I am talking of. What you are talking is actually the tiniest corner of this industry where people are thought of as cattle (and being a vegan, that in itself is unethical, but we aren’t discussing animal rights). So yes, this is a person from the said industry. And it is still not about my viewpoint but the victims. Most don’t want to be there. They weren’t adults when they were trafficked or sold or bought or deceived for many many number of reasons when they trusted people in authority- which included both men and women, but we both know who are the majority - which if I were a man would still own. Yes, men are the greatest consumers, distributors, producers and enablers of this crime against millions of women and children majorly and men (lesser by a huge margin). We don’t see the demand of multiple women pissing on a lone male. Or one male being gangraped on film, nor going by the rape statistics in real life. I am human enough to acknowledge that. If I were a male, I still would, with much much shame on part of my fellow men. 

The answer is not in giving women paltry compensations but lies with men - because they hold the power over most of such existences. Women don’t habitually and statistically more visit brothels and rape women. Women don’t 
rape children, male and female, in schools and orphanages and places of worship and child prostitution rings. Women aren’t the mafia kings. Women who exist there are mostly those who spent an entire life in it, nipped in the bud as young kids. Groomed and pornified, sexualised, prostituted. Majorly. 

In life there are always exceptions. We work for the greater moral good - not who benefits most or the few who benefit or are okay with an exploitative system. If that were the case, slavery would still be legal (it is a different form of slavery in the modern world, but I hope you get it), Africans would still be where they are, much of the developing world is not the rosy picture of porn prostitution of cam work and sex toys etc. You have cherry-picked prostitution where it is not as horrendous but there are aspects of it that will chill you to the bone if it were your child/wife/sister/mother/partner or male relation or friend. 

So please don’t mix this unfortunate pleading with men to not put most women, children and some men in a situation which is not a matter of life and death for them as consumers of a few moments of satisfaction, release and the stench that arises from such power play",,,1615866009,{},gr35cty,True,t3_m5k12y,False,True,t3_m5k12y,/r/wgtow/comments/m5k12y/how_ethical_men_fail/gr35cty/,1615869331.0,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Yet it’s supposed to be the worst thing and I need to attach myself to someone immediately or else I’m miserable. I realized that men are the ones who need to be attached to women, that’s why if their wife gets sick/dies they remarry quickly or cheat on her. I noticed this when dating, so many of the single guys had just broken up with their gf and were on the rebound. Even if a guy says he’s “single” he’s still messing with women. Maybe that’s why so many women feel drained from dating them, because they’re trying to drain healthy vibrant women. If she’s not healthy, they move on to the next to care for them. 

I’ve had guy friends I haven’t seen in ages meet up with me imo just to tell me all their emotional problems then go “I can’t tell this to my guy friends” meanwhile their guy friends are right there while they’re saying this so basically women are “emotional dumpsters” to men. I feel sorry for some of them because they’ll have all these guy friends but still complain they’re lonely if their woman leaves them. Their relationships with each other shallow that’s why I think they don’t really know how to emotionally support a woman, they’re just glad to have that emotional support but they don’t know how to reciprocate it back (women learn how to in our relationships). Instead they’re thrown in the wild and women are basically expected to “raise grown men”, and the fact that so many women are saying the same thing ACROSS the world tells me it’s not just in our heads. They have no coping skills and can’t care for themselves without women. They benefit the most from relationships but it’s women they pressure to get into them not men. It’s a trap lol, that’s why they have to sell us all these fairytales to make our servitude look “glamorous”

The blood in her eyes, sighs, skies.
---
Not only these silent home walls
but in the deafening dark of your unknown lanes,
shrapnel pierce the existence, the names,
sometimes as acid,
sometimes as rain,
incessant, un-giving, monstrous,
and vain.
But you don't stop.
You don't stop.
You cut open wounds barely closed.
Her gut tumbles out, helpless,
exposed.
Safe? But where?
At home? School? Or Work?
From behind screens, in the Deep End,
darker things lurk ...
For flesh to be seen, smelled, and grabbed,
ground, kinked, forked, and gagged,
infinite hands baiting, baiting ...
Tongues and eyes, waiting, waiting.
Do you hear the fingernails scratching,
scratching the door?
The butchering minds of family, friend, foe ...
There is no place, no place she can go.
Accused.
How she walks wrong,
speaks wrong, wears wrong,
hell, every time she breathes,
she breathes wrong!
Strange, she birthed the world yet
she ain't strong?
Good for nothing raises men, but fails lifelong!
So stuff. Pump. Just ram and ram!
Do her in. Slam. Slam.
Trivial?
Not yet.
Then try your slurs once more!
One, two, three and four ....
You think feminized, but not on will?
Wait, wait, let the insult graph build ...
How civilized! Now that's a thrill!
C'mon now, don't be so shrill!
Boys being boys! Innocent drill!
 
On and on, justified,
after all 'fun' is prime!
Groomed. Degraded. Mortified.
Little girls. Two to five.
Sexualized.
Objectified.
Nine and ten. Pornified.
From shoulders, armpits, waist,
to nipples, legs, and thighs.
What age? Consent? You silly thing!
Shush, shush! Let the 'little man' sing ...
Long last sure comes the 'prize' …
she learns fast she has to hide:
From streets at night, 'coz you can see.
Her talents' might, 'coz you can see.
Hopes it mars, 'coz you can see.
Emotions, scars, 'coz you can see.
Need and want, 'coz you can see.
Her shadow gaunt, 'coz you can see.
Blood on sheets, 'coz you can see.
And fear that eats, 'coz you can see.
But 'can' you see?
---
UNTOUCHED. Shamed. Touched. Blamed.
Unmarried. Shamed. Broken. Blamed.
Childfree. Shamed. Childless. Blamed.
Homemaker. Shamed. Ambitious. Blamed.
Quiet. Shamed. Vocal. Blamed.
Homely. Shamed. Appealing. Blamed.
Abandoned. Shamed. Divorced. Blamed.
Re-married. Shamed. Widowed. Blamed.
Dead … the woman reclaimed!
---
That strings are reined by powerful males
yet she is shamed ...
That men are milked and killed by other men, but she is blamed ...
Women, children, everywhere, yet she more shamed ...
Devoured. Trafficked. Prostituted. Sold.
Blamed and blamed …
Raped. Battered. Burnt. Left in cold.
Damned and shamed ...
The list ain't slim. The list ain't slim.
Priests and uncles, rich and high,
from poor Joe to the family guy ...
Virgin spring dumped into gloom.
Heart is tired. Night is doomed.
Little girls yet to bloom, yet to bloom.
To beg for justice, one's basic right!
At homes, in courts, no end in sight ...
Why the hatred, men?
Why? But why?
You parade us as mothers, sisters, daughters, wives,
yet criminally increase our daily plight.
Feminazis for dignity, opportunity, safety to thrive ...
How proudly you Protectors eclipse the light!
Scared of the granter, the flourish of life,
you throttle her in the womb before it's time.
You rape her, degrade her, fists clenched tight.
And if something remains,
you stab her, delete her, in your gory delight.
Shame.
The toxic, sadistic thorn of masculinity.
The brutal farce, the ugly mark of virility.
---
HURT.
Hurt.
Hurt.
By silence, when words were needed.
By hate, when love was needed.
By inaction, when support was needed.
By neglect, when care was needed.
By insecurity, when pride was needed.
By control, when nurture was needed.
By fraud, when faith was needed.
By distance, when talk was needed.
By indifference, when concern was needed.
By absence, when presence was needed.
By hands, when heart was needed.
By impotency, when strength was needed.
By rods, when rights were needed ...
By the bestial, when humane was needed.
 
THE END.
---
In the name of wars, or honor, or game,
the sickness of desire, of patriarchy and fame,
from lips that you cracked,
trust that you smacked,
jaw that you broke,
in sheer disgust of vaginas you tore,
red blood gushing,
red blood crushing inhumanity of yore.
No more, no more ...
Slit, tortured throats. Un-slit, tortured throats.
Red, oh red! Pity, you can't see what holds.
Radicalized, it rises, it floats.
From each dead drop it quotes and quotes ...

Machiavelli wrote that when a Prince takes power, if he needs to kill someone, said Prince should better organize the full bloodshed at once, and then be peaceful and kind. That this would make people hate him less and would create a better impression of him overall in time than needing to attack or kill or imprison enemies regularly during the years.

You can be annoyed a 100 times because you want to be polite, and people will keep pushing on you. Be burning hell furious once, and they will remember.  


In short: write what you want to say to your mother until you have clear ideas yourself. Memorize it. Next time she tries to pressure you, you stop her, firmly but politely. If she tries again, you go ballistic, get furious and, in a firm voice but without screaming, explain in the bitchiest way possible why you are NOT going to do what she wants of you, and why if she wants a marriage, partner or kids, she is going to have to do all that herself.

Do not, do NOT, by ANY means, in no way, shape or form, touch the stock market without having read that book, all 600-700 pages, and having UNDERSTOOD it. I am going to give you the shortest possible summary: ""a share has a *value* and a *price*. The value is what it's really worth due to the company's worth. The price is what it sells for. Buy shares when the price is lower than their value. Sell when the value is higher than the price"". The rest of the book is learning to do this.

Do NOT, by any means, no way, never, ride on other people's brains or accept advice from someone else. Do not use ""copy"" systems in traders. And DO NOT, EVER, BY ANY REASON, FOLLOW ANY FASHION, TREND OR HYPE that you see in TV and mass media. N-E-V-E-R.

And the most important rules (though they appear in the book):

1. **Do not** invest money you might need (NEVER invest all of your savings).
2. Be ready for the EMOTIONAL part of investing. Your shares WILL go down, and you must not be scared and sell. They will also go up, you might sell at a great profit... and then find out they are worth even more. If you are not able to deal with this emotional rollercoaster, then do not get into it. The main reason why you should not put all your savings on investments is because if you actually need that money, the fear when the shares go down will kill you. Or, for example, I bought Tesla at 150-200 and within the range, and sold at 400. It went up to 850 (and more, because of a 5:1 split) after that. But I have to think my decision was sound: I still think the company was overpriced at 400, and I paid my mortgage with the profits. I did the right thing. You will NEVER be the person who buys lowest or sells highest, so learn to deal with that. If you cannot deal with that, do not touch the stock market with a ten foot pole.
3. As Warren Buffet said: ""If you wouldn't have them ten years, don't have them ten minutes"". Which can be summarized better in...
4. **Do not speculate. Invest.** Learn the difference. If you do not know what the difference is, stay away from the stock market, buy real state instead.",,,1617761482,{},gtn61vc,False,t3_mk25un,False,True,t1_gtdurax,/r/wgtow/comments/mk25un/what_are_your_practical_life_rules_for_women/gtn61vc/,1617763903.0,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Yeah i need to be better at establishing boundaries. I'm quite passive and the type to try to ignore or try to find other ways to get around it. I need to learn to be more confrontational :/

The worst part is...in our university we had a CS prof (he's very popular) and he wrote a whole BLOG on how women are inferior. It was your typical misogynistic stuff regurgitated and everyone in our Uni saw the blog. He didn't get fired though. It really sucks because we have no support. Not even from professors who get away with this stuff. 

Thanks. Glad there's other girls who can relate &gt;.&lt;",,,1613272220,{},gncco9j,True,t3_ljcd9t,False,True,t1_gnc6m94,/r/wgtow/comments/ljcd9t/how_to_avoid_conversations_with_male_coworkers_or/gncco9j/,1613287077.0,2,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

My advice if you’re comfortable: wear a ring or make up a boyfriend. I know it’s annoying that you have to resort to this, but in my experience as someone that worked in STEM, men only put extra effort into chit chat and small talk if they want to have sex with you. 

Saying you have a boyfriend (even better if you wear a ring) will cause them to back off. If they keep talking to you, they are either extremely sleazy and don’t care that you have a SO, or they may be friendly people.

[],,monch-bred,,,[],,,,text,t2_7sdmnumo,False,False,[],"I saw on another comment you said most of this is coming from fellow students, not at work. That does make it harder because since it’s not employment, they can get away with asking personal questions because they won’t get fired. When I had to do partner projects, I only ever picked other women as partners. Is this feasible, are you allowed to pick your own partners?

Alternatively, honestly I don’t think the opinions of the men in your university cs department will matter after college, or during college. They’re not your friends, their opinions aren’t going to reach your friends, and they’re not in the industry so it’s not like they can blacklist you. Perhaps just cutting off personal questions in a tough but still somewhat polite way would get them to stop, even though they tend to have 0 personal skills. 

So, if they start making small talk you could be like “I have a ton of other work to do, so I’d like to work efficiently on this and focus on the task at hand. I’m not interested in sharing my personal life, it makes me uncomfortable.” &lt;— this clearly tells them in no uncertain terms to back off. If they continue, you could tell them that if they don’t stop prying into your personal life, you consider it harassment. If they continue then report it to the dean.*****

**** this comes with major caveats, I know. You would need to have friends that don’t overlap with the guys of the cs department, a university that takes harassment complaints seriously, and the security of not caring what they think even if they do think you’re a b*tch. I know at my university I was very lucky to have a supportive dean who would have stood by anyone reporting harassment, but not everyone has that. You know your situation best, so you’ll know if the above is a risk you can take. But if the WORST CASE scenario is “the guys of the cs dept won’t like me” and that’s the extent of it, there is NO reason to play nice, that’s barely a bad outcome because if they won’t like you maybe they’ll harass you less.

Anyways sorry for the wall of text, I just feel for you because although I had very little regard for what the guys of my cs dept thought of me, I know other people prefer to avoid confrontation and to protect their reputation, even from unfair attacks.

I also have this issue with friend groups, I’ll spend most of my time just doing my own thing and then try to get back in the fold and they end up giving me the cold shoulder.

I have so much fun on my own, I don’t like people in my space, I don’t like feeling accountable for someone else because if I become their girlfriend all of a sudden I have to fill this “role” that isn’t who I am. Ex kept saying “you don’t act like my girl. You keep trying to haze me like an older brother ” I’m supposed act like some cheerleader who’s super girlish, emotional and attached to him. It’s just not me, again maybe I just haven’t found the one, but yeah. I used to feel bad about it, but that’s who I am, I’m an adventurous, independent and goofy person.. 

In all fairness though I felt like I was only in a relationship because I’m tired of people making me feel weird and asking “where’s your boyfriend?” Not because I actually wanted to be in a relationship with any of the guys, I’ve yet to meet anyone that I’m like “wow, I want to be in a relationship with you”. I mostly did it to get people off my back, and to have someone in my corner looking out for my interests and defending me. 

People have a tendency to see people who are alone as easy targets especially if you’re a woman. I lived with a woman who’s boyfriend basically attacked me if he even thought I looked at his girl sideways, just causing so much issues — his girl was very passive aggressive (long story) but he was aggressive.

[],,Sufficient_Purchase1,,,[],,,,text,t2_84stpob4,False,False,[],"You don't need to listen to my advice, since it plays a bit of devil's advocate. 

I'm (24F) a full-time math and CS student, Calculus TA, research assistant, and also have a full-time job in network security. I've recently received a substantial pay raise at work. Academically, I'm currently tackling an open problem in mathematics with major breakthroughs. I sold my start up when I was 17 and made a bunch of money. If I wanted to, I'd easily be able to retire before 30. So, you should listen to what I have to say if you want to be extremely financially successful. My advice will likely be, at the very least, monetarily valuable. 

Mostly, I've found social networking in professions like ours to be unavoidable. (i.e LinkedIn profiles are the best way to get recruited and the connections you form will help get you up the ladder). As the saying goes: it's about who you know, not about what you know. Everyone you're competing against also has a degree and a portfolio, but the best jobs in this industry go to the ones with the best connections. Good connections also guarantee job security. I have recruiters who still contact me.

I've built many wonderful professional relationships with men. You can Go Your Own Way without limiting yourself or closing professional doors. I've been invited to everything from talks, lectures, casual coffees, and contracted for private projects. Due to a combination of academic skill and a high degree of personability, numerous Professors have requested me to TA their classes or do research with them every semester. 

That's not to say my time and emotional energy is free. You choose your availability on your own time. Outside of class, students literally venmo me for my advice on personal projects or help on problem sets. One guy was so grateful, he even acknowledged me along with his family in an academic paper. Usually, if I become quiet while trying to figure something out, they'll talk about their personal life as well. I always *seem* readily available because I am often seen around campus doing something with someone. But behind the scenes, I choose the time, duration, and method of contact. If anyone needs me, they email me. I don't give out my phone number. I don't have an Instagram or Snapchat or social media platform. If we venture into a discussion I don't want to have, I shut it down. I set my boundaries.

Once, there was a girl who refused to speak to anybody in one of my classes. I was one of the few people she would talk to. We both had the top grade in the class. The Professor, who was the most senior at the school and very chill, would ask me weekly, like clockwork, if I wanted to do research with him. At first, I said no because I couldn't make time. When he kept asking, I suggested that he ask her instead. He said he wasn't going to because she was too standoffish. He didn't like her demeanor or the way she constantly ignored her classmates. After a month of repetitive requests, I finally decided to work with the Professor which ended up being most fun research experience I've ever had. At the end, he wrote me a glowing recommendation and gave me one of his analysis textbooks from grad school. He's retired, but still likes to keep in contact because he enjoys hearing about major milestones in my life and how I've been doing. 

Another time, two years ago, there was a guy older than me. I helped him a few times in Physics (before I even took the class) while he pursued a degree in AI and Robotics. It was his last class for his degree, he was really struggling to pass, didn't understand the material, there was no TA, and he just couldn't focus. He often vented about his home life. I didn't think he was actually listening to me about the coursework, but he was. Venting helped him focus. A few months ago, he emailed, thanked me for helping him, and told me he was now working with a company that designs affordable, lightweight robotic prosthetics for children.

That aside, I'm very excited to get settled in. I bought a house about three years ago but my job changed. So I rented out that house and moved into an apartment. Finally felt stable enough to get something here. I moved three times in 14 months. I am so ready to settle down and stay somewhere for a while!

It has a great kitchen for cooking in despite being small. It's very quiet! Relatively peaceful for being part of a crowded urban area. My other house is silent but very much a food desert. Not walkable to anything. 20 minute drive to the nearest non Walmart non Burger King area. So you make some sacrifices to be walkable to restaurants and stores. I have to remind myself that.

Lots of little things need to be done around the house but I put out feelers for a good handy person. Every so often I think how nice it would be to have a man in my life who is more handy than me. I would be more handy but my dad was a little bit sexist and only taught my brother how to do that kind of thing. I'm learning but I don't want my curtains hung sideways. I want it done right.

When I first started I followed [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sTAiDki7AQA) tutorial, and it worked out pretty good. Having a starter is a lot of work, and can be expensive. But I think it can be very rewarding.

A few tips to keep in mind is:
• Use good flour. I bought local artisan flour. I tried to make a starter with bleached &amp; pasteurized store bought flour, and all the yeast was dead so nothing happened.

• it takes about 2-4 weeks of feeding the starter everyday for it to develop flavour. Once you get that going you can put it in the fridge and feed it 1x week.

• Where you live matters. Humidity, temperature, and season will affect your starter’s fermentation. I ended up having to feed my starter 2x a day because of how cold &amp; dry my climate was.

When Stevie Smith was three years old, she moved with her mother and sister to Palmers Green in North London where she would live until her death in 1971.  
 She resented the fact that her father had abandoned his family. Later,   
when her mother became ill, her aunt Madge Spear (whom Smith called ""The  
 Lion Aunt"") came to live with them, raised Smith and her elder sister   
Molly and became the most important person in Smith's life. Spear was a   
feminist who claimed to have ""no patience"" with men and, as Smith wrote,  
 ""she also had 'no patience' with Hitler"". Smith and Molly, raised in a   
family of women, became attached to their own independence, in contrast   
to what Smith described as the typical Victorian family atmosphere of   
""father knows best"".

In the poem ""A House of Mercy"", she wrote of her childhood house in North London:  
It was a house of female habitation,  
Two ladies fair inhabited the house,  
And they were brave. For although Fear knocked loud  
Upon the door, and said he must come in,  
They did not let him in.

After she retired from Sir Neville Pearson's service following a   
nervous breakdown she gave poetry readings and broadcasts on the BBC that gained her new friends and readers among a younger generation. Sylvia Plath  
 became a fan of her poetry and sent Smith a letter in 1962, describing   
herself as ""a desperate Smith-addict."" Plath expressed interest in   
meeting in person but took her own life soon after sending the letter.

Smith was celibate for most of her life, although she rejected the idea that she was lonely as a result, alleging that she had a number of intimate relationships with friends and family that kept her fulfilled. She never entirely abandoned or accepted the High Church Anglican faith of her childhood, describing herself as a ""lapsed atheist"", and wrote sensitively about theological puzzles;""There is a God in whom I do not believe/Yet to this God my love stretches."" Her 14-page essay of 1958, ""The Necessity of Not Believing"", concludes: ""There is no reason to be sad, as some people are sad when they feel religion slipping off from them. There is no reason to be sad, it is a good thing."" The essay was unveiled at a meeting of the Cambridge Humanist Society.

She also hiked the Appalachian, among many other trails.

Personally, I did not hike the Appalachian, but did some longish hikes in Europe. Most important is to plan ahead at least a bit (but don't forget that some problems can be solved better in the moment and there's often people around willing to help). Know your route, know the dangers, find a on- or offline map that has good places for sleeping/camping and getting water. 90% of your concern will be where to sleep, where to next find water, and where to buy food again. But be prepared that once you show up at a place, it might not be how you pictured it - so be willing to improvise in the moment.

Educate yourself on safety on the trail - what dangers are there and how can you avoid them/react if they occur. E.g. bad weather, storms, injuries,...

Imho, you don't necessarily need to train that much. It's helpful to be fit, and of course do some shorter hikes to know what to expect. However, every able-bodied person can hike (and a lot of disabled ones, too). If you are out of form, you might get tired faster or walk slower. That's not a problem, though. You can just slow down or take a break. It will take you more days to hike, but that's all. You will also build muscles in your legs once you hike for a longer time.

edit: And I second the advise about breaking your shoes in! A lot!

Yes, that is exactly what OP is talking about. Older women are forced to compete with their younger counterparts, which is essentially impossible to do so. We are continually aging. There is no stopping the process of aging (no matter the skin routine or treatment), which leaves older women to feel bitter and jealous. Is the bitterness and jealousy warranted?

bell hooks teeters towards the basic tenets of radical feminism rather than liberal feminism. She technically would be since she wants a complete restructuring of society and elimination of male ~~^(superiority)~~ inferiority while accommodating and compensating women in their role within reproduction politically, socially and financially.

She wouldn't be associated with liberal feminism to me since that's more of an offshoot from social contract theory where legal democracy equates to sex equality and personal/private concerns aren't related to the equality of women. She always is making the personal political.

""There's no place in this world that that man can go and say he created peace and harmony. Everywhere he's gone he's created havoc, everywhere he's gone he's created destruction""

What he says can be adapted to the feminist struggle.

Surely if you go to a conservative institution you'll expect to have to tolerate misoginy. But then that's why people become Left wingers and maybe search alterantive life paths, to avoid that. Except even in those places, most of the times, men already went there and ruined it.

The other day I read here a comment from a sister saying that she liked the Wicca community but lately it has just become a place where women go to prey on women. The same about communes, it could be a place to recover from emotional trauma, or to do organic gardening or to be a vegan or whatever. But most often than not, men go there and transform it into ugly polyamour communes. 

Meetups are a great way to have people to do some stuff with you, like a hike, a book club, a film. Or just to chat with foreigners, know different cultures, go to a different restaurant. Of course men have to go there to try to hookup with women, they need to go and make everything sexual.

Even a date can just be about two people going on a hike, going to the beach, enjoying a landscape. Of course a man will try at least to kiss, most likely to have sex with you if not the first date, then the second or the third or whenever he has a change.

Wherever men go, they ruin everything because they are unable to control their sexual urges.",,,1621182382,{},gyc7ehh,False,t3_ndoe2y,False,False,t1_gybyren,/r/wgtow/comments/ndoe2y/what_do_you_enjoy_best_about_going_your_own_way/gyc7ehh/,1621221602.0,11,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

That's what being a communist is. True communism is not the Communist regime that was installed in Czech Republic after the nazis were defeated.

I watched the movie Carol yesterday and she is in it. Really liked the movie. 

It made me wonder a few things. First of all the guys seem to tolerate when the women are lesbian. The husband of the main character didn't mind she had an affair with another woman, he just got upset when she left him. But honestly it was her that took the initiative because she was tired of being repressed. If she had put up with it more, he probably would close his eyes... So apparently dudes don't feel threatened by women, only by other men. 

And then both main characters of the movie had relationship with men and liked women... So are they lesbians and were repressed by society and forced to find a man? Are they bisexual?

I personally feel like I am not a lesbian. I am interested in men but not enough to tolerate bullshit. If I wanted to be a lesbian I could freely pursue other women in the city, nobody would judge me because nobody knows me, my family isn't there so they wouldn't even have to know... But I don't feel the need to. Maybe I am just asexual or something because I like men but I am not willing to tolerate certain behaviours and thus I prefer to stay single. If I was an highly sexual person I'd either put up with certain behaviors to have a sexual partner or I'd seek a woman.

This reminds of the movie Shame. The guy was straight and a sex addict. At one point he was so desperate for sex he went into a gay club and had a guy doing him a blowjob. So his despair for sex actually made him go outside his sexual orientation...

**Marriage and motherhood**

*Marriage is nothing more than a tool for the capitalist wage slave machine, which is why I recommendation women not only be single and stay away from men but to also never have children themselves.*

*One of the biggest contributors to the gender pay gap is motherhood. When a woman has a baby, she is normally the one who needs to stay home to look after it, which means she sacrifices her career. She sacrifices earnings and skills development. This makes her financially dependent on the husband.*

*The reason why women are oppressed so much is because of natural biology i.e. pregnancy and motherhood. The fact that women have to tear up their bodies to let the species continue shows how gruesome biology is, and the demands of pregnancy and child rearing make women dependent on men, which gives men the natural upper hand. Also, motherhood deprives women the freedom to pursue intellectual interests, tying them down to the status of incubators and gestators. As far as biology goes, a woman’s purpose is mainly that she can act as a birthing machine.*

*It is for this reason that I believe that nothing holds women back more than motherhood and that women should never have children if they want independence and autonomy, which are basic freedoms.*

*Compared to being single, marriage is a bum deal for many woman. Accordingly, married women are less happy than single women and less happy than their husbands, they are less eager than men to marry, they’re more likely to file for divorce and, when they do, they are happier as divorcees than they were when married (the opposite is true for men) and they are more likely than men to prefer never to remarry.*

*The only reason this is surprising is because of the torrent of propaganda we get that tells us otherwise.*

*We are told by books, sitcoms, reality shows, and romantic comedies that single women are wetting their pants to get hitched.*

**Financial freedom**

Basically I think the keys to financial independence is to live a minimalist lifestyle, which means minimising large obligations eg no children, no marriage, no luxury car etc. Try to keep expenses down. Then you will be able to save up more. Then put these savings into assets eg shares, ETFs or real estate. These assets should pay income eg real estate can be rented out which means you get rental income. Shares and ETFs pay dividends. The value of these assets tend to go up over time (not guaranteed) but they will pay you passive income that does not require you to do any work.",,,1622647686,{},h0bnaj6,True,t3_nqne2x,False,False,t3_nqne2x,/r/wgtow/comments/nqne2x/wgtow_wordpress/h0bnaj6/,1622756203.0,15,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

I want to just quit, but then there are the women that I get stories from, women in here, women in the PTSD subs, etc... And I begrudgingly go back to work because women like us deserve to live and be safe. Honestly, I'm just not wired to put up and shut-up, even if it is in my own best interest, which makes me pretty damned dumb if I'm being honest. I absolutely hate it and want to give up ALL. THE. TIME. I'm not some hero and I'm not looking for praise. I've tried to ""fit in"". I've tried to be a fake, girly-girl, but the mask always slips.

I am a Socialist, anti-work, eco-feminist, with an education in male dominated fields (Political Science and Philosophy). I tried to re-educate as a cosmetologist, and found out female professional bullies are WAY worse than male ones. I got expelled for putting Rosie the Riveter up on my station and standing up for a girl who was bullied into a mental health breakdown. Feminists aren't welcome in beauty culture. 

My dad was and abusive, sexist, Catholic, undiagnosed bi-polar for my entire childhood. My mom checked out mentally/emotionally years ago to survive. 

I'm an Aquarius - the weird, cold, loner in the corner observing things that happen like it's a science experiment when it's a party. 

I have diagnosed severe PTSD and Anxiety Disorder from a 2 attempted murders, a kidnap, and 2 sexual assaults (4 different men at different times in my life). Also, I studied things like FGM, rape as a war crime, and child sex trafficking in University. I am a PTSD and anti-sexual violence advocate. I get desperate women DMing, emailing me their trauma stories every week. Then I have to go into Zoom meeting with white men in positions of power and beg for funding/initiatives/housing for women with trauma. In truth, I am a bit of a work-aholic, but mostly for non-profit or protest organizations, so I don't get paid. People also hate the poor. ""Imposter Syndrome"" is a typical symptom of anxiety and childhood abuse: but because I'm not traditionally successful in a neo-liberal society, I feel like a looser all the time. 

I have been a feminist since I was 5: My family told me I couldn't be the first female pope of the Catholic Church and I couldn't have inheritance because I am a girl even though I am the oldest - I was expected to get married, obey, and make Catholic babies for my husband. I was strongly opinionated about women's equality then, and I still am at 43 (which means I am an elder millennial/Gen X cusp). 

I'm really smart which isn't a blessing because ignorance is bliss and I'm ""too smart for my own good"" as my dad would say. It intimidates most men/authority figures around me - especially if they assume everyone is ruthless and ambitious like them. I am not. I have no desire to step on other people to get myself ahead. I want to end/ease suffering, not cause it. In my psych eval they gave me an IQ test and it is pre-genius (not bragging - I hate it - it's awful). 

I'm also Canadian... 

TL;DR: Everyone hates a ""mentally-ill"", Canadian, socialist, boomer, snowflake, know-it-all, with a temper --- especially on the internet. I am a warrior (the battle of the sexes has almost killed me) against anything that exploits women and children (tyranny, capitalism and the patriarchy). So I am at war with the world. I've taken the hits and have the battle scars to prove it. I want a better world more than personal glorification and if that makes me a looser so be it. That's what I am and I love the hell outta me. I am truly ""blursed"".  

Now I feel sick: I hate bragging. I usually hide most of that for my own safety. I gave up on being openly confident years ago. My anxiety brain is waiting for the misogynist-incel-tolls lurking in every corner of reddit to send death/rape threats in my DMs.",,,1622639309,{},h0b5af6,False,t3_nq609n,False,True,t3_nq609n,/r/wgtow/comments/nq609n/imposter_syndrome_anticorporate_feelings/h0b5af6/,1622743447.0,3,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Since leaving I have:

- Gone on road trips (am currently on one now - vaccinated of course). My ex always said we would go travel, but it was never made a priority and he financially drained us so it wasn’t even possible

- Re-enrolled in school for this Fall getting a more practical, well paying career degree

- Worked on my mental health. I’ve been with my current therapist for over a year now and have been diagnosed with disorders that were lowering my quality of life that I didn’t know I had. I am now on medication and doing therapy to work on managing them. Also working through the 5 years of abusive trauma I have from the marriage and am in a much better place now than I was. Stopped having weekly panic attacks immediately after I left the relationship

- Stayed single and decided that WGTOW was best for me so I could work through my trauma and not return to my codependency issues I formed during the relationship

- Quit my awful fast food management job

- Got a cat

- Improved my dental health (which got put on the back burner from lack of insurance and moving too often to get decent insurance - also not having enough money to afford any work anyways...yay USA)

- Am more financially stable and less stressed about money

- Reconnected with art and photography, which gives me joy and life (which I had stopped due to his criticism)

I’m still working on improving and hope to improve even more a year from now. Leaving has been so worth it. I feel like myself again and like the person I used to be before the relationship started.

Damn. 

I *really* love men, but I’ve never been able to get past the fear of telling my lady crushes I’m interested in them intimately. Even when I’ve been explicitly clear I’m queer, I’m very rarely approached by other queer women, too. So, the majority of my relationships have been with men, though I would say I skew slightly more towards gay internally. Even more so romantically as I’m getting older. 

I have so much more confidence in the dance between men/women because the cues are more straightforward (no pun intended). I’ve been very fortunate to be very well loved and treated by men, so it’s not been tragic by any means, but my heart has always felt half-bloomed.  I’m currently partnered with a man, and he knows this about me, he’s been very understanding. But I don’t think I would settle down again with a man long term, if it wasn’t him.

My boobs had increased a whole cup size; he told me he preferred my boobs more now (at the moment) than before, and was weirdly evading my followup that surely he wasn't as happy with my natural size before, if he was going to say something like that about my _boobs_ after being on an *antipsychotic* that I had talked to him about numerous times that I was worried that it was unhealthy for me because of the weight gain and breast growth, not even something that fluctuates more and that you have exponentially more control over such as body weight in general.

When they start attempting to initiate beyond professional reasons, I'll blatantly ignore them.  Pretend I didn't hear their droning. Act like I thought they were talking to someone else. Walk away mid droning. Say I have something important to do and walk off, regardless of what they say.  If you're not in a position to do this for whatever reason, being disinterested and saying ""Uh huh"" works until you're able to walk off.  Grey rocking works well in these situations.

Refuse to engage in any questions that require personal information that is beyond the mundane.  Ex. ""Any plans this weekend?"" you answer, ""Nope"" and provide no further details. ""Have you watched any good movies lately?"" Nope. ""Are you interested in X hobby?"" Nope.  Anything you can answer no (or some variant of) to, do so.  It sounds like a broken record, but the more boring and casually disengaged you are, the more they'll eventually get bored themselves. Don't give them anything to work with. Usually these questions they ask are designed to get information and try setting up a date or get together so they can have you alone and if you say no, not interested, not my cup of tea to everything, there isn't much for them to prompt with.

For the ""studying"" guy, for example, I'd say no, I do better when I'm able to actually focus by myself and study better alone and am not interested in group study time.  Cut it off right there, leaving no room for questioning.

The guy that likes to drop his personal baggage on you, I'd redirect to someone else he actually knows.

Wow. This sounds like all of my best girlfriends right now (besides the gay ones, who are actually all partnered). They keep being treated like shit by men and I'm kinda like.... always able to see it coming... but I feel really bad for them.

One of my friends never gets past two dates with any guy and is like legit miserable and pessimistic. She makes good money and is beautiful. I want her to be happy single; it's a great life!

I think you're probably right to not bring up the conversation with most people because they'll patronize you. Or they'll be hostile toward you. Sometimes I'll drop a phrase and then move on (like 'and that's why I don't want to date men anymore') with my closest friends. People are so into identity these days that they might overrun you with questions or advice or try to change you. Really it's your life and your choice.

I relate to that. Especially the *monetizing hobbies* part is something I struggled with. It's **totally** capitalistic, if you're not making money off of something, it means you're wasting your time. And our value depends so much on our networth and how productive we are.

Batteries need drained and charged and are the most expensive hung to replace.

Easiest- The wax ring could be bad- fixable but you probably will have damage under the toilet. I’ll go more in to this later. 

Most common- something solid (tampon, “flushable” wipe, something got dropped in) is causing a blockage in the Ubend and the water is singing out. Try plunging it really vigorously. It’s worth buying and learning to use a snake next. Because it could be a blocked vent.

Most involved- I vent or trap could be blocked somewhere else causing a vacuum in the sewer line which is sucking the water out of the bowl.

I know that sounds cliché, but that made me realize that a lot of paralyzing pressure was put on myself by trying to conform to societal expectations of “successful”— making 6+ figures, always being productive/“hustling”, buying a bunch of trendy stuff, traveling all the time, and monetizing my hobbies.

Change careers? Look at programs near where you live (or want to live.)

I have a couple hacks that have helped when I need to hire someone:

Start with word of mouth, I have several other independent women friends that could help or teach. If that fails, they may have hired someone before and can recommend him. This is how I found my roofer and termite guys. I make a point of telling them who referred them and why I am hiring them vs the other guys so hopefully this strengthens our clout over time 

I have inexpensive Wyze pan cams in every room and a ring security system. The pan cams are key because the sound and movement are noticeable. If you point them out you sound defensive or like you might be worried about something valuable. If they are just quietly tracking movement I think it helps keep people in their toes. I mention them in a nonchalant way so I don’t get sued though. No proof that this does anything, but guys who might slack off are less likely to on camera

I always educate myself about what I’m hiring for and decide ahead of time what I want and what I can compromise on. If anyone tried to get me to change my mind on something they are done- I’ve paid for a half a day and kicked someone out. 

Always be ready to go to court and or get a restraining order if you have to. Never threaten. If someone shows up uninvited don’t fuck around- call the sheriff immediately or 911 if you feel threatened. Then follow up. This has only happened once but I’m glad I didn’t doubt myself.

[],,throwaway17498509859,,,[],,,,text,t2_6prz8h6,False,False,[],"I don't think there are principles, but here's the advice that I'd give:

1) Start working *hard* as early as possible.  Choose a financially stable profession and do what's necessary to make bank.  Women are often uneducated when it comes to financial matters and retirement.  Since they are at a financial disadvantage from birth to death, they need a large retirement fund independent *for themselves*.  Too many women end up poor after their husbands divorce them or die.  

2) Being a career-driven woman is always preferable to being mommy.  Motherhood is too often a one-way ticket until poverty and chronic illness for a woman in her middle and later years.  If you want to be a mother, educate yourself *fully* about postpartum depression and injuries before doing so.  Also have the financial means to support the child *without* any assistance, including a college fund.  Do **not** assume that your kid will ""take care of you"" when you're older; they may not be able do so.  Too many people (male or female) think ""everything will work out"" and then have to face a brutal reality once the kid arrives.  Even worse, if a woman gets divorced, she ends up with primary custody and has *far* less money, even assuming that the father regularly pays child support. 

3) Ignore those who insist that dating and/or relationships are a marker of ""adulthood."" It's usually the opposite; women in particular end up sacrificing their careers and personalities to make the marriage or relationship ""work.""  I've seen few exceptions to this, even within ""successful marriages.""  When children enter the picture, women become financially and emotionally dependent upon their spouses.  Single women tend to make roughly the same amount as men, even in male-dominated fields.  

4) Always put yourself ***first***.  Society and family members like to use the **selfish** label to independent women for not doing what *they're doing.*  But the truth is that once you hit your late-thirties and forties, you'll start thinking more about your fifties and sixties because you'll experience more aches, pains, illnesses, and financial set backs.  It's life.  No one will come to your aid, especially those who're calling you **selfish**.  They honestly don't care about your problems; they care that you're doing better than they are.  In order to survive this period of your life, you'll need to have a good job, valuable education, and common sense.  Too many people piss away their twenties and early thirties following the LifeScript, only to pay in their forties when they get divorced, sick, laid off, etc. 

That's about it.  To be clear, money isn't everything, but it does make life easier.",,,1615694200,{},gqv8r40,False,t3_m1zehc,False,True,t3_m1zehc,/r/wgtow/comments/m1zehc/hey_im_new_to_this_sub/gqv8r40/,1615694211.0,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

It also seems like people who come from “broken homes” like myself may have a harder time ever having a fulfilling relationship in life.

And sometimes we should maybe push ourselves to be more aware of how our own personality and actions lead us to select piss-poor partners; or to recognize that we may interact with the disappointing members of the human race, but they don’t represent all people.

Men generally seem to be interested in one-sided relationships that are about cook, clean, fuck.  In all of the romantic relationships that I've been in with men, none of them could handle my intelligence, need for a fair amount of space, drive in my career, and chronic illness.  The latter is especially true; none of them could give support other than ""Go to the doctor"" and ""Why are you still sick?""  But fuck us if we have the same response for them! 

Women are constantly told that they ""have it all"" once they ""balance"" career with ""family.""  But the truth is that they can't possibly ""have it all;"" they just get shouldered with the emotional and financial burdens of the family.  Once they get pregnant, their careers are generally (but not always) over, so they have to rely on their husbands not to fuck other women and remain the breadwinners.  Meanwhile, their own emotional and/or physical health often gets sidelined (or outright dismissed), hence why they age at a quicker rate than single women do.  I mean, shit, look at all of the postpartum injuries, cardiovascular, and cancer diagnoses! 

So despite all of this, why do women crave relationships?  Because they're taught from childhood that too much independence makes her a ""career woman,"" cold, bitchy, lesbian, blah, blah, blah.  They think they'll be the *exception* instead of a number.

&amp;#x200B;

2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour	

1 tablespoon baking powder	

1/2 teaspoon salt	

8 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut up	

1/4 cup granulated sugar ( use 1/3 for slightly sweeter scones)	

2/3 cup milk (I usually use slightly more, maybe more like 3/4 cup, to make the scones less crumbly)

\--

1.	Heat oven to 425°F (220 Celsius).

2. Put flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl; stir/mix well Add butter and cut in with a pastry blender/fork or rub in with your fingers, until the mixture looks like fine crumbs.

3. Add sugar; toss to mix.

4. Add milk and stir with a wooden spoon until slightly sticky dough forms (or crumbly dough, if you want drier scones)

5. (\*\*optional, as I often just roll the dough in my hands and flatten it on the actual baking sheet\*\*) Place dough on a floured counter and knead gently until it comes together in a ball.

6. Pat or roll into a circle about 1 1/2 inches thick.

7. cut each circle into 6 or 8 wedges.

8. place wedges on a greased cookie sheet- slightly apart for crisp sides, touching for soft.

9. Bake about 12-15 minutes, or until medium brown on top.

\--

\*\*I usually add my ""extras"" into the mix after step 4, with some exceptions. These are pretty hard to f--- up so it's more about your preference and experiences. All of the recipes I use are developed by me, but are often inspired by ones I've seen in books or online before!\*\*

For my beloved lemon butter scones, I use a grater to add lemon zest after step 3, then replace a bit of the milk with about 3-4 tablespoons or more of lemon juice. I top with powdered sugar when they are done.

Cinnamon bun scones are also a favorite. For these, I add cinnamon (I just eyeball it) during step 3, then 1/4 cup of brown sugar and about 2 tsp of vanilla extract during step 4. I'll often make icing using whatever I've got (cream cheese, powdered sugar, etc) and top them with that.

I used to watch porn but hate almost everything about the sex industry, so watching it now personally just turns my stomach and does not turn me on. 

With this vibe, I don't need any external mental stimulus bc it genuinely just feels so good. I just put on soft meditative music and try to focus on my breathing and body sensations. 

This practice has the added bonus of allowing me to mentally decentre my sexuality from the pleasure of others and recentre it around my own pleasure. I just highly recommend getting a really good vibrator because literally no one on this earth can make me feel the way I make myself feel with this thing. Which is quite an empowering thing for me to realise in and of itself.

EDIT: I see you say you've just bought yourself a new vibe, so practice the meditative music and breathing with this new vibrator.

We do react emotionally more than logically and the more I hear someone talk irrationally, the more that I beg them to see reason. It's a vicious cycle. 🤣

I've never considered myself a feminist for largely the same reason. So much of the rhetoric is personal, anecdotal, or meant to inspire instead of inform. All very persuasive and very human. If I said that I was a robot, would people let me off the hook?

When I was in college and feminists tried to recruit me, they would use examples that were very personal but didn't actually resonate with me. ""So let's say that you were at a frat party, and some guy wouldn't stop flirting with you.""

Why would I go to a frat party? Do vegans walk into steakhouses?

It's incredibly difficult for me to talk to women, because so much is about trusting women, and validating women, and believing women. Not so much about understanding women. Because my question is always going to be WHY would I go to a frat party to begin with? Why wouldn't I go to a women-controlled space? Why would I go to a party where casual sex is part of the culture? Why would I go someplace where people are doing illegal and irresponsible things like drinking and smoking weed? Why would I waste my time surrounded by those things?

And these women would just tell me that sometimes women did things that weren't easy to understand, not entirely admitting they were mistakes, but sometimes that's just how life is and the fight and the struggle was in the middle of these battlegrounds. Which is perfectly understandable. But I feel the same way now is I felt when I was 17 years old: Women aren't going to accomplish anything in this world if we feel that our first right is to commit every single mistake that men have done like it's some sort of right of passage, and then after that, spend half of our lives fighting to escape the consequences of our mistakes with the same privilege that men have had, and then after that, when we are middle aged and tired, then we can be revolutionaries.",,,1624256699,{},h2if8zt,True,t3_o4e04v,False,False,t1_h2idxjv,/r/wgtow/comments/o4e04v/do_you_approve_of_the_sexualization_and/h2if8zt/,1624563250.0,4,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

I learned a while ago that our emotions and thoughts are actually pretty separate, and we experience emotions first and stronger.

I suspect it's because they feel powerless with other men most of the time and they need to feel powerful over a woman. They need to degrade women to feel like they have power. If anyone has another theory, I'd like to hear it.

It's several things. It starts with upbringing. For some men it's resentment for not feeling accepted by a female figure as a boy; some experience abandonment, others are raised by emotionally unavailable mothers. Others, it's being raised around negative male role models or keeping bad friends as company. Then, there's parental abuse/neglect. These experiences lead to an underdeveloped emotional brain (Limbic System) because they weren't taught to deal with negative emotions (such as the feeling of rejection) other than by screaming and fighting. They project what they felt as a child onto the women around them.

 I do have some very close friends, both male and female, but the kind of people I tend to keep in contact with are chill and we give each other lots of space. I can't imagine wanting a close relationship or love. I can't imagine I'd make a good mother, and maybe it's a selfish reason but I don't think any of it is worth the stress, on my mind or body.

I saved money despite losing someone to pay half the rent because the electric bills, grocery and gas went way down.

Subdivision 1.Crime defined. A person who engages in sexual penetration with another person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the third degree if any of the following circumstances exists:

(d) the actor knows or has reason to know that the complainant is mentally impaired, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless;

This is literally what the law is, and in it it says that if your partner gets a bit tipsy and you sleep together, you're a rapist. If You're tipsy too, they're a rapist too. 


&gt;The legislative definition of “mentally incapacitated,” as set forth in Minn.
Stat. § 609.341, subd. 7 (2020), does not include a person who is voluntarily intoxicated by alcohol. 

*The state charged Khalil with two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and two counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct. Two of the charges against Khalil-count 1 (first degree) and count 3 (third degree)-involve sexual activity with a person when ""the actor knows or has reason to know that the complainant is mentally impaired, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless."" Minn. Stat. §§ 609.342, subd. 1(e)(ii), .344, subd. 1(d) (2016).*

It does not appear that anything was changed, though I'll admit it has very poor optics. These sorts of laws are very complicated and require a very careful vetting and application process. While I agree that it appears this guy appears to be a rapist, the law is very poorly written as a whole. There is an excellent chance that according to it, you and I and most everyone we know collectively are rapists. It also suggests that Khalil need only say that he was also drunk, and was therefore also a victim of rape. The young lady blacking out is not a relevant detail to her ability to commit a crime. 

These cases tried in the public domain often fall victim to emotional bias, and this is a commonly proven thing; people are more likely to believe whom they empathize with, regardless of facts.

In the same year, the king ([Louis XV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XV)) commissioned her to teach midwifery to peasant women in an attempt to reduce infant mortality. This had become a political concern because a perceived high rural perinatal mortality, following from the deaths in the [Seven Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War), was depleting France of future citizens.\[5\]

Between 1760 and 1783, she traveled all over rural France, sharing her extensive knowledge with poor women. During this period, she is estimated to have taught in over forty French cities and rural towns and to have trained 4,000 students directly.\[7\] She was also responsible for the training of 6,000 other women, who were taught directly by her former students.\[4\] In addition, she taught about 500 surgeons and physicians, all of them men.\[8\] In her thirty years of teaching she taught over 30,000 students. \[9\] Through this educational effort Du Coudray became a national sensation and international symbol of French medical advancement.\[2\]",,,1617066070,{},gsr2kfi,False,t3_mf04hx,False,True,t3_mf04hx,/r/wgtow/comments/mf04hx/sunday_spotlight_day/gsr2kfi/,1617068830.0,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

In the worst case scenario (it being illegal) if someone tried to rape you, you could spray it *on yourself*... And I'd like to see anyone trying to rape you after that.  


If they are legal, get one. If they are illegal and you can buy a good one, get one.  


Important: TRY it at least once. In a very isolated place, in the open air. You must make sure they work. In my country, they changed the good ones for ones that do nothing. Obviously, using the one that does nothing on an attacker would get the attacker mad at you. So you must try them.  


But if you can get a good one, I really, really recommend them. I wish I could get one again myself. If you are under 40 and remotely attractive, get one if you can, even if you have to get it illegally. At 40, your chances of being raped are the same as a 15 year old boy's, so you don't need it that much...

[],,Bitter_Froyo_6742,,,[],,,,text,t2_ah7nv7hh,False,False,[],"Reddit started out by appealing almost entirely to computer nerds back in like 2008 or whenever and, while the site has changed A LOT over the years, you can definitely still see the lingering stain of how it started (and the type of people who have been in charge most of the time). This is a site that led a witchhunt against the CEO until she was given the boot because she wanted to address reddit's  CP/revenge porn problem. 

I've honestly found that for my own mental health,I just stop going to subreddits with sexist biases. For some things which tend to have a heavily male bias in real life, I usually try go somewhere else for that content since only 4chan has a worse userbase. Like there's a lot of women on tiktok who have comp sci degrees, built their own custom PC, enjoy programming, etc. and they're able to engage in their hobby in a not only non-sexist but an actively female perspective and it's super cool and made me realize that having traditionally male interests doesn't mean I should have to be stuck with predominately male spaces. 

It's honestly not worth it to try to deal with it. Reddit has mainstream subreddits that are actively toxic, hate mongering spaces. The site owners just flat out don't care and have shown a strong bias against female users - it is what it is. I go where I'm welcome and once I'm treated in a way that leads me to conclude I'm not welcome, I leave. There's too many healthy and supportive spaces on the internet to bother with a bunch of toxic man-children who blame women because of their inability for introspection.

I don't hang out in online nazi spaces and get upset everytime they find an excuse to be racist, because I recognize that it's unproductive and unhealthy. Anti-feminists are no different (seriously the overlap between them and Nazis is extremely high, they've got to have over 50% the same userbase). I think internet communities should always be those that serve us in a healthy way and provide a sense of belonging/support or which provide good info to us. Otherwise, why bother? I'll deal with sexists in real life when I need to, but I'll go out of my way to avoid them online becuase that's the beautiful thing about the internet - there's no geographic limitation forcing you to remain in a certain area. Leaving is always an option, and with men *that* toxic leaving is usually far and away the best option. 

They're on the wrong side of history. They're probably already mostly sad, lonely men who are lashing out at women becuase they can't take personal responsibility for their own failures. As someone who is likely on the autism spectrum, I relate to a LOT of the issues the average redditor has. But I've realize a key difference is that I have always questioned what is wrong with *me*, what about *me* do I need to change. Men [and this has been shown in game theory psych studies looking at the role of testosterone in social dynamics and group hierarchies, so it's not just some sexist opinion if mine] are signficantly more likely to respond with anger when they feel threatened/wronged/etc. Low testosterone people (aka women) are signficantly less likely to respond with anger and less likely to retaliate. When. I look at the average redditor, I see a lot of similarities. But I don't *want* to be like them. So if anything, I'm kind of glad reddit is a sexist cesspool becuase even without the sexism most of those areas are still toxic and unhealthy.

Sometimes I put myself in the female character's shoes and imagine myself receiving the romantic actions. So I totally get this. And it does lose its power if I think about it this way!

Throughout most of human history, we were all some type of farmer (or hunter/scavenger). We derive pleasure from simple things such as the scent of coffee or tending to plants because they progress us forward despite no obvious longtime reward; they are meant to encourage our survival. 

These mechanisms have been manipulated against us to make us more complacent in the current system, productive; it was intentionally engineered to be a an addicting cycle, like social media. 

We have such large, longterm goals, we have been deprived of simple pleasures in the here and now. Although they are technically still in front of us, the mental patterns we have all developed make that excruciatingly difficult. Dopamine is responsible for motivation, but if it is overused via too much sensory input (invasive phones, computers, advertisements), in becomes weakened, as does our drive. It takes a long time to deprogram, and one must be aware. 

Unlike the comments offering surrogate activities (hobbies) after work, you might actually want to abandon society altogether. A slower life as a farmer or tradesperson in a small community of close and likeminded people who look out for each other can bring so much peace.

Biologically speaking, you have one combined role reproduction and validation, men have one combined role too, resource production and security.   


Capitalism is the market name for ""survival of the fittest""; that's it. Capitalism and nature are very much in agreement with each other, and capitalism and ""survival of the fittest"" have proven to be the most effective methods of governance outside of beneficial dictatorships, which are unicorns.   


  **What are those of us who don't prioritize family/kids OR a career supposed to do?**   


You're not going to like this answer, I wouldn't even be surprised if it got me banned from this sub, but lack of honest and logical discourse is most of the problems today. **You're supposed to die**. You don't reproduce, and your genes and these decisions die off with you, because the species needs reproducers, not ""sit around and do nothing'ers""  


Men are in their own version of this dilemma, and they didn't choose to be here.   
""what should I do if no one will allow me to produce for them and they don't want my security"". In the past, a man might go and take a mate, but that option has been legislated away, so they find themselves in a dilemma they didn't agree to.  


The answer for men is different, because violence is always the final solution. Men are expected to fight and take what they want to secure reproduction, or die, for the same reasons I gave for yourself.   


On the bright side, you have the unique position of considering what the value of your life is if you strip away biology; its a rather divine moment for you in my opinion.

[],,immortallogic,,,[],,,,text,t2_5n7jousc,False,False,[],"- don't allow anything that gives someone else power over you 
- take up space in public - don't make yourself small
- don't feel the need to be polite if you are not comfortable somewhere - leave 
- don't be afraid of seeming rude if you are standing up for yourself
- don't give in to someone asking you something multiple times (are you sure, are you sure) - stand firm on your no, and call them out on it if you want
- do not ever put yourself down or self- deprecate
- do work on yourself, realize your flaws and work on improving them 
- do not take a partner with the hopes that they will 'complete' you. Build yourself up to who you want to be, and then find a partner that will complement you and make you a better person (growth), and someone who you do the same for
- be with someone that will challenge you to be a better person
[- find someone with traits that you may lack? But do not let them control you....]
- if someone is doing sometimes they you aren't down for, speak up. Don't stay silent for fear of it being awkward. Be firm, be confident
- do not try and change someone, they will be who they are. Build yourself up, find the ones that are compatible, not necessarily meaning the exact same as you, but have the same core values and morals 
- you do not owe anyone anything. You don't need to do anything just to be nice, and if you change your mind about something, that's fine
- listen to your gut, don't feel the need to be polite and stay somewhere where you don't feel comfortable
- walk with confidence and don't smile if you don't want to
- do not be afraid to say 'no'. Just no and nothing else, you don't need to explain yourself
- do not put yourself in a position where people can take advantage of you (eg being inebriated)
- do not allow someone to talk you out of saying no (eg by asking you the same thing, are you sure, come on just one, etc) - people will take this as you being able to be coerced even if you don't want something. Be the person that is blunt if you need to be, but be firm

ON YOUR INNER SELF
- make sure you are able to count on yourself, first and foremost
- be kind to yourself, and be honest to yourself about your shortcomings 
- thinking or yourself as your first best friend, the one you can rely on over anyone elae
- spend time with yourself - go on walks and to restaurants and make memories with yourself
- have adventures with yourself - find a hobby that you can do with yourself (photography, biking, martial arts) 

General life
- look at things in perspective and always try to look at both sides of something
- judge people's actions on their intentions, but do not sell yourself short or make excuses for their bad behaviour (example?)
- have empathy, especially towards those who do not have as much as you, but do not be empathetic to the point of it eating into yourself. You can only help others once you are solid. You cannot pour from an empty cup
- be kind but do not be a pushover or put up with bs
- don't look for validation or worth in outside sources
- do not ever let anyone do anything physically in anger, even if they claim it was out of anger (this points to deeper issues indicating they have anger issues, you don't want to be with someone who is prone to instability). Do not think or let them claim it is 'out of passion'
- beware of people that apologize/saying they understand but do not change their behaviour after you've communicated something to them 
- it's ok to lose yourself sometimes, as long as you find yourself again. Know what is wrong and what is right, learn what your moral are, and stick to them

On Appearance/ clothing
- do not allow yourself to be objectified - dressed up like a doll with pretty clothes/hair/makeup and lack agency (the ability to act on your own and make your own choices)
- do not allow yourself to fall to external pressures such as the beauty, diet and fashion industries (this perpetuates objectification)
- do not be submissive, be assertive
- Your appearance should not be your substance - it should simply be an extension of who you are 
- dress modestly, but do not oppress yourself - we live within a system that puts us at a disadvantage because of our biology in many realms, and we must explicitly understand that
- putting emphasis on appearance and being passive takes away capacity for action and thought (because you are distracted by things that do not matter). This in turn gives you less power, because you have less knowledge
- women's clothes constrain their movement and comfort, and they are encouraged to spend large amounts of time and money on their superficial self
- Do not wear clothes that advertise you as a sexual object for consumption
- ""what is wrong with your face. Why do you think that you have to create a false image of yourself to be attractive but men don't? That's what I want women to think about. Why are men's faces and bodies good enough, buy you're not?"" 

On boys
- you need to be mindful of the situations you get yourself into, relative to men
- never send compromising pictures of yourself to boys
- do not exist in relation to someone else (fulfill their needs or dreams and neglect your own)
- do not date boys who are much older than you, because they often want to date someone younger because they want power/dominance over you. Date the same age (more or less), or younger 
- think about the consequences of your actions because you are the one they will have to bear it 
- never allow double standards in a relationship
- do not let someone control you 
- do not let your partner try and control your finances 
- don't let things be one sided - eg don't always be the one making plans, deciding what to do, doing the emotional and mental labor in the relationship
- if you decide to be with someone, after awhile ask them why they like you - if they can't name things that make you you (your personality, passions, goals, values) and simply say they like you because of how kind/nice you are or how much you love them, you need to ask yourself if they really love and respect you as an individual or simply because you are someone that is there for THEM
- make sure you find a partner that you can share your genuine thoughts and self with without having to hold back or feel embarrassed or uncomfortable
- a person you decide to be with should first and foremost be your FRIEND. if you take out the romantic/sexual aspect, there should be something of substance there
- do not allow men to use reverse psychology. Eg they ask for something and you say no, then they make it about them (you don't like me, you don't want me, etc) to make you feel compelled to then soothe them and give in
- do not fake stupidity or put yourself down to make someone (especially a guy) look smarter/better than you.

[],,Ruby_5lipper,,,[],,,,text,t2_4u2z9avp,False,False,[],"Keep in mind that the two options you cited - being a mother and/or excelling in your career - are societal expectations.  They're not reality and don't have to be yours.  Your life and what you make of it are based on one thing only - your choices and what has meaning for you.

As \_level\_up\_ wrote, having a purpose can be important, and it sounds like THAT's what you're looking for: a purpose, a meaning to your life and existence.  But that purpose DOESN'T have to be any kind of societal expectation like motherhood or going to the top of your career, or even having a career.

What you need to do is figure out what's important to you, what gives meaning to your life.  Based on what you have written here, it sounds like you've already figured some of that out - namely, not having a career that you're devoted to.  A career is not just a job, but a lifepath, an occupation you do that you want to excel in, learn more about, develop more skills, and get to the top level if you choose.  For example, someone who starts out as a nursing assistant, but gets further education and experience to become a licensed nurse, then a registered nurse, and then may eventually decide to become a nurse administrator, or go to med school to become a doctor.  That's a career.

A job, on the other hand, is not a career.  A job is an occupation, meaning something you do to occupy your time and have no interest in learning more about the job, developing new skills or certifications to move up the job food chain.  A job is generally something you do to pay the bills, to survive.  Some people go from job to job, willing to do different kinds of work for short periods of time to make money, move on, and do other things that are important to them.  Other people have 1 or 2 jobs throughout their lives that they do on a daily basis, put in their 8 hours to get a paycheck, and then use the rest of their time on other things that are important to them.

So that's what you need to figure out for yourself.  Do you like the idea of doing different jobs for a few months, maybe a year, and then moving on to another job, whatever you can do to make money, and then spend the rest of your time on other things that give meaning to your life?  Or do you like the idea of finding 1 job that fulfills your financial needs, and spending the rest of your time on other things?

Secondly, the other thing you need to figure out is what gives meaning to your life?  Do you like to volunteer?  To you like to help people build things? Feed people?  Care for animals? Rescue animals?  Training people on how to care for animals?  Do you like to garden? Do you like to help people grow things, build a community garden?  Do you like to create art?  Volunteer with city beautification, paint a local mural?  Or create other kinds of art that you donate to community centers, craft fairs, etc, just to make people happy?  Or for community centers to sell so they can make more money to help their clients.

Those are just some examples and you may not have interest in any of them.  The only way you'll learn what interests you, if you don't have an idea already, is by trying things out and seeing what brings meaning to you.  Another way to do that is by visiting a community counseling or career center yourself and seeing if you can get some career counseling.  Not necessarily to find a career, if that's not what you want, but in maybe finding the kind of job that might be the best fit for you, and also figuring out what your other interests are to bring meaning to your life.

It can be tough to figure out those things without guidance, which is why I suggest seeking it out, because it can only help you get a clearer picture of who you are and what you want for yourself.  Career counselors can offer all kinds of assessment tools and questionnaires to help you figure out your interests.  Their focus is NOT just on career, but on job skills and personal interests, which are things you need to figure out.  You can discuss with a career counselor exactly what you've shared here - that you're not interested in a career where you learn new skills, advance, get certifications, etc, and move up the career food chain, but are interested in simply finding a job that's a good fit for you, where you can make the kind of money you want, and then focus the rest of your time on your interests.

You might even want to consider temping for a while, which can offer you the ability to try different jobs in a temporary setting, and you might find something that seems relatively tolerable to you, that you think you could do for a while to make money while you figure out what else you want to do with your time.

Many community centers offer sliding scale fees for counseling services, meaning you pay what you can afford.  You can pay as little as $5 to $10 per hour at some centers, so it won't cost you a lot of money to find some guidance to help you learn more about yourself, your interests, what gives meaning to your life and how you want to spend your time.

I thought she must have had a fabulous love life if she wrote such passionate love stories, but it turns out she never got married.

I feel like she was a very romantic person, but she didn't like what reality had to offer in terms of love and romance. She also made a comment about how the success of your marriage depends on chance. I feel like I can relate to her. I'm more comfortable treating romance as a fantasy. As reality its not appealing.

I feel like she was a very independent person and a free spirit. Especially for her time. She spoke her mind and was very witty. I admire that.

This might sound strange, but I feel that life has a way of rewarding us for doing the right thing.

Whenever I made the right decisions, opportunities arose out of nowhere, doors were promptly opened. I even met kinder people.

This eventually made me stop fearing failure. That job, that friendship, that exam did not work out for a good reason and I will understand in due time. Instead I now pay attention to what works and put all my efforts in that direction.

She went through a series of tests and my father pleaded the doctors to let her come home for an hour; they strongly did not want her to because they suspected heart failure, but allowed it as he promised to take her back if they called.

Her symptoms were getting worse and she wanted to go back, but my father told her to suck it up. The hospital called and said she needed to go back because she *was* in heart failure, but my dad asked ""Can't it wait another week?"" to my pleading grandmother.

I know he said this because I no longer visit her; she has issues with boundaries. I have told my dad bluntly I cannot stand her or him as they fight like cats and dogs. I would still take her to the hospital if she needs it, and I certainly don't wish death on her. The only one who doesn't care if she dies is him because she needed to go and the hospital quite literally said she was dying. My mom called to tell me everything above, and that he begrudgingly took her long after the call. 

I wish I visited her today because I had a gut feeling something was wrong!! I would have taken her and spared her the anxiety she was feeling making her symptoms worse.

[],,queen-of-quartz,,,[],,,,text,t2_wo32v,False,False,[],"Congratulations! You're going to love it. I closed on 75 acres last year and it's been a dream come true. I wish I never had to leave. I'm working on building greenhouses for veggies and have goats and chickens so I'm hoping I can avoid going into town as much as possible soon! A few word of advice though - in the beginning I felt like I could do it all on my own. But it's a lot of property to take care of, 12 acres is a lot too. I let some friends stay in a tiny home, rent-free for their labor (but they pay their own electric/internet/etc) whenever I want it lol, and it's really made a difference to have people help chop firewood, maintain trails. help build stuff etc. 

I would also recommend, if you don't already have one, to purchase at least two firearms - a handgun and a shotgun or hunting rifle. There have been cougars and coyotes interested in my goats and chickens, and warning shots work well to keep them away. And if one day I shoot one, guess I'll have cougar for dinner lol. I've also had thieves come to my property, and depending on how rural your property is the police might not help you. My local police said they don't respond to calls where I am, only the county sheriff does, and candidly told me that unless there was a dead body I can't really count on the sheriff to come out here. So if there's any trouble you need to be able to defend yourself. I'd also invest in a surveillance system when you build your house and trail cams for where electricity can't reach, my thieves were taken to court due to my cameras and I became a hero in the community because they'd been stealing from everyone. 

Last advice, get to know your neighbors! Most rural communities are small, so having a friendly neighbor on your side helps a lot, they give you all the intel. And if you were originally a city slicker like me who didn't know too much about country living, they can dispense great advice like ""hey neighbor, the bucks are shedding their horns right now so keep an eye out!"" (my tenant then proceeds to find a horn), or ""black trumpet mushrooms are in season rn, there's a local guy in town who buys them for  $12/lb!"". I wouldn't have known any of that stuff if we hadn't stopped to have a quick chat.

Then she stated all my dishes in my fridge and made her way there - out of which 2 items were mine and old. That's it. 

Yes, I leave some chips on the break room a couple times, but I've been better. And when I said that and told her that her expectations of cleanliness were a little much, she scoffed and told me to shut up. 

I started to tear up in frustration. Because I felt like I was being bullied and attacked and finally stated: ""Look you're angry and you're directing that anger at me. I get that I may not be up to your standards - but I'm trying. And as for all this? Telling me to shut up? Very innappropriate."" And my lip is wibbling and I'm crying. 

I leave as she realizes what she's done and she tries to quickly backtrack - stating that she's emotional and she's sorry it came out tthat way. But I'm crying and walk over to someone who is waiting for me help and I reply: ""Look I'm really emotional right now. Please don't interact with me."" 

Afterwards, my eyes keep leaking. And after I'm sick of my eyes leaking, I go up to her, ask her to talk privately. 

""Look, I get why you're mad. You helped make the office beautiful and you see my mess as a way of me shitting on it. But the way you expressed yourself was not the way to go about it. I get that you're mad - but that was really upsetting. Sorry - I get teary during confrontation.""

White people enslaving black people. Discriminating against women.


Racists *loved* to point out difference in IQ tests between races. Afai rember the difference wasn't big. So, even when you are the priviledged group, with much more education, when tests *cater to you* - there was little difference. How are you superior when you are *barely* doing better with all the advantage?


More men finishing college was somehow a sign of superiority. Now that the field is more leveled and women do it more it's an error in the system. Something is wrong, they are oppressed! *Now* we need to do something about it!


It's also why they sabotage women's day but don't care about men's. It's why they think equality means equal violence (like men weren't violent with women before and they ignore that it's *women* that would *reaaaally* have to ramp up the violence against men if they seek such ""equality"").

Motherhood doesn’t have to be the all-consuming feat it is  in the US, but people would rather blame the mothers themselves for their “failings” instead of the society that fails them - tells them they are responsible for raising perfect children, never look at your phone, have a tidy house but also be up to date on current entertainment so you can be engaging for company.

And when that company is over, better not focus on your kids at all because company might be upset.  But also don’t neglect your kids just to socialize! But also don’t hire a caregiver because what kind of mom does that.

And above all, don’t expect your husband to help.

How about we stop speaking for all women? Nobody is saying that societal pressure has nothing to do with women's choices. Are there many women who think they do things of their own free will, but are really operating on years of negative reinforcement from society? Of course. We all have patriarchal habits we're unlearning, because we've been bombarded with this shit since birth. Everyone here is all too aware of that. But to boldly say *ALL* women who choose to shave, do so because they're subconsciously giving in to that pressure - *especially* saying so in a community of women who are actively going against societal pressures just by being wgtow - is frankly an equally blind stance to take. 

I have sensory sensitivities. I don't enjoy shaving, so I don't shave anywhere close to the frequency that is expected of me as a woman, but at a certain length it rubs too much against my clothing in a way that is deeply uncomfortable and at times even painful. So I still shave my legs every couple months and my pits roughly every week. I also love the feeling of getting into clean sheets and pjs with freshly shaved legs. Not enough to shave more than every couple of months, but I enjoy it when I do it. In the same vein, I'm a very creative person and sometimes put on makeup just for the artistic aspect of it. I'll put it on just to play around with a different medium for a change and then immediately take it off (again, because of my sensory issues, I can't wear it for longer than an hour). If I had only said ""I wear makeup because I like the artistic aspect of it"" most of the people in this thread would probably be thinking ""she's just subconsciously doing it for men""... even though I never even leave the house with it. Yes, the reason I bought the makeup in the first place was due to me bending to societal pressure as a young teen (as most of us once did), but I think most of us here have evolved past doing things just because other people want us to or will shame us for it if we don't. 

Some people are still on that journey and that's okay too. If a woman is denying she does something to cater to the male gaze, she's already subconsciously acknowledged that she doesn't *want* to do it for other people (even if she hasn't fully broken away from those pressures yet). This is a woman that has taken a step away from happily being a slave for men. She will come around with time and confidence and seeing other badass women (like us 😘) model how to live life however they please. 

*Living how you please includes choosing what you do or do not do with your own fucking body.*

The point is, there are reasons for shaving that are not rooted in patriarchy. There are lots of things in life that affect a person's decisions outside of just patriarchy. There are people out there with different circumstances, that you may know nothing about that play into the choices they make (health struggles being an example that is very often overlooked by healthy people). These circumstances are deeply personal and nobody owes you their reasons for choosing something for themselves.

Even if someone is doing it to subconsciously avoid ridicule, that's an equally valid reason to do it. Yes, it sucks. Yes, it's patriarchal. But calling other women brainwashed isn't going to make them more willing to listen to you or feel more open to deprogramming decades of learning The Rules and the consequences of not following them. 

Calling them brainwashed isn't going to make those consequences disappear. 

Please keep an open mind. Singular thinking and disdain for women who don't live exactly the way they think you should is something I expect from men or women on the voldemort sub.

I’m sure her intentions were good, she wanted me to be confident and happy. For 15+ years I wore a full face of makeup almost every day. Even when i was so overwhelmed studying and working, having 18 hour days. I didn’t accept the bare-faced person I saw in the mirror - she was too flawed to expose to the world. 

At the beginning of the pandemic I worked from home, rarely left the house, and didn’t have many video calls. I had no reason to wear makeup. Over the year or so I gradually started to accept my bare face. 

When I got vaccinated and my office resumed in-office work, I decided to not wear makeup. Since I made that choice I LOVE my natural self for the first time in my life. This choice has had a multiplier effect across many areas of my life. Now that I fully accept and respect myself, I am finally able to stop being a doormat and demand respect from others. Now that I’m not worrying about how I appear to coworkers, I have better focus and confidence in my capabilities and professional aspirations. Now that I have defined what I deserve and what my standards are, I accept that it’s highly unlikely I’ll find an adequate male partner. I’m finally content with who I am today, I know I can fulfill all of my needs as an individual. 

I have had zero negative repercussions from not wearing makeup the past few months. No one has said a word about it to me. At work no one has treated me differently at all.

For women in these countries, they are often reduced to the perceived attractiveness, fertility and whether or not a seal is still attached (aka virginity). Women in these areas are literally graded like how one would grade a product. Are the casings intact? Are the seals intact? Is there any noticeable blemishes? A woman’s worth is based on how much she can propel her man’s worth in the eye of society. This model can’t give me a son? Trade with another model, who cares what happens to the old model, just throw it away. This product is defective and does not dispense regular sex? Throw it away and get another model instead. In these countries, everything is seen through the male gaze. Their bodies are not free, but their mind even more so. Women in these countries are also accustomed to the male gaze and also see themselves through it while acting as a gatekeeper. 

While younger women in developed democratic countries do prescribe to this dubious ‘sexual liberation,’ you don’t see their future being ruined by this unlike in muslim majority society, where you’ll be lucky if you don’t get killed or whipped, and if worst case something happen, forcibly married to your rapist. I would say the fact that they have enough freedom and agency over their body to do those things is also a good thing. Also, and arguably most importantly, they’re young. A lot of young men also makes mistake. Most of these young people will learn and grow out of it, regardless of gender. 

The unattractive penalty applies to both gender in liberal society, haven’t you seen MGTOW and incels blaming everything on their looks? Attractive people earn more and is treated better regardless of gender. While a lot of women do embrace performative femininity, in muslim majority country the end goal is to secure a rich husband while in Western countries it is partly to attract a mate (and males does it too, look at gym bro culture), it is also to accrue social currency that they can trade for better employment opportunity, social perks, etc. I used to work in consulting and let me tell you, we barely have unattractive people of either gender. In muslim majority country, the unattractive penalty only applies to women. These men does not need to care about impressing women, only about accruing enough money. The women’s parents does not care whether or not the woman find them attractive, only that they can provide enough for them, the woman and their offsprings.",,,1626736026,{},h5t71hn,False,t3_onk549,False,False,t3_onk549,/r/wgtow/comments/onk549/i_grew_up_in_a_conservative_muslim_society_and/h5t71hn/,1626893714.0,11,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Here I was also lucky because I didn't stay in a party hostel or even if it was a party hostel due to pandemic it wasn't full of people. It was ideal for me, since it was my first time solo travelling. 

My country ranks as the 3rd or 2nd safest country in the world so I don't know how it would be like in the US. I mean rape and sexual assault happens here too and there's misogynism, but in the stats we are considered quite safe so maybe those things don't happen as often. 

I think here things would be stricter, like you can't just park your van everywhere, usually there's specific parks and you can get fined if you don't respect that. The guy I met didn't respect it and he didn't have problems but I think he changed spot sometimes because there's a limit fo time of how long you can stay.

[],,chasteandfree,,,[],,,,text,t2_c2gdbmbs,False,False,[],"Oh man! I didn't even think about how much domestic stuff woman do for free! It really would negatively impact society if women abandoned those roles; but that's why I value marriage and having children so highly and don't want it for myself. Mothers are obviously the backbone of any society, so the greatness of all societies is dependent on the mothers (the women raising the children). If every child is well-raised, you're going to get a really awesome society of people; but if every mom was lazy, selfish, and ill-equipped to take care of her children; you'd most likely end up with a society of broken people: criminals, narcissists, rude people, depressed, insecure, aggressive, etc. men and women who are destructive and raising people who are like themselves or worse.

Looking back at all the stuff my mom did for us when I was child, I think it's crazy how much we took her for granted. She worked, cooked, cleaned, picked us up and dropped us off, took care of us when we were sick, planned all our doctor/dentist appointments and vacations... She did everything for us. When something happened at school, she was the one who was called, not our dad.

For a brief period of my childhood, I remember her ""going on strike"". She said no one appreciated her, and would yell at our teachers if they called her. She'd say, ""LOSE MY NUMBER! I WROTE THEIR FATHER'S NAME ON THE SLIP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR! CALL HIM! I WORK TOO!"" At parent teacher conference, my female teachers nodded sympathetically like they knew exactly what she was going through. I didn't know then, but I know now. We really didn't appreciate her, and she's gone now. My dad is dating again, and I'm sure he realizes at this point that he will never find another woman like my mom, because the stuff that woman did to take care of us and keep everyone happy WA ridiculous! Like, I remember being 3 and waking up in the middle of the night hungry. I could ask her to cook whatever I wanted, and she would prepare the whole meal in the kitchen for me!!! At 2am! For a 3 year old!

There's no way I would be making chicken strips, mashed potatoes, and pink lemonade in the middle of the night. I would hand that child a slice of bread and some water, and send them back to bed! She was on a different level. Just another reason why I don't feel that marriage and motherhood are right for me.

And true, she did seem like she wanted to validate her decision to marry or something. I've been seeing this often. Some women have been telling me how marriage isn't all its cracked up to be, and I shouldn't expect certain things; but I know they're only saying that because their own marriages are awful. They rushed into it with a gut they barely knew, they married someone who was abusive even though they knew he wouldn't change, etc etc, so they tell other women not to hope for a good marriage and that it's all about struggling, and that's real love.

I don't know if she's a holier-than-thou-type, but she has constantly made assumptions about my sinfulness and given me unsolicited advice to fix myself. I'm not even sure where some of her assumptions come from half the time, but she seems to think she's doing an act of charity by lecturing me on my imaginary faults.",,,1620867123,{},gxxa80n,True,t3_nb21gr,False,True,t1_gxx4uhm,/r/wgtow/comments/nb21gr/why_do_people_assume_that_if_you_dont_want_to/gxxa80n/,1620911878.0,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Yes. I absolutely agree. If anyone should be put up on a pedestal it is women. I know in Islam, (at least from what I've read in the Quran) is that ""Women are the next closest thing to God besides angels."" And I think that is really beautiful and power. I just wish that society treated women as such. 

""Pagan"" is a termed coined by the Romans that essentially mean ""barbarian"" and anyone not Christian (as it was coined during the Christian times of Rome). ""Pagan"" meant ""Not Christian/ Not as intelligent."" It's kinda like the equivalent of calling someone a ""Redneck.""

I clearly stated my reasons for wanting to be a nun: wanting to marry Jesus, wanting to live in a monastery where the Blessed Sacrament is, being able to focus my life on prayer and studying theology, being able to work on arts and live in a community of sisters (the monastery I chose has nuns who are really artistically talented and make all kinds of religious arts and crafts), wanting to give my life wholly to God, not wanting to worry about worldly things anymore (life is simpler when you garden, raise livestock, and have less material things due to vows of poverty).

However, I did mention that I think I'm not cut out for being a wife or mother. I don't want to screw up a child, and I see how serious a calling marriage and child rearing is. I don't think it's a light job at all. Also, I don't think I could handle the pain of giving birth, and that terrifies me. Much more frankly, I only want marriage for sex, and that's not a good reason to go into it.

She told me that my reasons for not wanting to get married were ""bad reasons"" and that these were ""hangups"" I needed to get over, or I was choosing to be a nun out of fear and duress. 

I told her she came off very rude, and that my reasons for not wanting marriage were absolutely good reasons. I also told her that she seemed elitist about marriage, like every woman who chose not to marry was wasting her life, had something wrong with her, or hated men (she's accused me before of having issues with men, which I don't). We're kind of not talking at this point. I feel that I may have been too harsh, but I got really fed up with her.

Oh, about the flower thing. St. Therese sometimes sends people flowers when they ask her intercession. A guy who was discerning if he should be a priest or married, asked for a white rose if he should be celibate and a red rose if he should marry. He got a white rose with an invitation for a wedding in the mail, and took it as a sign. I prayed a similar prayer, and got a red rose; but it was in a way that I couldn't discern if it was a sure sign or not; so I asked for prayer about it.

The good thing that came out of the woman's comment was that it solidified my decision to stay single and/or be a nun. Even if I don't become a nun, I still want to stay single and not get married.

Becoming Catholic, I've found the faith to be very in favor of non-marriage/celibacy in a way that the non-religious world and Protestantism aren't.

Catholicism has ceremonies for ""consecrated virgins"" and of course nuns and sisters who never get married. Consecrated virgins are different in that they can still live in the world without marriage. They are married to Jesus, but don't live in a convent and don't have to take vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

Being a consecrated virgin isn't absolutely necessary though. You could just be a woman who decides not to marry or join religious life and I think that will be well understood. If anyone gives you flack about it, you could point out the fact that Jesus said it's literally better to stay single than to get married.

&gt; The disciples said to him, “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.” But he said to them, “Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.  For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.” (Matthew 19:10‭-‬12)

Remaining single, according to Jesus, is preferential; but most people don't like the thought of being single forever. I think Catholics generally see the choice to remain unmarried as a noble thing.

Most Protestants are a different story. By the age of 19, it was like people were constantly trying to marry me off, and asking me why I'm not dating. I think at the ripe age of 26, now, (not dating or married) people assume I'm a hussy or a lesbian. Clearly, I must be up to no good, sleeping around with men from sex apps, and that's why I haven't settled down yet.

The secular, non-religious world pities me as sad, selfish, or man-hating (I'm not). They think I will regret my decision when I'm ""old and ugly"", and I'll be miserable because no one will want me then.

So yeah, I think Catholics have a better view on wgtow than most religious or non-religious groups, but it really depends on the faith and the people. I've come across Catholics who also seem angry at the idea of a woman not marrying.

Traditional Pagan religions were more woman friendly. Look at Norse Mythology. Everyone knows of Odin and Valhalla. Then there are the Valkries (beautiful objectives women who help pick the soldiers to go to Valhalla). 

But a lot of people don't know about Freya. She is not of the same race as Odin and comes from a magical race. SHE hand picks soldiers FIRST to go to her domain known as Folkvang. Going to Folkvang is more prestigious than Valhalla but everyone thinks Valhalla is the absolute Hall of Honor. Nope. 

Women of Scandanavia could own land and other forms of property. They could essentially come and go as they pleased unlike the women of Greek culture who basically had to get permission from their husbands to do so. 

Ancient Egypt had certain Temples that were runned by all women. I can't remember where in Egypt, but Hathor had a temple with all women priestess. A.E was also the first culture to allow/ accept gay marriage and the first homosexual marriage was a lesbian couple. One of the Goddesses, Isis, has a story of being so clever, so tricked Ra (sometimes seen as the ""All-Father"") to give her some of his power, thus in turn making her [more powerful] one of the most powerful Netjeru (Gods). She had a massive following and still does to this day.  A.E women could own property as well. 

I also think Taosim is women friendly. It is like Buddhism but embraces worldly things. Be in connection with all and have peace with all. ""Be like water""  while Buddhism restricts all worldly things to achieve ""Enlightment.""

I think the answer is pretty obvious, but uncomfortable. Independent creatures can make their own decisions, objects or things to possess are supposed to do what they're told. Why do you think people get so angry when their computer, car, television, phone, etc, breaks or doesn't do exactly what they want in that moment. The woman is usually has her career end or suffer, she is the one who usually uproots her whole life if her man gets a job and wants to relocate the family, she has 100% of the reproductive labor and has the damn kid attached to her for nourishment for up to like two years, typically. Men made marriage- public prostitute or private prostitute, that is absolutely the historical purpose up until like five minutes ago. Marrying for romantic love is extremely recent, as far as the human timeline for its existence is concerned. How do we even know that men and women truly see marriage the same? Globally, the perspectives and incentives are very, very different, and western women have the privilege to have the choice to both marry and to marry for love.

You are supposed to have your life male (and [nuclear] family) centered, your career, education, and travel are the garnish on top that makes you more appealing. It's a nice small window of time to have those experiences but the ultimate goal is to reproduce and be available for sex- not my words, though, the actions done over and over and over again are enough to show and know that this much is obvious.",,,1620782384,{},gxsvgxy,False,t3_n9i1c2,False,True,t1_gxrx15k,/r/wgtow/comments/n9i1c2/i_feel_like_i_wasted_my_20s/gxsvgxy/,1620822578.0,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

I'm sure that husband is a major contributor to the situation, but it is still really important to recognize that a mental health crisis induced by having to be both parents to a high maintenance kid is ultimately still a mental health episode and needs to be treated as such.

If she's stressed enough for her hair to be falling out, then this goes far past ""ugh look at what trash men are"". This woman needs help ASAP. and not to get too dark, but *especially* because shes the primary caregiver to a young child. Unfortunately it's a well known pattern that women will become mentally ill but not receive diagnosis or help because it's always dismissed as stress and it's allowed to exacerbate up until the point she kills her child. It's an invisible epidemic becuase of how taboo it is to discuss infanticide.

My dad is schizoaffective and that sudden strong urge to retreat into the wilderness always coincided with psychosis, during which he would became very erratic and aggressive. And this is a man with male presentation of symptoms -- it's strongly suspected were under diagnosing these types of symptoms in women.  This isn't married life, this is trauma piled on top of trauma sprinkled with physical exhaustion. This goes far past the normal degree of marital stress a woman in a bad marriage would experience. 

It's also the time of year where depression often gives way to energy which leads to violence (it's why were seeing SO MANY shootings. Suicide also spikes in that march-may window). She's consciously thinking about exist strategies.

OP, Im sure you already are, but I would be taking this situation incredibly seriously. She's verbally admitting she wishes she could abandon her child to others, which often means that she's progressed past the point of feeling these things to being *so* entrenched in them that she's not even bothering to hide it (or perhaps doesn't realize it is a major taboo). 

If you can find any kind of group to help round-robin provide childcare assistance so she can exist outside a caretaker and take care of herself for the first time in a long time, even a few hours a week can be such a big deal. Threaten her POS husband to get his shit together and pull his weight in helping. Encourage her to get medical care, etc.

Keep an eye on her, both for her health and for the little girls safety. ""She would never do that"" kind of stuff goes out the window if there's psychosis.

I know I am really empathetic and trusting and it often gets me into trouble. I like to think of myself as tough and discerning but I guess I still have a long way to go. 

Your comments were really enlightening. This guy grew up as a Jehovah’s Witness and still goes to church with his cult-like family even though he stopped believing like 10 years ago. He suffers a lot of abuse and manipulation at their hand too but still has a connection with them. I don’t know why. It’s a big red flag and I guess I just feel bad for him. But he’s much older now so he really should just say goodbye honestly. Maybe he thinks it’s normal to manipulate people.

I feel better. I don’t feel like it’s my fault so much anymore and I know he’s manipulative and controlling. He was just so sweet during our relationship and he was never forceful when we were intimate. 

One weird thing he did though was... he told me that when he wasn’t around me his depression and anxiety came back and when we were together, it went away. So at one point he wanted to spend time apart so he could “become more like himself”. I was really upset because we had such a close connection and he was saying this very strange and confounding stuff. I wonder if it was a type of manipulation tactic, but who knows what it was meant to achieve. Probably just to make me feel bad for some reason. 

... I really idealized our relationship for such a long time. I miss waking up next to him. I didn’t see the bad parts at all and I am so grateful every time he just talks to me. And I feel bad talking to him because I know he is seeing somebody but he still talks back. I even un-friended him on FB like 3 times and every time he accepted my friend request immediately.

After they die, then really the motivation to have all that space will be lower and a 1 bedroom apartment will do. 

This is the most expensive place in my country for a reason though, it's 20 min to the capital where all jobs are, there's tons of stuff to do, 15 mins from beaches. You don't need a car because there's a lot of public transportations, it's extremely safe and clean and it's full of rich people that probably pay huge property taxes (because the houses are like mansions) which makes them have cool programs like free transportation in the area or free covid tests, among other things.  
Maybe one day I'll get tired of the city or will want to move abroad, in that case I can sell or rent with profit. It's a very dynamic housing market so you always have people looking to buy or rent there. It's also a bit touristic and a hot spot for digital nomads so you can do short term rental.

Housing market is just stupid here, though. A 1 bedroom I'll be lucky if I find for 110k in the area. If I save 5k/year in 4-5 years I'll have enough for downpayment and then maybe if I pay like 300€/month to the bank I'll pay it in 20 some yrs. House with garden would be at least 300k (for that price, it would need some construction work). It's a bit impossible to be able to afford that before my dogs die :( 

Maybe after they die I'll venture myself in the US and get me some money to come back, get a house with garden and retire earlier.

As far as career goes I think I read this on this sub or similar that really inspired me but I really want to actually challenge myself. I want to do something really hard that I will be proud of myself for achieving. It is a total mindset shift for me because before I wanted more of an easy skate through kind of life which don't get me wrong I still do in some ways but I want to see my potential.

Absolutely unacceptable. You should have cut contact that day.

&gt;*.... When we broke up I told him I’d have his kids  ....I mentioned it a few years ago to him because I was having “baby fever” because I was 24 and terrified of “running out of time""*  
&gt;  
&gt;.... *I told him that I still had feelings for him via the FB “vanish mode” and he saw it but of course didn’t say anything.*

You are telling this man that it is okay to disrespect you, that despite the fact he's ben callous by being aloof or bait-and-switching in his messages to you, you'd still have his children. Absolutely never share this kind of information with a man you are not in a serious committed relationship with.

&gt;*...he dangled a carrot and took it away. I ended up begging him again but he just didn’t say anything ...At this point he had a GF who he’s suuuper in love with etc*

He is putting on this performance to see your reaction: jealousy, hurt, etc.

&gt;*he watches like 90% of my insta and FB stories religiously.*

He's controlling. He wants to see what you're up to despite him not being there. 

&gt;*....it felt like he wanted me to come over and sleep with him? That was just my intuition but it felt so absurd I wrote it off.*

Listen to your gut. It's right. It's not the first time he's done this to you according to your comment. 

&gt;... *maybe he doesn’t even think I’m that attractive.*

Yes he does. Women have a tendency to turn inward: self-blame when trying to reason unjustifiable behavior. His behavior has absolutely nothing to do with you.

&gt;When we broke up he said something like “well I just did it for the regular sex” and it was such a traumatic thing for him to say 

It was traumatic to say. Even if he were flatly lying, the immaturity of saying something like that is something you should never associate with. 

He sounds like he has NPD and/or is a sociopath. You also sound like you have low self-esteem with is a lethal combo with someone like that.

[],,goddessmoneta,,,[],,,,text,t2_9a9wtfzm,False,False,[],"So basically me and my ex broke up 5 years ago, I was a senior in college and graduating and he had taken a year off so, even though he was only a year younger than me, he was a sophomore and still had two years. We went out on-and-off for like nine months, and for the first 4-5 I was in a poly relationship with this guy (5 years older than me) who lived an hour away who was engaged and I was his “girlfriend”, and she had a “boyfriend” who I was dating - like a poly square. Yes I know. Barf. 

Anyway, this boyfriend was in my major the first few months - we actually met in February and starting dating around August. So until December I was a computer science major just like him, we had like 2-3 overlapping classes and he slept over my apartment all the time, which was 20 minutes to our college as opposed to his commute which was like an hour. 

So we had A LOT of sex and at some point I realized his friend (we were part of a friend group) had r-ped me because I was blacked out when we did it and I couldn’t remember. To this day I can’t even confirm if we did but he bragged about it to no end to the other friends. This was May. We went out for a week because I had a “no sex without dating rule” but he was a pathological liar so I dumped him (didn’t wanna go out with him anyway). 

My boyfriend, who is STILL his best friend, said he “wasn’t going to take sides” which is pretty messed up but I forgave him at the time. 

Anyway, when we broke up 5 years ago I told him maybe we could go out again in 5 years, when he has a stable job etc. since at that point he was just a broke college sophomore. 

This guy was also really good looking and I felt really insecure at the time and grateful he went out with me. 

So these past 5 years I go traveling around the world and doing fun stuff while he graduates and gets a boring computer science job (I dropped the major and took a bunch of random music classes my last semester. He actually said he wanted a “brand new start” that next semester as if I was interchangeable with semesters, and also probably because we didn’t share classes anymore). 

Throughout these past five years we have been talking on and off mostly on Facebook. When we broke up I told him I’d have his kids (mostly to make him feel better about being dumped) and then I mentioned it a few years ago to him because I was having “baby fever” because I was 24 and terrified of “running out of time”. But at this point he had a GF who he’s suuuper in love with etc. 

Well anyway so I come back to the city we went to college in, kind of my home city, and I’m broke and in trouble and I ask him if I can stay with him and his gf. Well he says “oh that’s funny my gf is out of town for 2 weeks” and I said “oh ok I’ll be over tomorrow” and he said “nah she wouldn’t be ok with you staying here alone for obvious reasons”. I thought maybe COVID but also that he would cheat??? It was so weird. Like he dangled a carrot and took it away. I ended up begging him again but he just didn’t say anything although he did reply when I asked him where I could pick up 🍃. 

Anyway so he sent me this long rambling message two months ago about how his girlfriend is moving across the country at the end of this month and he’s going to have to find another place. I don’t know why he told me this. Is he trying to tell me they’re going to break up? They’ve been together like 3-4 years. Right now he is searching for a new place with a mutual friend of ours. 

Recently I told him that I still had feelings for him via the FB “vanish mode” and he saw it but of course didn’t say anything. He is aloof like this a lot and very selectively responsive. 

Oh, and he watches like 90% of my insta and FB stories religiously. I don’t know why he does it. He’s probably watched like 50 of my stories so it’s not a coincidence and it’s fairly recent. He even did after I told him I still liked him. So it’s kind of annoying. 

So basically I am having this trauma of wondering, was our whole relationship a lie? All of that sex and cuddling and saying I love you, was that all so he could have a lot of sex? Did he not really like me the whole time? To brag to his friends? When we broke up he said something like “well I just did it for the regular sex” and it was such a traumatic thing for him to say that I thought he was just being bitter but I’m realizing maybe it’s true. And when he said his gf was going to be gone for two weeks it felt like he wanted me to come over and sleep with him? That was just my intuition but it felt so absurd I wrote it off. 

Anyway I think about this ex a lot and I miss our love and our cuddles but I feel like all the love was a lie. And he probably talks smack about me all the time and maybe he doesn’t even think I’m that attractive. Anyway I just need to get this off my chest because I’m still going through it.

How did I feel about women friends/family: I loved them but didn’t consider them in daily planning or future planning. They had their own nuclear families. We were separate entities.

How available was I? Somewhat. If my sister had called me crying saying she was going to kill herself, I would have absolutely dropped everything regardless. But did I plan dinner just to touch back in with my sister and work on our relationship? No. I would have put that time into my marriage.

Could someone have been more important? As stated above, in an emergency I would prioritize them of course. And then my kids really did become the center for me once they were born. 

If he got the lions share (he did) why? I was raised to think that was the way things were. I am the only divorced person in my family of 12 first cousins, and many were married young like me.

I was married for 11 years before my eyes finally opened - I was married at 18, it was just a cultural thing where I was from. It wasn’t unusual. I divorced after kid 2. 

When I was married (before kids) no one else came first. I made plans around him. I grocery shopped with him in mind. I was only available to others with his blessing. Keep in mind, he became increasingly abusive over time. 

Once we had kids, I put them first and that’s when things got really bad. He couldn’t handle being second. We’d been married for 6 years when kid 1 was born.

So in short- no I didn’t have another important person in my life when I was married, and when I did it was a problem for him. But the grain of salt is that he was an abusive type.

The truth is that women are often *not* the most important person in their relationships, even for other women.  That's why relationships, even homosexual ones, are such a losing prospect for women.  Yes, they might feel like they've ""succeeded"" if they get married and have babies by age 30-35; however, when they reach middle age, the chances of them ending up divorced and poor are *extremely high*.  Aside from nearly always being the primary parent, they often lose out on promotions and better pay because they follow their spouses.  When they get divorced or if their spouse gets sick and/or dies, they often find themselves in poverty because they don't have the second (or only) income.  Family will suddenly disappear or give them the ""bootstraps speech.""  As for friendships, they won't have any of value, as they tossed them as soon as they became pregnant in favor of fellow ""mommies"" or ""couples"" who couldn't give a toss about their circumstances.

I personally disagree with IVF for a few reasons: 

* The world is overpopulated.
* There are unwanted children out there who need a loving home.
* IVF produces a bunch of extra zygotes that are either kept frozen or thrown away.  (This doesn't bother me, but if you're pro-life you shouldn't go this route.)
* Sperm donation centers don't do enough research on the donors.  There are issues of men donating to multiple agencies the maximum amount of times, leading to critical lack of genetic diversity in certain populations.  Also they might lie about family history of certain diseases.

They are literally telling you point blank how they see you, and so many STILL chase after dick. Why anyone would want that cancer in their life is beyond me. It's almost as if the women that either support the channel or contact him with advice are masochistic. You're looking for either public humiliation from being told you're second class in front of hundreds of thousands of people, with no room edge wise to really speak your piece because you're constantly interrupted and made to feel stupid for even daring to have the audacity to not want to be with a man, or you're worshipped by thirsty guys if you're the women in the comment section that blow this guy's ego up by men that want you _because you're submissive and you've made it apparent as such._

Beautiful women have called in to him for dating advice and the conclusion is that they are _too independent and assertive._

_TOO INDEPENDENT._

Which is a complete contradiction to all the advice out there _from men_ that says they want women that shoulder the financial work equally. So, which is it? What's true?

The only thing I know to be true now is that this world is fucked up.

If you don't work and have a man support you, you're a useless gold digger. If you work and have your own place, financially independent, have a fulfilling separate life from him, stick to your convictions, you're too independent and you need to drop the attitude of having a will of your own that doesn't center around pandering to men and obsessively looking for one to pair up with. So now you have to balance it by having some income so he doesn't have to genuinely invest anything into you, but still revolve your life around him, mind your p's and q's, and be willing to do your stereotypical ""woman's work"", which is STILL shat upon by men even though they want us to revert back to that.

That behavior is flat out abusive but so many of us keep going back to it.

Men like independent and assertive women until it cramps their style and they can't actually control her like they'd like to. They even fetishized that. They like sassy women if it is followed up with a blow job an hour later. It turns them on, but they have this bizarre need to have the last word as far as their ""dominance"" is concerned. I have used air quotes so many times because these are _their_ words, not mine, and not my inference.

Look at that woman's body language while he's going off. She literally has her head down. You know he's eating that up, body language is the biggest thing that we pick up on.

They resent us either way, the only thing I've figured out to be most successful for at least my goals in life is to notnllay the rigged game altogether.

The jig is about to be up and they know it, so it's like they're flipping the script and being as brazen as they can about how much they hate (especially 'modern') women hoping that they'll snag the ones with gutter level self esteem and self worth. Because you cannot tell me that you value yourself as a fully autonomous human if you dig this guy's content as a woman. If the sexes were reversed, men would be calling men that followed a woman who had contention this on her channel ""simps"", though I normally don't put a lot of stock into that word, as people often call men that do that if they show genuine, or as genuine as possible, respect for us.",,,1613931483,{},go8zfok,True,t3_lozare,False,True,t1_go8v53k,/r/wgtow/comments/lozare/yt_channel_kevin_samuels_thoughts_on_video_about/go8zfok/,1613931621.0,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

While I don't use this sub specifically anymore, someone brought up some guy named ""Kevin Samuels"", and talked about how he is rather brutal and ruthless to the women that call in and ask for relationship advice.

Basically what this video consists of is a woman saying that we don't need men, and Samuels coming back with a retort of if men disappeared, women would die within three or so weeks.

Five minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food.

What is insulting to me is that no consideration is taken into if half the population, without discrimination to men or women, disappeared overnight, that the rest of the world realistically not be able to pick up the slack from the industries or facets of life they were typically involved in within less than one month, without numerous casualties simply from people in the west as a whole not having the survival skills to even last a week in an environment where you'd have to actually forage for your own food when the grocery shelves are stripped. That's not my only disagreement with the video, but it is the one that stuck out the most in the beginning.

""We don't need you to survive, we need you to reproduce; you need us to survive""

Yeah, that right there sealed the deal for me.

Look, I'd quite literally rather die than have my hand forced to be with someone that sees me as second class. I am not being hyperbolic. That is the antithesis of who I am as a person. I rectify this by being skilled in many different areas and being as self sufficient as a human in modern civilization can be, barring being off the grid, which is a pressing goal within the next five years.

Coupled with Trust Your Perceptions blog, it has me looking for the nearest exit in regards to even the thought of being with a man again.

I am unsure of what I am bothered by more, the video and the amount of attention the channel gets, the men in the comment section that clearly are thinking these thoughts as they walk around among us, or the women that are in full agreement.

I typically am happy to be a woman and don't give much thought at all to men and am grateful to not be one, but it is shit like this that makes me resentful to even be a part of this world.

The video is like twenty minutes long, but it pretty much is twenty minutes of him saying the same thing, telling us that without men we will die within a month.

The only thing that I agree with him about, and he only has it half right, is that if a situation like that, that people would not know what to do. That is true of anyone. Take civilization away, and most people WILL die, the same people that couldn't figure out how to wipe their asses without toilet paper in March last year when COVID came ramming through the doors.

You can even order meal kits and groceries online that get delivered in the regular mail rather than from like a delivery boy. 

If you do leave the house, first of all look and dress however you want - ive been sick and gross looking with messy hair, pj's, and no makeup and still would get hit on, so just dress however you want - the thing is dont make eye contact with people as much as possible. Like when you're shopping and theres other shoppers focus your gaze on the products around you and just keep walking. Sometimes guys try to compliment me and stop and try to talk to me, but I literally laugh like hurr hurr and keep walking. I was in the grocery shop for less than 10 minutes today and THREE men approached me. They don't know what to do when you keep walking, just act like you on a mission and you can pretend to not hear them as well. 

Another thing is if you do have a question when out and about, ask an employee rather than a random shopper. You can find a woman that works there and ask her. I would also get approached a lot by men coming up to me and thinking I worked at the stores when I was wearing a sundress that of course didn't look anything like the employee uniforms. Its their way of playing dumb and trying to have a convo. I just look at them dead serious with a REALLY?! Look of disgusting and not amused on my face and I keep a serious tone, I kind of keep my voice a little deeper rather than having the fake nice higher pitch customer service/polite tone and say in all serious ""I don't work here, I don't know."" And walk away. Some will follow you and ask more and just ignore them. One was real creepy and I saw an employee and was like ""I told you I don't work here,  theres an employee you need to ask him."" Be ""bitchy"" be firm be ""rude"" so to speak don't smile, don't apologize. 

Another tip that can help deter them is headphones, you can wear them even if they aren't playing music, but wear the big obvious ones people can see. It won't stop some guys, but in my experience it helps deter them.

Im gonna say this- your dad is the parent and should be the one taking care of you and your siblings or making some type of arrangement (like hiring someone to help or maybe having another relative come help out) so his kids can be taken care of and the house can be running. 

It is NOT your responsibility to become like a wife/mother/maid/caretaker i do not care what the culture says or anything. The thing is women get burdened down by this especially during their formative years and they should be really working on getting their own life and future secured like by getting that first job, building a resume, saving up money, getting your education, etc. When you get burdened down by having to fill the role of a wife/mother like this, it really makes everything harder to accomplish. 

My advice is do what you can to get a job, pickup extra shifts if possible, and save up what you can. If school is something you're thinking about, do what you can to get in and live at college not at home. While you are at home, I would suggest talking to your siblings and divide up the responsibilities among all of you, to share the burden more. Maybe your younger sister can be the one cooking and folding laundry while you do the dishes and the wash or something like that - rather than having you do everything.

You'd think the next logical step was to stop fucking them - I remember when Alyssa Milano suggested a sex strike and women on twitter responded saying that was white feminism (which is a lie) and said that just because men oppress women that doesn't mean women should have to stop fucking them. I've seen women raise a stink about teen boys killing teen girls in school because of rejection, men chiming in to say if you stop fucking us we'd change quick and women responding with, ""We shouldn't have to stop fucking men for them to be decent human beings"" and one said, ""then men would just rape more."" Women are so controlled they risk their lives and their families lives for dick. I've even heard of tribes women who killed another tribe of women because the men from their tribe fancied another.

I think it’s because when men experience sexual desire or arousal they also experience some degree of hatred or violence. For some reason it’s connected with them. It’s why some men kill a woman after they r-pe her or they fantasize about having intercourse with a woman who has already passed on. Some of the p-rn is terribly violent too - like, more than just kinky. 

So they make up these arguments to feel like they’ve “won one over” on women because they are ‘angeroused’ or whatever depraved kinda state they’re in. They’ll make up some argument just to make you sad. They’ll put words in your mouth and make you think you’re crazy. They’ll spread rumors and lies like the push-up bra meme you referenced.

My mother and I have had a fractured relationship so I won't go there, and my father and I are okay but he's had his moments of giving me everlasting trauma too.
I resented the loser behind men telling me what to do and the verbal and mental abuse I got from them. Also being teased and catcalled from the age of 12 to 20 something from other losers in my community. On one hand I was the ""ugliest"" girl in the hood/in school but I was still having grown butt men and boys making sexual comments and abusive actions against me. And seeing these same a-holes knock up classmates and trap them in crap relationships.

Coming of age in the 90s where female empowerment seemed to be on the agenda in pop culture and so called modern society, But seeing Anita Hill, Lorena Bobbitt and Monika Lewinsky go through the gauntlet of patriarchal bulls-it as is. 

Speaking of pop culture, I was/am a rock music fan and geek and have always participated in the related scenes and subcultures whether they wanted a weird ass black girl in the room or not. However to prevent writing a thesis on the problematic crap in various alt.cultures let's just say that dating and relationship issues in those worlds left me with a bag of chips on my shoulder.

My love life would be a kin to a series of disaster/monster movies, my heart would be yet another city lying in dust with all the financial abuse, infidelity and emotional manipulation wrecking me over and over again. Even after I declared myself a spinster following the breakup with my exfiance, I continued to find more men who sought to use and consume me like a disposable novelty. I finally banned myself from online dating before the advent of Tinder and all those apps, but I have plenty of OK CUPID and Craigslist disasters I could share before I wised up. 

Also I have always been a loner, comfortable in my own company, even though I dont eschew the many friends and chosen family I have. Unfortunately I have been subject to too many male former friends who have wasted my time and gave me problems even as platonic friends, thankfully they have been cut off from my life and brought the drama level down completely.

As a black woman, the perpetuating toxic misogynoir-istic rhetoric in the black culture as well as most definitely outside of it is repulsive and I want no parts of it. I deserve respect and love and will not stand being told and shown disrespectful hatred for daring to exist. Screw all that. I am quite better off by my darn self anyways.

There is so much more in this life for me besides finding a ""good man"" and getting married with children. I am worth more than that mess.

All in all I'm just disgusted by men.  
Realizing that several women around the world had experienced similar things and that I wasn't alone was also eye-opening and a deciding factor in going my own way.   
I tried dating for a while a few years ago before gmow and most men are mediocre as human beings. They're rude, unintelligent, have no impulse control and their sense of humor is abysmal. They can't engage women without mansplaining or putting women in their place (especially if you're a outspoken feminist, then they see you as a threat). Men are afraid of us, which I find egregious because if you look at the statistics of murder and rape, WE should be the ones fearing them. Another problem is that they feel entitled to sex, the ""nice guys"" especially. I don't even feel like escalating with men or talking to them, because I don't want to put myself in a position where I can't leave or can't say no without fearing for my safety. Especially someone who's twoce my size and physically stronger and can use it to their advantage during intercourse (ie rape). So I'd rather not engage with them at all. Even as ""friends"" they're parasites; give them a little pity attention in any form and they'll try to sink their claws in. I had to be mean on purpose to get rid of one lol. I told them to leave me alone, then I ignored them, but nothing worked.   
Pickmes and handmaidens are somehow worse than men, they'll defend their dicksucking at any cost and will embarass **ALL** women in the process.

[],,nanofarm,,,[],,,,text,t2_5dh5p,False,False,[],"Kindly, I would argue that patriarchy is bad for women’s health and male run patriarchal fundamentalist “traditionalist” (especially Christian in the US)  is an expression of that patriarchy. 

Personally, I am an atheist and a Jew and have found religion to be a great source of strength and has buttressed my support system and strengthened my ability to live on my own. When I was bedridden and undergoing chemo, it was the women in my synagogue who brought groceries and meals and took my kid for the day to beach or park with them so I could rest and she could see friends. The older women are a great source of inspiration as many are single by choice as well or are happily married to decent men. Our rabbi is a divorced woman, and was a great source of counsel and comfort for me when I decided to end my marriage. In fact, when it came to light that my ex was abusive, she rallied multiple lawyers for me and testified in custody court for me. The men in the community put a lot of pressure on him to grant my Get and to agree to let me keep the house and to pay child support. They literally would walk him to I’m his car after work and hang out at his tennis club in groups until he backed down. 

I realize that I am being a devils advocate at this point and I’m sorry for that. 

I think going our own way is a process of separation from patriarchal dynamics and most main stream Christian religion reinforces the patriarchy. So the article is a helpful and valid thing to share. Jews are a very small minority so I don’t want to “whatabout” all over to e place here. However, I do think that we can make mindful choices in all areas of our lives and building community is essential for single women in a world designed to enforce heterosexual coupledom. I’ve seen all female Unitarian churches, non denominational women’s groups and such fill this role as well. Separatism is an essential step to ending the patriarchy but that doesn’t mean being an island either. That’s when I notice some struggle with GTOW as we are human and humans are a tribal species. But a relationship with a man isn’t the only way to fill that need.

But me determining that isn’t what I want is solely my own creations. I’m happy to say that is 100% my decision. Despite being brainwashed from a young age that abuse is normal, that women shouldn’t expect more, that my life would rely being dependent on others because I’m not good enough or smart enough to be in my own... I have decided that narrative is all bullshit. 

I remember living with my father and thinking, “I can’t wait to get out on my own and not have to deal with this.” I did not realize I would find men who make me feel the exact same way. It became a pattern. I’m 30 and have finally decided enough is enough. I don’t know if there exists such a proverbial “good man” who exists. I’ve had many, many relationships with supposed good men who turned out be abusive.

As a heterosexual women, I thought I would eventually find someone who sees me as an equal, who treats me right, and who adds benefit to my life. 

I have not found such, and my experiences with men make it so that I don’t want to try. My new fantasy for the future doesn’t involve men at all. It involves a life of peace, self sufficiency, agency, and happiness. Even if a man were “kind,” I just don’t see one adding to any of that. 

It’s funny, I think the idea that women hit a “wall” is reframing something that happens in your 30s and 40s where women are just sick of bullshit. They no longer pander to men. It’s reframed that they are “bitter” and “ugly” but imo it’s more that they no longer want nor need men, and maybe they stop caring about being sexually desirable and focus on themselves, their career, their personal growth, etc. it’s a natural consequence of a life filled with men who are disappointing and/or abusive.

well, not their fault.

They don't abuse them, but neglect them. Like if they were sick they wouldn't take them to the vet because it's expensive, they'd only feed him if there was left overs. So I took charge and I pay everything for them and make sure they are ok.

Like why don't you raise him the rent? It's below market value, I am sure of it because there's other places here that pay like 400€/month of rent and he pays like 75€. 

If I was him I'd accept it obviously. So it's not his fault. But then don't fuck with my Internet. And in the winter he spent electricity, the bills were huge and the first month I paid like 80€ because I couldn't tell if it was me or him.

Then I broke an ankle in August and literally was completely dependent on them. At first it was ok, she loved it that I was completely disabled and dependent, I couldn't go anywhere because I literally couldn't walk lol. So until my treatment ended this March things were okay. Now that it ended and she knows I am independent again, it started getting worst. 

Unfortunately I can't afford a house in the city yet. I'd like to buy a house with a little garden, that'd be the ideal because then I'd take the dogs and wouldn't have to come back here. However houses are even more expensive so if I opt for that it will take me longer to get the downpayment. If I buy an apartment (cheaper), I'll be able to do it sooner, but then I'll have to come back here for the dogs... Another option is to buy an apartment and then come here like two weeks a month and rent it out for AirBnB when I am here, make profit with it, then change it for a more expensive house later on.

[],,Ruby_5lipper,,,[],,,,text,t2_4u2z9avp,False,False,[],"To a certain extent, I think my answer would be yes, although my toxic family wasn't the only reason I've made the life choices I've made and reached the conclusions I've reached.

My mom was the biggest cause of toxicity in my family of origin.  She had untreated borderline personality disorder which often seems very similar to narcissism, but doesn't always have the same severity of symptoms.  That's not to say people with BPD can't be extremely toxic and divisive, because they can and my mom certainly was.  It's just a slightly different set of symptoms and diagnosis than narcissism.

My mom also came with a hefty set of other issues, too - racism, homophobia, blind political conservatism and generic ""xstian values.""  She also had dry drunk behavior, which is when you adopt the behaviors of an alcoholic, but you're not drunk.  My grandfather (who I never knew, had died long before I was in the picture) was an alcoholic and my mom witnessed and experienced his volatility when he drank.  Growing up in that environment, my mom didn't realize she was absorbing his behaviors and later repeating them as an adult in her own life.  Just without the alcohol.  She could fly into an unexpected rage at the drop of a hat, suddenly become physically violent - throw things, slap, push or punch me.

Growing up with her, I got familiar with the signs pretty quickly and could usually tell when she was about to flip into a rage.  It would usually start with verbal bullying and abuse, which was her usual method of expressing rage, degrading us and keeping us under her control.  And as her verbal invective got more severe, the physical violence usually followed.  Sometimes, though, it would show up completely unexpectedly and I'd get a backhand slap across the face completely out of nowhere, or she'd suddenly grab a cup, a book or whatever was in her reach and throw it in my general direction.

We never knew when her volatility would show up and it was often not very far from the surface.  And I believe it was my experience growing up in that kind of environment that was one of the main reasons I have avoided creating any kind of familial relationships for myself.  I'm 52, single, unmarried, no kids, and just don't want to deal with the drama.

Some of that is not for lack of trying.  I did try for many years to find a partner and create a loving partner relationship for myself.  And while I've had a few relationships over the years, nothing has lasted, they've all been unsustainable for one reason or another, and the dating scene has never proved fruitful for me.  I've long since given up looking and have no desire any more to tolerate all the b.s. of the dating scene.

My decision to remain childfree wasn't completely due to my family of origin, either.  While my past experiences definitely play a part, I'm also self-aware enough to recognize that decision was mostly made on my own, and has most likely always been part of my personality.  I never liked playing with dolls when I was a kid, and found baby dolls especially creepy.  My mom loved them and always tried to convince me to like them when I was young, but they always creeped me out.  I look back on that now and realize it was a pretty clear sign that having kids was never going to be part of my future, and that came long before my mom's toxicity became a regular touchstone in my life.",,,1624935856,{},h3ed94y,False,t3_o9wxq8,False,False,t3_o9wxq8,/r/wgtow/comments/o9wxq8/how_many_of_you_dont_have_close_relationships/h3ed94y/,1625194497.0,6,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Example: just the other day, I was driving out of a parking lot and got cut off near the exit by a guy in his car.  My car window was open, so I yelled ""hey!"" at the guy for cutting me off.  His window was open, too, so he responded with ""shut the f\*ck up, fat bitch!""  Had I been thin, do you think he would have yelled, ""shut the f\*ck up, skinny bitch"" at me?  No, I don't think he would.  He went for the obvious 'slur' (aside from 'bitch') that he thought would hurt me, which is commenting on my weight.  That doesn't happen as openly or as much to thin women.  It just doesn't.  It's important to recognize and acknowledge that when having these discussions.

[],,Ruby_5lipper,,,[],,,,text,t2_4u2z9avp,False,False,[],"I'm curious to know how ""your family made you overweight and unattractive on purpose.""  I'm not sure what you mean by that.

I'm a fat woman and a size activist so this statement worries me for several reasons.  Firstly, ""overweight"" is not a positive term to a size activist.  Over *what* weight?  The prefix ""over"" implies that there's an ideal weight everyone ""should"" maintain, and that's b.s.  Everyone has value, is valid, is socially acceptable, no matter how much they weigh.  So the fact that you use terms like ""overweight"" and ""unattractive"" to describe your appearance suggests to me that the male gaze is deeply entrenched in your own thought process about your own appearance, as much as you might want to get away from it.

The first step in ridding the patriarchy from your life is to rid it from your own internal dialog first, and it seems like you haven't done that.  You won't be able to get away from the male gaze until you deprogram yourself from it.  And the first steps are understanding why using terms like ""overweight"" and describing your appearance as ""unattractive"" are deeply toxic and unhelpful to you in accomplishing your goal.

My strong recommendation would be to start educating yourself on size activism (i.e., radical fat activism) and radical feminism in relation to fat activism ASAP.  Books to read: Two Whole Cakes; Lessons From the Fat-o-Sphere; Landwhale; many, many others, but those are a good start.  Most of the authors of those books - Lesley Kinzel, Marianne Kirby, Kate Harding - used to have wonderful size acceptance blogs.  But they stopped writing them a few years ago to make room for other voices in the size acceptance community.  Jes Baker, author of Landwhale, still has a great size acceptance blog, The Militant Baker, worth checking out.  But there are plenty of other resources online, blogs and articles to read, videos to check out... so many discoveries for you to make on your journey of size acceptance, should you decide to make it and use it as the roadmap to help rid yourself of your own deeply entrenched patriarchal views of how women are ""supposed to"" look, how much we're ""supposed to"" weigh, what kind of appearance we're ""supposed to"" maintain.

Should you choose to take that journey, I'll give you 2 guideposts that will hopefully help along the way.  1) The point of the journey is not ""self love.""  The point of the journey is self acceptance and tolerance.  You're very right about 1 thing - fat hate and fear is deeply entrenched in our popular media, in the medical and weight loss industries, and in so much of society.  Your own fat fear of your appearance does not just come from within, but from almost everything else we encounter in the world.  And until that changes (which seems unlikely in our lifetime), learning to accept your fat self in a world that's been taught for years to hate and fear fat people, is a daily journey that never ends.  We'll never reach a point where we can say to ourselves, ""I love myself completely now! I'll never hate my appearance again!""  That just doesn't happen.  The world, in all it's fat-hating fear, will inject itself in our lives and continue to create hurdles that we must struggle over every day.

But if you work on acceptance and tolerance, which includes deprogramming yourself of your own patriarchal views on women's appearance, that journey can get a little easier over time.  Those negative self-talk voices we've all learned that tell us to hate ourselves, hate our appearances, can get quieter over time.  We can learn to be gentler on ourselves.  I've been on that journey for nearly 20 years and it's taken me nearly 18 of them to finally start to get there.  But I speak from experience when I say it *is* possible.  I've seen the difference within myself.

The second guidepost is this: 2) Get rid of the idea that ""no one will ever love you until you love yourself.""  This connects to the first guidepost - the point of the journey is not ""self love.""  The point of the journey is self acceptance and tolerance.  Those things are NOT self love.  ""Self love"" is a construct created by our patriarchal society to teach us to comply with our oppressors.  To clarify... EVERYONE is deserving of love, respect and value, regardless of how they feel about themselves.  You're deserving of love, respect and value whether you love yourself or not.  Telling people that ""no one will ever love you until you love yourself"" is essentially telling them that they're responsible for their own oppression.  It's blaming them for systemic oppression.  If you're a fat person living in a world of patriarchally guided fat hate and fear, you struggle every day with that systemic oppression just to achieve self acceptance.  So, no, you DON'T need to ""love yourself"" to be deserving of love, respect and humane treatment from anyone else on the planet.  The assumption that you do is just so much b.s.

Lastly, I'll address my concerns about your statement that your family ""made you overweight and unattractive.""  There's a lot of psychological baggage in that statement that needs to be unpacked, but I'll speak from my experience as a fat person with some similar baggage and try to debunk some of it.

From about age 12 or 13, my mother subtly encouraged me to eat and, like you, I could say she was at fault for ""making me fat.""  My mother was very overprotective, particularly when it was time for me to start having an interest in boys and to start dating.  If she could have prevented those things from happening, she would have.  Since she couldn't, she subtly encouraged me to eat, knowing that if I had a fatter body, it would make me less attractive to boys.

However, that's not the only reason I'm fat.  I can't completely blame my mom's overprotective and unhealthy parenting style for that.  I can, however, blame her genes.  My mom's fat, too.  Her mom was fat; her mom's mom was fat.  We come from a long line of fat bodied women.  *THAT's* why I'm fat.  Not because my mom encouraged me to eat when I was younger, but because I would have developed a fat body whether she'd done that or not.  It's in my genes.  I couldn't escape it.

Maybe that's not your story, though.  Maybe, unlike me, you don't have a history of fat genes in your family.  Maybe your parents encouraged you to eat and that's a big part of the reason why you gained weight.  Regardless, your parents are not entirely responsible for it and for why you dislike your appearance.  Continuing to blame them takes the focus off your own internalization of patriarchal standards, the male gaze.  And that's really where you need to be looking if you're truly sincere about getting away from the male gaze.

Start with your internalized patriarchal standards first, work on unlearning those, deprogramming yourself, start working on self acceptance and tolerance and learning about size acceptance with a hefty dose of radical (and intersectional) feminism, and you'll be heading in the right direction.",,,1625552986,{},h47m9r0,False,t3_oeg74w,False,True,t3_oeg74w,/r/wgtow/comments/oeg74w/before_i_go_full_on_wgtow_i_want_to_consume/h47m9r0/,1625760177.0,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Men who are attracted to young girls know they should be ashamed of being attracted to children so they spin the narrative to make it that older women are ""unattractive"" or ""undesirable"" but the reality is they are disgusting perverts.

Also when women get older and smarter they are less likely to put up with* the usual crap men dish out. These men know a real adult woman won't put up with they're shit unless hey first tear them down and destroy their self esteem. It's gross and you should completely ignore men like that. 

As to women who are victimized by the patriarchy and perpetuate these lies about women's aging I try to gently question them about it. For example my Mom always said that men age better than women and I just said to her, 'then why are there so many attractive older actresses while old male actors mostly look disgusting and decrepit? I think that women age better because they actually put care into their skin and hair and bodies where as men never even put on sunscreen because that might make them gay.' I could see her considering it and she's never said it again.

You are glorious and beautiful just that way you are! I'm sorry you went through so much trauma. The world is cruel to women.

I'm so sorry to hear about your partner but I'm glad you are living your best life in her honor. You are a Queen! Don't let anyone bring you down! ❤👑❤

I really like the book 'An Interview With The Devil' by Napoleon Hill and he says drifting is basically the ultimate 'sin' i.e. not having a purpose (he doesn't use sin in the traditional Christian sense the whole book is a metaphor it's really interesting). But I think sometimes we focus too hard on finding our ""Purpose"" with a capital P when we can have lots of little purposes on the way that lead us to our bigger one. Otherwise it's a lot of pressure. 

Also I'm personally of the belief that women are THE fundamental creators, not just of life physically but we are the creatrix of all.

I took a really long time in college, because everything interested me.  I even took an additional year in graduate school, because I couldn't squeeze in all the courses I wanted to take in the normal amount of time.

For many years I had a career in a field that makes a meaningful difference to people's lives.  I believed in it (still do though I'm retired), and did my best to excel and also to push the envelope of what institutions of this particular type could be and do.  I spoke nationally about it, published a few articles and book chapters about it, and made sure that I helped women climb the ladder behind me.

Now in retirement, I'm done with all that.  I feel like I've made a contribution so I've ""earned my keep"" as a human, if you will.  So now my purpose is to be present in the moment, and also to care for the very small plot of land I have.  I care about making a safe space for pollinators, growing flowers and fruit trees, and improving the health of the soil.  I enjoy my dog, who will be 3 later this summer.  I also enjoy making art.  

You could say my purpose is hedonistic, but I think that's looking at it in the wrong way.  The world doesn't need all of us to be in the rat race.  Our lives are valuable just because we have them.",,,1624101904,{},h2bb2t3,False,t3_o39gqu,False,False,t3_o39gqu,/r/wgtow/comments/o39gqu/what_is_your_purpose/h2bb2t3/,1624423699.0,12,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Vegetable oil is highly oxidized, and oxidizes more when you cook it, and at body temperature. There's way worse things in a typical western diet than meat. Things we as a species haven't eaten for millions of years. I definitely encourage you to look into it on your own, Dr. Cate Shanahan is a good source. 

Secondly it's not attractong gnats. Rotting meat supports flies, decomposing fruit and veg will attract gnats, it gives them a breeding habitat. Ultimately you need to not provide that habitat. Your options are to stop throwing away food. If you cant eat it in time, put it in the freezer. Or take it striaght out. Source: me, a pest control tech of 5 years.

To me, the concept of facing one's fear seems like a deliberate project, and that's not what happened in my case. 

 X3 misrepresented himself in a bunch of ways.  I thought I was getting a stable, conscientious, emotionally functional man with assets.  What I actually got was an anger-monkey who had less money than he claimed, didn't listen when I expressed my needs, pawed at me instead of considering what might get me in the mood for sex (even though I'd told him myriad times).  But when he tried to kill my 8 month old puppy because she was barking to alert him that her toy had gone under his recliner, I realized all in an instant that I needed to be gone ASAP.  So the next day I rented an apartment and hired an attack dog lawyer.  I moved out with my dog that weekend.

So it started as ""fuck this I need to be gone"" and very quickly turned into ""Huh.  When I think about it, *I* have always been the responsible one.  *I've* always been the one with assets.

[],,immortallogic,,,[],,,,text,t2_5n7jousc,False,True,[],"Hi sis, first of all you're very young. I would highly highly recommend you spend your twenties invested in education, developing your skills, schooling (STEM if you can), reading and gaining knowledge, and cultivating relationships with strong older women and those your age if you can find them.

With regards to your mom, that's ok! There is probably a generational gap, but as long as there is love you don't need to agree on everything! Always cherish your mom as you seem to 🥰

Now the other thing is that you should rethink what it means to 'be alone'. Just because you may not be married or have kids (btw you can still have or adopt kids down the line without a guy), doesn't mean you're alone. As a single 30 year old, the most cherished relationships for me are those with my fellow female friends who are like my sisters. Society has really done a number in convincing us that if you're not in a hetero nuclear family, you're ""alone"". It's bs that simply reinforces the patriarchy.

Now , I'd also recommend reading, so you can become more confident in your choice. The obvious recommendations are authors like Simon de Bouvier, Dworkin, to help you solidify your beliefs. 

But in terms of coping, I'd highly recommend looking into Stoicism. It's a worldview that emphasizes being virtuous, relying on oneself, and not allowing outside influences to affect you. If you can start getting into Stoicism at 18 I promise you will be ahead of the curve. 

Finally and most importantly, learn to enjoy your own company. Go on adventures with yourself, in nature, in the city, whatever. Learn to think of yourself as being WITH yourself and opposed to BY yourself. Become the type of person you are proud of.

You seem intelligent and thoughtful and I'm sure you will do great. Keep in mind that as you get into your twenties you may feel isolated because that's when young women typically do start to get into more serious relationships etc but don't let that away you.

But I do believe that it is a very real possibility that I chose to spend my life alone atm. For me it is very empowering for the following reasons

1) I know I would not end up in a relationship just for the appearance and social value. Every women in my life who is in a bad relationship didn't want to end up alone. Now, going through emotional abuse, they wish their partner would leave them alone.

2) I have learned to enjoy my own company and learning more and more about myself every day. The amount of fun that a woman can have by herself is one of the best kept secrets lol. I mean I do not support incel like mentality. I have friends from all genders that I adore and enjoy spending time with. But at the end of the day I know there is one person who truly has my back and that's myself. 

3) Finally, knowing that fear of ending up alone wouldn't make me beg for men or suffer through things that I shouldn't have to suffer through, it is a peaceful thought. 

For me WGTOW is not necessarily cutting off all men from my life right away, but realizing how my life would continue to be sweet af if I don't chose the traditional marriage and kids route.

I highly recommend the app Headspace. I’d tried to build a regular meditation practice a few times throughout my life but was only successful after relying on the structured lessons of Headspace. Now, 15 months later, I still meditate 10-15 minutes a day about 5 days a week. It’s a big commitment to set aside that much time to “do nothing“ but it was critical for me to get a handle on my anxiety when I was close to having a mental breakdown last year. Because of my meditation practice, now when a particularly anxious thought arises, I have the ability to examine it instead of letting it take control. I can objectively conclude that anxious thoughts are due to insecurity, uncertainty, low self-esteem, etc then move on.   


I believe that mindfulness meditation could help you with your anger and pain. In addition to lessening the intensity of these emotions by viewing them objectively, Buddhism and mindfulness meditation encourages us to treat others with loving kindness - especially  ourselves. When I think back to how I’ve let men treat me in the past, I cringe then take a deep breath and think “I’ve learned a lot from that experience, I deserve to be treated better”, and can move on much quicker than I could‘ve in the past.   


I love what you wrote about how the world at large - and particularly media and especially social media - constantly tell us that we’re not enough and we’ll be happy if we finally have or look like X. Buddhist teachings say that desires harm us twice: before we have them we yearn, crave, feel incomplete til we obtain X. Then afterwards either X didn’t live up to our expectations, or if we lose it then we miss it and maybe even grieve it. I’ve come to view sex this way. When you’re first dating someone it’s so exciting but for me it actually produces a lot of anxiety. “When will I see him again? Will he call me back? I want to have sex with him sooo badly.” Immediately after sex your hormones are satiated, but after a few hours or days - that wasn’t enough, you just want more! This is the cycle of suffering Buddhism says can best be broken by non-attachment.

Imho, almost all gender differences are the result of socialisation. The way boys and girls/men and women are treated by others is so different, we might as well be different species. Most men will never understand the way women are treated in society (unless maybe they're extremely self-reflective about society and their own upbringing). The large majority of men just can't be feminists because they don't get the female experience. As a result, there are very few men who are truly empathetic, simply because they never have to be (quite the opposite, sensitive men are put down by other men...). 

I'm against pornography and prostitution,  but I'm not sure if the Nordic model is the best way to deal with it. As long as economic inequalities exist, some women will turn to forms of sex work and illegality will make them more vulnerable (even if it's only the men being prosecuted - they're their way of making money, after all). Ending economic inequalities and giving all women financial stability should be the first goal in ending sex work. 

I think all feminism catering to men or trying to get men on the board is mostly useless. The majority of men simply benefits from patriarchy in too many ways. Even the soft, more feminine types. There are ways in which men would benefit from a more egalitarian society (such as spending more time with their kids, more true emotional connections,...), but these are things  most men don't value enough to give up their chance for money and power over. 

I think governments should do a lot more to enforce gender equality. Such as making it mandatory that parental leave is split 50/50 (or else part of it expires - with exceptions for single parents, of course). Single earner/SAHP households should not get any tax benefits, but rather pay more taxes, unless both parents stayed at home for an equal amount of time. That said, marriage should not grant people tax benefits at all, but rather having children (if at all). Honestly, I'd abolish marriage altogether. Having companies that don't have 50/50 quotas in higher positions have to PROVE that the man they hired actually fits the hiring criteria than the women who applied. Same for people of colour/different cultural backgrounds (on a quota based on the distribution of inhabitants of a country). Giving all women free and safe access to birth control and abortion. Giving lesbians and single women access to adoption and IVF. Not releasing drugs that were not tested on women. 

More women in police force/governmental positions/judicature positions. Harsher sentences for violent men. Laws that protect women from crimes such as under-skirting, sharing nudes, revenge-porn,... (where they are not already in action).  Measures to  combat economic inequalities, such as finally taxing the rich and guaranteeing working people fair wages. Inheriting anything of larger monetary value should simply be illegal - children of rich people already have large benefits due to better education etc., no reason to allow them to gain a large amount of resources they never had to work for. Investing in good quality schools and preschools to give all children access to good education. Not allowing companies that use slave labour or exploit poorer countries to sell their products. All these points are from a pretty European perspective, in other countries, different measures might be useful. 

That said, none of this is going to happen, as pretty much all governments/executive/judicature orders are deeply rooted in patriarchy and no real change will be allowed.",,,1619862890,{},gwixsyf,False,t3_n1rik4,False,False,t3_n1rik4,/r/wgtow/comments/n1rik4/which_type_of_feminism_do_you_identify_with/gwixsyf/,1619885898.0,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

I've never been protected by any man, including my 'father'. so sometimes there is that infantile wish to just be taken care of. but I snap out of it when I take care of myself. bc I do a much better job at it than any man could.

also, men are never as good as you want them to be. there is this guy that I thought was okay (he looks beautiful and is smart and he laughs at my jokes). but yesterday a woman told me that he's apparently quite arrogant and annoying LMAO. I applauded her for putting him in his place. so yeah. I take it as a compliment when he stares at me (which is also kinda hilarious), but I would not take him home. men, in general, are disappointing. they are clowns.

It's important to become your own person. I do that by having hobbies that I LOVE!! I am writing my own short stories (and eventually a book). I am becoming so much better at it. why would I spend my valuable free time on a man? I want and need that time to become better at my hobby. that's much more fulfilling than being in a relationship.

Also, I love getting to know who I am. I think other people distract you from yourself. that's why so many people are addicted to relationships. I need and want to work through years of neglect, abuse and other traumas. I want to get to know myself. I need solitude for that. all of this can be painful but it's necessary. I don't want to be a vapid person who is addicted to romance. Nah. I can do better than that.

Actually I have a question I made in AskHistorians and AskFeminists and nobody replied. It was about the relationship between the black people rights movements and feminism and also asking if its typical that civil rights leaders reject the help from whites.

This was based on my observation of Malcom X movement. Obviously nation of Islam was against race integration so naturally they'd refuse a black man to date white women. But then I found an article saying that Malcom X actually mistreated white women (slapping them and stealing money because they could always go ask more to daddy according to him) while never doing that to black women. He took revenge on white women and thought getting a white girl was like a trophy because he'd be ""stealing"" the girl from the white men who for centuries raped black women.

Also then I found another article of a black activist saying he often got the question from whites asking what they could do to help... And according to him it was mostly from white women. I was curious, why mostly women? Do black people consider white women were equally or less guilty for things like slavery and systemic racism? Also Malcom X yelled for the ""death"" of white men. Not sure that includes white women too.  A black activist of my country said something like that recently and everyone was offended but I was like ""weeeellll, he said white men... I am a woman"" lol

I do personally tend to be more complacent with black men because I feel like we both belong to oppressed classes...

Nah, we're oppressed because 'they' want us to have babies.

The capitalists need their labor class. Anti natalistists are very rare and seen as crazy, it's definitely not what the majority wants even though the result is sparring children from forcing them to experience pain, suffering and inevitable death they didn't ask for.

All books are in PDF form. If you want access, please send me a chat/message and I will happily add you as a viewer on the drive, after ensuring you're genuine (I'll have a look at your history). 

I hope you can all gain some knowledge, there are some really good reads in there. I'm trying to read one book per month this year, and I encourage you all to make some sort of reading goal for yourself!

Could also be cool to start a thread for each book/different books that some of us may have read, and we can discuss them.

[],,immortallogic,,,[],,,,text,t2_5n7jousc,False,True,[],"Lol I hear you, but this story should make you feel better about yourself and all the bullets you're dodging by pursuing this lifestyle. 

I'd suggest maybe getting off social media, especially if you're at the age when many of your acquaintances are getting married/having kids, and if you feel like it may have an impact on how you feel about yourself (although your stance seems very strong, it can be easy to see all these pictures that feed into the traditional societal narrative and think very briefly ""damn, am I f'ng up?""). The answer is, no, you're not. 

If you're looking for some words of support/validation here they are: you are literally making one of the best decisions a woman can make. To decide to be unencumbered by the traditional tropes that very often pull women down (marriage/kids), is one of the most liberating things you can do. The road will be lonely at times, but the satisfaction of knowing that you won't have to put up with a ton of bs that comes with the normal narrative and that you'll have the freedom to do whatever the hell you want with few strings, is incredibly powerful. If you want some quotes:

To live alone is the fate of all great souls  - Schopenhauer

The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself. - Kipling.

The trans brigade is basically saying that sex does not determine gender. Our problem with that is the full knowledge that women are oppressed based on their sex - not the idea that they *identify* as women. 

Radical feminism is growing among older women, we are going after the men who are passing these anti abortion laws and we are working with other feminists &amp; women in order to ensure the legal protection of women’s bodies and rights. 

There have always been many strands of feminism because contrary to what patriarchy would have everyone believe, women are not a hivemind. Radical feminism embraces that many women may not have such “extreme” beliefs but at the same time, we are the only feminists who openly support segregated spaces for women to ensure that men cannot dull, hijack, play down and “not all men” women who would like to speak openly about their struggles and experiences of women.

One of the reasons why all women intentional communities fascinate me is because it gives Americans the opportunity to actually experiment with ways of living and see for themselves what it is that they want to do. Ultimately any and all freedom of Choice greatly increases the ability to make and accept any choice that is made. 

For example, when I talk to Americans who criticize the nuclear family and idealize a more blended family structure, I often ask them if they've read up on the draw-backs that come from THAT structure, which is largely that mother-in-laws RULE and younger women feel absolutely no autonomy to make choices in their children's lives.

I don't particularly think that any structure is perfect, or doesn't have its drawbacks. We need to protect the elderly, but we also need to innovate without the elderly burdening us with tradition. We need to protect children, but we also have to let go and accept when children make decisions that we don't agree with. We have to be caregivers, but care giving doesn't pay the bills. We all want the five current generations to be treated with equal dignity without sacrificing any of our self-respect.

[],,MedievalMadeliene,,,[],,,,text,t2_7q1kou4u,False,False,[],"Feminism has taken a huge backslide due to third and fourth wave feminism thinking the game had already been won. Now, radical feminists who follow second wave feminism focus on the wrong things as well and seem to have been co-opted by the right. Not ALL but quite a number of radical feminists--which are the only ones willing to still aggressively fight for women's rights--align themselves with right-wing association out of mutual hatred of ""Trans"" people.  


So who is left fighting against men? No one, really. Third and fourth wave feminists spend most of their time trying to educate and coddle men and do the emotional work of healing them from ""toxic masculinity"". Radical feminists show a lot of promise, but get side tracked by ideological hatred of gender situation to the point where they will sometimes SIDE with conservatives--which is fucking mind-blowing to me. 

I believe all of these movement have been co-opted--by men. Liberal men who see third and fourth wave feminism as  a way to refocus women's energy on men and reframing objectification as empowering, and hardly focus on women's issues at all. And then conservative right-wing men who find their way into radical feminist groups and redirect what was originally nuanced conversations about the current state of gender ideology to turn it into outright hatred and bigotry--and they use radical feminists to add legitimacy to their hatred of trans people.   


The latter really disappoints me. Where is the focus on MEN AS A CLASS? radical feminism flirts with it, but ultimately always goes back to freaking out about trans people. Even if their criticism is valid, trans people hold very little power and make up a small percentage of men at large. Why are they not focusing on MEN IN POWER--such as Greg Abbott as well as all of the other conservative politicians and their lobbyists who are now pushing our rights BACKWARDS?   


The problem with feminism has always been that men will find a way to co-opt it and direct it to do their will. Women have been too easily swayed by men's direction in their own movements. For instance, radical feminist groups that I was a part of would \*claim\* to be against all male allies, yet they would allow traditional, conservative men SIMPLY because those men questioned trans issues.

[],,mdiver12,,,[],,,,text,t2_etnmf,False,False,[],"I've lived in and done work for these communities, specifically in S. Oregon. Fly Away Home is beautiful and has two residents, but they are both incredibly stubborn and I imagine hard to live with, at times. I spent time working there and those two are so set in their ways it can be exhausting. They bought the land as romantic partners, split up shortly after, and have lived there together since the late 70s. They still bicker like they broke up yesterday.  However, I did have the wonderful experience of hiking through the mountains with a 71 year old woman who periodically needed to stop and push her uterus back in. The water line for FAH snakes through the siskiyou mountains about two miles to a spring box they share with neighbors. When it's dry, bears and other animals bite through the line hunting for water. Side note, it gets super dry in S. Oregon so they do this multiple times per summer. Men haven't been on their land in decades. 

The land I lived on was near Grants Pass and Rootworks (but wasn't Rootworks. I do have friends who lived there with Mountaingrove, though) and we ran the production offices for We'Moon out of our main house. We'Moon employed most of the women who lived there, and connected those who didn't work for them to a larger local community. It wasn't quite as strict as FAH when it came to men on the land- we have a good drag queen friend who visited frequently and also had men who were friends visit, though they were few and far between. 

I was able to easily support myself doing odd jobs for other women and lesbians (in particular) in the area. Unfortunately, the location makes it less than friendly to BIPOC. The lack of diversity is noticeable and feels VERY encouraged. It's one reason among many that my wife and I chose to leave the area. 

We still talk about buying a big piece of land and building homes on each corner of it, with a community home in the center. I think the younger generation of women values community, but also has a much stronger need for independence and solitude. Sometimes you don't want to talk about your feelings at the required weekly meeting, but that doesn't mean you're turning your back on your landmates. We've also been conditioned as women to hide our feelings, and that can lead to a whole lot of passive aggressive behavior when living in community. Think someone uses too many dishes when they cook? Let's vote to change the rules about who does dishes when that person cooks because I don't like getting my hands pruny. Have an opinion about how the shower curtain should hang after someone showers? Put it on the weekly meeting agenda, right after ""who ate my raw cashews and spirulina?""

I’ve known women that have absolutely gotten their ass kicked trying to “be more aggressive”. The same way not all women would put up with getting their teeth knocked out, not all men will put up with “getting their teeth knocked out” like your grandpa. 

And that’s not to even bring in the discussions of female socialization/victim blaming and do you even *want* to be in a relationship where you have to constantly be on guard and force someone to respect your boundaries. 

I think learning to pick your battles is the smartest way to go about things.

That is of course until I found out that relationships nowadays are not like my grandparents relationship that lasted 40+ years.

So I have a hard time investing in someone emotionally if I know that it's going to end in 1 or 2 yrs. Whats the point really?
Being chilfree also sort of complicates things because most guys will stick with you if you have a common purpose (kids) but if you don't want to have kids they might not take you serious as a partner. Also much easier to break up if you don't have common obligations together (kids, common house mortgage, etc).

On the other hand I am not sure I would be able to have a long term relationship like my grandparents. My grandfather wasn't abusive or a cheater. They both worked hard, saved money to build a house, don't rememeber seeing them fighting. When my grandmother died, my grandfather was heartbroken, didn't find out anyone else and honestly I think he was just waiting to die to rejoin with my grandmother.

Pillow Talk (1959) sounds like an absolutely awful movie that glorifies rape culture. Two men objectify and compete over a single career woman to make her give up her life, career, and goals. The douche-bag womanizer neighbour she hates pretends to be someone else to seduce her. He manipulates to get her consent. That's a horror movie to me!  

This quote is from the womanizer chatting up a woman on an old party line phone system. The career woman and her friend (Jan and Alma) overhear it and discuss it. The friend with internalized sexist views agrees and also starts pressuring the career woman to get a man. The whole plot of the movie is based on the lead female character being too beautiful to be allowed to stay single and focus on her interior design career. 

Thelma Ritter is the actress who plays the friend and delivers the line in the movie. It's not actually something she said as a real person.

and then in other disenfranchised communities especially or in particular the black community in the us (but can be expanded to others that's just where it's the most pronounced - also to a certain extent the latino community i've noticed albeit not as much) the men don't have the resources to provide that 'patriarchal bargain' with so those women become more independent head of household etc. i did also learn about the smaller amount of black women going the other direction with the divestment/swirler movement (which i know are different things but overlap) but it seems most are going the way in which you say. but i find it interesting that there is this subset of woc/bw in particular now who are going the opposite direction and basically wanting patriarchy perhaps because they didn't experience it from their own group in the way they felt like other women have.  

so long story short i think the reason why they didn't follow was because the 'bargain' was good enough for them and now it's not, or they are realizing it never was to begin with. but i actually think it's more because it's just not good enough anymore because there are a lot of women out there who would sign up for it if they got xyz requirements met, hence also why other women are jumping ship to other social groups i have even seen many say they would only do so if higher xyz requirements were met things that they would not require from their own group (usually in terms of resources money etc.)

Normally in order to be resident in a foreign country, you need to have a job. And it’s better to find the job before you move, however the challenges most people won’t hire unless you live there.

So you can either move there and stay on your tourist visa and look for a job, or…

You could go to university in the country, and look for a job, so that when university ends you can switch your visa over to a work visa. 

It’s really hard to move to a foreign country, especially with their residency requirements. Yet if you do it under the University, it would be easier. You’ll just need to check to see how you turn a student visa into a proper work visa so you can maintain residency.

Also check out how long residency requirements are. Many countries state that you are a temporary resident for a certain amount of years… Yet if you live there long enough, become a permanent resident. Which means in most countries you don’t need to have a job in order to stay. So if you lose your job, you can stay.

Also check and see what the language requirements are, as well as how long you need to live there before you can apply for citizenship. And double check and make sure that they allow dual citizenship, that is if you want to maintain your current citizenship. 

For example, to live in Spain, you need to have a job. You could also look and see if you can go there and start your own company, but note that the Spanish job market is shit at the moment. As a US citizen, you can live in Spain for six years, and then after that you have a permanent residency card which means you don’t need a job to stay. And at the 10 year mark you can apply for the Spanish passport, and they do recognize dual citizenship

We should be able to talk about it like the health problem it is. When we say being anorexic is bad for you, we aren't saying being thin is bad, or that people suffering from anorexia are bad. We're saying it's a serious health concern. Binge eating is also disordered eating and it's a psychological problem. I'm sick of hearing I should be happy the way I am. I'm not. And that's ok. It drives me to improve. 

I no longer say I want to lose weight. I say I want to get stronger and healthier. It helps my mindset and people don't react the same way.

I do think discrimination against fat people is a huge problem. If fat people are represented in media they are presented as the butt of the joke or as pathetic and depressed.

[],,[deleted],,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"Honestly, I think we have been sold down the river by the notion of romantic love and the way it is portrayed in the media...and we are fed this dream from a young age. Even people who have long and happy marriages would probably tell you that their lives look nothing like the romantic ""ideal"" and involve way more compromise than we are ever led to believe.

I have been purposfully single and celibate for almost a decade now and I still sometimes get that desire to fall in love with some great guy. When I take the time to think about it, I realise that feeling of me wanting romantic love is probably actually an expression of a deep down longing for companionship and connection both of which can be found in friendships (even online, with like minded people) without all the drama that the whole dating scene inevitably invites. I haven't yet met a guy with the capacity to be as kind, loving and generous to me as I am to myself.

I decided to walk away from dating for the sake of my sanity and so that I could funnel all of the emotional energy that relationships demand into my children, but many years down the line I have discovered that I can give myself everything that I would want from a romantic partner and without any of the fuss that comes with trying to align with another person. Yes, even sex! There is a peace and fulfillment that I never really expected to experience, since my whole being had been wrapped up in finding ""the one"" who would make everything suddenly fall into place. And somehow, things have fallen into place whilst I have been pusposfully single. I didn't expect that to happen!

I still have days when I get a pang. And I sometimes miss being intimate with another person, but there is a price to pay for relationship and for me, that always involved compromising far, far too much. 

How would you feel if you met someone tomorrow and the life you have built for yourself as a single woman suddenly had to grow and change to accomodate another person's needs? But not a perfect guy, because they don't exist.

I am 33 and also somewhat conventionally attractive (not perfect, but more on the attractive side than not and I clean up well.) But I’ve always been kind of weird and shy. I just started getting Botox and I feel deeply conflicted about it. I almost got a breast reduction when I was younger, basically for cosmetic reasons. Three of my good friends have gotten nose jobs. It’s amazing that I resisted all that pressure. As I get older I realize I would miss my imperfect nose and breasts if I ever changed them, because they make me me. 

I also have a very corporate job and feel pressure to dress well for the office. I would say for job interviews and client meetings I do wear makeup, but day to day on the job I eventually stopped putting so much effort into my appearance. It’s hard because other women treat you better when you look made up, and I do have the kind of face that makeup dramatically improves (not all women do, but I have kind of fair eyelashes and deep features that pop so much more with makeup.) And I honestly do feel like people treat me better when I’m wearing light makeup and acting confident. 

I feel so conflicted about it, but I have decided to just support other women no matter what, if they play the game or don’t play the game. If having to look good helps women earn more money I find it hard to criticize them for that.

[],,Shadowgirl7,,,[],,,,text,t2_16y5cj,False,False,[],"Can totally relate. I was sort of ""forced"" to being independent at a very young age because my parents never took care of my needs, for example, I had to figure a way to go to college on my on, it was me who took care of all the paperwork of scholarship, it's me who basically does most paperwork. When I was unemployed I always found my jobs alone (my brother for example, needed my mom to talk with some neighboors to help him find two jobs he had), I moved to a new city alone and took care of all the process of finding a house there and finding a way to move my stuff. I do vacations alone, I spend most of my days alone. Even when I liked someone, it was a LDR which I realize now was enough for me because it somehow fulfilled my emotional needs to have someone who I could text but distant enough that I wouldn't have to deal with them (still think LDR are sort of crap, but okay, they served their learning purpose for me). 

It was a process, a couple of years ago I was craving men attention because I never had. I was bullyed growing up, I thought I was so ugly, so having some male attention helped me understand that that's not the case. So then after a while, I slowed down in seeking male attention and entered a phase where I wanted someone to have a long lasting stable relationship that cared about me.

It took a few experiences to realize that that's probably not going to happen. The only thing that makes me miserable in my life is that I still don't own a house in the city where I work so I can take my dogs there with me and don't have to interact anymore with my abusive parents. No man will ever provide that for me (well at least not without some attached abuse because men are foreign to the concept of giving just because), so I don't really need one.

It sounds like the article's author, Bella DePaulo, is essentially plagiarizing the idea that Sasha Cagen came up with nearly 17 years ago, Quirkyalone.  DePaulo uses the term ""single-at-heart,"" but it's the same exact concept Cagen created in 2004 with her book and website, Quirkyalone - people who generally prefer to be single, are usually childfree, or may be married or in a relationship, but each person in the relationship is fulfilled on their own and is a whole person without their partner.  Cagen did extensive research on the Quirkyalone phenomenon, too, and has been giving Quirkyalone seminars all over the world for years.  I attended a Quirkyalone anti-Valentines Day gathering back in 2005.  ...Well, not exactly ""anti-"" Valentines Day, but more of an alternative to V Day, a gathering of single, like minded people who weren't necessarily looking for partners and want to live beyond the societal and Madison Avenue-sponsored expectations of stereotypical couplehood, expensive dinners, gifts, chocolates, flowers, etc, that V Day has come to mean.

Cagen's been promoting these concepts, researching them and drawing people together for years.  DePaulo really hasn't stumbled on anything new, other than someone else's idea that she seems to be stealing.  Check the facts here...

Trigger warning: animals as food




AND I also spent a fortune on frozen rats. I also found out how crappy of a life feeder rats had before they were frozen, and that made me sad. So I built a rat colony. All the moms and dads were tame pets and the others had a very happy life with lots of room to play and enrichment and fresh veggies. I humanely euthanized them with CO2 (they just get sleepy and relaxed) then my snakes get healthy food that had a good life and I get lots of pet rats. Any excess feeders get tamed and played with and given to niblings and neighbors who want pets or if I get a big surplus I can sell them on Craigslist to help pay for food and toys. 

So you know where my heart is, I used to work in the food industry and now refuse to be a part of that system. I have chickens for eggs and meat as well as dairy goats. They all live glorious happy lives, even the ones that I peacefully and humanely butcher for food. I rarely eat meat and only if sustainably grown. I felt like the same should apply to the feeder animals for my reptiles. Rats are so intelligent and social, being farmed in battery cages in sterile rooms just doesn’t seem right.

Google the problem your car is having. You will likely be able to narrow it down to three or so causes. Research how much those generally cost to repair. Find out how much the parts generally are, and how many hours it takes to fix. 

When you get an estimate, it’ll most likely be one of the causes that you already have a price range for. Have them break down the parts and labor. Now you have some leverage. 

“You are saying it will be $1200 to do &lt;thing&gt;. You are charging me $500 for a $200 part and $700 for labor for something that will take two hours to fix. Go ahead and put my car back together so I can take it somewhere else.”

Or maybe they are more reasonable. “Ah the going rate for that is $400, not $500. If you’ll do it for $400 / $425 / $450, we have a deal.”

Maybe they give you a cause you haven’t researched yet. Ask for the parts and labor costs. Tell them that the price sounds high, so you will call them right back. Then research and call back and haggle. 

When you are dropping off the car and they hit on you, get your car back and leave. Ask them questions up front on the possible causes. If there is any whiff of disrespect, drive away.

[],,nanofarm,,,[],,,,text,t2_5dh5p,False,False,[],"One thing stood out in your post: you feel like you can’t love yourself because you have *never experienced love* 

So: you know from experience that looking for love outside yourself hasn’t yielded results. Maybe it’s time to start looking inside yourself. 

Imagine how you would feel if someone loved you: what would that look and feel like? Get specific and write it down. What parts of you would you get to be ok with? What would you get to think and feel? What would it “fix”? Spend time really getting it all out. Spin the entire fantasy. You will probably cry, that’s ok. 

Now, what is stopping you from feeling this way now? Why do you need someone else to give you permission? What if you could think and feel all of those good things with or without someone else? 


You may need to go neutral at first because you will resist the idea that you are lovable. Forcing yourself to think positive thoughts that you don’t yet believe is not really helpful. So make a list if the things that you don’t dislike about yourself and move up from there. 
Start from compassion, can you have the same care and compassion for yourself that you would for someone else? Can you forgive yourself for not being (insert whatever is bothering you)? 

As a side note: it is very hard to recognize or receive love (romantic or otherwise) when you don’t love yourself. It causes cognitive dissonance which your brain hates so it will find ways to discount and disregard any love you have received. So you may have been more loved than you realized in the past. 

Do some thought exercises. Are you sure you have never been loved? By family? Friends? No one has even loved a part of you? Right now your brain can only find evidence that you are not loved. Give your brain the assignment of finding evidence that you are lovable. Brains are very good at finding evidence, so you have to decide where you want to direct that. 

For example: my coworkers don’t love me in a traditional sense but I know that they love having me as a coworker and admire my many good qualities. I’m able to see that because I also love those things about me. And here’s the cool thing: I only *think* they think those things because I believe it. Maybe they secretly hate me, I have no idea. My own mother could despise me and I would never be able to know for sure. 

On the other side: I married and had a baby with a man I was sure loved me. Turns out he and I had different definitions of love. He doesn’t think he lied but he didn’t love me the way I thought he did. We had different thoughts/ideas about love. I’ll never know for sure what he felt for me but i didn’t like how he treated me so I left. I felt very betrayed for a long time because I thought he cared for me. But I couldn’t feel what he was feeling, i only had my perceptions. 

This is where things start to get metaphysical and confusing but it’s not as depressing as it seems! Love is a feeling that your thoughts create inside of you. That’s all it is. It doesn’t cost anything to feel love for someone- in fact it feels wonderful to love someone- the love I feel for my daughter is the most amazing thing in the world. You can feel that same love for yourself. 

Love is a feeling that only you can feel- you can’t feel it for someone else or make them feel it for you. The experience of love comes ONLY from your thoughts about yourself and the other person. It isn’t a sensation like hot or cold, it’s an emotion which comes from your brain.

The narrative for activism changed from the '60s into forcing mainstream America to let people fit in.

Our historically black colleges and universities and are historical black communities have suffered ever since, because the narrative changed so completely to talented people of color going to corporations and government jobs then into creating their own.

The same thing for women, white or people of color.

They cannot love like what we women mean with “love”. And another part in healing was becoming excited about what I can do in this life that has no connection to a man.

I have a career in a field I enjoy, I love cooking and baking for friends and acquaintances, cultural exchange, teaching, acting... etc etc. And I can take all my free time t to care for my body and soul.

I can’t anymore imagine sharing my living space with a man. Even if you were in love with a man, he’d still be a flawed human, and with way more flaws than women generally.

It's a casual relationship based on fun and not drama. I'm not saying that some don't end up long-term or bring drama, but that often isn't the goal.

We've all been (or are) young women so we know that a traditional relationship can bring drama, games and hurt feelings, etc. Why? Usually, one person wants more of something from the other that the other isn't willing to give.

As for older men/older women relationships, I think some men avoid a relationship with older women their age because we are more mature than younger women and less likely to take any drama, etc. We know what we want and what we don't want. We are independent and have higher expectations and don't have to compromise our values, etc. if we don't want to.

Another guy was literally insane too but in a way that didn't benefit me.

He could've been the devils son abusive and soulless. Just to tell ya that it's not in my head. I had an abortion once and he was there...

When he went away I got a Ted talk from the abortion doctor that was also a man that I need to break up with him cause he could sense that he's bad news and told me to focus on educating myself to the highest level and stay away from men. He basically encouraged me to be WGTOW. I know he told me because it was too late for him he had kids distracting from his studies so he became a doctor late. I've never ran into anybody boy or girl before or after that encouraged me to be WGTOW. I broke up with dude after the abortion was all done and said.

Made the decision right there but I also designed my life after that solo and fell more in love with WGTOW.

But, for some reason I never applied that same logic to relationships.  I was never particularly interested in being partnered, it was just, ""what you do.""  It took an abusive marriage and two failed long-term relationships for me to stop and ask why I was putting myself through so much drama and misery.

Whenever I was in a relationship, it always felt like my life was on hold.  I often compare it to a train derailment.  Then, once it ended, it would take me months to get the train back on the tracks and moving in the direction I wanted to go again.

My last relationship ended about 10 years ago when I was 30.  That's about when I figured out that I was likely on the ace-aro spectrum.  I never dated much anyway, but that's when I made the decision to bow out of the game entirely.  I stayed single until I briefly did a FWB thing about 5-6 years ago.  Decided that wasn't worth the headache either, and was blissfully single again until last year.  Out of curiosity, I decided to dip my toe in the dating pool again, but that only lasted a week or two.

Sex bores me to tears, so apart from companionship and someone to share the bills with, I really don't see what a traditional romantic relationship has to offer.  I can easily afford the bills on my own, and I can get companionship from a cat, so.... {shrug}

I just never really thought relationships where that great and didn't understand when others wanted one. When I was a teenager, I thought I wanted to have a boyfriend, but whenever I fantasised about being in a relationship, I really just thought about kissing, making out, sex. Turned out you could also have that without a relationship (yes, I know, these days everyone complains about people just having hook ups without relationships, but I grew up in a rather conservative area, and FWBs as a widespread phenomena did not really exist. ONS were something that you'd maybe do drunk once and then regret...). 

Anyway, I went my merry way just having hook-ups and sort of FWBs. At some point, I did have a relationship, mostly because romantic relationships are so ingrained in society and I thought I might just try it out. I did love the guy, but at the same time, I was relieved when the relationship ended. I just like having my freedom, doing what I want, and planning my own life without taking plans of another person into account. 

I just stayed single after that. I guess finding wgtow made me even more secure in my decision. I was also getting frustrated about the men I had sex with, because most of them were not that good at it and finding a good FWB was hard. The combination of reading more on feminist separatism, wgtow, and other alternative lifestyles made me question my own lifestyle. At some point, after my last (good) FWB ended and I was having a few episodes of bad sex while trying to find a new one, I just decided to quit dating/hooking up altogether and went full wgtow. 

Life is a lot more peaceful since. Ironically, even though I never wanted to bind myself to a men and always valued my independence, I had spent way too much time on tinder and dating men.

when it comes time to twist it in to place you need good grip and upper body strength *OR* you could outsmart gravity with the jack from your car.

I have a hand injury so this method doesn’t work well for me and the disposal I picked didn’t have the tabs that stuck out so it was a no go either way. 

Here’s what I did- there is a thick rubber gasket between the disposal and the sink so I put a bottle jack under there and a piece of wood to distribute the force and jacked it up juuuust enough to compress the gasket, then I could twist it into the lock position with both hands. Much easier! I undid all of it and did it again with little jack out of my car and it worked just as well.

So first of all, no guy would touch my money. I don't share my money with anyone, I would never have a shared account. If I lived with the person for a while (say like 1 or 2 years) I could come to the idea of opening a shared account and charging it with a fixed amount of money monthly for the expenses, but I would NEVER give him access to my personal account. And I know how I am, at the slightest suspicious activity, we'd have a serious problem. I am very territorial about my money lol. 

Second of all, I don't date potheads I don't smoke weed or drink that much, so defintely he would not smoke inside the same house where I lived. Or drink too much for that matter. I don't want drunk guys inside my house much less to share a bed with a drunk dude. I can only imagine for me this would not end well... I'd either hurt him, or he'd hurt me depending on who was stronger. I am a Virgo I don't like messes inside my house and my moon is in Scorpio, so dude, be careful when I have access to knives. lol

Third, I am childfree and that includes not having to provide for a dude. If he doesn't make at least the same or more than me, you can forget it. I live in a country with extremely low salaries (even though I am from STEM but even so they are low) so for a guy to make less than me his job would have to be picking strawberries or oranges on a field anyway. 
If he doesn't have a job like me, you can forget it (that would solve the long hours, I mean if he had a job he wouldn't complain about the long hours because he'd have long hours too). I am also not too fascinated about guys with no college degrees.  

Damn if I have to accept a guy who doesn't work, doesn't have a stable job or career, smokes weed, drinks beer then definetely this is not ever going to happen to me... EVER lol. 

All the guys I ever liked were not like that, they were older, had money/house/car didn't use drugs (probably did when younger but not anymore) and it still didn't work lol. 

My family always said I was stingy so maybe this is my natural blessing. 

Despite that you managed to graduate in a field that seems quite interesting and you have a fascinating career goal...so yeah you are successful already.

I would physically cringe when thinking of how I dealt with men in the past, but be kind to yourself. What you went through is a betrayal, and it must have been so difficult to process in the moment. The way you reacted is completely normal, especially when worried about your living situation. 

It helps me to think of those moments as lessons for how I want to act when moving forward, so you change resentment to determination. You had never been in that position before, and now you’ve learned how dangerous it is to be close with people who consume porn. That’s incredible progress! 

Don’t beat yourself up for things you didn’t know because you’re learning. Once you’ve processed it, don’t look back. Just think of how you want to do things moving forward. And remember that women are conditioned to accept these behaviors, so you are literally fighting against generational conditioning when you go through these situations. It’s not your fault. 

It might be a sore spot for a while, but you’ll get over it. I have. Whether or not you choose to confront him is up to you. I highly doubt you will get a satisfying response from him if you choose to speak to him— his actions show entitlement, and the fact that he was nervous means that he *knows* what he did was wrong but he didn’t care. He chose to do it anyway. I’m not sure if anything you say would change that, especially since he chose to violate you even though you two were so close. 

However, only you know what is best for you. If you want to confront him for yourself and your own peace of mind, then go forward. I’m only saying that I don’t think you’ll get anything from him out of it.

Exactly this. Even when they want to be submissive, they direct everything down to the makeup and the shoes and the script. So much for domination. 

The need truly is perverse. That’s why they like to attack powerful women - actresses, politicians, even a woman who just speaks her opinion.

Men are completely ruled by their obsession with the female body - that’s why in some cultures women can’t even show an ankle or a wrist. They hate that they want us so badly. 

They commit suicide at three times the rate of women. At least they know they’re depraved, some of them.

Maybe in some situations but most probably didn't actually want to have kids and definitely not the number of kids they did want to have.

It syncs with our menstrual cycles or it used to. We'd ovulate with the full moon. It was a way for us to control our fertility. They took that away.

I also heard a story not sure if it's true that originally the wedding ring was made because women would literally be tied up, like elephants are today. Eventually with enough conditioning the elephant can be tied to a balloon or a chair or something lightweight that they could easily run away from but they don't because they are conditioned by the fact that it's tied to believe it can't go anywhere. After women were tied up for so long eventually they just tied a string to their finger as a reminder to stay and that's where wedding rings came from.

Many aren’t ambitious either, and think being SAHM is easier (it’s a 24/7 job with no vacation so I don’t know how it is). 

They don’t have a strong identity so they assume the identity of motherhood easily because it gives them purpose even if it’s draining them. 

Its easier to just follow the traditional path then to think critically. However, I’m seeing things changing. This generation is having less s3x, domestic violence has gone up since lockdown and women are divorcing. I’m seeing more women confident in their decision to just be single and live life.

I'm mainly talking about western women. A third world shit hole is different. Why a western woman would make it her goal to get married and especially get married and start a family the traditional way, and have her life be male-centered is beyond me. Brainwashing only excuses so much, this isn't the same as some MK Ultra brainwashing where we act like Manchurian candidates whenever we hear trigger words. I feel like most women in these spaces had something that they would consider the ""straw that broke the camel's back"", as far as them snapping to. Many women have had those experiences, but it either doesn't register or they refuse to let it do so.

In my anecdotal experience, I was very, very willful as a child- not a trouble maker, but did not like being told what to do and did not like that I was told, either directly or indirectly, that people grow up and get married and have families. I didn't like the idea of a husband and especially kids.

Anyway, she gives birth in a fucking Walmart and I freaked out and started crying to my mom that I didn't want that to happen to me.

[],,Shadowgirl7,,,[],,,,text,t2_16y5cj,False,False,[],"Oh yes, the same for me. I was a virgin up until 24 (almost 25) and it was starting to weight me down. 
The stereotype says that girls who are virgins in that age is because they had some sort of sexual trauma (nop never had a sexual trauma, in fact a childhood friend of mine was molested by a family member and she has a LTR stable relationship so definetely not that), are religious (I sympathize with the Communist Party, that'd be an interesting combination lol) or have some sort of disease. I masturbated, I was not religious and never had any sexual trauma. Being a virgin, I felt I'd only attract the religious freaks, guys who like to slut shame women, arabs, and other freaks who want the girl to be a virgin for marriage (nop, not that either I am chilfree and don't believe in the traditional model of family).

So because I didn't like what being a virgin meant, I wanted to lose it. Also to see what's all the fuss about. I met a guy and lost it. I met him a few times in the context of events, we exchanged numbers, texted for a couple of weeks and then had a short weekend thing where I lost it. I didn't see him again after that, he doesn't live in my country, and then he decided to spend time with one of his exes so I told him to fuck off in a very unpolite manner so he blocked me anyway. 

Since then, I never had sex again (3 yrs have passed). I thought that I wanted to. I was chatting with a guy and was excited to meet him when restrictions were lifted, he seemed to be on the same page as me, not very sex driven, chilfree, he said he could live without sex and just wanted to focus on his stuff...that is of course until an available woman moved in to where he was staying. Then he started having sex with her and said that he was actually in love with her, but only told me this after she dumped him. While he was seeing her, he kept chatting with me normally and keeping up the plans to meet and never telling me he was involved with someone else. So I told him to fuck off. If that's what I have to endure to have a sexual partner, then hell no. 


Pre pandemic I used to go to events often, I actually made the first move to ask for number and invite guys I liked. So it's not like I am hiding. But the guys who are interested on me I don't find attractive and the ones I like always have something (either they are commited, or just passing by or not interested).

I am not willing to settle for someone I dislike, my sex libido is not that high, I am chilfree and I am used to being alone, so not very concerned anymore.

the rest of my advice I think is applicable regardless of where the root of the obsession lies. 

get a female therapist and invest as much of yourself as you can into self improvement. fall in love with yourself and taking care of yourself. 

invest whatever time you’re not investing in self improvement into nurturing female friendships. just because you’re single doesn’t mean you have to be “alone”. I might be biased because I’m currently living with my best friend as roommates, but I never feel alone even though I’m single. if you’re living on your own, try and have at least once a week zoom or in person meetups with female friends. 

get a pet. seriously. I felt so alone before I was able to have my cat with me and now I never feel truly alone. a pet will love you better than any man ever could. 

get a hobby unrelated to your field that you’re proud of. I highly recommend painting or some kind of art creation. don’t worry about it being “good” just enjoy the act of creation.

I think it’s appropriate to spend some time mourning the loss of what I call, the lie of the fantasy life. Even something as silly as Disney love stories told us a lie from a very young age. And no matter how much we have attempted to resist it throughout our lives, that lie is so pervasive, and used as such a tool to further oppress women and uphold the status quo of misogyny, that it’s extremely difficult to separate our lifescript from it. It is okay to mourn that fact, and take your time in looking forward. 

I saw a comment once that said, Bridgerton offered me more romance than any man has ever come close to offering. And I laughed, and then realized how true this is. I think it’s important to compartmentalize these experiences, and enjoy being swept away in a romance (of a male character written by women), and understand that it’s entertainment, it’s a fantasy, and chasing those stories in the actual one life you get to lead, is not a good use of your emotional energy.",,,1623908328,{},h223l1o,False,t3_o17go9,False,False,t3_o17go9,/r/wgtow/comments/o17go9/even_knowing_everything_that_i_do_im_still_sad/h223l1o/,1624225607.0,11,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

[],,[deleted],,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"You’ve been brainwashed to think that romantic love is necessary for happiness. Romantic love is a social construct and really didn’t even exist in people’s consciousness until the medieval idea of courtship. Even then, most people were married to further their families wealth or bloodline, while the poor women were often given away by their fathers and were left abused, raped, and often dead after their 12th child. 

IMO the notion of “true love” is as big a lie, and perhaps even more insidious, than the lie of religion. Actually, they are likely one and the same. As religion has gone down, the notion of true love and your one and only has been on the rise. How else would they get women to marry men despite all of the risks/health problems/reduced life expectancy/reduced wealth that comes with it? All of those things are statistically proven.

Religion is very hard to give up. People don’t just become atheists. There is a lot of back and forth, wavering, wanting to go back, missing the delusion. I say this as someone who used to be religious. It’s the same thing. It’s really, really hard. But you need to root yourself in reality.

Yes, there may be a man who improves your life, but it isn’t because of true love. It’s because he brings companionship, security, etc and the “negative” is outweighed by the positive. It would be equivalent for someone who knows god isn’t real to join a church for social and philanthropic reasons. 

For me, this will likely never be the case because the trauma I’ve experienced at the hands of men. For many ex-religious people, they cannot go back to church because the delusion is still calling them and they are susceptible to falling back into the belief that has harmed them.",,,1623859423,{},h1zcz38,False,t3_o17go9,False,False,t3_o17go9,/r/wgtow/comments/o17go9/even_knowing_everything_that_i_do_im_still_sad/h1zcz38/,1624161919.0,29,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Its either finding a gem in a pile of poo, redeeming the poo or just catching the strongest and scariest guy out there - in any way it is all connected to the idea of risk and danger.

My family has its share of dysfunction too, and it’s taught me that all love is conditional (as it should be— unconditional can be unhealthy), but romantic love from men is more conditional than most.

But I think the last time I tried dating made me recalibrate and realize that kind of socialization isn’t what I need in my life anymore. So I’m taking social distancing up another level. 

At face value, it’s about receiving validation from men that you’re still attractive and desirable. I’m at the point in my life where I know my appeal and don’t doubt it. So I don’t need them to tell me I’m pretty. Feels shallow to want that. I value more the health of my brain and work to preserving that, cuz I want to be mentally present way into my senior years. What is beauty if the brain is empty. 

Relationships with men are a high risk gamble to me therefore it’s stress that I would expose myself to if I volunteered myself for it. And stress is a common denominator for lots of diseases. I’ve been self-sustainable and self-accountable for so long that it really bothers me both psychologically and physiologically to have someone come into my life and destabilize things. 

I still interact with men but not with the mindset of befriending or flirting with them. I treat them all like distant co-workers or acquaintances. I’ve been applying this mental filter for myself that makes me less sensitive and conscientious, not that I’m rude. I just practice being grey rock which is being as bland, monotone as possible so they give up trying.

I really don’t know what a relationship with a man could enhance in my life. I don’t need that financial support, I have my friends and family for the emotional/mental well being. I used to be open to having children but my priorities are different now and if I seek a man’s company, it’s likely going to be temporary. Maybe when I’m in my 50s, I’ll have a fling for a week.

I think the key thing here is choose to go it on your own when you want. And if you decide you want to have an experience and be with a man, make sure that when you go into it you go in with intention, as well as being firmly resolved that if your needs go unmet, or if that person starts to treat you poorly, end it immediately. And use that as an opportunity to learn more about yourself. 

Yet while at the same time make sure you’re not putting yourself consistently in a potentially toxic situation thinking you just need to keep learning about yourself. When it doesn’t serve you, bail immediately

I think it is natural for human beings to want to belong. Also if you think about it when your closest family dies you'll want someone to call family and that's often a partner. Or used to be, when it worked out well.

About the money thing yes my biggest dream would be to have my own house. That's like what I really want. If I met a man who said ""hey here's a house for you"" I think I could give in. Problem is there's no free lunches, specially not with men and certainly not with rich men. Men are naturally selfish and self centered, rich men are even more and also they are entitled. And obviously have a not of options so I'd always feel like I'd have to fall in line and make him happy otherwise he'd leave... And shit I am not doing that I am not a dog.

Even in sugar type of arrangements they just don't give women a house. Sometimes they get an apartment and pay her rent but its conditional to her dating him. When it ends they don't keep giving. So yeah I highly doubt meeting a man that will add something as valuable to my life as that will ever happen. I am not super hot either, just average looking. 

If that's the case I don't see much advantage to share life with a man unless he was truly a decent person, a good friend, we had matching libidos and sex was not that important.

He completely freaked out and assumed that I was trying to baby trap him into a white picket fence fairy tale. Which made as much sense as being scared of being mauled by a teddy bear. I pointed out to him that my mother is asexual and his parents only married because it saved them money on health insurance and taxes. I told him I just thought it would be nice and he wouldn't have to worry about 90% of what he was scared of with me.

That pretty much marked the descent of our friendship, though, because he wanted to do everything possible to show me how much he didn't want to date me and burned every bridge between us until I lost all my love for him.

All of this to say that his mother wrote me a very long letter covering a lot of things, but among them that love is important but also very difficult, and that I should pursue love that made sense for me.

This is what I've done on a daily basis and noticed improvements in my posture within a week :

1. Upper and lower body stretches (especially those that target the thoracic area and lower back, yoga has a lot of these)

2. Identify specific issues you have and address them. eg if you've posture issues like pelvic tilt (I have Anterior Pelvic Tilt), implement the workouts/stretches into your daily routine that target those areas. You can find a ton of those on youtube.

3. (very impotant) If you're working a desk job or have to sit a lot at work, record yourself working while sitting and make corrections to your posture accordingly (did it with my phone or tablet every time for 30 mins). I heard getting lumbar support cushions/ergonomic chairs help a lot but I personally have not used them. 

4. This was pretty difficult for me to implement while in I was working in the office, but I try to go for walks/breaks/stretch my muscles after 30 mins of sitting down. Sitting down continuously for long hours actually strains specific muscles and thus it gets inflamed/achy/painful easily. 

5. Massages. Couldn't afford getting a massage every day so I read up on trigger points and how to effectively massage them. I do this at least once a day targeting problem areas like my neck, chest and back.

pain is inevitable, suffering is optional

right now you are both suffering and in pain because of not being in acceptance

practice accepting things just as they are, it will feel painful but those feelings will pass and you will feel more at peace. even better to get a good cry out too

radical acceptance is really something that needs to be experienced/felt self explanatory however if it's easier there are worksheets and books etc. if you search the term

your pain will subside as well but to me it sounds more like suffering than pain right now which can definitely be improved. pain is much easier to deal with.

[],,ProserpinaFC,,,[],,,,text,t2_49v9v7n3,False,False,[],"Well, I think a politically prudent place to start would be describing my dating history with men:

I was raised as Baptist Christian and was a Christian educator by my teenaged years. I took the commitment of Chastity until Marriage very seriously, it would be later that I realized that I was asexual and that's why it was never a temptation for me. This was often the first hurdle that any Christian, Muslim, or Jewish man had when dating me. They were always quick to say how much they valued my self-respect and honor, but they always assumed I was just initiating the ""I'm a lady, of course I won't put out on the first date"" dance they expected to dance anyway. When date 3-6 came around, it would hit them like a bus that I was serious.

Some of them had outright existential crises over how to date a virgin. One Muslim man cried and begged me to forgive him for heavy petting me, as if his grandmothers had materialized behind him and screamed at him for touching me. Another guy, a great guy I still think about to this day, couldn't bare dating me because of a 5-year age gap which, plus virginity, made it feel like a 15-year age gap to him!

Another man WAS a pastor and swore he'd never EVER do anything to jeopardize my honor, but also couldn't keep his hands off me. So, I told him we should cool it down and just be friends. That confused him even more. Women ALWAYS wanted commitment! Why wasn't I using his attraction to strong-arm him into a relationship?!

So, dating men has always been --- I dunno, anti-climatic. I've never felt personally rejected by it all... It just seems like men both overthink and act too much on instinct in that first month of dating. They both do little to control themselves but then over-analyze and categorize women to ""sus out the crazy"". (My best friend spent the first six months of our friendship ""sussing out my crazy"" while also shamelessly flirting with me. 🤣 Looking back, he's concluded that vasectomies should be mandatory upon high school graduation. I agree. Men should have absolute control over who they impregnate. The rate of single-motherhood would plummet.)

Once I became atheist and considered dating women, I became fully exposed to the song and dance men usually do... And I don't freaking dance and I don't have the tolerance to sus out other women's crazy. 🤣

1) Immediately, had women trying to trick me into paying for them. I dutch date. I ain't paying for no stranger's meal and no stranger has to pay for me. But in so many ways women would whimper and whine that because I was the more masculine one that I should just take a man's role. No.

2) Men felt overwhelming guilt over trying to seduce me. Women acted like I owed them sex. Was I faking being bi just to say ""I kissed a girl and I like it""?! Asexuality wasn't real if it meant they got rejected. 

3) So many tests of character, fake dramas, manufactured problems, conclusions jumped to, arguments that didn't need to happen if the slightest communication had been used. So much unnecessary bluster in the name of making them feel respected.

4) And just none of the intellectual stimuli that made dating men worth the trouble. No interest in deep conversations, no depth of thought. Just a surface-level rhetoric that was often based off what other people believed: politics without ideology, religion without theology, very little science and a whole lotta ""that's just my personal opinion"". And, pressuring me to agree with their ill-informed opinions.

A) Just throwing this in as well: sexual harassment at work. Male coworkers have inappropriately flirted with me, yes. But women have: slapped my ass, groped me, asked for my full sexual history or lack thereof, forcibly kissed me, and tried to pressure me into dating them and turned other people against me for refusing.

[],,ObamaMakeMyPenisHard,,,[],,,,text,t2_6gmijuzj,False,False,[],"I too dislike the constantly fluctuating hormones as well. I heard somewhere that the “luteal phase” during the menstrual cycle (the last 14 days of the month or so) is when your body purposely “slows down” to make it easier to get pregnant, which in turn can make a person feel tired and drowsy, and honestly I fucking despise that.

I HATE knowing that I’m destined to be inherently less productive, alert, and energetic at certain points in the month solely because my stupid body is designed to infest a parasite I don’t want against my own will. Like what type of design was this? I absolutely despise how my hormones are destined to be messy, the emotions and constantly changing moods associated with these changes, the inherent anxiety and neuroticism that comes from this various hormonal changes, the fact that I’m more likely to get depressed solely due to my body and it’s stupid biological functions that I didn’t even ask for. It honestly makes me super mad at evolution as a whole for deciding on this. I hate feeling like a living incubator. 

Hell, I’ve even read articles about women being more likely to get sick at certain points in the month as the immune system weakens to make it easier for sperm to impregnate, and it just makes me feel so disgusted as my own self. No wonder many women want children despite the fact that they risk losing their lives, identity, and sanity. When you realize that your entire body as basically designed to do one thing and that the way your hormones affect moods/personality all factor into the fact that you can give birth and had to raise children throughout history, it’s no wonder so many women think motherhood is by far the best thing they can do with their lives and themselves, and lack the confidence to believe otherwise. Obviously also because women that want children will be able to handle the realities of their bodies better, as opposed to being miserable about things like periods and hormones, unlike women who don’t want children.

And more importantly, why is it that girls have to go through puberty so early anyway and have to deal with all the frankly traumatic changes and inappropriate behavior from these disgusting men anyway?! A 11 year old shouldn’t have to be worried about things like bras, periods, cramps, etc. Female hormones feel more like downers whereas male hormones feel more like energizers tbh. I always get moody and depressed whenever I’m going through hormonal cycles, but I noticed that boys tend to get happier and more active during puberty. Not to mention the fact that they don’t have to deal with sexualization, maturity being forced onto them, being judged on their fuckability, negative stereotypes, etc.

I get so mad at the nature of evolution and how it’s screwed over women as a whole. I hate feeling like less of a person and less of an individual solely due to the body I was born in. I hate feeling like my own body isn’t my own, but some foreign entity that just makes me feel bad.

I also hate knowing how my body makes me inherently vulnerable and weaker than most men by default. Weaker, meaning easier to rape, harm, harass, etc. Weaker because it’s inherently designed to give birth to babies as it’s only purpose, ignoring my own mental health and sanity and my own desires in life. I hate how the mind just feels so separate from the body sometimes.

This is part of the reason why I’m antinatalist and childfree. Just the thought of possibly bringing another girl into the world who will eventually have to face the traumas of having a female form is something I would never do.

Of course you feel angry and hateful. Your right to choose NOT to be a mother is under attack. It's a very real and imminent possibility. Fear/hate are two sides of the same coin. It's Ok to feel angry and upset and absolutely normal!

As for what to do to try to process this, I went through a period like this too. I'm still angry at the unfairness, because it IS unfair.

But the anger/disgust that made me feel bad did start to go away when I established real, actual things I can do if I do get pregnant. It gave me some peace of mind, I felt more empowered, and also when my friends needed help, I was able to direct them towards what they could actually do.

That helped with the burning, constant anger and helplessness I felt. Maybe it will help with you, too.

By the way, when I say figure out what to do, I don't mean just get a list of phone numbers for contraceptive advice/planned parenthood in other states or list of locations or websites. I mean, calling those phone numbers, perhaps calling those locations. Have a Google doc or an email with everything you need to know. Save up all the $$ you'd need for transport, accomomdation and the procedure.

Decide on a few people you could call if you're in that situation, and talk to them about what they'd do, and see if they'd be able to support you.

As for me, I ended up even calling a place in another country (I'm currently in SEAsia with few abortion rights) and a nice woman guided me through the whole hypothetical scenario, and I feel a ton better (while still knowing that this is NOT ok.)

In the early/mid 2000s, she was happily single and living in the Bay area, but traveling around, doing Quirkyalone seminars, events, etc, re-editing the book with more info to distribute updated versions, updating the Quirkyalone website, etc.  About 5-6 years ago, she moved to South America because she got really into tango dancing.  She liked the way tango teaches you to use your body in confident ways - to move with open arms, open chest, head up, looking people in the eye, so it was not only for dance purposes, but to work on building her confidence and self esteem in physical ways.

While she was in South America, she started keeping a sort of personal/public blog that detailed her tango experience, not just learning to dance, but how it helped her personally, and also continued living Quirkyalone as a personal example and sharing it on her blog.  She also started giving online classes and personal sessions about what she called ""pussy walking,"" I believe.  I don't recall if that's the correct term, but I think it was something like that.

""Pussy walking"" came from her tango experience.  Cagen took the tango walk step and turned it into a walking gait - shoulders up, chest open, head high, and moving forward with your hips, using your hips and center of your body as your place of power, energy and confidence when you're walking.  Walking without projecting any shame.  Like tango, she found this helped her develop physical confidence and she started sharing it with other women so they could develop their own physical confidence.

Late last year, with COVID stuff going on, she finally left South America and returned to the northeastern US, where she grew up.   I don't think she's as actively involved in tango stuff any more and has curtailed her outreach stuff with her blog and the ""pussy walking"" classes and videos for now, but I think you can still find some of them on Youtube.  The move back to the US forced her to restructure her life a little, so she's been working on that.

Regarding no 2. Yes spot on. It's mind boggling how society forgot each of us is always evolving i.e. change

The only thing constant is change.  All forms of relationship evolve because people change due to life circumstances,  be it work, sickness, mental illness,  etc

This is where relationships breakdown because some blindly or refuse to accept their loved ones evolving.
