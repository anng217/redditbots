Anyway, I digress. My mother is obsessed with me finding love and relationships, and having children. I definitely don't want my own kids I know that for sure. I might adopt in my mid 30s though. She's always bringing up me finding a husband, children etc. And it drives me mad! It's partly why I want to move out, so I don't have to hear her yapping about it all the time.

I feel like when most people get in a relationship, get married and have kids, they forget their mortality. One of the reasons I want to go my own way from men and romance in general is because nothing lasts forever. I'm more comfortable accepting the people around me as temporary, because I'm also temporary. 

I often think about the idea of romance as a social construct and wonder if it was a big mistake. It just doesn't seem to work out for most people. Its a kind of ""love"" that causes so much pain in people's lives. We give so much power to another person to stomp on our hearts. And if it ends, either by death or break up, you're left with questions of ""what was it all for?"", that you don't have in other losses (I can't speak for everyone), because you invested so much time and energy in this ""forever"" relationship.

 I'm comfortable with my relationship with my family and friends as well as idea of getting a pet in the future. I acknowledge that people come and go. But when you get in a relationship, especially when you grew up with romantic movies where the cameras cut after they get married, you assume your relationship will be ""forever"". So you make a lot of forever decisions like having kids with that person, as well as investing a lot of time and energy with the assumption that nature will treat you kindly.

I just can't live this way. No matter how attractive the idea of romance is. I feel like the price is too high, as well as the risk. I feel like with friends, since you're not putting all your eggs in one basket, so to speak. It would be nice to have someone to be affectionate with and whatever, but it really puts me off how there are so many variables. I just don't think romantic relationships are a good investment.

But this is coming from a non-religious person. Depending on what meaning you make of life, your perspective will be different.",6759,"I'm put off by the ""forever"" aspect of romance",0,,,,0

regardless, the only person who i felt would understand and care after the fact was my mother, but no. she still makes excuses for the abusers and says that ‘they feel misunderstood/powerless and just need someone to protect their future’ or ‘they did it because they were frustrated’. i gave up on my father a long time ago. i absolutely hate him. he’s spineless and would rather jump the gun to defend the horrible scum. but to just lose a caring mother and be all alone feels like hell.

An rv is going in on the property so that I can have my own space while I get my shit together. The silver lining of this is that I can start working on my dream of making things more of a compound here eventually. Bc of the zoning laws here you can have a house/rv etc per x amount of acres making it possible to have 5 including the main house given the size of the land. My sis may get a double wide if she moves back so she can save money too. That leaves two other potential units in the future. It will take years I'm sure but it would be awesome to either add more double wides, or tiny houses and then rent them to women in similar situations. 

I like this idea better than the commune type womyn's lands because I don't really want to do that whole situation to the extreme that they do although I do want to be self sufficient as much as possible and then I can be in direct control of vetting and such.

I never joined a political party in my country because I have a very hard time being accepted into ""clubs"" and having the club mentality of having to say yes to everything. Also with work and other stuff I sometimes lose touch with my political side.

I am left leaning and there's two major left wing political parties, Communist Party and then a derivative of the Communist Party that worries more about issues like gender issues, drugs, milennial social issues, let's say. Then there's the equivalent of the Green Party and two minor left wing parties that I know of (well there's more but they usually don't have representation in the parliment). And of course the Socialist Party but since it's part of the mainstream parties that alternate between each other in occupying power, it's a bit tainted with corruption scandals and nepotism.  

I also went to a meeting with group that worries about european issues but I was a bit disappointed because they just discussed more local small issues and I felt like I didn't fit in because most of them were from rich families. 

For me the most important issues are labour rights and income inequality, fighting poverty, quality of education, justice and health. Obviously women issues are important to me, but I often align with the Communist Party on this and refuse to indulge in some media fed gender fights because there's more important things in the big picture. Politically speaking there's very little that can be done in terms of gender rights (we already have legal abortion, free access to contraception programs), maybe increase penalties for rape crimes and sexual harassment crimes and give more legal protection to people who commit some sort of crime as a form of self defense. Obviously increase funding of associations that fight for gender equality and train police forces to know how to react to gender related crimes. 

I just feel like sometimes women worry so much about relationship and all the drama associated with it when we could be worrying about the bigger picture. I am guilty of that too, sometimes forgeting about the bigger issues because of my petty personal dramas.",6983,Are you involved in some sort of political organization?

That’s why the me too movement blew up the way it has. Women decided to stop pretending that men aren’t operating as predators by default, and started calling it out. Men hate the fact that more women are waking up and they are being exposed for who they really are. For so long women were pretending that men are something different than what they really are, all because men would act as though their feelings would be hurt by being called out. Their feelings aren’t hurt, they just don’t want to be exposed. 
You can tell them a long story about something horrific that happened to a woman at the hands of a man, and all a man will have to say is that not all men do that. They don’t care what women are going through, they are just mad we’re making it harder for them to gain women’s trust quickly.


They will ask you questions about your life in an attempt to “get to know you”. What they’re actually trying to figure out is what your emotional weaknesses and triggers are, so they can use that to get you to sleep with them. I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve been listening to men who claim to be romantically interested in me speak to me and the whole time I’m just thinking - *this dude is full of shit, he wants to have sex with me and that’s it. This guy is not interested in me at all.* Every question is framed to eventually lead to sex, which is what he really wants to talk about. When you choose to reveal next to no personal information to them until they share more about themselves with you, they get frustrated. The bolder ones will just ask you for sex right away. At least they’re honest and don’t feel the need to play bs games. 

These are feelings I’ve had ever since I first started dating as teen. I knew that boys did not really like me, they just wanted me to let them grope me or something. They knew if they gave me the Princess treatment for long enough the way their dad taught them, it would probably happen. 

I don’t think men like women as human beings, personally. I think men like the way women make them feel physically, and they get a sexual thrill out of the chase. That’s why so many of them will say they can’t be friends with women. They do not see women as someone worthy of communicating with casually, unless there is a reward(sex) at the end of it. Women are for sex and child rearing and that is it. Eventually if you don’t annoy them with your existence for long enough and be passive enough, they will propose to you. The ultimate reward is supposed to be that you get to have their child and be proud that you have a child with this guy. Whole time it’s just a way to get permanent endured servitude out of you. Men don’t even like kids, which is why women end up taking care of the majority of childcare duties. Men can’t stand being around their own kids and pretend to be too busy. 

It’s just weird. 

I think all women know deep down that men don’t really like them, but they cave to society’s expectations because men bully them into believing they are nothing without them. It doesn’t matter how great a woman’s accomplishments are. Men say the only thing that really matters is whether she was worthy enough for a proposal. If that hasn’t happened yet, the woman is still a loser. 
Men have women on a merry go round of neuroticism. Meanwhile they are focusing on hoarding wealth and valuable resources, and dishing small amounts of it out to the women who obey their commands and jump when they say how high. 

I also think men know they’re not good people and that they’re unpleasant to be around, but can’t help it. They know they are biologically flawed and thats why they hoard resources. Women need to some incentive to be around them or else they wouldn’t bother. They get angry at any sign of a woman getting access to a new escape route, and work hard to cut that escape route off.",6980,"Men pretend to care about you when really they’re just trying to find a way to get you to sleep with them.

So I mentionned separatism amongst handmaiden (even though I knew I wan't going to convert them) and one handmaiden said ""Even if I wasn't romantically involved with men, I have a son. I'd rather spend my time raising my son to respect women than spend the rest of my life bitching with miserable banshees"".

The same boymom said she think she can ""mold"" her son. The word is actually quite telling. It made me think of the story of Pygmalion

 *Pygmalion, disgusted by the loose and shameful lives of the women of his era, decides to live alone and unmarried. With wondrous art, he creates a beautiful statue more perfect than any living woman.*  
 *The more he looks upon her, the more deeply he falls in love with her, until he wishes that she were more than a statue.*    


The statue that he molded as his perfect women (in traits and in personality) then becomes real.  
I think that women who are disapointed by the state of men and want to raise their sons into their idea of a man who respects women and as some sort of ideal romantic partner aren't as different as Marquis de Sade rewriting Pygmalion but with his daughter.  
Not that these women are as degenrate as Sade, or more recently, incels who want to groom their daughters into becoming sex slaves. But the instrumantalization of children and the incesty element is there. I definitely think adults project their fantasies onto children. (Which is why I am a firm believer it's okay to disapoint your parents lol.)  
Terri Strange has an excellent video abt mothers of sons where she says mothers have a romantic attachement to their sons, and she cited the exemple of Amy Schumen who was shocked she got along with her mother in law bc she always felt like she was treated as a sexual competition by the mothers of her former boyfriends.  
I understand that patriarchy creates this structure where women feel their role in a man's life (mother, wife or girlfriend) is their entire identity. Which explains why they feel any criticism twrds men is a personal attack.",6933,"Women who think they can ""mold"" their son",0,,,,0

The mainstream life plan for women is get a husband, get a house together, have kids, either after college or in some cases, it's not even advised for women to go to college. In the US I think most people, even women who want to be homemakers, go to college. In my country and other countries I don't think it's that common. I am the first of my family to ever go to college and my family never stimulated me to do so, they thought it was a waste of time and I am sure they'd be happier if I had had kids instead in my 20s. 

I am curious to know what is the life plan of women who decided to go their way and what made you decide that.

For me, I was bullied as a kid by guys due to my looks which caused me depression later in life (still struggling though now it's controlled and no longer suicidal), have an extremely annoying and bad father figure (not abusive, but basically a man child) and had a lot of bad previous experiences with guys. I wasn't sexually assaulted but I just have a low tolerance for dishonesty and I think to be in a relationship you have to accept certain things that I don't want to accept. I am not actively looking for a relationship anymore, if one appears we'll see, but I highly doubt. I'd rather be alone than to settle for crap/abbuse. I was never in a relationship (only two long distance ones, which I'd rather not have been), I lost my virginity in a short fling and since then didn't have any sexual partner, because well, I didn't meet anyone who I am attracted to and who is attracted to me enough for that. I do go to a lot of events and meet a lot of people (not now due to pandemic), I have no trouble meeting guys, so it's not like I am not putting myself out there like they say, but I just never met anyone interesting. 

My life goal is to be able to own a house alone. Ideally it would be a house with garden to have pets, not sure if that will be possible due to housing prices. I am anti-work and anti-corporate so I'd like to make enough so that then later in life I can not work or only work part time to have time to travel or study some social science or even do a PhD in something useful for society.",6913,What made you be WGTOW and what is your life plan?,0,,,,0

There's one instance I have a hard time moving on from and any insight is appreciated.

A few years ago I had a close male friend who ended up becoming a roommate. We were super close and hung out daily, traveled together etc. I'm sure he had a crush on me and I maybe would have been interested except he was pornsick as hell and left his pornhub history on his computer literally every single day (yuck, I know). I've changed so much since then and would never hang out with a pornsick male now but this is just some background for you.

One day when I was changing I caught him taking a picture of me with his phone. I had nothing on but a thong. I turn around and see him with his phone *blatantly* lifted up and pointed right at me, and he immediately and nervously pulls it away when he knows I've seen him. I froze with fear and said nothing which I *majorly* regret. But keep in mind we lived under the same roof, I did not want to lose my place to live. 

I acted bitchy to him after that and eventually moved out without confronting him about what's going on. I've actually ran into him at a few events since then and since it was not an appropriate time to bring up the situation I was cordial but I still wish I had gone off on him.

I hope it’s alright I post here. I am concerned about my mom and I feel I can’t give her enough of the advice she needs as I am 25 and haven’t lived through her experiences as she has. I’m looking for outside ideas and advice. Long story short, she has had a really challenging life. She raised my brother and I alone. She’s had 3 husbands die, 2 in front of her, and she immigrated to the US from Mexico about 20 years ago with me. She doesn’t have a steady career, but does enjoy, and is quite good at being a hairstylist. She’s moved her entire life several times for different people and her overall sentiment is: I’m just tired. She’s been with her new fiancé about 3 years, 2 at a distance and 1 living together. I have lived with them for some months now and can say they have a really hard time communicating well. TLDR; she’s not happy but is at the same time “comfortable” for the first time in a long time- no money troubles, not having to work in a toxic work environment (her previous salon), and living in the nicest home she’s lived in yet. She feels stuck, like she can’t be herself around him, like he’s too controlling, and at the expense of a comfortable lifestyle. She’s really strong but she’s just so tired. I can’t tell her, you got this! Just leave him. Go back to work for low pay and deal with rude people,go back to a Shitty apartment....I am trying to encourage her that should she choose to leave it can be better than before. I’m wondering if anyone knows of WGTOW groups for women over 50 looking for roommates? She’s be living in San Antonio, Texas. She’s currently in the middle of nowhere, because her fiancé lives in the middle of nowhere. Ofc couples conseling and such is being discussed but I know there has to be a good option. The lack of being close to her network in San Antonio also doesn’t help the situation. I am leaving in a couple months to go work in Asia, so that’s also going to make it extremely hard for her. She’s my best friend and once I’m making more money I absolutely intend to help her should she choose to leave. I can help her apply to nicer high end salons where the environment is much nicer to be in. I really want to help her, If she went to church or a hobby group she could meet women her age or a roommate. If anyone has any ideas I would appreciate a comment so so much! I just know there’s resources I don’t know exist or groups.

Yet these are men society loves and worships. There are more examples obviously but this is enough to make my point.

Typically the justification is that they are only human, it doesn't discredit the great things they did etc and I get that. Everybody has flaws. That's not why it's annoying. It's annoying because the pattern here isn't that they made mistakes, it's that they are *shitty to women*. And society just writes it off. Would we write it off as quickly if the pattern had been child abuse or theft? Would we write it off as quickly if one of them had abandoned their pet and left it at the side of the road?

I come from a western country but still a bit conservative and I grew in a rural area so traditions are very much engrained. My grandmother was a homemaker (she did work but then retired early), I was raised being told the importance of being a homemaker, cleaning the house, cooking. My mom still tries to put me down saying I am not good at those things (except for cooking I am frankly better than she is at everything, and even cooking if I stop being lazy I can do much better than she does, but ok). I am the first one from my extended family to ever go to college, honestly the only educated people I met in my life were my teachers at school.

I was bullyed throughtout my childhood due to my looks mostly by guys. I spent my teen years with so much body issues, depression and anxiety. I craved so much male attention yet I thought I was so ugly no man would ever look at me. When I finally started exploring the dating world (only when I was 23-24) I had such a low self esteem. I remember being so worried about getting to know the guy, what he wants sexually, because I wanted to be a cool girl that would treat him so well, not like those bitchy women. I felt unworthy when an handsome guy liked me and felt I needed to try to do the right stuff and try extra hard to please him.

Now I sometimes read some reddits posts from the subreddits I used to go and...something changed. When a guy says I want X, Y, Z I no longer feel inferior for not having all what he asks. I just think he is full of shit and are happy I don't have to put up with that crap lol.

I still have some troubles saying no and feel guilty when I turn down a guy. I can't help but have those annoying thoughts in the back of my head saying I am not that good so I shouldn't be as picky otherwise I'll end up alone and some day I'll regret it... Problem is, this fear is no longer enough to make me want to give my freedom to tolerate bullshit.

Sometimes my body issues come back, but then I am like... ""who cares?"". I just been finding some very cute plus sized models on instagram. Today I found one who filmed a tiktok video with a guy asking her to rate herself in a scale of 1 to 10 and she was like, with no doubt ""I am a 10"" and the guy kept trying to put her down questioning her ""are you sure? to be a 10 you need to be flawless"" and she was like ""yap I am a 10"" with so much confidence. According to her, it pissed a lot of dudes on tiktok. But I just loved it! and also her body shape is similar to mine and when I was younger I would never image I'd see someone with a body similar to mine being a model...

I used to feel inferior due to my lack of sexual and relationship experience, now, since my last failed crush, not even that bothers me that much anymore. I feel like if I meet someone and that's an issue for that person, than that person should go see a shrink and get the fuck out of my life, because I don't have a problem with it so neither should he LOL I am a bit worried if this is repressed emotions or something and will blow out later. Not sure. But I just don't feel a lot of drive to pursue those things as much as before.

I am sure I am still damaged and have a lot of emotional traumas, but I think I was able to grow some self esteem thanks to communities like this one and others that I found along the way. Definetely without the Internet and the digital age I wouldn't have evolved because I wouldn't know there's other people like me out there and that I am valid.",7198,How the fuck did I become a wgtow?,0,,,,1

Do you have any placements that you feel contribute to going your own way? 

I'll start.

I have Saturn in my 7th house (in Capricorn lol) which Saturn in the 7th means a delay in relationships/marriage and you're not supposed to get married after your Saturn return. In my last relationship which was happening through my Saturn return (which was fucking horrible btw lol) I told myself if this doesn't work out that's it I'm done. Now I'm so glad I didn't get married. Some say the delay makes it until your 40s but I say never!! Also have Neptune in my 7th which makes me not see others clearly which I can definitely say has been a pattern of mine and part of the resulting trauma is why I'm just not interested in any of that anymore.

Another placement I feel is related is Venus in the 11th. This is interesting because the cookie cutter description of this is basically that you find more value or love through the 11th house of friends/fans/society etc. I really feel like this is me because I have struggled with friends/boundaries (see previous about Saturn in the 7th!) and Saturn is supposed to teach us those lessons so we learn and are rewarded. My hope is to build a large network of community instead of relying on partnership (the nuclear family truly seems like isolated hell can't believe we're so brainwashed).

Lastly I have Pluto in the 5th. This is a malefic representing death/transformation and the 5th house is literal conception via sex but also creativity. I feel this is wgtow-ish because I have been childfree and I am channeling that energy into the figurative art vs the literal children of the 5th house.

I know we could discuss oppositions and all that other stuff but I'm fairly new to those so feel like I don't have too much to say about them yet.

1. A meme about how women, animals and babies are all loved unconditionally but men are only loved if they can provide something.

2. A comedian talking about how women would not be able to keep their man around if they were no longer able to provide them with sex (or ""pussy"" as the video calls it) say, due to a horrible accident or something.

He immediately came off as *very* friendly and multiple times just came up to me and started saying ""woke"" things about feminism, how women have it hard trying to stay safe from men etc. Somewhat odd but I brushed it off.

However today he made a joke that creeped me out. There was a huge, beautiful bird on the deck and he began insisting on showing me an album of bird photos he took. He said he could put them on a USB stick for me then says ""that is, if you'd trust a stick from me...and I don't mean the kind that wears a condom"" then burst out laughing.

Maybe it's hard for me to stay friends with married couples because the ones I've known have been so toxic. It just doesnt make sense to me.

When I decided to have sex, I knew it was gonna be on my terms. Which meant no PIV, which I not only see as degrading but it gives me dysphoria as well, and no sucking his dick. It was going to be me-centered. And it was. 

We made out for a long time, kissed etc. Every time. I made him give me oral while I was standing as well as lying down. He once asked for a BJ but I refused. He also fingered me till I orgasmed. I reciprocated by giving him a handjob once because I was curious. 


After that, I got on with my life. I stopped obsessing over getting a bf, soul-draining projects that relationships are and men in general. I just stopped caring about that stuff.

I distanced myself because she essentially couldn't stand me being single and would try setting me up against my will with dudes that had situation-ships already going on with other women. She was dating this guy who always made her cry and belittled her... and she ended up recently marrying him. 

Anyways, I was checking out their wedding photos they posted! My friend looked so beautiful and elegant!

And then I looked aside her at her husband. They had a traditional religious wedding and part of the ceremony involves sitting before the minister and then all the people are watching them. She was sitting up, at attention, and looked focused on the Minister. Her hands were folded nicely. Her husband was extremely slouching to the point where his hurt jacket didn't even look like it was on all the way and his eyes were off to outer space dating off... and his one hand was grabbing near his crotch! I was horrified and feel secondhand embarrassed for the bride. The groom looks like one of the slobby class clowns from high school goofing off and not paying attention during class, like the kid that always gets sent to the principles office...

They looked like night and day. In the rest of the photos he was making faces and didn't take it seriously at all while she was trying to be mature and professional. 

I dont believe in marriage and haven't been dating, and when I am out in public I ignore men that start hitting on me. Seeing her husband slouch and zone out and be in his crotch in front of a minister and whole church of people made me feel literally so sick. He was the one that proposed to her. Why is he already acting so miserable and like he doesn't want to be at his own wedding? He asked her. And then to pose like that? 

My friend is like a many others who dream of their wedding and white dress their whole life. He knew that and he doesn't care to even pretend to pay attention at his own wedding. Im glad she is a former friend because I couldn't handle hearing any more of her stories about how awful he was during their time dating. 

The wedding she had though made me loose even more hope for myself. It feels so abysmal. To be honest I distanced myself hard when she got engaged because I just didn't have the heart to be there and pretend to act happy for her when I can see the truth. I do hope he gets better for her but I doubt that will happen. 

Her husband is an extreme example but still most guys never seem to excited for their weddings, they act sort of like its a chore and boring.

Honestly it’s going to sound dumb but I LOVED Frozen!

It was one of the few Disney movies I’ve actually connected with because it’s not about romance primarily

Even as a little girl I only liked the music and songs in Disney cartoons but not the romance/prince/princess stuff

I think Frozen is empowering because it’s about family, friendship, sacrifice, sisterhood idk I really liked it and I had no kids to watch it for heheh

For most of my life I have idealized having a relationship. Guys would be down to have casual sex, or be my friend, but “getting” them into a “relationship” was really difficult. Almost like a feat. You had to get to know him, go on several dates where you played a part, smiling, feminine, and then he deemed you worthy of being his girlfriend. I know this isn’t 100% of cases but it seems to be the mainstream. 

In the few cases I did have a boyfriend, we were obviously alone a lot and he wanted to do sexual things. All the time. And I was his girlfriend, and that’s what the girl offends did unless they were waiting until marriage - and *then* they did the sexual things. 

Sure, there is love and cuddles too. Texting, hand-holding, events, spending time with friends. But what is this structure? Why can’t we have all these things without so much regular sex? 

Men whine about wanting love and connection. Empathy. A partner. But they also want a sex moppet. And I can tell you, during all of my relationships it was mostly him who wanted all the physical intimacy, and I just went along with it because I was supposed to trust him. Because he was my boyfriend, and that’s just *what you do* in a “relationship”.

I am not american, abortion is legal in my country and I think free (never had to use it, luckily). Contraception is also free, they even have condoms sometimes there in the health center for people to take. The most recent attack we had was the leader of a conservative party (a woman) saying women should pay a fee to have an abortion to limit the number of abortions they could have and to prevent people from using abortion as contraception. 

In the US it seems that 1) contraception is not free, sometimes even very expensive which limits access to poorer people and 2) religious groups stalk and harass abortion clinics and now apparently are ceasing the opportunity.

Celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment with stories about the people and events that led to the passage of women’s suffrage in the United States.

Nannie Helen Burroughs, who was a leading educator, feminist and suffragist in the Washington, D.C., area throughout the early 20th century, founded a school for girls and women and was an active member in her community.

Early Life:

Burroughs was born on May 2, 1879, in rural Orange, Virginia. Both of her parents were formerly enslaved, and her father passed away when Burroughs was a young girl. She and her mother subsequently moved to Washington, D.C., where Burroughs spent the majority of her childhood.

She was an exemplary student and graduated with honors from the M Street High School, now the Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. Though she excelled academically, she was denied a teaching job in the Washington, D.C., public school system – however, this setback would not hinder her goal to further the education of those in need.

Training School:

Burroughs then decided to establish her own school to educate and train African American women who could not pursue a traditional educational path. Burroughs brought her proposal to the National Baptist Convention, and the organization decided to support her idea. The group bought six acres of land in the Lincoln Heights area of Northwest Washington, D.C., but this was only the beginning of her journey to open the school. Not wanting to rely on wealthy white donors, Burroughs gained the support of small donations from African American women and children to raise the funds to open the school. Once the fiscal matters were in order, Burroughs was able to open the National Training School for Women and Girls in 1909.

Originally operating out of a small farmhouse on the property, the school was popular and well-attended through the first half of the 20th century. The curriculum at the school was rigorous, including courses both vocational and academic, such as dressmaking, power machine operation, music, and physical education. Students could also participate in activities such as the school newspaper. Most of the students came from working-class backgrounds and hailed both from the Washington, D.C., area and other countries around the world.

Early supporters of the school included Black history scholar Dr. Carter G. Woodson and president of the National Association of Colored Women, Mary McCleod Bethune, who also spoke at the dedication ceremony. Burroughs outlined her goals for the school as training women for jobs both in and outside of the traditional female job sphere, and aiming for each student to become “the fiber of a sturdy moral, industrious and intellectual woman.” In 1928, the school saw an expansion, and a larger building – called Trades Hall – was constructed, with 12 classrooms, three offices, an assembly hall, and a print shop.

Woman’s Convention of the National Baptist Convention:

At the same time as Burroughs lead her school and students, she was also an activist and advocate. Notably, she was involved in supporting greater civil rights and suffrage for African Americans and women. She wrote and spoke extensively on these topics, highlighting the need for African American and white women to work together to achieve the right to vote for all. She also emphasized that suffrage for African American women was key in protecting them in a persistently prejudiced and discriminatory society.

Starting early in her career, she was active in the Woman’s Convention of the National Baptist Convention, many of whose members were fellow suffragists and who discussed suffrage topics at their meetings. In 1900 she delivered a speech at the group’s annual meeting entitled “How Sisters Are Hindered from Helping,” and at the 1905 First Baptist World Alliance meeting in London, gave a speech called “Women’s Part in the World’s Work.” Burroughs also served as the corresponding secretary of the Woman’s Convention for 48 years and helped the organization grow its membership to 1.5 million by 1907.

Baptist Convention:

Legacy:

Throughout her life she also became part of the vibrant community of African American women suffragists, advocating for the cause alongside Coralie Franklin Cook, Anna Julia Cooper, Angelina Weld Grimké, Lucy Diggs Slowe, and Mary Church Terrell. African American women’s clubs were a strong network in Washington, D.C., and Burroughs was also active in these groups, including the National Association of Colored Women, the National Association of Wage Earners, and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History.

Burroughs served as president of her school until her death on May 20, 1961, and three years later, the school changed its name to the Nannie Helen Burroughs School in her honor. Trades Hall now houses the Progressive National Baptist Convention and is a National Historic Landmark.",7220,Nannie Helen Burroughs (WGHOW),0,,,,1

An educator and humanitarian, Clarissa “Clara” Harlowe Barton helped distribute needed supplies to the Union Army during the Civil War and later founded the disaster relief organization, the American Red Cross.

Born on December 25, 1821 in Oxford, Massachusetts, Barton was the youngest of Stephen and Sarah Barton’s five children. Her father was a prosperous farmer. As a teenager, Barton helped care for her seriously ill brother David—her first experience as a nurse.

Barton’s family directed their painfully shy daughter to become a teacher upon the recommendation of renowned phrenologist L.N. Fowler, who examined her as a girl. She began teaching at age 18, founded a school for workers’ children at her brother’s mill when she was 24, and after moving to Bordentown, New Jersey, established the first free school there in 1852. She resigned when she discovered that the school had hired a man at twice her salary, saying she would never work for less than a man.

In 1854 she was hired as a recording clerk at the US Patent Office in Washington, DC, the first woman appointed to such a post. She was paid $1,400 annually, the same as her male colleagues. However, the following year, Secretary of the Interior Robert McClelland, who opposed women working in government, reduced her to copyist with a lower salary. In 1857, the Buchanan Administration eliminated her position entirely, but in 1860, she returned as copyist after the election of President Abraham Lincoln.

When the Civil War began in 1861, Barton quit her job and made it her mission to bring supplies to Union soldiers in need—among them, men of the 6th Massachusetts Infantry. This started a life-long career of aiding people in times of conflict and disaster. In 1862, she received official permission to transport supplies to battlefields and was at every major battle in Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina, where she also tended to the wounded and became known as the “angel of the battlefield.” She was officially named head nurse for one of General Benjamin Butler’s units in 1864, even though she had no formal medical training. She joined Frances Gage in helping to prepare slaves for their lives in freedom. After the war, Barton helped locate missing soldiers, mark thousands of graves, and testified in Congress about her wartime experiences.

In 1869, Barton traveled through Europe to regain her health. While in Switzerland, she learned about the International Red Cross, established in Geneva in 1864. Returning to the US, Barton built support for the creation of an American society of the Red Cross by writing pamphlets, lecturing, and meeting with President Rutherford B. Hayes. On May 21, 1881, the American Association of the Red Cross was formed; Barton was elected president in June. In 1882, the US joined the International Red Cross.

Barton remained with the Red Cross until 1904, attending national and international meetings, aiding with disasters, helping the homeless and poor, and writing about her life and the Red Cross. She was also an ardent supporter of women’s suffrage. In 1904, she established the National First Aid Association of America, an organization that emphasized emergency preparedness and developed first aid kits. Her Glen Echo, Maryland home became a National Historic Site in 1975, the first dedicated to the achievements of a woman.",7220,Clara Barton (1821-1912) (WGHOW),0,,,,1
