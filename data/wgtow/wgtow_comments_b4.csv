[],,PiscesPoet,,,[],,,,text,t2_ao97vxja,False,False,[],"I guess because I’m too used to being a lone Wolf and just doing things on my own that I often forget to stay in touch. I also have this issue with friend groups, I’ll spend most of my time just doing my own thing and then try to get back in the fold and they end up giving me the cold shoulder.

I have so much fun on my own, I don’t like people in my space, I don’t like feeling accountable for someone else because if I become their girlfriend all of a sudden I have to fill this “role” that isn’t who I am. Ex kept saying “you don’t act like my girl. You keep trying to haze me like an older brother ” I’m supposed act like some cheerleader who’s super girlish, emotional and attached to him. It’s just not me, again maybe I just haven’t found the one, but yeah. I used to feel bad about it, but that’s who I am, I’m an adventurous, independent and goofy person.. 

In all fairness though I felt like I was only in a relationship because I’m tired of people making me feel weird and asking “where’s your boyfriend?” Not because I actually wanted to be in a relationship with any of the guys, I’ve yet to meet anyone that I’m like “wow, I want to be in a relationship with you”. I mostly did it to get people off my back, and to have someone in my corner looking out for my interests and defending me. 

People have a tendency to see people who are alone as easy targets especially if you’re a woman. I lived with a woman who’s boyfriend basically attacked me if he even thought I looked at his girl sideways, just causing so much issues — his girl was very passive aggressive (long story) but he was aggressive. (We were ‘friends’ so it was weird) I didn’t feel safe so I rushed it with my ex so I could feel like someone was on my side and just running away from a home where I did not feel safe.

I'm (24F) a full-time math and CS student, Calculus TA, research assistant, and also have a full-time job in network security. I've recently received a substantial pay raise at work. Academically, I'm currently tackling an open problem in mathematics with major breakthroughs. I sold my start up when I was 17 and made a bunch of money. If I wanted to, I'd easily be able to retire before 30. So, you should listen to what I have to say if you want to be extremely financially successful. My advice will likely be, at the very least, monetarily valuable. 

Mostly, I've found social networking in professions like ours to be unavoidable. (i.e LinkedIn profiles are the best way to get recruited and the connections you form will help get you up the ladder). As the saying goes: it's about who you know, not about what you know. Everyone you're competing against also has a degree and a portfolio, but the best jobs in this industry go to the ones with the best connections. Good connections also guarantee job security. I have recruiters who still contact me.

I've built many wonderful professional relationships with men. You can Go Your Own Way without limiting yourself or closing professional doors. I've been invited to everything from talks, lectures, casual coffees, and contracted for private projects. Due to a combination of academic skill and a high degree of personability, numerous Professors have requested me to TA their classes or do research with them every semester. 

That's not to say my time and emotional energy is free. You choose your availability on your own time. Outside of class, students literally venmo me for my advice on personal projects or help on problem sets. One guy was so grateful, he even acknowledged me along with his family in an academic paper. Usually, if I become quiet while trying to figure something out, they'll talk about their personal life as well. I always *seem* readily available because I am often seen around campus doing something with someone. But behind the scenes, I choose the time, duration, and method of contact. If anyone needs me, they email me. I don't give out my phone number. I don't have an Instagram or Snapchat or social media platform. If we venture into a discussion I don't want to have, I shut it down. I set my boundaries.

Once, there was a girl who refused to speak to anybody in one of my classes. I was one of the few people she would talk to. We both had the top grade in the class. The Professor, who was the most senior at the school and very chill, would ask me weekly, like clockwork, if I wanted to do research with him. At first, I said no because I couldn't make time. When he kept asking, I suggested that he ask her instead. He said he wasn't going to because she was too standoffish. He didn't like her demeanor or the way she constantly ignored her classmates. After a month of repetitive requests, I finally decided to work with the Professor which ended up being most fun research experience I've ever had. At the end, he wrote me a glowing recommendation and gave me one of his analysis textbooks from grad school. He's retired, but still likes to keep in contact because he enjoys hearing about major milestones in my life and how I've been doing. 

Another time, two years ago, there was a guy older than me. I helped him a few times in Physics (before I even took the class) while he pursued a degree in AI and Robotics. It was his last class for his degree, he was really struggling to pass, didn't understand the material, there was no TA, and he just couldn't focus. He often vented about his home life. I didn't think he was actually listening to me about the coursework, but he was. Venting helped him focus. A few months ago, he emailed, thanked me for helping him, and told me he was now working with a company that designs affordable, lightweight robotic prosthetics for children.

People ask me what I'll do if a man wants to stay the night. Tell him to leave I said. I don't really have sex, pretty asexual and I don't buy a bed for someone else.

That aside, I'm very excited to get settled in. I bought a house about three years ago but my job changed. So I rented out that house and moved into an apartment. Finally felt stable enough to get something here. I moved three times in 14 months. I am so ready to settle down and stay somewhere for a while!

It has a great kitchen for cooking in despite being small. It's very quiet! Relatively peaceful for being part of a crowded urban area. My other house is silent but very much a food desert. Not walkable to anything. 20 minute drive to the nearest non Walmart non Burger King area. So you make some sacrifices to be walkable to restaurants and stores. I have to remind myself that.

Lots of little things need to be done around the house but I put out feelers for a good handy person. Every so often I think how nice it would be to have a man in my life who is more handy than me. I would be more handy but my dad was a little bit sexist and only taught my brother how to do that kind of thing. I'm learning but I don't want my curtains hung sideways. I want it done right.

A few tips to keep in mind is:
• Use good flour. I bought local artisan flour. I tried to make a starter with bleached &amp; pasteurized store bought flour, and all the yeast was dead so nothing happened.

• it takes about 2-4 weeks of feeding the starter everyday for it to develop flavour. Once you get that going you can put it in the fridge and feed it 1x week.

• Where you live matters. Humidity, temperature, and season will affect your starter’s fermentation. I ended up having to feed my starter 2x a day because of how cold &amp; dry my climate was.

For example if you sleep at 8am, then the first day stay up until 11am, then the next day stay up until 2pm, etc. until you fall asleep at a normal time again. If you can't stay awake for 3 more hours you can also try just 1 hour.

Wow. This sounds like all of my best girlfriends right now (besides the gay ones, who are actually all partnered). They keep being treated like shit by men and I'm kinda like.... always able to see it coming... but I feel really bad for them. I never would tell them ""I told you so"" but in some cases I'll say some version of ""YOU told me so"" when their gut had warned them to steer clear but they allowed it to progress anyway. One of my friends never gets past two dates with any guy and is like legit miserable and pessimistic. She makes good money and is beautiful. I want her to be happy single; it's a great life!

I think you're probably right to not bring up the conversation with most people because they'll patronize you. Or they'll be hostile toward you.

People are so into identity these days that they might overrun you with questions or advice or try to change you. Really it's your life and your choice.  

\[Disclaimer, I don't date men anymore and am currently single and happy but am still interested in finding a female partner someday.

I relate to that. Especially the *monetizing hobbies* part is something I struggled with. It's **totally** capitalistic, if you're not making money off of something, it means you're wasting your time. And our value depends so much on our networth and how productive we are.

Easiest- The wax ring could be bad- fixable but you probably will have damage under the toilet. I’ll go more in to this later.

Most involved- I vent or trap could be blocked somewhere else causing a vacuum in the sewer line which is sucking the water out of the bowl.

But at the risk of sounding like a conspiracy theorist, I think a lot of that image of “successful” is really made just to line corporate pockets and make you feel inferior.

Once you know WHAT you want, you need to figure out how to get there.

Do you want to live in another city? Start by looking at jobs there, and housing.

Change careers? Look at programs near where you live (or want to live.)

Don't put your own plans on hold because you want a relationship and family. People waste their entire lives waiting for relationships and children. If you do have children, they'll benefit from having a mother that knows you what she wants and how to get there.

I have a couple hacks that have helped when I need to hire someone:

Start with word of mouth, I have several other independent women friends that could help or teach. If that fails, they may have hired someone before and can recommend him. This is how I found my roofer and termite guys. I make a point of telling them who referred them and why I am hiring them vs the other guys so hopefully this strengthens our clout over time 

I have inexpensive Wyze pan cams in every room and a ring security system. The pan cams are key because the sound and movement are noticeable. If you point them out you sound defensive or like you might be worried about something valuable. If they are just quietly tracking movement I think it helps keep people in their toes. I mention them in a nonchalant way so I don’t get sued though. No proof that this does anything, but guys who might slack off are less likely to on camera

I always educate myself about what I’m hiring for and decide ahead of time what I want and what I can compromise on. If anyone tried to get me to change my mind on something they are done- I’ve paid for a half a day and kicked someone out. 

Always be ready to go to court and or get a restraining order if you have to. Never threaten. If someone shows up uninvited don’t fuck around- call the sheriff immediately or 911 if you feel threatened. Then follow up. This has only happened once but I’m glad I didn’t doubt myself.

Maybe in some situations but most probably didn't actually want to have kids and definitely not the number of kids they did want to have.

It syncs with our menstrual cycles or it used to. We'd ovulate with the full moon. It was a way for us to control our fertility. They took that away.

I also heard a story not sure if it's true that originally the wedding ring was made because women would literally be tied up, like elephants are today. Eventually with enough conditioning the elephant can be tied to a balloon or a chair or something lightweight that they could easily run away from but they don't because they are conditioned by the fact that it's tied to believe it can't go anywhere. After women were tied up for so long eventually they just tied a string to their finger as a reminder to stay and that's where wedding rings came from.

Many aren’t ambitious either, and think being SAHM is easier (it’s a 24/7 job with no vacation so I don’t know how it is). 

They don’t have a strong identity so they assume the identity of motherhood easily because it gives them purpose even if it’s draining them. 

Its easier to just follow the traditional path then to think critically. However, I’m seeing things changing. This generation is having less s3x, domestic violence has gone up since lockdown and women are divorcing. I’m seeing more women confident in their decision to just be single and live life.

The women in my family are not muscular by any means, but my dad and brother are borderline beasts, so I think that contributes to my tendency to being able to put muscle mass on relatively easily; it might be genetic.

Also, I was, sometime last year, briefly on a medication for mental health reasons that messed with my metabolism and increased my prolactin levels, so I gained a bit of weight, like maybe 15 pounds, I think. My boobs had increased a whole cup size; he told me he preferred my boobs more now (at the moment) than before, and was weirdly evading my followup that surely he wasn't as happy with my natural size before, if he was going to say something like that about my _boobs_ after being on an *antipsychotic* that I had talked to him about numerous times that I was worried that it was unhealthy for me because of the weight gain and breast growth, not even something that fluctuates more and that you have exponentially more control over such as body weight in general.

When they start attempting to initiate beyond professional reasons, I'll blatantly ignore them.  Pretend I didn't hear their droning. Act like I thought they were talking to someone else. Walk away mid droning. Say I have something important to do and walk off, regardless of what they say.  If you're not in a position to do this for whatever reason, being disinterested and saying ""Uh huh"" works until you're able to walk off.  Grey rocking works well in these situations.

Refuse to engage in any questions that require personal information that is beyond the mundane.  Ex. ""Any plans this weekend?"" you answer, ""Nope"" and provide no further details. ""Have you watched any good movies lately?"" Nope. ""Are you interested in X hobby?"" Nope.  Anything you can answer no (or some variant of) to, do so.  It sounds like a broken record, but the more boring and casually disengaged you are, the more they'll eventually get bored themselves. Don't give them anything to work with. Usually these questions they ask are designed to get information and try setting up a date or get together so they can have you alone and if you say no, not interested, not my cup of tea to everything, there isn't much for them to prompt with.

For the ""studying"" guy, for example, I'd say no, I do better when I'm able to actually focus by myself and study better alone and am not interested in group study time.  Cut it off right there, leaving no room for questioning.

The guy that likes to drop his personal baggage on you, I'd redirect to someone else he actually knows. ""Huh, I'm sure your parents would love to discuss that with you"", ""Yeah, I'm sure your wife/girlfriend would enjoy you mentioning that"", etc... Not a ""Have you to talked with X about this?"", because that shows interest to them and opens the door to them saying ""X just doesn't care!"".  Instead let them know there is a more appropriate person they could be discussing this with and it isn't you.  If they say they've talked to X person, go ""Huh, anyways..."" and change the topic to something mundane, acting like you just suddenly thought of said topic.

I personally disagree with IVF for a few reasons: 

* The world is overpopulated.
* There are unwanted children out there who need a loving home.
* IVF produces a bunch of extra zygotes that are either kept frozen or thrown away.  (This doesn't bother me, but if you're pro-life you shouldn't go this route.)
* Sperm donation centers don't do enough research on the donors.  There are issues of men donating to multiple agencies the maximum amount of times, leading to critical lack of genetic diversity in certain populations.  Also they might lie about family history of certain diseases.

And yeah, I may have lost track of the back and forth that took place between us, replying the next day and all, but ultimately what took place here was I initially responded to someone who said all of her own *relationships* served as evidence that *men are awful.*

The community rules say that’s not the purpose of this subreddit. I replied with an example that, to me, proves it’s wrong to speak in absolutes about these things. And it’s important to me, as a feminist, to also specifically avoid spouting off misandry.

I thought that would be a shared value here. I thought it all would be seen as appropriate to be rational to not commit the same mistakes that so many men make in how so many of them treat us as women (as second-class citizens or lesser people). If the main complaint is that it’s terrible that men can be so sexist, I’d assume people would want to avoid being a hypocrite about hating on the basis of sex...

But it was kind of lame how unwelcoming a couple people were, upset about what I thought was reasonable and acceptable commentary. Because the purpose here is obviously actually *not* to be rational and anti-sexist and avoid hypocritical hate.

I am the poster there and am banned but would like to enlighten you:
1. Sexuality is very personal for a lot of people. So your idea of it being backward Western ideas is very flawed. If you are anti work because of its exploitative nature, then anti porn/prostitution people too can be for the same reason.

2. I hadn’t mentioned those points initially because I overestimated the capacity of cognition of a lot of commenters there. I was interested in understanding the hypocrisy of consumers of porn/prostitution when it comes to consent and ethics. Any consent given under duress or force is not consent. Exchange of money in itself implies lack of true consent. I had hoped too much for ANs to understand this simple point. Thus, I edited my post to become that long to accommodate such expositions which I assumed ANs, of all people, would understand.

3. As for Amsterdam. You do know that the system can’t be repeated everywhere. No one size fits all. And even it is rife with uncountable loopholes and injustices. Try researching before setting it as an example of a haven for victims of this industry. And thus the need to not further oppress women or give them minimal compensation for their exploitation, but to urge men to not involve themselves in situations where exploitation and violence is a given. Not creating demand would automatically stop supply. If you wish to help such women, provide money or money-generating avenues other than selling bodies - which isn’t just limited to the physical structure but affect psychology, health, well-being and unforgivable acts of creation of children who also become a part of the same rut. I don’t think men who use such victims ever think if they fathered multiple children over the course of their existence and what happened to those children. So the abuse is not as simplistic as equating to capitalist exploitation in jobs. It is a vicious circle unfathomable to so many men because they don’t carry a womb.

4. And while I am not the victim I am someone who has worked for the betterment and rehabilitation and empowerment of such desperate souls. So I know what I am talking of. What you are talking is actually the tiniest corner of this industry where people are thought of as cattle (and being a vegan, that in itself is unethical, but we aren’t discussing animal rights). So yes, this is a person from the said industry. And it is still not about my viewpoint but the victims. Most don’t want to be there. They weren’t adults when they were trafficked or sold or bought or deceived for many many number of reasons when they trusted people in authority- which included both men and women, but we both know who are the majority - which if I were a man would still own. Yes, men are the greatest consumers, distributors, producers and enablers of this crime against millions of women and children majorly and men (lesser by a huge margin). We don’t see the demand of multiple women pissing on a lone male. Or one male being gangraped on film, nor going by the rape statistics in real life. I am human enough to acknowledge that. If I were a male, I still would, with much much shame on part of my fellow men. 

The answer is not in giving women paltry compensations but lies with men - because they hold the power over most of such existences. Women don’t habitually and statistically more visit brothels and rape women. Women don’t 
rape children, male and female, in schools and orphanages and places of worship and child prostitution rings. Women aren’t the mafia kings. Women who exist there are mostly those who spent an entire life in it, nipped in the bud as young kids. Groomed and pornified, sexualised, prostituted. Majorly. 

In life there are always exceptions. We work for the greater moral good - not who benefits most or the few who benefit or are okay with an exploitative system. If that were the case, slavery would still be legal (it is a different form of slavery in the modern world, but I hope you get it), Africans would still be where they are, much of the developing world is not the rosy picture of porn prostitution of cam work and sex toys etc. You have cherry-picked prostitution where it is not as horrendous but there are aspects of it that will chill you to the bone if it were your child/wife/sister/mother/partner or male relation or friend. 

So please don’t mix this unfortunate pleading with men to not put most women, children and some men in a situation which is not a matter of life and death for them as consumers of a few moments of satisfaction, release and the stench that arises from such power play",,,1615866009,{},gr35cty,True,t3_m5k12y,False,True,t3_m5k12y,/r/wgtow/comments/m5k12y/how_ethical_men_fail/gr35cty/,1615869331,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,

Yet it’s supposed to be the worst thing and I need to attach myself to someone immediately or else I’m miserable. I realized that men are the ones who need to be attached to women, that’s why if their wife gets sick/dies they remarry quickly or cheat on her. I noticed this when dating, so many of the single guys had just broken up with their gf and were on the rebound. Even if a guy says he’s “single” he’s still messing with women. Maybe that’s why so many women feel drained from dating them, because they’re trying to drain healthy vibrant women. If she’s not healthy, they move on to the next to care for them. 

I’ve had guy friends I haven’t seen in ages meet up with me imo just to tell me all their emotional problems then go “I can’t tell this to my guy friends” meanwhile their guy friends are right there while they’re saying this so basically women are “emotional dumpsters” to men. I feel sorry for some of them because they’ll have all these guy friends but still complain they’re lonely if their woman leaves them. Their relationships with each other shallow that’s why I think they don’t really know how to emotionally support a woman, they’re just glad to have that emotional support but they don’t know how to reciprocate it back (women learn how to in our relationships). Instead they’re thrown in the wild and women are basically expected to “raise grown men”, and the fact that so many women are saying the same thing ACROSS the world tells me it’s not just in our heads. They have no coping skills and can’t care for themselves without women. They benefit the most from relationships but it’s women they pressure to get into them not men. It’s a trap lol, that’s why they have to sell us all these fairytales to make our servitude look “glamorous”

Violence
 
Why the hatred, men?
All this blood flowing,
from kitchen sinks, bathtubs,
hollow of her eyes,
from strangled words onto your hands
as this wet floor dries.
Can you feel it shrieking,
out of lungs long collapsed?
Breathing?
Flinching?
Sinking?
And pleading, pleading, pleading .....
The blood in her eyes, sighs, skies.
---
Not only these silent home walls
but in the deafening dark of your unknown lanes,
shrapnel pierce the existence, the names,
sometimes as acid,
sometimes as rain,
incessant, un-giving, monstrous,
and vain.
But you don't stop.
You don't stop.
You cut open wounds barely closed.
Her gut tumbles out, helpless,
exposed.
Safe? But where?
At home? School? Or Work?
From behind screens, in the Deep End,
darker things lurk ...
For flesh to be seen, smelled, and grabbed,
ground, kinked, forked, and gagged,
infinite hands baiting, baiting ...
Tongues and eyes, waiting, waiting.
Do you hear the fingernails scratching,
scratching the door?
The butchering minds of family, friend, foe ...
There is no place, no place she can go.
Accused.
How she walks wrong,
speaks wrong, wears wrong,
hell, every time she breathes,
she breathes wrong!
Strange, she birthed the world yet
she ain't strong?
Good for nothing raises men, but fails lifelong!
So stuff. Pump. Just ram and ram!
Do her in. Slam. Slam.
Trivial?
Not yet.
Then try your slurs once more!
One, two, three and four ....
You think feminized, but not on will?
Wait, wait, let the insult graph build ...
How civilized! Now that's a thrill!
C'mon now, don't be so shrill!
Boys being boys! Innocent drill!
 
On and on, justified,
after all 'fun' is prime!
Groomed. Degraded. Mortified.
Little girls. Two to five.
Sexualized.
Objectified.
Nine and ten. Pornified.
From shoulders, armpits, waist,
to nipples, legs, and thighs.
What age? Consent? You silly thing!
Shush, shush! Let the 'little man' sing ...
Long last sure comes the 'prize' …
she learns fast she has to hide:
From streets at night, 'coz you can see.
Her talents' might, 'coz you can see.
Hopes it mars, 'coz you can see.
Emotions, scars, 'coz you can see.
Need and want, 'coz you can see.
Her shadow gaunt, 'coz you can see.
Blood on sheets, 'coz you can see.
And fear that eats, 'coz you can see.
But 'can' you see?

UNTOUCHED. Shamed. Touched. Blamed.
Unmarried. Shamed. Broken. Blamed.
Childfree. Shamed. Childless. Blamed.
Homemaker. Shamed. Ambitious. Blamed.
Quiet. Shamed. Vocal. Blamed.
Homely. Shamed. Appealing. Blamed.
Abandoned. Shamed. Divorced. Blamed.
Re-married. Shamed. Widowed. Blamed.
Dead … the woman reclaimed!
---
That strings are reined by powerful males
yet she is shamed ...
That men are milked and killed by other men, but she is blamed ...
Women, children, everywhere, yet she more shamed ...
Devoured. Trafficked. Prostituted. Sold.
Blamed and blamed …
Raped. Battered. Burnt. Left in cold.
Damned and shamed ...
The list ain't slim. The list ain't slim.
Priests and uncles, rich and high,
from poor Joe to the family guy ...
Virgin spring dumped into gloom.
Heart is tired. Night is doomed.
Little girls yet to bloom, yet to bloom.
To beg for justice, one's basic right!
At homes, in courts, no end in sight ...
Why the hatred, men?
Why? But why?
You parade us as mothers, sisters, daughters, wives,
yet criminally increase our daily plight.
Feminazis for dignity, opportunity, safety to thrive ...
How proudly you Protectors eclipse the light!
Scared of the granter, the flourish of life,
you throttle her in the womb before it's time.
You rape her, degrade her, fists clenched tight.
And if something remains,
you stab her, delete her, in your gory delight.
Shame.
The toxic, sadistic thorn of masculinity.
The brutal farce, the ugly mark of virility.
---
HURT.
Hurt.
Hurt.
By silence, when words were needed.
By hate, when love was needed.
By inaction, when support was needed.
By neglect, when care was needed.
By insecurity, when pride was needed.
By control, when nurture was needed.
By fraud, when faith was needed.
By distance, when talk was needed.
By indifference, when concern was needed.
By absence, when presence was needed.
By hands, when heart was needed.
By impotency, when strength was needed.
By rods, when rights were needed ...
By the bestial, when humane was needed.
 
THE END.
---
In the name of wars, or honor, or game,
the sickness of desire, of patriarchy and fame,
from lips that you cracked,
trust that you smacked,
jaw that you broke,
in sheer disgust of vaginas you tore,
red blood gushing,
red blood crushing inhumanity of yore.
No more, no more ...
Slit, tortured throats. Un-slit, tortured throats.
Red, oh red! Pity, you can't see what holds.
Radicalized, it rises, it floats.
From each dead drop it quotes and quotes ...

Machiavelli wrote that when a Prince takes power, if he needs to kill someone, said Prince should better organize the full bloodshed at once, and then be peaceful and kind.

You can be annoyed a 100 times because you want to be polite, and people will keep pushing on you. Be burning hell furious once, and they will remember.  


In short: write what you want to say to your mother until you have clear ideas yourself. Memorize it. Next time she tries to pressure you, you stop her, firmly but politely. If she tries again, you go ballistic, get furious and, in a firm voice but without screaming, explain in the bitchiest way possible why you are NOT going to do what she wants of you, and why if she wants a marriage, partner or kids, she is going to have to do all that herself.

Do not, do NOT, by ANY means, in no way, shape or form, touch the stock market without having read that book, all 600-700 pages, and having UNDERSTOOD it. I am going to give you the shortest possible summary: ""a share has a *value* and a *price*. The value is what it's really worth due to the company's worth. The price is what it sells for. Buy shares when the price is lower than their value. Sell when the value is higher than the price"". The rest of the book is learning to do this.

Do NOT, by any means, no way, never, ride on other people's brains or accept advice from someone else. Do not use ""copy"" systems in traders. And DO NOT, EVER, BY ANY REASON, FOLLOW ANY FASHION, TREND OR HYPE that you see in TV and mass media. N-E-V-E-R.

And the most important rules (though they appear in the book):

1. **Do not** invest money you might need (NEVER invest all of your savings).
2. Be ready for the EMOTIONAL part of investing. Your shares WILL go down, and you must not be scared and sell. They will also go up, you might sell at a great profit... and then find out they are worth even more. If you are not able to deal with this emotional rollercoaster, then do not get into it. The main reason why you should not put all your savings on investments is because if you actually need that money, the fear when the shares go down will kill you. Or, for example, I bought Tesla at 150-200 and within the range, and sold at 400. It went up to 850 (and more, because of a 5:1 split) after that. But I have to think my decision was sound: I still think the company was overpriced at 400, and I paid my mortgage with the profits. I did the right thing. You will NEVER be the person who buys lowest or sells highest, so learn to deal with that. If you cannot deal with that, do not touch the stock market with a ten foot pole.
3. As Warren Buffet said: ""If you wouldn't have them ten years, don't have them ten minutes"". Which can be summarized better in...
4. **Do not speculate. Invest.** Learn the difference. If you do not know what the difference is, stay away from the stock market, buy real state instead.",,,1617761482,{},gtn61vc,False,t3_mk25un,False,True,t1_gtdurax,/r/wgtow/comments/mk25un/what_are_your_practical_life_rules_for_women/gtn61vc/,1617763903,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,

I *really* love men, but I’ve never been able to get past the fear of telling my lady crushes I’m interested in them intimately. Even when I’ve been explicitly clear I’m queer, I’m very rarely approached by other queer women, too. So, the majority of my relationships have been with men, though I would say I skew slightly more towards gay internally. Even more so romantically as I’m getting older. 

I have so much more confidence in the dance between men/women because the cues are more straightforward (no pun intended). I’ve been very fortunate to be very well loved and treated by men, so it’s not been tragic by any means, but my heart has always felt half-bloomed.  I’m currently partnered with a man, and he knows this about me, he’s been very understanding. But I don’t think I would settle down again with a man long term, if it wasn’t him.

[],,throwaway17498509859,,,[],,,,text,t2_6prz8h6,False,False,[],"I don't think there are principles, but here's the advice that I'd give:

1) Start working *hard* as early as possible.  Choose a financially stable profession and do what's necessary to make bank.  Women are often uneducated when it comes to financial matters and retirement.  Since they are at a financial disadvantage from birth to death, they need a large retirement fund independent *for themselves*.  Too many women end up poor after their husbands divorce them or die.  

2) Being a career-driven woman is always preferable to being mommy.  Motherhood is too often a one-way ticket until poverty and chronic illness for a woman in her middle and later years.  If you want to be a mother, educate yourself *fully* about postpartum depression and injuries before doing so.  Also have the financial means to support the child *without* any assistance, including a college fund.  Do **not** assume that your kid will ""take care of you"" when you're older; they may not be able do so.  Too many people (male or female) think ""everything will work out"" and then have to face a brutal reality once the kid arrives.  Even worse, if a woman gets divorced, she ends up with primary custody and has *far* less money, even assuming that the father regularly pays child support. 

3) Ignore those who insist that dating and/or relationships are a marker of ""adulthood."" It's usually the opposite; women in particular end up sacrificing their careers and personalities to make the marriage or relationship ""work.""  I've seen few exceptions to this, even within ""successful marriages.""  When children enter the picture, women become financially and emotionally dependent upon their spouses.  Single women tend to make roughly the same amount as men, even in male-dominated fields.  

4) Always put yourself ***first***.  Society and family members like to use the **selfish** label to independent women for not doing what *they're doing.*  But the truth is that once you hit your late-thirties and forties, you'll start thinking more about your fifties and sixties because you'll experience more aches, pains, illnesses, and financial set backs.  It's life.  No one will come to your aid, especially those who're calling you **selfish**.  They honestly don't care about your problems; they care that you're doing better than they are.  In order to survive this period of your life, you'll need to have a good job, valuable education, and common sense.  Too many people piss away their twenties and early thirties following the LifeScript, only to pay in their forties when they get divorced, sick, laid off, etc.

But he was also a single dad. And remarried my aunt, who became a mother to his (now ‘their’) daughter. 

He has a demanding, physically exhausting job with long hours as a small business owner. Yet he used to help his wife grade her (middle school) students’ quizzes. He’d drive her *across town* to take her to work on the day that he used to do drive all day, and then go bring her dinner at work while helping her with grading, and drive her home with him. 

He’d do grocery shopping, make dinners. When they got a new car, it was for her. He had never disparaged her. He takes care of her and listens to her and lets her put her foot down. 

They have a partnership.

Men generally seem to be interested in one-sided relationships that are about cook, clean, fuck.  In all of the romantic relationships that I've been in with men, none of them could handle my intelligence, need for a fair amount of space, drive in my career, and chronic illness.  The latter is especially true; none of them could give support other than ""Go to the doctor"" and ""Why are you still sick?""  But fuck us if we have the same response for them! 

Women are constantly told that they ""have it all"" once they ""balance"" career with ""family.""  But the truth is that they can't possibly ""have it all;"" they just get shouldered with the emotional and financial burdens of the family.  Once they get pregnant, their careers are generally (but not always) over, so they have to rely on their husbands not to fuck other women and remain the breadwinners.  Meanwhile, their own emotional and/or physical health often gets sidelined (or outright dismissed), hence why they age at a quicker rate than single women do.  I mean, shit, look at all of the postpartum injuries, cardiovascular, and cancer diagnoses! 

So despite all of this, why do women crave relationships?  Because they're taught from childhood that too much independence makes her a ""career woman,"" cold, bitchy, lesbian, blah, blah, blah.  They think they'll be the *exception* instead of a number.

I'm mainly talking about western women. A third world shit hole is different. Why a western woman would make it her goal to get married and especially get married and start a family the traditional way, and have her life be male-centered is beyond me. Brainwashing only excuses so much, this isn't the same as some MK Ultra brainwashing where we act like Manchurian candidates whenever we hear trigger words. I feel like most women in these spaces had something that they would consider the ""straw that broke the camel's back"", as far as them snapping to. Many women have had those experiences, but it either doesn't register or they refuse to let it do so.

In my anecdotal experience, I was very, very willful as a child- not a trouble maker, but did not like being told what to do and did not like that I was told, either directly or indirectly, that people grow up and get married and have families. I didn't like the idea of a husband and especially kids. Barring the fact that I was a very big tomboy, the concept of princesses disgusted me, because they seemed so pathetic and I got almost second-hand embarrassment from them. I remember watching some movie on ABC Family when I was ten, it was about some country girl that got pregnant as a teen, sounds bad but it was supposed to be some weird heartfelt movie and she may have given her kid up for adoption. Anyway, she gives birth in a fucking Walmart and I freaked out and started crying to my mom that I didn't want that to happen to me.

You'd think a physically powerful woman that was willing to take charge would be preferred because they wouldn't be as much of a liability and would be hugely beneficial. I guess the liability is waived for the control, and is preferred to actual teamwork?

This is literally what the law is, and in it it says that if your partner gets a bit tipsy and you sleep together, you're a rapist. If You're tipsy too, they're a rapist too. 


&gt;The legislative definition of “mentally incapacitated,” as set forth in Minn.
Stat. § 609.341, subd. 7 (2020), does not include a person who is voluntarily intoxicated by alcohol. 

*The state charged Khalil with two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and two counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct. Two of the charges against Khalil-count 1 (first degree) and count 3 (third degree)-involve sexual activity with a person when ""the actor knows or has reason to know that the complainant is mentally impaired, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless.""

It does not appear that anything was changed, though I'll admit it has very poor optics. These sorts of laws are very complicated and require a very careful vetting and application process. While I agree that it appears this guy appears to be a rapist, the law is very poorly written as a whole. There is an excellent chance that according to it, you and I and most everyone we know collectively are rapists. It also suggests that Khalil need only say that he was also drunk, and was therefore also a victim of rape. The young lady blacking out is not a relevant detail to her ability to commit a crime. 

These cases tried in the public domain often fall victim to emotional bias, and this is a commonly proven thing; people are more likely to believe whom they empathize with, regardless of facts. For all I know the man also blacked out and the woman slept with him without his knowledge, this is exactly what the trial is for.

Romance is a fairy tale intended to con women into a relationship where she sacrifices all for kids and husband, all to her detriment. It would be nice if men really were romantic and doted on their wives, but 99% of the time, she ends up being a mommy and bang maid for ungrateful kids and husband.

In the same year, the king ([Louis XV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XV)) commissioned her to teach midwifery to peasant women in an attempt to reduce infant mortality. This had become a political concern because a perceived high rural perinatal mortality, following from the deaths in the [Seven Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War), was depleting France of future citizens.\[5\]

Between 1760 and 1783, she traveled all over rural France, sharing her extensive knowledge with poor women. During this period, she is estimated to have taught in over forty French cities and rural towns and to have trained 4,000 students directly.\[7\] She was also responsible for the training of 6,000 other women, who were taught directly by her former students.\[4\] In addition, she taught about 500 surgeons and physicians, all of them men.\[8\] In her thirty years of teaching she taught over 30,000 students. \[9\] Through this educational effort Du Coudray became a national sensation and international symbol of French medical advancement.\[2\]",,,1617066070,{},gsr2kfi,False,t3_mf04hx,False,True,t3_mf04hx,/r/wgtow/comments/mf04hx/sunday_spotlight_day/gsr2kfi/,1617068830,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,

I did when I could get a legal one. They are wonderful. They have a 5 meter range, with a nearly two meters radium. I tried it with my arm extended from a window, and the itch was unbearable.  


In the worst case scenario (it being illegal) if someone tried to rape you, you could spray it *on yourself*... And I'd like to see anyone trying to rape you after that.  


If they are legal, get one. If they are illegal and you can buy a good one, get one.  


Important: TRY it at least once. In a very isolated place, in the open air. You must make sure they work. In my country, they changed the good ones for ones that do nothing. Obviously, using the one that does nothing on an attacker would get the attacker mad at you. So you must try them.  


But if you can get a good one, I really, really recommend them. I wish I could get one again myself. If you are under 40 and remotely attractive, get one if you can, even if you have to get it illegally. At 40, your chances of being raped are the same as a 15 year old boy's, so you don't need it that much...

They are literally telling you point blank how they see you, and so many STILL chase after dick. Why anyone would want that cancer in their life is beyond me. It's almost as if the women that either support the channel or contact him with advice are masochistic. You're looking for either public humiliation from being told you're second class in front of hundreds of thousands of people, with no room edge wise to really speak your piece because you're constantly interrupted and made to feel stupid for even daring to have the audacity to not want to be with a man, or you're worshipped by thirsty guys if you're the women in the comment section that blow this guy's ego up by men that want you _because you're submissive and you've made it apparent as such._

Beautiful women have called in to him for dating advice and the conclusion is that they are _too independent and assertive._

_TOO INDEPENDENT._

Which is a complete contradiction to all the advice out there _from men_ that says they want women that shoulder the financial work equally. So, which is it? What's true?

The only thing I know to be true now is that this world is fucked up.

If you don't work and have a man support you, you're a useless gold digger. If you work and have your own place, financially independent, have a fulfilling separate life from him, stick to your convictions, you're too independent and you need to drop the attitude of having a will of your own that doesn't center around pandering to men and obsessively looking for one to pair up with. So now you have to balance it by having some income so he doesn't have to genuinely invest anything into you, but still revolve your life around him, mind your p's and q's, and be willing to do your stereotypical ""woman's work"", which is STILL shat upon by men even though they want us to revert back to that.

That behavior is flat out abusive but so many of us keep going back to it.

Men like independent and assertive women until it cramps their style and they can't actually control her like they'd like to. They even fetishized that. They like sassy women if it is followed up with a blow job an hour later. It turns them on, but they have this bizarre need to have the last word as far as their ""dominance"" is concerned. I have used air quotes so many times because these are _their_ words, not mine, and not my inference.

Look at that woman's body language while he's going off. She literally has her head down. You know he's eating that up, body language is the biggest thing that we pick up on.

They resent us either way, the only thing I've figured out to be most successful for at least my goals in life is to notnllay the rigged game altogether.

The jig is about to be up and they know it, so it's like they're flipping the script and being as brazen as they can about how much they hate (especially 'modern') women hoping that they'll snag the ones with gutter level self esteem and self worth. Because you cannot tell me that you value yourself as a fully autonomous human if you dig this guy's content as a woman. If the sexes were reversed, men would be calling men that followed a woman who had contention this on her channel ""simps"", though I normally don't put a lot of stock into that word, as people often call men that do that if they show genuine, or as genuine as possible, respect for us.",,,1613931483,{},go8zfok,True,t3_lozare,False,True,t1_go8v53k,/r/wgtow/comments/lozare/yt_channel_kevin_samuels_thoughts_on_video_about/go8zfok/,1613931621,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,

While I don't use this sub specifically anymore, someone brought up some guy named ""Kevin Samuels"", and talked about how he is rather brutal and ruthless to the women that call in and ask for relationship advice.

Basically what this video consists of is a woman saying that we don't need men, and Samuels coming back with a retort of if men disappeared, women would die within three or so weeks.

Five minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food.

What is insulting to me is that no consideration is taken into if half the population, without discrimination to men or women, disappeared overnight, that the rest of the world realistically not be able to pick up the slack from the industries or facets of life they were typically involved in within less than one month, without numerous casualties simply from people in the west as a whole not having the survival skills to even last a week in an environment where you'd have to actually forage for your own food when the grocery shelves are stripped. That's not my only disagreement with the video, but it is the one that stuck out the most in the beginning.

""We don't need you to survive, we need you to reproduce; you need us to survive""

Yeah, that right there sealed the deal for me.

Look, I'd quite literally rather die than have my hand forced to be with someone that sees me as second class. I am not being hyperbolic. That is the antithesis of who I am as a person. I rectify this by being skilled in many different areas and being as self sufficient as a human in modern civilization can be, barring being off the grid, which is a pressing goal within the next five years.

Coupled with Trust Your Perceptions blog, it has me looking for the nearest exit in regards to even the thought of being with a man again.

I am unsure of what I am bothered by more, the video and the amount of attention the channel gets, the men in the comment section that clearly are thinking these thoughts as they walk around among us, or the women that are in full agreement.

I typically am happy to be a woman and don't give much thought at all to men and am grateful to not be one, but it is shit like this that makes me resentful to even be a part of this world.

The video is like twenty minutes long, but it pretty much is twenty minutes of him saying the same thing, telling us that without men we will die within a month.

The only thing that I agree with him about, and he only has it half right, is that if a situation like that, that people would not know what to do. That is true of anyone. Take civilization away, and most people WILL die, the same people that couldn't figure out how to wipe their asses without toilet paper in March last year when COVID came ramming through the doors.

You can even order meal kits and groceries online that get delivered in the regular mail rather than from like a delivery boy. 

If you do leave the house, first of all look and dress however you want - ive been sick and gross looking with messy hair, pj's, and no makeup and still would get hit on, so just dress however you want - the thing is dont make eye contact with people as much as possible. Like when you're shopping and theres other shoppers focus your gaze on the products around you and just keep walking. Sometimes guys try to compliment me and stop and try to talk to me, but I literally laugh like hurr hurr and keep walking. I was in the grocery shop for less than 10 minutes today and THREE men approached me. They don't know what to do when you keep walking, just act like you on a mission and you can pretend to not hear them as well. 

Another thing is if you do have a question when out and about, ask an employee rather than a random shopper. You can find a woman that works there and ask her. I would also get approached a lot by men coming up to me and thinking I worked at the stores when I was wearing a sundress that of course didn't look anything like the employee uniforms. Its their way of playing dumb and trying to have a convo. I just look at them dead serious with a REALLY?! Look of disgusting and not amused on my face and I keep a serious tone, I kind of keep my voice a little deeper rather than having the fake nice higher pitch customer service/polite tone and say in all serious ""I don't work here, I don't know."" And walk away. Some will follow you and ask more and just ignore them. One was real creepy and I saw an employee and was like ""I told you I don't work here,  theres an employee you need to ask him."" Be ""bitchy"" be firm be ""rude"" so to speak don't smile, don't apologize. 

Another tip that can help deter them is headphones, you can wear them even if they aren't playing music, but wear the big obvious ones people can see. It won't stop some guys, but in my experience it helps deter them.

Im gonna say this- your dad is the parent and should be the one taking care of you and your siblings or making some type of arrangement (like hiring someone to help or maybe having another relative come help out) so his kids can be taken care of and the house can be running. 

It is NOT your responsibility to become like a wife/mother/maid/caretaker i do not care what the culture says or anything. The thing is women get burdened down by this especially during their formative years and they should be really working on getting their own life and future secured like by getting that first job, building a resume, saving up money, getting your education, etc. When you get burdened down by having to fill the role of a wife/mother like this, it really makes everything harder to accomplish. 

My advice is do what you can to get a job, pickup extra shifts if possible, and save up what you can. If school is something you're thinking about, do what you can to get in and live at college not at home. While you are at home, I would suggest talking to your siblings and divide up the responsibilities among all of you, to share the burden more. Maybe your younger sister can be the one cooking and folding laundry while you do the dishes and the wash or something like that - rather than having you do everything.

You'd think the next logical step was to stop fucking them - I remember when Alyssa Milano suggested a sex strike and women on twitter responded saying that was white feminism (which is a lie) and said that just because men oppress women that doesn't mean women should have to stop fucking them. I've seen women raise a stink about teen boys killing teen girls in school because of rejection, men chiming in to say if you stop fucking us we'd change quick and women responding with, ""We shouldn't have to stop fucking men for them to be decent human beings"" and one said, ""then men would just rape more."" Women are so controlled they risk their lives and their families lives for dick. I've even heard of tribes women who killed another tribe of women because the men from their tribe fancied another.

I've felt this. Everything else you wrote doesn't apply to me, but I used to feel powerless in that I wanted women's approval when I was a young man. I didn't know this was going on in my mind, but it came out in the form of being the ""nice guy"".

I suspect it's because they feel powerless with other men most of the time and they need to feel powerful over a woman. They need to degrade women to feel like they have power. If anyone has another theory, I'd like to hear it.

It's several things. It starts with upbringing. For some men it's resentment for not feeling accepted by a female figure as a boy; some experience abandonment, others are raised by emotionally unavailable mothers. Others, it's being raised around negative male role models or keeping bad friends as company. Then, there's parental abuse/neglect. These experiences lead to an underdeveloped emotional brain (Limbic System) because they weren't taught to deal with negative emotions (such as the feeling of rejection) other than by screaming and fighting. They project what they felt as a child onto the women around them.

Then there's the ancient instinct of conquest built into complex thinking species, especially males, e.g. apes, lions, etc. People who have a strong instinct for this will exploit anything they view as a weakness (lack of strength, emotions, vulnerability, niceness).",,,1619354450,{},gvt9jx1,False,t3_mxgrer,False,False,t1_gvqkxip,/r/wgtow/comments/mxgrer/women_who_think_they_can_mold_their_son/gvt9jx1/,1619356977,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,

I would highly highly recommend you spend your twenties invested in education, developing your skills, schooling (STEM if you can), reading and gaining knowledge, and cultivating relationships with strong older women and those your age if you can find them.

With regards to your mom, that's ok! There is probably a generational gap, but as long as there is love you don't need to agree on everything! Always cherish your mom as you seem to 🥰

Now the other thing is that you should rethink what it means to 'be alone'. Just because you may not be married or have kids (btw you can still have or adopt kids down the line without a guy), doesn't mean you're alone. As a single 30 year old, the most cherished relationships for me are those with my fellow female friends who are like my sisters. Society has really done a number in convincing us that if you're not in a hetero nuclear family, you're ""alone"". It's bs that simply reinforces the patriarchy.

Now , I'd also recommend reading, so you can become more confident in your choice. The obvious recommendations are authors like Simon de Bouvier, Dworkin, to help you solidify your beliefs. 

But in terms of coping, I'd highly recommend looking into Stoicism. It's a worldview that emphasizes being virtuous, relying on oneself, and not allowing outside influences to affect you. If you can start getting into Stoicism at 18 I promise you will be ahead of the curve. 

Finally and most importantly, learn to enjoy your own company. Go on adventures with yourself, in nature, in the city, whatever. Learn to think of yourself as being WITH yourself and opposed to BY yourself. Become the type of person you are proud of.

You seem intelligent and thoughtful and I'm sure you will do great. Keep in mind that as you get into your twenties you may feel isolated because that's when young women typically do start to get into more serious relationships etc but don't let that away you.

But I do believe that it is a very real possibility that I chose to spend my life alone atm. For me it is very empowering for the following reasons

1) I know I would not end up in a relationship just for the appearance and social value. Every women in my life who is in a bad relationship didn't want to end up alone. Now, going through emotional abuse, they wish their partner would leave them alone.

2) I have learned to enjoy my own company and learning more and more about myself every day. The amount of fun that a woman can have by herself is one of the best kept secrets lol. I mean I do not support incel like mentality. I have friends from all genders that I adore and enjoy spending time with. But at the end of the day I know there is one person who truly has my back and that's myself. 

3) Finally, knowing that fear of ending up alone wouldn't make me beg for men or suffer through things that I shouldn't have to suffer through, it is a peaceful thought. 

For me WGTOW is not necessarily cutting off all men from my life right away, but realizing how my life would continue to be sweet af if I don't chose the traditional marriage and kids route.

So first of all, no guy would touch my money. I don't share my money with anyone, I would never have a shared account. If I lived with the person for a while (say like 1 or 2 years) I could come to the idea of opening a shared account and charging it with a fixed amount of money monthly for the expenses, but I would NEVER give him access to my personal account. And I know how I am, at the slightest suspicious activity, we'd have a serious problem. I am very territorial about my money lol. 

Second of all, I don't date potheads I don't smoke weed or drink that much, so defintely he would not smoke inside the same house where I lived. Or drink too much for that matter. I don't want drunk guys inside my house much less to share a bed with a drunk dude. I can only imagine for me this would not end well... I'd either hurt him, or he'd hurt me depending on who was stronger. I am a Virgo I don't like messes inside my house and my moon is in Scorpio, so dude, be careful when I have access to knives. lol

Third, I am childfree and that includes not having to provide for a dude. If he doesn't make at least the same or more than me, you can forget it. I live in a country with extremely low salaries (even though I am from STEM but even so they are low) so for a guy to make less than me his job would have to be picking strawberries or oranges on a field anyway. 
If he doesn't have a job like me, you can forget it (that would solve the long hours, I mean if he had a job he wouldn't complain about the long hours because he'd have long hours too). I am also not too fascinated about guys with no college degrees.  

Damn if I have to accept a guy who doesn't work, doesn't have a stable job or career, smokes weed, drinks beer then definetely this is not ever going to happen to me... EVER lol. 

All the guys I ever liked were not like that, they were older, had money/house/car didn't use drugs (probably did when younger but not anymore) and it still didn't work lol. 

My family always said I was stingy so maybe this is my natural blessing. 

Despite that you managed to graduate in a field that seems quite interesting and you have a fascinating career goal...so yeah you are successful already.

I would physically cringe when thinking of how I dealt with men in the past, but be kind to yourself. What you went through is a betrayal, and it must have been so difficult to process in the moment. The way you reacted is completely normal, especially when worried about your living situation. 

It helps me to think of those moments as lessons for how I want to act when moving forward, so you change resentment to determination. You had never been in that position before, and now you’ve learned how dangerous it is to be close with people who consume porn. That’s incredible progress!

My advice if you’re comfortable: wear a ring or make up a boyfriend. I know it’s annoying that you have to resort to this, but in my experience as someone that worked in STEM, men only put extra effort into chit chat and small talk if they want to have sex with you.

When I had to do partner projects, I only ever picked other women as partners. Is this feasible, are you allowed to pick your own partners?

Alternatively, honestly I don’t think the opinions of the men in your university cs department will matter after college, or during college. They’re not your friends, their opinions aren’t going to reach your friends, and they’re not in the industry so it’s not like they can blacklist you. Perhaps just cutting off personal questions in a tough but still somewhat polite way would get them to stop, even though they tend to have 0 personal skills. 

So, if they start making small talk you could be like “I have a ton of other work to do, so I’d like to work efficiently on this and focus on the task at hand. I’m not interested in sharing my personal life, it makes me uncomfortable.” &lt;— this clearly tells them in no uncertain terms to back off. If they continue, you could tell them that if they don’t stop prying into your personal life, you consider it harassment. If they continue then report it to the dean.*****

You would need to have friends that don’t overlap with the guys of the cs department, a university that takes harassment complaints seriously, and the security of not caring what they think even if they do think you’re a b*tch. I know at my university I was very lucky to have a supportive dean who would have stood by anyone reporting harassment, but not everyone has that. You know your situation best, so you’ll know if the above is a risk you can take. But if the WORST CASE scenario is “the guys of the cs dept won’t like me” and that’s the extent of it, there is NO reason to play nice, that’s barely a bad outcome because if they won’t like you maybe they’ll harass you less.

Anyways sorry for the wall of text, I just feel for you because although I had very little regard for what the guys of my cs dept thought of me, I know other people prefer to avoid confrontation and to protect their reputation, even from unfair attacks.

Another thing that could possibly work is just pretending you don’t have anything going on (re: personal life, hobbies, etc). Like “how was your weekend?” “Good” “what did you do?” “Not much” I think this is called gray-rocking? Could that work?

I noticed you mentioned they ask about your dating history, if you are in a job (not uni) this is totally unprofessional and you should write notes about exactly what was said by who at what time in case you ever need to file a harassment issue.

Throughout most of human history, we were all some type of farmer (or hunter/scavenger). We derive pleasure from simple things such as the scent of coffee or tending to plants because they progress us forward despite no obvious longtime reward; they are meant to encourage our survival. 

These mechanisms have been manipulated against us to make us more complacent in the current system, productive; it was intentionally engineered to be a an addicting cycle, like social media. 

We have such large, longterm goals, we have been deprived of simple pleasures in the here and now. Although they are technically still in front of us, the mental patterns we have all developed make that excruciatingly difficult. Dopamine is responsible for motivation, but if it is overused via too much sensory input (invasive phones, computers, advertisements), in becomes weakened, as does our drive. It takes a long time to deprogram, and one must be aware. 

Unlike the comments offering surrogate activities (hobbies) after work, you might actually want to abandon society altogether. A slower life as a farmer or tradesperson in a small community of close and likeminded people who look out for each other can bring so much peace.

Biologically speaking, you have one combined role reproduction and validation, men have one combined role too, resource production and security.   


Capitalism is the market name for ""survival of the fittest""; that's it. Capitalism and nature are very much in agreement with each other, and capitalism and ""survival of the fittest"" have proven to be the most effective methods of governance outside of beneficial dictatorships, which are unicorns.   


  **What are those of us who don't prioritize family/kids OR a career supposed to do?**   


You're not going to like this answer, I wouldn't even be surprised if it got me banned from this sub, but lack of honest and logical discourse is most of the problems today. **You're supposed to die**. You don't reproduce, and your genes and these decisions die off with you, because the species needs reproducers, not ""sit around and do nothing'ers""  


Men are in their own version of this dilemma, and they didn't choose to be here.   
""what should I do if no one will allow me to produce for them and they don't want my security"". In the past, a man might go and take a mate, but that option has been legislated away, so they find themselves in a dilemma they didn't agree to.  


The answer for men is different, because violence is always the final solution. Men are expected to fight and take what they want to secure reproduction, or die, for the same reasons I gave for yourself.

- take up space in public - don't make yourself small
- don't feel the need to be polite if you are not comfortable somewhere - leave 
- don't be afraid of seeming rude if you are standing up for yourself
- don't give in to someone asking you something multiple times (are you sure, are you sure) - stand firm on your no, and call them out on it if you want
- do not ever put yourself down or self- deprecate
- do work on yourself, realize your flaws and work on improving them 
- do not take a partner with the hopes that they will 'complete' you. Build yourself up to who you want to be, and then find a partner that will complement you and make you a better person (growth), and someone who you do the same for
- be with someone that will challenge you to be a better person
[- find someone with traits that you may lack? But do not let them control you....]
- if someone is doing sometimes they you aren't down for, speak up. Don't stay silent for fear of it being awkward. Be firm, be confident
- do not try and change someone, they will be who they are. Build yourself up, find the ones that are compatible, not necessarily meaning the exact same as you, but have the same core values and morals 
- you do not owe anyone anything. You don't need to do anything just to be nice, and if you change your mind about something, that's fine
- listen to your gut, don't feel the need to be polite and stay somewhere where you don't feel comfortable
- walk with confidence and don't smile if you don't want to
- do not be afraid to say 'no'. Just no and nothing else, you don't need to explain yourself
- do not put yourself in a position where people can take advantage of you (eg being inebriated)
- do not allow someone to talk you out of saying no (eg by asking you the same thing, are you sure, come on just one, etc) - people will take this as you being able to be coerced even if you don't want something. Be the person that is blunt if you need to be, but be firm

ON YOUR INNER SELF
- make sure you are able to count on yourself, first and foremost
- be kind to yourself, and be honest to yourself about your shortcomings 
- thinking or yourself as your first best friend, the one you can rely on over anyone elae
- spend time with yourself - go on walks and to restaurants and make memories with yourself
- have adventures with yourself - find a hobby that you can do with yourself (photography, biking, martial arts) 

General life
- look at things in perspective and always try to look at both sides of something
- judge people's actions on their intentions, but do not sell yourself short or make excuses for their bad behaviour (example?)
- have empathy, especially towards those who do not have as much as you, but do not be empathetic to the point of it eating into yourself. You can only help others once you are solid. You cannot pour from an empty cup
- be kind but do not be a pushover or put up with bs
- don't look for validation or worth in outside sources
- do not ever let anyone do anything physically in anger, even if they claim it was out of anger (this points to deeper issues indicating they have anger issues, you don't want to be with someone who is prone to instability). Do not think or let them claim it is 'out of passion'
- beware of people that apologize/saying they understand but do not change their behaviour after you've communicated something to them 
- it's ok to lose yourself sometimes, as long as you find yourself again. Know what is wrong and what is right, learn what your moral are, and stick to them

On Appearance/ clothing
- do not allow yourself to be objectified - dressed up like a doll with pretty clothes/hair/makeup and lack agency (the ability to act on your own and make your own choices)
- do not allow yourself to fall to external pressures such as the beauty, diet and fashion industries (this perpetuates objectification)
- do not be submissive, be assertive
- Your appearance should not be your substance - it should simply be an extension of who you are 
- dress modestly, but do not oppress yourself - we live within a system that puts us at a disadvantage because of our biology in many realms, and we must explicitly understand that
- putting emphasis on appearance and being passive takes away capacity for action and thought (because you are distracted by things that do not matter). This in turn gives you less power, because you have less knowledge
- women's clothes constrain their movement and comfort, and they are encouraged to spend large amounts of time and money on their superficial self
- Do not wear clothes that advertise you as a sexual object for consumption
- ""what is wrong with your face. Why do you think that you have to create a false image of yourself to be attractive but men don't? That's what I want women to think about. Why are men's faces and bodies good enough, buy you're not?"" 

On boys
- you need to be mindful of the situations you get yourself into, relative to men
- never send compromising pictures of yourself to boys
- do not exist in relation to someone else (fulfill their needs or dreams and neglect your own)
- do not date boys who are much older than you, because they often want to date someone younger because they want power/dominance over you. Date the same age (more or less), or younger 
- think about the consequences of your actions because you are the one they will have to bear it 
- never allow double standards in a relationship
- do not let someone control you 
- do not let your partner try and control your finances 
- don't let things be one sided - eg don't always be the one making plans, deciding what to do, doing the emotional and mental labor in the relationship
- if you decide to be with someone, after awhile ask them why they like you - if they can't name things that make you you (your personality, passions, goals, values) and simply say they like you because of how kind/nice you are or how much you love them, you need to ask yourself if they really love and respect you as an individual or simply because you are someone that is there for THEM
- make sure you find a partner that you can share your genuine thoughts and self with without having to hold back or feel embarrassed or uncomfortable
- a person you decide to be with should first and foremost be your FRIEND. if you take out the romantic/sexual aspect, there should be something of substance there
- do not allow men to use reverse psychology. Eg they ask for something and you say no, then they make it about them (you don't like me, you don't want me, etc) to make you feel compelled to then soothe them and give in
- do not fake stupidity or put yourself down to make someone (especially a guy) look smarter/better than you.

[],,Ruby_5lipper,,,[],,,,text,t2_4u2z9avp,False,False,[],"Keep in mind that the two options you cited - being a mother and/or excelling in your career - are societal expectations.  They're not reality and don't have to be yours.  Your life and what you make of it are based on one thing only - your choices and what has meaning for you.

As \_level\_up\_ wrote, having a purpose can be important, and it sounds like THAT's what you're looking for: a purpose, a meaning to your life and existence.  But that purpose DOESN'T have to be any kind of societal expectation like motherhood or going to the top of your career, or even having a career.

What you need to do is figure out what's important to you, what gives meaning to your life.  Based on what you have written here, it sounds like you've already figured some of that out - namely, not having a career that you're devoted to.  A career is not just a job, but a lifepath, an occupation you do that you want to excel in, learn more about, develop more skills, and get to the top level if you choose.  For example, someone who starts out as a nursing assistant, but gets further education and experience to become a licensed nurse, then a registered nurse, and then may eventually decide to become a nurse administrator, or go to med school to become a doctor.  That's a career.

A job, on the other hand, is not a career.  A job is an occupation, meaning something you do to occupy your time and have no interest in learning more about the job, developing new skills or certifications to move up the job food chain.  A job is generally something you do to pay the bills, to survive.  Some people go from job to job, willing to do different kinds of work for short periods of time to make money, move on, and do other things that are important to them.  Other people have 1 or 2 jobs throughout their lives that they do on a daily basis, put in their 8 hours to get a paycheck, and then use the rest of their time on other things that are important to them.

So that's what you need to figure out for yourself.  Do you like the idea of doing different jobs for a few months, maybe a year, and then moving on to another job, whatever you can do to make money, and then spend the rest of your time on other things that give meaning to your life?  Or do you like the idea of finding 1 job that fulfills your financial needs, and spending the rest of your time on other things?

Secondly, the other thing you need to figure out is what gives meaning to your life?  Do you like to volunteer?  To you like to help people build things? Feed people?  Care for animals? Rescue animals?  Training people on how to care for animals?  Do you like to garden? Do you like to help people grow things, build a community garden?  Do you like to create art?  Volunteer with city beautification, paint a local mural?  Or create other kinds of art that you donate to community centers, craft fairs, etc, just to make people happy?  Or for community centers to sell so they can make more money to help their clients.

Those are just some examples and you may not have interest in any of them.  The only way you'll learn what interests you, if you don't have an idea already, is by trying things out and seeing what brings meaning to you.  Another way to do that is by visiting a community counseling or career center yourself and seeing if you can get some career counseling.  Not necessarily to find a career, if that's not what you want, but in maybe finding the kind of job that might be the best fit for you, and also figuring out what your other interests are to bring meaning to your life.

It can be tough to figure out those things without guidance, which is why I suggest seeking it out, because it can only help you get a clearer picture of who you are and what you want for yourself.  Career counselors can offer all kinds of assessment tools and questionnaires to help you figure out your interests.  Their focus is NOT just on career, but on job skills and personal interests, which are things you need to figure out.  You can discuss with a career counselor exactly what you've shared here - that you're not interested in a career where you learn new skills, advance, get certifications, etc, and move up the career food chain, but are interested in simply finding a job that's a good fit for you, where you can make the kind of money you want, and then focus the rest of your time on your interests.

You might even want to consider temping for a while, which can offer you the ability to try different jobs in a temporary setting, and you might find something that seems relatively tolerable to you, that you think you could do for a while to make money while you figure out what else you want to do with your time.

Many community centers offer sliding scale fees for counseling services, meaning you pay what you can afford.  You can pay as little as $5 to $10 per hour at some centers, so it won't cost you a lot of money to find some guidance to help you learn more about yourself, your interests, what gives meaning to your life and how you want to spend your time.  Don't do it all on your own when there are people available to help you, people who are trained to help you find the best answers to those questions for yourself.",,,1617575843,{},gte5v31,False,t3_mk0jcc,False,True,t3_mk0jcc,/r/wgtow/comments/mk0jcc/what_are_those_of_us_who_dont_prioritize/gte5v31/,1617575854,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,

I feel like she was a very romantic person, but she didn't like what reality had to offer in terms of love and romance. She also made a comment about how the success of your marriage depends on chance. I feel like I can relate to her. I'm more comfortable treating romance as a fantasy. As reality its not appealing.

I feel like she was a very independent person and a free spirit. Especially for her time. She spoke her mind and was very witty. I admire that.

Whenever I made the right decisions, opportunities arose out of nowhere, doors were promptly opened. I even met kinder people.

This eventually made me stop fearing failure. That job, that friendship, that exam did not work out for a good reason and I will understand in due time. Instead I now pay attention to what works and put all my efforts in that direction.

Specifically this means: struggle love is the wrong love. A job/major that drives you to despair is the wrong job/major.

This isn't saying the right path can't be difficult or a struggle, but life always made sure I was rewarded regularly for staying on that path.",,,1617570314,{},gtdvgvm,False,t3_mk25un,False,True,t3_mk25un,/r/wgtow/comments/mk25un/what_are_your_practical_life_rules_for_women/gtdvgvm/,1617570325,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,

My mother and I have had a fractured relationship so I won't go there, and my father and I are okay but he's had his moments of giving me everlasting trauma too.
I resented the loser behind men telling me what to do and the verbal and mental abuse I got from them. Also being teased and catcalled from the age of 12 to 20 something from other losers in my community. On one hand I was the ""ugliest"" girl in the hood/in school but I was still having grown butt men and boys making sexual comments and abusive actions against me. And seeing these same a-holes knock up classmates and trap them in crap relationships.

Coming of age in the 90s where female empowerment seemed to be on the agenda in pop culture and so called modern society, But seeing Anita Hill, Lorena Bobbitt and Monika Lewinsky go through the gauntlet of patriarchal bulls-it as is. 

Speaking of pop culture, I was/am a rock music fan and geek and have always participated in the related scenes and subcultures whether they wanted a weird ass black girl in the room or not. However to prevent writing a thesis on the problematic crap in various alt.cultures let's just say that dating and relationship issues in those worlds left me with a bag of chips on my shoulder.

My love life would be a kin to a series of disaster/monster movies, my heart would be yet another city lying in dust with all the financial abuse, infidelity and emotional manipulation wrecking me over and over again. Even after I declared myself a spinster following the breakup with my exfiance, I continued to find more men who sought to use and consume me like a disposable novelty. I finally banned myself from online dating before the advent of Tinder and all those apps, but I have plenty of OK CUPID and Craigslist disasters I could share before I wised up. 

Also I have always been a loner, comfortable in my own company, even though I dont eschew the many friends and chosen family I have. Unfortunately I have been subject to too many male former friends who have wasted my time and gave me problems even as platonic friends, thankfully they have been cut off from my life and brought the drama level down completely.

As a black woman, the perpetuating toxic misogynoir-istic rhetoric in the black culture as well as most definitely outside of it is repulsive and I want no parts of it. I deserve respect and love and will not stand being told and shown disrespectful hatred for daring to exist. Screw all that. I am quite better off by my darn self anyways.

As such I am now in my close to mid 40s, very single (solo polyamorous in the technical sense) and loving my two cats - (childfree AF), my various hobbies and my career (state govt job with bennies and a pension at the end of the rainbow). There is so much more in this life for me besides finding a ""good man"" and getting married with children. I am worth more than that mess.

I tried dating for a while a few years ago before gmow and most men are mediocre as human beings. They're rude, unintelligent, have no impulse control and their sense of humor is abysmal. They can't engage women without mansplaining or putting women in their place (especially if you're a outspoken feminist, then they see you as a threat). Men are afraid of us, which I find egregious because if you look at the statistics of murder and rape, WE should be the ones fearing them. Another problem is that they feel entitled to sex, the ""nice guys"" especially. I don't even feel like escalating with men or talking to them, because I don't want to put myself in a position where I can't leave or can't say no without fearing for my safety. Especially someone who's twoce my size and physically stronger and can use it to their advantage during intercourse (ie rape). So I'd rather not engage with them at all.

I told them to leave me alone, then I ignored them, but nothing worked.

I look at my mother and other women’s relationships with men and it’s a lot of effort and work and babying them and taking care of men and doing everything and I just don’t see the point of it 

Another aspect is I truly put absolutely everything I have and more into a relationship I really commit and do my best to be the best partner but when you look at the cost benefit analysis it’s very skewed because no matter how beautiful you are, how perfect, how understanding or amazing, men can still cheat and can still leave you and I just get so deeply depressed and devastated when relationships end because I feel like a failure and so this sensitive nature I have and proneness to depression coupled with the fact that humans are unpredictable makes me think it’s better to be single and put all that work and love towards myself and achieve my goals 

Women give soooo much in relationships and in general that it’s exhausting just thinking about it

But I apparently came into an angry rant by the aide supervisor, who wasn't -my- supervisor. And she immediately got on me for leaving messes to be cleaned up. Her quote was ""I'm tired of cleaning after your shit"" and used my bagels and cream cheese as an example of my mess. 

Then she stated all my dishes in my fridge and made her way there - out of which 2 items were mine and old. That's it. 

Yes, I leave some chips on the break room a couple times, but I've been better. And when I said that and told her that her expectations of cleanliness were a little much, she scoffed and told me to shut up. 

I started to tear up in frustration. Because I felt like I was being bullied and attacked and finally stated: ""Look you're angry and you're directing that anger at me. I get that I may not be up to your standards - but I'm trying. And as for all this? Telling me to shut up? Very innappropriate."" And my lip is wibbling and I'm crying. 

I leave as she realizes what she's done and she tries to quickly backtrack - stating that she's emotional and she's sorry it came out tthat way. But I'm crying and walk over to someone who is waiting for me help and I reply: ""Look I'm really emotional right now. Please don't interact with me."" 

Afterwards, my eyes keep leaking. And after I'm sick of my eyes leaking, I go up to her, ask her to talk privately. 

""Look, I get why you're mad. You helped make the office beautiful and you see my mess as a way of me shitting on it. But the way you expressed yourself was not the way to go about it. I get that you're mad - but that was really upsetting. Sorry - I get teary during confrontation.""

And she apologized. Stated that she had an issue with responding that way. Said she wouldn't do it again and threw some compliments there to try to smooth it out.

This is a site that led a witchhunt against the CEO until she was given the boot because she wanted to address reddit's  CP/revenge porn problem. 

I've honestly found that for my own mental health,I just stop going to subreddits with sexist biases. For some things which tend to have a heavily male bias in real life, I usually try go somewhere else for that content since only 4chan has a worse userbase. Like there's a lot of women on tiktok who have comp sci degrees, built their own custom PC, enjoy programming, etc. and they're able to engage in their hobby in a not only non-sexist but an actively female perspective and it's super cool and made me realize that having traditionally male interests doesn't mean I should have to be stuck with predominately male spaces. 

It's honestly not worth it to try to deal with it. Reddit has mainstream subreddits that are actively toxic, hate mongering spaces. The site owners just flat out don't care and have shown a strong bias against female users - it is what it is. I go where I'm welcome and once I'm treated in a way that leads me to conclude I'm not welcome, I leave. There's too many healthy and supportive spaces on the internet to bother with a bunch of toxic man-children who blame women because of their inability for introspection.

I don't hang out in online nazi spaces and get upset everytime they find an excuse to be racist, because I recognize that it's unproductive and unhealthy. Anti-feminists are no different (seriously the overlap between them and Nazis is extremely high, they've got to have over 50% the same userbase). I think internet communities should always be those that serve us in a healthy way and provide a sense of belonging/support or which provide good info to us. Otherwise, why bother? I'll deal with sexists in real life when I need to, but I'll go out of my way to avoid them online becuase that's the beautiful thing about the internet - there's no geographic limitation forcing you to remain in a certain area. Leaving is always an option, and with men *that* toxic leaving is usually far and away the best option. 

They're on the wrong side of history. They're probably already mostly sad, lonely men who are lashing out at women becuase they can't take personal responsibility for their own failures. As someone who is likely on the autism spectrum, I relate to a LOT of the issues the average redditor has. But I've realize a key difference is that I have always questioned what is wrong with *me*, what about *me* do I need to change. Men [and this has been shown in game theory psych studies looking at the role of testosterone in social dynamics and group hierarchies, so it's not just some sexist opinion if mine] are signficantly more likely to respond with anger when they feel threatened/wronged/etc. Low testosterone people (aka women) are signficantly less likely to respond with anger and less likely to retaliate. When. I look at the average redditor, I see a lot of similarities. But I don't *want* to be like them. So if anything, I'm kind of glad reddit is a sexist cesspool becuase even without the sexism most of those areas are still toxic and unhealthy.

I'm working on building greenhouses for veggies and have goats and chickens so I'm hoping I can avoid going into town as much as possible soon! A few word of advice though - in the beginning I felt like I could do it all on my own. But it's a lot of property to take care of, 12 acres is a lot too. I let some friends stay in a tiny home, rent-free for their labor (but they pay their own electric/internet/etc) whenever I want it lol, and it's really made a difference to have people help chop firewood, maintain trails. help build stuff etc. 

I would also recommend, if you don't already have one, to purchase at least two firearms - a handgun and a shotgun or hunting rifle. There have been cougars and coyotes interested in my goats and chickens, and warning shots work well to keep them away. And if one day I shoot one, guess I'll have cougar for dinner lol. I've also had thieves come to my property, and depending on how rural your property is the police might not help you. My local police said they don't respond to calls where I am, only the county sheriff does, and candidly told me that unless there was a dead body I can't really count on the sheriff to come out here. So if there's any trouble you need to be able to defend yourself. I'd also invest in a surveillance system when you build your house and trail cams for where electricity can't reach, my thieves were taken to court due to my cameras and I became a hero in the community because they'd been stealing from everyone. 

Last advice, get to know your neighbors! Most rural communities are small, so having a friendly neighbor on your side helps a lot, they give you all the intel. And if you were originally a city slicker like me who didn't know too much about country living, they can dispense great advice like ""hey neighbor, the bucks are shedding their horns right now so keep an eye out!"" (my tenant then proceeds to find a horn), or ""black trumpet mushrooms are in season rn, there's a local guy in town who buys them for  $12/lb!"". I wouldn't have known any of that stuff if we hadn't stopped to have a quick chat.

White people enslaving black people. Discriminating against women.


Racists *loved* to point out difference in IQ tests between races. Afai rember the difference wasn't big. So, even when you are the priviledged group, with much more education, when tests *cater to you* - there was little difference. How are you superior when you are *barely* doing better with all the advantage?


More men finishing college was somehow a sign of superiority. Now that the field is more leveled and women do it more it's an error in the system. Something is wrong, they are oppressed! *Now* we need to do something about it!


It's also why they sabotage women's day but don't care about men's. It's why they think equality means equal violence (like men weren't violent with women before and they ignore that it's *women* that would *reaaaally* have to ramp up the violence against men if they seek such ""equality"").
