What's trollish is that a lot of feminism subs are moderated by men. LOL

This is a good sub. Mods do not ban people unfairly. And it's not a men centered sub, we don't come here to talk about our failed romances with men. We come here to talk about women, women issues, our lifestyle as women going our own way. 

Sometimes you get a man here, but their comments are excluded. However, this sub is not as chased by men as other feminism subs (like the Voldemort sub, who has male lurkers foaming from their mouths and dying for reddit to ban them, because they can't participate).

Also some coworkers went to LA and they got lost and asked instructions and the dude started yelling they couldn't be there it wasn't safe... pretty strange shit for us to have like those unsafe areas. They said they started running LOL
Here I was also lucky because I didn't stay in a party hostel or even if it was a party hostel due to pandemic it wasn't full of people. It was ideal for me, since it was my first time solo travelling. 

My country ranks as the 3rd or 2nd safest country in the world so I don't know how it would be like in the US. I mean rape and sexual assault happens here too and there's misogynism, but in the stats we are considered quite safe so maybe those things don't happen as often. 

I think here things would be stricter, like you can't just park your van everywhere, usually there's specific parks and you can get fined if you don't respect that. The guy I met didn't respect it and he didn't have problems but I think he changed spot sometimes because there's a limit fo time of how long you can stay. In the movie they were like in the nowhere land, in the middle of the desert.

In Europe you don't have nowhere land like in the US (maybe Siberia? lol). There's houses mostly everywhere here lol. 

I'd run if I spotted a vandweller using drugs.

bell hooks teeters towards the basic tenets of radical feminism rather than liberal feminism. She technically would be since she wants a complete restructuring of society and elimination of male ~~^(superiority)~~ inferiority while accommodating and compensating women in their role within reproduction politically, socially and financially.

She wouldn't be associated with liberal feminism to me since that's more of an offshoot from social contract theory where legal democracy equates to sex equality and personal/private concerns aren't related to the equality of women. She always is making the personal political.

What he says can be adapted to the feminist struggle.

Surely if you go to a conservative institution you'll expect to have to tolerate misoginy. But then that's why people become Left wingers and maybe search alterantive life paths, to avoid that. Except even in those places, most of the times, men already went there and ruined it.

The other day I read here a comment from a sister saying that she liked the Wicca community but lately it has just become a place where women go to prey on women. The same about communes, it could be a place to recover from emotional trauma, or to do organic gardening or to be a vegan or whatever. But most often than not, men go there and transform it into ugly polyamour communes. 

Meetups are a great way to have people to do some stuff with you, like a hike, a book club, a film. Or just to chat with foreigners, know different cultures, go to a different restaurant. Of course men have to go there to try to hookup with women, they need to go and make everything sexual.

Even a date can just be about two people going on a hike, going to the beach, enjoying a landscape. Of course a man will try at least to kiss, most likely to have sex with you if not the first date, then the second or the third or whenever he has a change.

Wherever men go, they ruin everything because they are unable to control their sexual urges.",,,1621182382,{},gyc7ehh,False,t3_ndoe2y,False,False,t1_gybyren,/r/wgtow/comments/ndoe2y/what_do_you_enjoy_best_about_going_your_own_way/gyc7ehh/,1621221602.0,11,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was talking to a friend earlier. Every Sunday we have ""girl talk"" and just talk about how lives, stresses and support one another/ be each other's devil advocates. 

I'm about to move out of a city I've lived in for 8 years. I told her I'm proablly going to cry once I get to around packing and she said why? Im going to miss this place despite the good, bad and ugly. She told me I've been mostly unhappy there. 

And it hit me, I've been unhappy the most in a relationship. I've I've feeling much happier not dealing with men and I guess a part of me wish I had more time like I do now to enjoy the city on my own now that in single. 

So, with preparing to move I've been looking into things to do in my new town. The things I wanted to do in my current city but didn't because I had my head up a man's ass and dealing with trying to figure out what degree I should get since I was talked out of what I wanted to do by family.

I think more and more that you don't choose to become a communist. You are either one or you're not. A communist from my country once say ""For a communist, the fight never ends"". 

That's what being a communist is. True communism is not the Communist regime that was installed in Czech Republic after the nazis were defeated.

I watched the movie Carol yesterday and she is in it. Really liked the movie. 

It made me wonder a few things. First of all the guys seem to tolerate when the women are lesbian. The husband of the main character didn't mind she had an affair with another woman, he just got upset when she left him. But honestly it was her that took the initiative because she was tired of being repressed. If she had put up with it more, he probably would close his eyes... So apparently dudes don't feel threatened by women, only by other men. 

And then both main characters of the movie had relationship with men and liked women... So are they lesbians and were repressed by society and forced to find a man? Are they bisexual?

I personally feel like I am not a lesbian. I am interested in men but not enough to tolerate bullshit. If I wanted to be a lesbian I could freely pursue other women in the city, nobody would judge me because nobody knows me, my family isn't there so they wouldn't even have to know... But I don't feel the need to. Maybe I am just asexual or something because I like men but I am not willing to tolerate certain behaviours and thus I prefer to stay single. If I was an highly sexual person I'd either put up with certain behaviors to have a sexual partner or I'd seek a woman.

This reminds of the movie Shame. The guy was straight and a sex addict. At one point he was so desperate for sex he went into a gay club and had a guy doing him a blowjob.

I still have fun though. This summer I met some cool people. At the hostel I met three guys and they were so nice. We went on a day trip and I never felt harassed. I also slept on a mixed dorm with other guys and didn't feel unsafe. I guess I was lucky.

Scorpio rules things like astrology and the taboo occult etc. so you'd probably enjoy learning more about it!

**Marriage and motherhood**

*Marriage is nothing more than a tool for the capitalist wage slave machine, which is why I recommendation women not only be single and stay away from men but to also never have children themselves.*

*One of the biggest contributors to the gender pay gap is motherhood. When a woman has a baby, she is normally the one who needs to stay home to look after it, which means she sacrifices her career. She sacrifices earnings and skills development. This makes her financially dependent on the husband.*

*The reason why women are oppressed so much is because of natural biology i.e. pregnancy and motherhood. The fact that women have to tear up their bodies to let the species continue shows how gruesome biology is, and the demands of pregnancy and child rearing make women dependent on men, which gives men the natural upper hand. Also, motherhood deprives women the freedom to pursue intellectual interests, tying them down to the status of incubators and gestators. As far as biology goes, a woman‚Äôs purpose is mainly that she can act as a birthing machine.*

*It is for this reason that I believe that nothing holds women back more than motherhood and that women should never have children if they want independence and autonomy, which are basic freedoms.*

*Compared to being single, marriage is a bum deal for many woman. Accordingly, married women are less happy than single women and less happy than their husbands, they are less eager than men to marry, they‚Äôre more likely to file for divorce and, when they do, they are happier as divorcees than they were when married (the opposite is true for men) and they are more likely than men to prefer never to remarry.*

*The only reason this is surprising is because of the torrent of propaganda we get that tells us otherwise.*

*We are told by books, sitcoms, reality shows, and romantic comedies that single women are wetting their pants to get hitched.*

**Financial freedom**

Basically I think the keys to financial independence is to live a minimalist lifestyle, which means minimising large obligations eg no children, no marriage, no luxury car etc. Try to keep expenses down. Then you will be able to save up more. Then put these savings into assets eg shares, ETFs or real estate. These assets should pay income eg real estate can be rented out which means you get rental income. Shares and ETFs pay dividends. The value of these assets tend to go up over time (not guaranteed) but they will pay you passive income that does not require you to do any work.",,,1622647686,{},h0bnaj6,True,t3_nqne2x,False,False,t3_nqne2x,/r/wgtow/comments/nqne2x/wgtow_wordpress/h0bnaj6/,1622756203.0,15,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a Socialist, anti-work, eco-feminist, with an education in male dominated fields (Political Science and Philosophy). I tried to re-educate as a cosmetologist, and found out female professional bullies are WAY worse than male ones. I got expelled for putting Rosie the Riveter up on my station and standing up for a girl who was bullied into a mental health breakdown. Feminists aren't welcome in beauty culture. 

My dad was and abusive, sexist, Catholic, undiagnosed bi-polar for my entire childhood. My mom checked out mentally/emotionally years ago to survive. 

I'm an Aquarius - the weird, cold, loner in the corner observing things that happen like it's a science experiment when it's a party. 

I have diagnosed severe PTSD and Anxiety Disorder from a 2 attempted murders, a kidnap, and 2 sexual assaults (4 different men at different times in my life). Also, I studied things like FGM, rape as a war crime, and child sex trafficking in University. I am a PTSD and anti-sexual violence advocate. I get desperate women DMing, emailing me their trauma stories every week. Then I have to go into Zoom meeting with white men in positions of power and beg for funding/initiatives/housing for women with trauma. In truth, I am a bit of a work-aholic, but mostly for non-profit or protest organizations, so I don't get paid. People also hate the poor. ""Imposter Syndrome"" is a typical symptom of anxiety and childhood abuse: but because I'm not traditionally successful in a neo-liberal society, I feel like a looser all the time. 

I have been a feminist since I was 5: My family told me I couldn't be the first female pope of the Catholic Church and I couldn't have inheritance because I am a girl even though I am the oldest - I was expected to get married, obey, and make Catholic babies for my husband. I was strongly opinionated about women's equality then, and I still am at 43 (which means I am an elder millennial/Gen X cusp). 

I'm really smart which isn't a blessing because ignorance is bliss and I'm ""too smart for my own good"" as my dad would say. It intimidates most men/authority figures around me - especially if they assume everyone is ruthless and ambitious like them. I am not. I have no desire to step on other people to get myself ahead. I want to end/ease suffering, not cause it. In my psych eval they gave me an IQ test and it is pre-genius (not bragging - I hate it - it's awful). 

I'm also Canadian... 

TL;DR: Everyone hates a ""mentally-ill"", Canadian, socialist, boomer, snowflake, know-it-all, with a temper --- especially on the internet. I am a warrior (the battle of the sexes has almost killed me) against anything that exploits women and children (tyranny, capitalism and the patriarchy). So I am at war with the world. I've taken the hits and have the battle scars to prove it. I want a better world more than personal glorification and if that makes me a looser so be it. That's what I am and I love the hell outta me. I am truly ""blursed"".  

Now I feel sick: I hate bragging. I usually hide most of that for my own safety. I gave up on being openly confident years ago. My anxiety brain is waiting for the misogynist-incel-tolls lurking in every corner of reddit to send death/rape threats in my DMs.",,,1622639309,{},h0b5af6,False,t3_nq609n,False,True,t3_nq609n,/r/wgtow/comments/nq609n/imposter_syndrome_anticorporate_feelings/h0b5af6/,1622743447.0,3,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since leaving I have:

- Gone on road trips (am currently on one now - vaccinated of course). My ex always said we would go travel, but it was never made a priority and he financially drained us so it wasn‚Äôt even possible

- Re-enrolled in school for this Fall getting a more practical, well paying career degree

- Worked on my mental health. I‚Äôve been with my current therapist for over a year now and have been diagnosed with disorders that were lowering my quality of life that I didn‚Äôt know I had. I am now on medication and doing therapy to work on managing them. Also working through the 5 years of abusive trauma I have from the marriage and am in a much better place now than I was. Stopped having weekly panic attacks immediately after I left the relationship

- Stayed single and decided that WGTOW was best for me so I could work through my trauma and not return to my codependency issues I formed during the relationship

- Quit my awful fast food management job

- Got a cat

- Improved my dental health (which got put on the back burner from lack of insurance and moving too often to get decent insurance - also not having enough money to afford any work anyways...yay USA)

- Am more financially stable and less stressed about money

- Reconnected with art and photography, which gives me joy and life (which I had stopped due to his criticism)

I‚Äôm still working on improving and hope to improve even more a year from now. Leaving has been so worth it.

I've never considered myself a feminist for largely the same reason. So much of the rhetoric is personal, anecdotal, or meant to inspire instead of inform. All very persuasive and very human. If I said that I was a robot, would people let me off the hook?

When I was in college and feminists tried to recruit me, they would use examples that were very personal but didn't actually resonate with me. ""So let's say that you were at a frat party, and some guy wouldn't stop flirting with you.""

Why would I go to a frat party? Do vegans walk into steakhouses?

It's incredibly difficult for me to talk to women, because so much is about trusting women, and validating women, and believing women. Not so much about understanding women. Because my question is always going to be WHY would I go to a frat party to begin with? Why wouldn't I go to a women-controlled space? Why would I go to a party where casual sex is part of the culture? Why would I go someplace where people are doing illegal and irresponsible things like drinking and smoking weed? Why would I waste my time surrounded by those things?

And these women would just tell me that sometimes women did things that weren't easy to understand, not entirely admitting they were mistakes, but sometimes that's just how life is and the fight and the struggle was in the middle of these battlegrounds. Which is perfectly understandable. But I feel the same way now is I felt when I was 17 years old: Women aren't going to accomplish anything in this world if we feel that our first right is to commit every single mistake that men have done like it's some sort of right of passage, and then after that, spend half of our lives fighting to escape the consequences of our mistakes with the same privilege that men have had, and then after that, when we are middle aged and tired, then we can be revolutionaries.",,,1624256699,{},h2if8zt,True,t3_o4e04v,False,False,t1_h2idxjv,/r/wgtow/comments/o4e04v/do_you_approve_of_the_sexualization_and/h2if8zt/,1624563250.0,4,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I learned a while ago that our emotions and thoughts are actually pretty separate, and we experience emotions first and stronger. So we think of ourselves as rational even though we're definitely not. And if course, nobody ever intuitively realized their perception is distorted.

This is where relationships breakdown because some blindly or refuse to accept their loved ones evolving.

Personally, I am an atheist and a Jew and have found religion to be a great source of strength and has buttressed my support system and strengthened my ability to live on my own. When I was bedridden and undergoing chemo, it was the women in my synagogue who brought groceries and meals and took my kid for the day to beach or park with them so I could rest and she could see friends. The older women are a great source of inspiration as many are single by choice as well or are happily married to decent men. Our rabbi is a divorced woman, and was a great source of counsel and comfort for me when I decided to end my marriage. In fact, when it came to light that my ex was abusive, she rallied multiple lawyers for me and testified in custody court for me. The men in the community put a lot of pressure on him to grant my Get and to agree to let me keep the house and to pay child support. They literally would walk him to I‚Äôm his car after work and hang out at his tennis club in groups until he backed down. 

I realize that I am being a devils advocate at this point and I‚Äôm sorry for that. 

I think going our own way is a process of separation from patriarchal dynamics and most main stream Christian religion reinforces the patriarchy. So the article is a helpful and valid thing to share. Jews are a very small minority so I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúwhatabout‚Äù all over to e place here. However, I do think that we can make mindful choices in all areas of our lives and building community is essential for single women in a world designed to enforce heterosexual coupledom. I‚Äôve seen all female Unitarian churches, non denominational women‚Äôs groups and such fill this role as well. Separatism is an essential step to ending the patriarchy but that doesn‚Äôt mean being an island either. That‚Äôs when I notice some struggle with GTOW as we are human and humans are a tribal species. But a relationship with a man isn‚Äôt the only way to fill that need.

But me determining that isn‚Äôt what I want is solely my own creations. I‚Äôm happy to say that is 100% my decision. Despite being brainwashed from a young age that abuse is normal, that women shouldn‚Äôt expect more, that my life would rely being dependent on others because I‚Äôm not good enough or smart enough to be in my own...

I remember living with my father and thinking, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to get out on my own and not have to deal with this.‚Äù I did not realize I would find men who make me feel the exact same way.

Like why don't you raise him the rent? It's below market value, I am sure of it because there's other places here that pay like 400‚Ç¨/month of rent and he pays like 75‚Ç¨. 

If I was him I'd accept it obviously. So it's not his fault. But then don't fuck with my Internet. And in the winter he spent electricity, the bills were huge and the first month I paid like 80‚Ç¨ because I couldn't tell if it was me or him.

Now that it ended and she knows I am independent again, it started getting worst. 

Unfortunately I can't afford a house in the city yet. I'd like to buy a house with a little garden, that'd be the ideal because then I'd take the dogs and wouldn't have to come back here. However houses are even more expensive so if I opt for that it will take me longer to get the downpayment. If I buy an apartment (cheaper), I'll be able to do it sooner, but then I'll have to come back here for the dogs... Another option is to buy an apartment and then come here like two weeks a month and rent it out for AirBnB when I am here, make profit with it, then change it for a more expensive house later on.

&amp;#x200B;

2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour	

1 tablespoon baking powder	

1/2 teaspoon salt	

8 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut up	

1/4 cup granulated sugar ( use 1/3 for slightly sweeter scones)	

2/3 cup milk (I usually use slightly more, maybe more like 3/4 cup, to make the scones less crumbly)

\--

1.	Heat oven to 425¬∞F (220 Celsius).

2. Put flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl; stir/mix well Add butter and cut in with a pastry blender/fork or rub in with your fingers, until the mixture looks like fine crumbs.

3. Add sugar; toss to mix.

4. Add milk and stir with a wooden spoon until slightly sticky dough forms (or crumbly dough, if you want drier scones)

5. (\*\*optional, as I often just roll the dough in my hands and flatten it on the actual baking sheet\*\*) Place dough on a floured counter and knead gently until it comes together in a ball.

6. Pat or roll into a circle about 1 1/2 inches thick.

7. cut each circle into 6 or 8 wedges.

8. place wedges on a greased cookie sheet- slightly apart for crisp sides, touching for soft.

9. Bake about 12-15 minutes, or until medium brown on top.

\--

\*\*I usually add my ""extras"" into the mix after step 4, with some exceptions. These are pretty hard to f--- up so it's more about your preference and experiences. All of the recipes I use are developed by me, but are often inspired by ones I've seen in books or online before!\*\*

For my beloved lemon butter scones, I use a grater to add lemon zest after step 3, then replace a bit of the milk with about 3-4 tablespoons or more of lemon juice. I top with powdered sugar when they are done.

Cinnamon bun scones are also a favorite. For these, I add cinnamon (I just eyeball it) during step 3, then 1/4 cup of brown sugar and about 2 tsp of vanilla extract during step 4. I'll often make icing using whatever I've got (cream cheese, powdered sugar, etc) and top them with that.

Other additions I've tried include blueberries, coconut shavings, chocolate chips, maple syrup, apples &amp; cinnamon, peaches...the only limit is your creativity and preferences!

I promise I don't work for them/am not sponsored by them, but this is the second time I have recommended this vibe to someone on reddit. 

I used to watch porn but hate almost everything about the sex industry, so watching it now personally just turns my stomach and does not turn me on. 

With this vibe, I don't need any external mental stimulus bc it genuinely just feels so good. I just put on soft meditative music and try to focus on my breathing and body sensations. 

This practice has the added bonus of allowing me to mentally decentre my sexuality from the pleasure of others and recentre it around my own pleasure. I just highly recommend getting a really good vibrator because literally no one on this earth can make me feel the way I make myself feel with this thing. Which is quite an empowering thing for me to realise in and of itself.

EDIT: I see you say you've just bought yourself a new vibe, so practice the meditative music and breathing with this new vibrator.

For women in these countries, they are often reduced to the perceived attractiveness, fertility and whether or not a seal is still attached (aka virginity). Women in these areas are literally graded like how one would grade a product. Are the casings intact? Are the seals intact? Is there any noticeable blemishes? A woman‚Äôs worth is based on how much she can propel her man‚Äôs worth in the eye of society. This model can‚Äôt give me a son? Trade with another model, who cares what happens to the old model, just throw it away. This product is defective and does not dispense regular sex? Throw it away and get another model instead. In these countries, everything is seen through the male gaze. Their bodies are not free, but their mind even more so. Women in these countries are also accustomed to the male gaze and also see themselves through it while acting as a gatekeeper. 

While younger women in developed democratic countries do prescribe to this dubious ‚Äòsexual liberation,‚Äô you don‚Äôt see their future being ruined by this unlike in muslim majority society, where you‚Äôll be lucky if you don‚Äôt get killed or whipped, and if worst case something happen, forcibly married to your rapist. I would say the fact that they have enough freedom and agency over their body to do those things is also a good thing. Also, and arguably most importantly, they‚Äôre young. A lot of young men also makes mistake. Most of these young people will learn and grow out of it, regardless of gender. 

The unattractive penalty applies to both gender in liberal society, haven‚Äôt you seen MGTOW and incels blaming everything on their looks? Attractive people earn more and is treated better regardless of gender. While a lot of women do embrace performative femininity, in muslim majority country the end goal is to secure a rich husband while in Western countries it is partly to attract a mate (and males does it too, look at gym bro culture), it is also to accrue social currency that they can trade for better employment opportunity, social perks, etc. I used to work in consulting and let me tell you, we barely have unattractive people of either gender. In muslim majority country, the unattractive penalty only applies to women. These men does not need to care about impressing women, only about accruing enough money.

When Stevie Smith was three years old, she moved with her mother and sister to Palmers Green in North London where she would live until her death in 1971.  
 She resented the fact that her father had abandoned his family. Later,   
when her mother became ill, her aunt Madge Spear (whom Smith called ""The  
 Lion Aunt"") came to live with them, raised Smith and her elder sister   
Molly and became the most important person in Smith's life. Spear was a   
feminist who claimed to have ""no patience"" with men and, as Smith wrote,  
 ""she also had 'no patience' with Hitler"". Smith and Molly, raised in a   
family of women, became attached to their own independence, in contrast   
to what Smith described as the typical Victorian family atmosphere of   
""father knows best"".

In the poem ""A House of Mercy"", she wrote of her childhood house in North London:  
It was a house of female habitation,  
Two ladies fair inhabited the house,  
And they were brave. For although Fear knocked loud  
Upon the door, and said he must come in,  
They did not let him in.

After she retired from Sir Neville Pearson's service following a   
nervous breakdown she gave poetry readings and broadcasts on the BBC that gained her new friends and readers among a younger generation. Sylvia Plath  
 became a fan of her poetry and sent Smith a letter in 1962, describing   
herself as ""a desperate Smith-addict."" Plath expressed interest in   
meeting in person but took her own life soon after sending the letter.

Smith was celibate for most of her life, although she rejected the idea that she was lonely as a result, alleging that she had a number of intimate relationships with friends and family that kept her fulfilled. She never entirely abandoned or accepted the High Church Anglican faith of her childhood, describing herself as a ""lapsed atheist"", and wrote sensitively about theological puzzles;""There is a God in whom I do not believe/Yet to this God my love stretches."" Her 14-page essay of 1958, ""The Necessity of Not Believing"", concludes: ""There is no reason to be sad, as some people are sad when they feel religion slipping off from them. There is no reason to be sad, it is a good thing."" The essay was unveiled at a meeting of the Cambridge Humanist Society.

She also hiked the Appalachian, among many other trails.

Personally, I did not hike the Appalachian, but did some longish hikes in Europe. Most important is to plan ahead at least a bit (but don't forget that some problems can be solved better in the moment and there's often people around willing to help). Know your route, know the dangers, find a on- or offline map that has good places for sleeping/camping and getting water. 90% of your concern will be where to sleep, where to next find water, and where to buy food again. But be prepared that once you show up at a place, it might not be how you pictured it - so be willing to improvise in the moment.

Educate yourself on safety on the trail - what dangers are there and how can you avoid them/react if they occur. E.g. bad weather, storms, injuries,...

Imho, you don't necessarily need to train that much. It's helpful to be fit, and of course do some shorter hikes to know what to expect. However, every able-bodied person can hike (and a lot of disabled ones, too). If you are out of form, you might get tired faster or walk slower. That's not a problem, though. You can just slow down or take a break. It will take you more days to hike, but that's all. You will also build muscles in your legs once you hike for a longer time.

edit: And I second the advise about breaking your shoes in! A lot! Even if they feel fine on shorter hikes, they might start to hurt on longer hikes.",,,1627030348,{},h688hhn,False,t3_opt7ey,False,False,t3_opt7ey,/r/wgtow/comments/opt7ey/any_appalachian_trail_training_groups_for_women/h688hhn/,1627189752.0,4,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

get a pet. seriously. I felt so alone before I was able to have my cat with me and now I never feel truly alone. a pet will love you better than any man ever could.

Imho, almost all gender differences are the result of socialisation. The way boys and girls/men and women are treated by others is so different, we might as well be different species. Most men will never understand the way women are treated in society (unless maybe they're extremely self-reflective about society and their own upbringing). The large majority of men just can't be feminists because they don't get the female experience. As a result, there are very few men who are truly empathetic, simply because they never have to be (quite the opposite, sensitive men are put down by other men...). 

I'm against pornography and prostitution,  but I'm not sure if the Nordic model is the best way to deal with it. As long as economic inequalities exist, some women will turn to forms of sex work and illegality will make them more vulnerable (even if it's only the men being prosecuted - they're their way of making money, after all). Ending economic inequalities and giving all women financial stability should be the first goal in ending sex work. 

I think all feminism catering to men or trying to get men on the board is mostly useless. The majority of men simply benefits from patriarchy in too many ways. Even the soft, more feminine types. There are ways in which men would benefit from a more egalitarian society (such as spending more time with their kids, more true emotional connections,...), but these are things  most men don't value enough to give up their chance for money and power over. 

I think governments should do a lot more to enforce gender equality. Such as making it mandatory that parental leave is split 50/50 (or else part of it expires - with exceptions for single parents, of course). Single earner/SAHP households should not get any tax benefits, but rather pay more taxes, unless both parents stayed at home for an equal amount of time. That said, marriage should not grant people tax benefits at all, but rather having children (if at all). Honestly, I'd abolish marriage altogether. Having companies that don't have 50/50 quotas in higher positions have to PROVE that the man they hired actually fits the hiring criteria than the women who applied. Same for people of colour/different cultural backgrounds (on a quota based on the distribution of inhabitants of a country). Giving all women free and safe access to birth control and abortion. Giving lesbians and single women access to adoption and IVF. Not releasing drugs that were not tested on women. 

More women in police force/governmental positions/judicature positions. Harsher sentences for violent men. Laws that protect women from crimes such as under-skirting, sharing nudes, revenge-porn,... (where they are not already in action).  Measures to  combat economic inequalities, such as finally taxing the rich and guaranteeing working people fair wages. Inheriting anything of larger monetary value should simply be illegal - children of rich people already have large benefits due to better education etc., no reason to allow them to gain a large amount of resources they never had to work for. Investing in good quality schools and preschools to give all children access to good education. Not allowing companies that use slave labour or exploit poorer countries to sell their products. All these points are from a pretty European perspective, in other countries, different measures might be useful. 

That said, none of this is going to happen, as pretty much all governments/executive/judicature orders are deeply rooted in patriarchy and no real change will be allowed.",,,1619862890,{},gwixsyf,False,t3_n1rik4,False,False,t3_n1rik4,/r/wgtow/comments/n1rik4/which_type_of_feminism_do_you_identify_with/gwixsyf/,1619885898.0,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After they die, then really the motivation to have all that space will be lower and a 1 bedroom apartment will do. 

This is the most expensive place in my country for a reason though, it's 20 min to the capital where all jobs are, there's tons of stuff to do, 15 mins from beaches. You don't need a car because there's a lot of public transportations, it's extremely safe and clean and it's full of rich people that probably pay huge property taxes (because the houses are like mansions) which makes them have cool programs like free transportation in the area or free covid tests, among other things.  
Maybe one day I'll get tired of the city or will want to move abroad, in that case I can sell or rent with profit. It's a very dynamic housing market so you always have people looking to buy or rent there. It's also a bit touristic and a hot spot for digital nomads so you can do short term rental.

Housing market is just stupid here, though. A 1 bedroom I'll be lucky if I find for 110k in the area. If I save 5k/year in 4-5 years I'll have enough for downpayment and then maybe if I pay like 300‚Ç¨/month to the bank I'll pay it in 20 some yrs. House with garden would be at least 300k (for that price, it would need some construction work). It's a bit impossible to be able to afford that before my dogs die :( 

Maybe after they die I'll venture myself in the US and get me some money to come back, get a house with garden and retire earlier. But that won't happen until I am in my 40s, my youngest puppy is 5 yrs, so hopefully she'll still have at least 10 or 15 more years to live and I don't want to be that far from them (also they are house dogs, they are used to space, I wouldn't dare putting them on a flat).",,,1621867094,{},gz9zc0z,True,t3_njtq1e,False,True,t1_gz9x7cz,/r/wgtow/comments/njtq1e/whats_your_long_term_life_plan/gz9zc0z/,1621939784.0,2,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sorry if I'm being a little vague in the rest of my post I've just learned to keep certain goals to myself because it's more of a motivation personally that way.

I'm just getting into astrocartography which is a subset of astrology that shows where different planets are on different locations and the experiences you may have. Looking back on the past before I knew what it was it was eerie and pretty cray seeing how things lined up with my different experiences. I had always been drawn to a particular city that has a reputation for being 'lame' haha but I always thought the architecture was so beautiful and it turns out it's literally like right on my Venus line and I've never lived anywhere near that range so I want to move there and see what happens. 

As far as career goes I think I read this on this sub or similar that really inspired me but I really want to actually challenge myself. I want to do something really hard that I will be proud of myself for achieving. It is a total mindset shift for me because before I wanted more of an easy skate through kind of life which don't get me wrong I still do in some ways but I want to see my potential.

Absolutely unacceptable. You should have cut contact that day.

&gt;*.... When we broke up I told him I‚Äôd have his kids  ....I mentioned it a few years ago to him because I was having ‚Äúbaby fever‚Äù because I was 24 and terrified of ‚Äúrunning out of time""*  
&gt;  
&gt;.... *I told him that I still had feelings for him via the FB ‚Äúvanish mode‚Äù and he saw it but of course didn‚Äôt say anything.*

You are telling this man that it is okay to disrespect you, that despite the fact he's ben callous by being aloof or bait-and-switching in his messages to you, you'd still have his children. Absolutely never share this kind of information with a man you are not in a serious committed relationship with.

&gt;*...he dangled a carrot and took it away. I ended up begging him again but he just didn‚Äôt say anything ...At this point he had a GF who he‚Äôs suuuper in love with etc*

He is putting on this performance to see your reaction: jealousy, hurt, etc.

&gt;*he watches like 90% of my insta and FB stories religiously.*

He's controlling. He wants to see what you're up to despite him not being there. 

&gt;*....it felt like he wanted me to come over and sleep with him? That was just my intuition but it felt so absurd I wrote it off.*

Listen to your gut. It's right. It's not the first time he's done this to you according to your comment. 

&gt;... *maybe he doesn‚Äôt even think I‚Äôm that attractive.*

Yes he does. Women have a tendency to turn inward: self-blame when trying to reason unjustifiable behavior. His behavior has absolutely nothing to do with you.

&gt;When we broke up he said something like ‚Äúwell I just did it for the regular sex‚Äù and it was such a traumatic thing for him to say 

It was traumatic to say. Even if he were flatly lying, the immaturity of saying something like that is something you should never associate with. 

He sounds like he has NPD and/or is a sociopath. You also sound like you have low self-esteem with is a lethal combo with someone like that.

[],,goddessmoneta,,,[],,,,text,t2_9a9wtfzm,False,False,[],"So basically me and my ex broke up 5 years ago, I was a senior in college and graduating and he had taken a year off so, even though he was only a year younger than me, he was a sophomore and still had two years. We went out on-and-off for like nine months, and for the first 4-5 I was in a poly relationship with this guy (5 years older than me) who lived an hour away who was engaged and I was his ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù, and she had a ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù who I was dating - like a poly square. Yes I know. Barf. 

Anyway, this boyfriend was in my major the first few months - we actually met in February and starting dating around August. So until December I was a computer science major just like him, we had like 2-3 overlapping classes and he slept over my apartment all the time, which was 20 minutes to our college as opposed to his commute which was like an hour. 

So we had A LOT of sex and at some point I realized his friend (we were part of a friend group) had r-ped me because I was blacked out when we did it and I couldn‚Äôt remember. To this day I can‚Äôt even confirm if we did but he bragged about it to no end to the other friends. This was May. We went out for a week because I had a ‚Äúno sex without dating rule‚Äù but he was a pathological liar so I dumped him (didn‚Äôt wanna go out with him anyway). 

My boyfriend, who is STILL his best friend, said he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt going to take sides‚Äù which is pretty messed up but I forgave him at the time. 

Anyway, when we broke up 5 years ago I told him maybe we could go out again in 5 years, when he has a stable job etc. since at that point he was just a broke college sophomore. 

This guy was also really good looking and I felt really insecure at the time and grateful he went out with me. 

So these past 5 years I go traveling around the world and doing fun stuff while he graduates and gets a boring computer science job (I dropped the major and took a bunch of random music classes my last semester. He actually said he wanted a ‚Äúbrand new start‚Äù that next semester as if I was interchangeable with semesters, and also probably because we didn‚Äôt share classes anymore). 

Throughout these past five years we have been talking on and off mostly on Facebook. When we broke up I told him I‚Äôd have his kids (mostly to make him feel better about being dumped) and then I mentioned it a few years ago to him because I was having ‚Äúbaby fever‚Äù because I was 24 and terrified of ‚Äúrunning out of time‚Äù. But at this point he had a GF who he‚Äôs suuuper in love with etc. 

Well anyway so I come back to the city we went to college in, kind of my home city, and I‚Äôm broke and in trouble and I ask him if I can stay with him and his gf. Well he says ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs funny my gf is out of town for 2 weeks‚Äù and I said ‚Äúoh ok I‚Äôll be over tomorrow‚Äù and he said ‚Äúnah she wouldn‚Äôt be ok with you staying here alone for obvious reasons‚Äù. I thought maybe COVID but also that he would cheat??? It was so weird. Like he dangled a carrot and took it away. I ended up begging him again but he just didn‚Äôt say anything although he did reply when I asked him where I could pick up üçÉ. 

Anyway so he sent me this long rambling message two months ago about how his girlfriend is moving across the country at the end of this month and he‚Äôs going to have to find another place. I don‚Äôt know why he told me this. Is he trying to tell me they‚Äôre going to break up? They‚Äôve been together like 3-4 years. Right now he is searching for a new place with a mutual friend of ours. 

Recently I told him that I still had feelings for him via the FB ‚Äúvanish mode‚Äù and he saw it but of course didn‚Äôt say anything. He is aloof like this a lot and very selectively responsive. 

Oh, and he watches like 90% of my insta and FB stories religiously. I don‚Äôt know why he does it. He‚Äôs probably watched like 50 of my stories so it‚Äôs not a coincidence and it‚Äôs fairly recent. He even did after I told him I still liked him. So it‚Äôs kind of annoying. 

So basically I am having this trauma of wondering, was our whole relationship a lie? All of that sex and cuddling and saying I love you, was that all so he could have a lot of sex? Did he not really like me the whole time? To brag to his friends? When we broke up he said something like ‚Äúwell I just did it for the regular sex‚Äù and it was such a traumatic thing for him to say that I thought he was just being bitter but I‚Äôm realizing maybe it‚Äôs true. And when he said his gf was going to be gone for two weeks it felt like he wanted me to come over and sleep with him? That was just my intuition but it felt so absurd I wrote it off. 

Anyway I think about this ex a lot and I miss our love and our cuddles but I feel like all the love was a lie. And he probably talks smack about me all the time and maybe he doesn‚Äôt even think I‚Äôm that attractive. Anyway I just need to get this off my chest because I‚Äôm still going through it.

Buying goods and essentials that you bought with your own money, whether that's from work or even benefits that are made out to you in your name because you personally qualify for them is _way_ different than having an individual man support you materially, that is jeopardized by not being in a relationship that he wants and you don't- meaning SEX- and being concerned to the point that if you cut him off because you reject his romantic advances that you have literal concern about violence and that you will struggle on some level, is not the same thing as choosing to participate in society that we have in place. Say what you want about patriarchy, but the two aren't the exact same thing, and what I mean is that you can be WGTOW in our (presumptually assuming that you are US or western in general) culture because of the rules we have in place for our game, much more so than women do in other parts of the globe. There are no written laws in our society that bar women from being independent and legitimately going their own way- it is easier to follow the herd, but it is not impossible or beyond difficult, like it used to be.

That is not the same thing as going to a butcher because you do not want to hunt and slaughter your own game, or having a plumber to fix your toilet or sink because you just simply don't know the skills- and no one person can be a master of all skills, even though they might be a jack of all trades, you will at some point need assitance from your fellow human, man or woman, unless you are a legit hermit in the woods or far out in the country completely alone that may even die a premature death because of isolation. Actually, I see no reason why a strong female friendship that is mutually beneficial could not be formed and cohabitate.

None of these professions are specific to men- they may be highly populated by them, but women are not excluded from really any profession or trade at this point... that is different than an individual man in your life specifically giving _you_ material assistance because you have a disability that makes life more difficult than the average person, and especially because you are in a vulnerable position because of said support, which is the aspect that is putting you at real risk for emotional blackmail or potential physical violence if he is rejected and takes it too far.",,,1620088885,{},gwun98z,False,t3_n3d0w2,False,True,t1_gwudsss,/r/wgtow/comments/n3d0w2/male_friend_obsessing_over_me_despite_me_telling/gwun98z/,1620126988.0,2,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I learned to get over the fear of dying alone by thinking of all the cool shit I would do. I‚Äôm going to learn to fish, fight, paint, make diy projects travel to wherever the fuck I want, eat healthy, go to the beach, learn a new language, study things that I care about, read, possibly start my own business. Sure it gets lonely sometime because I wish that I had someone to share my viewpoint with but then I realized that people are work. When you get involved with people, your freedom becomes more limited. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm extra picky on being alone. I have a whole lot of shit I want to do and if I don‚Äôt get to do it, I‚Äôm okay with that because I like my company. I‚Äôm comfortable being alone in a room of silence. I feel peaceful. I have more energy to do the things I want when I‚Äôm alone because no one is there to suck the energy out of me.

Also, this may sound morbid/strange, but I imagine myself dying alone at old age. It doesn‚Äôt seem so bad because I‚Äôm already used to being alone so I know what it feels like. Besides, if other people are there while I‚Äôm dying, it‚Äôll straight up annoy me lol. I guess I‚Äôm just extremely introverted.

Nah, we're oppressed because 'they' want us to have babies. Take a look at what the Chinese govt is doing right now which is censoring feminists telling women not to have children or the countries with abortion bans or the ones chopping off 800 girls clits per day, marrying them off to grown men and saying you aren't a real woman without having children. The capitalists need their labor class. Anti natalistists are very rare and seen as crazy, it's definitely not what the majority wants even though the result is sparring children from forcing them to experience pain, suffering and inevitable death they didn't ask for. 

&gt;humans are in between beasts and gods - enough to have existential angst but not enough to do anything about it.

For a brief period of my childhood, I remember her ""going on strike"". She said no one appreciated her, and would yell at our teachers if they called her. She'd say, ""LOSE MY NUMBER! I WROTE THEIR FATHER'S NAME ON THE SLIP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR! CALL HIM! I WORK TOO!"" At parent teacher conference, my female teachers nodded sympathetically like they knew exactly what she was going through. I didn't know then, but I know now. We really didn't appreciate her, and she's gone now. My dad is dating again, and I'm sure he realizes at this point that he will never find another woman like my mom, because the stuff that woman did to take care of us and keep everyone happy WA ridiculous! Like, I remember being 3 and waking up in the middle of the night hungry. I could ask her to cook whatever I wanted, and she would prepare the whole meal in the kitchen for me!!! At 2am! For a 3 year old!

There's no way I would be making chicken strips, mashed potatoes, and pink lemonade in the middle of the night. I would hand that child a slice of bread and some water, and send them back to bed! She was on a different level. Just another reason why I don't feel that marriage and motherhood are right for me.

And true, she did seem like she wanted to validate her decision to marry or something. I've been seeing this often. Some women have been telling me how marriage isn't all its cracked up to be, and I shouldn't expect certain things; but I know they're only saying that because their own marriages are awful. They rushed into it with a gut they barely knew, they married someone who was abusive even though they knew he wouldn't change, etc etc, so they tell other women not to hope for a good marriage and that it's all about struggling, and that's real love.

I don't know if she's a holier-than-thou-type, but she has constantly made assumptions about my sinfulness and given me unsolicited advice to fix myself. I'm not even sure where some of her assumptions come from half the time, but she seems to think she's doing an act of charity by lecturing me on my imaginary faults.",,,1620867123,{},gxxa80n,True,t3_nb21gr,False,True,t1_gxx4uhm,/r/wgtow/comments/nb21gr/why_do_people_assume_that_if_you_dont_want_to/gxxa80n/,1620911878.0,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes. I absolutely agree. If anyone should be put up on a pedestal it is women.

I clearly stated my reasons for wanting to be a nun: wanting to marry Jesus, wanting to live in a monastery where the Blessed Sacrament is, being able to focus my life on prayer and studying theology, being able to work on arts and live in a community of sisters (the monastery I chose has nuns who are really artistically talented and make all kinds of religious arts and crafts), wanting to give my life wholly to God, not wanting to worry about worldly things anymore (life is simpler when you garden, raise livestock, and have less material things due to vows of poverty).

However, I did mention that I think I'm not cut out for being a wife or mother. I don't want to screw up a child, and I see how serious a calling marriage and child rearing is. I don't think it's a light job at all. Also, I don't think I could handle the pain of giving birth, and that terrifies me. Much more frankly, I only want marriage for sex, and that's not a good reason to go into it.

She told me that my reasons for not wanting to get married were ""bad reasons"" and that these were ""hangups"" I needed to get over, or I was choosing to be a nun out of fear and duress. 

I told her she came off very rude, and that my reasons for not wanting marriage were absolutely good reasons. I also told her that she seemed elitist about marriage, like every woman who chose not to marry was wasting her life, had something wrong with her, or hated men (she's accused me before of having issues with men, which I don't). We're kind of not talking at this point. I feel that I may have been too harsh, but I got really fed up with her.

Oh, about the flower thing. St. Therese sometimes sends people flowers when they ask her intercession. A guy who was discerning if he should be a priest or married, asked for a white rose if he should be celibate and a red rose if he should marry. He got a white rose with an invitation for a wedding in the mail, and took it as a sign. I prayed a similar prayer, and got a red rose; but it was in a way that I couldn't discern if it was a sure sign or not; so I asked for prayer about it.

The good thing that came out of the woman's comment was that it solidified my decision to stay single and/or be a nun. Even if I don't become a nun, I still want to stay single and not get married.

Becoming Catholic, I've found the faith to be very in favor of non-marriage/celibacy in a way that the non-religious world and Protestantism aren't.

Catholicism has ceremonies for ""consecrated virgins"" and of course nuns and sisters who never get married. Consecrated virgins are different in that they can still live in the world without marriage. They are married to Jesus, but don't live in a convent and don't have to take vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

Being a consecrated virgin isn't absolutely necessary though. You could just be a woman who decides not to marry or join religious life and I think that will be well understood. If anyone gives you flack about it, you could point out the fact that Jesus said it's literally better to stay single than to get married.

&gt; The disciples said to him, ‚ÄúIf such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.‚Äù But he said to them, ‚ÄúNot everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.  For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.‚Äù (Matthew 19:10‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨12)

Remaining single, according to Jesus, is preferential; but most people don't like the thought of being single forever. I think Catholics generally see the choice to remain unmarried as a noble thing.

Most Protestants are a different story. By the age of 19, it was like people were constantly trying to marry me off, and asking me why I'm not dating. I think at the ripe age of 26, now, (not dating or married) people assume I'm a hussy or a lesbian. Clearly, I must be up to no good, sleeping around with men from sex apps, and that's why I haven't settled down yet.

The secular, non-religious world pities me as sad, selfish, or man-hating (I'm not). They think I will regret my decision when I'm ""old and ugly"", and I'll be miserable because no one will want me then.

So yeah, I think Catholics have a better view on wgtow than most religious or non-religious groups, but it really depends on the faith and the people.

Traditional Pagan religions were more woman friendly. Look at Norse Mythology. Everyone knows of Odin and Valhalla. Then there are the Valkries (beautiful objectives women who help pick the soldiers to go to Valhalla). 

But a lot of people don't know about Freya. She is not of the same race as Odin and comes from a magical race. SHE hand picks soldiers FIRST to go to her domain known as Folkvang. Going to Folkvang is more prestigious than Valhalla but everyone thinks Valhalla is the absolute Hall of Honor. Nope. 

Women of Scandanavia could own land and other forms of property. They could essentially come and go as they pleased unlike the women of Greek culture who basically had to get permission from their husbands to do so. 

Ancient Egypt had certain Temples that were runned by all women. I can't remember where in Egypt, but Hathor had a temple with all women priestess. A.E was also the first culture to allow/ accept gay marriage and the first homosexual marriage was a lesbian couple. One of the Goddesses, Isis, has a story of being so clever, so tricked Ra (sometimes seen as the ""All-Father"") to give her some of his power, thus in turn making her [more powerful] one of the most powerful Netjeru (Gods). She had a massive following and still does to this day.  A.E women could own property as well. 

I also think Taosim is women friendly. It is like Buddhism but embraces worldly things. Be in connection with all and have peace with all. ""Be like water""  while Buddhism restricts all worldly things to achieve ""Enlightment.""

I think the answer is pretty obvious, but uncomfortable. Independent creatures can make their own decisions, objects or things to possess are supposed to do what they're told. Why do you think people get so angry when their computer, car, television, phone, etc, breaks or doesn't do exactly what they want in that moment. The woman is usually has her career end or suffer, she is the one who usually uproots her whole life if her man gets a job and wants to relocate the family, she has 100% of the reproductive labor and has the damn kid attached to her for nourishment for up to like two years, typically. Men made marriage- public prostitute or private prostitute, that is absolutely the historical purpose up until like five minutes ago. Marrying for romantic love is extremely recent, as far as the human timeline for its existence is concerned. How do we even know that men and women truly see marriage the same? Globally, the perspectives and incentives are very, very different, and western women have the privilege to have the choice to both marry and to marry for love.

You are supposed to have your life male (and [nuclear] family) centered, your career, education, and travel are the garnish on top that makes you more appealing.

I just looked into the context of this quote because I thought I missed something:

Pillow Talk (1959) sounds like an absolutely awful movie that glorifies rape culture. Two men objectify and compete over a single career woman to make her give up her life, career, and goals. The douche-bag womanizer neighbour she hates pretends to be someone else to seduce her. He manipulates to get her consent. That's a horror movie to me!  

This quote is from the womanizer chatting up a woman on an old party line phone system. The career woman and her friend (Jan and Alma) overhear it and discuss it. The friend with internalized sexist views agrees and also starts pressuring the career woman to get a man. The whole plot of the movie is based on the lead female character being too beautiful to be allowed to stay single and focus on her interior design career. 

Thelma Ritter is the actress who plays the friend and delivers the line in the movie. It's not actually something she said as a real person.

and then in other disenfranchised communities especially or in particular the black community in the us (but can be expanded to others that's just where it's the most pronounced - also to a certain extent the latino community i've noticed albeit not as much) the men don't have the resources to provide that 'patriarchal bargain' with so those women become more independent head of household etc. i did also learn about the smaller amount of black women going the other direction with the divestment/swirler movement (which i know are different things but overlap) but it seems most are going the way in which you say. but i find it interesting that there is this subset of woc/bw in particular now who are going the opposite direction and basically wanting patriarchy perhaps because they didn't experience it from their own group in the way they felt like other women have.  

so long story short i think the reason why they didn't follow was because the 'bargain' was good enough for them and now it's not, or they are realizing it never was to begin with. but i actually think it's more because it's just not good enough anymore because there are a lot of women out there who would sign up for it if they got xyz requirements met, hence also why other women are jumping ship to other social groups i have even seen many say they would only do so if higher xyz requirements were met things that they would not require from their own group (usually in terms of resources money etc.)

Normally in order to be resident in a foreign country, you need to have a job. And it‚Äôs better to find the job before you move, however the challenges most people won‚Äôt hire unless you live there.

So you can either move there and stay on your tourist visa and look for a job, or‚Ä¶

You could go to university in the country, and look for a job, so that when university ends you can switch your visa over to a work visa. 

It‚Äôs really hard to move to a foreign country, especially with their residency requirements. Yet if you do it under the University, it would be easier. You‚Äôll just need to check to see how you turn a student visa into a proper work visa so you can maintain residency.

Also check out how long residency requirements are. Many countries state that you are a temporary resident for a certain amount of years‚Ä¶ Yet if you live there long enough, become a permanent resident. Which means in most countries you don‚Äôt need to have a job in order to stay. So if you lose your job, you can stay.

Also check and see what the language requirements are, as well as how long you need to live there before you can apply for citizenship. And double check and make sure that they allow dual citizenship, that is if you want to maintain your current citizenship. 

For example, to live in Spain, you need to have a job. You could also look and see if you can go there and start your own company, but note that the Spanish job market is shit at the moment. As a US citizen, you can live in Spain for six years, and then after that you have a permanent residency card which means you don‚Äôt need a job to stay. And at the 10 year mark you can apply for the Spanish passport, and they do recognize dual citizenship

Every woman has gone through this, especially if she's in a male-dominated field or is unmarried without children.  I have even seen it on this sub.

[],,nanofarm,,,[],,,,text,t2_5dh5p,False,False,[],"One thing stood out in your post: you feel like you can‚Äôt love yourself because you have *never experienced love* 

So: you know from experience that looking for love outside yourself hasn‚Äôt yielded results. Maybe it‚Äôs time to start looking inside yourself. 

Imagine how you would feel if someone loved you: what would that look and feel like? Get specific and write it down. What parts of you would you get to be ok with? What would you get to think and feel? What would it ‚Äúfix‚Äù? Spend time really getting it all out. Spin the entire fantasy. You will probably cry, that‚Äôs ok. 

Now, what is stopping you from feeling this way now? Why do you need someone else to give you permission? What if you could think and feel all of those good things with or without someone else? 


You may need to go neutral at first because you will resist the idea that you are lovable. Forcing yourself to think positive thoughts that you don‚Äôt yet believe is not really helpful. So make a list if the things that you don‚Äôt dislike about yourself and move up from there. 
Start from compassion, can you have the same care and compassion for yourself that you would for someone else? Can you forgive yourself for not being (insert whatever is bothering you)? 

As a side note: it is very hard to recognize or receive love (romantic or otherwise) when you don‚Äôt love yourself. It causes cognitive dissonance which your brain hates so it will find ways to discount and disregard any love you have received. So you may have been more loved than you realized in the past. 

Do some thought exercises. Are you sure you have never been loved? By family? Friends? No one has even loved a part of you? Right now your brain can only find evidence that you are not loved. Give your brain the assignment of finding evidence that you are lovable. Brains are very good at finding evidence, so you have to decide where you want to direct that. 

For example: my coworkers don‚Äôt love me in a traditional sense but I know that they love having me as a coworker and admire my many good qualities. I‚Äôm able to see that because I also love those things about me. And here‚Äôs the cool thing: I only *think* they think those things because I believe it. Maybe they secretly hate me, I have no idea. My own mother could despise me and I would never be able to know for sure. 

On the other side: I married and had a baby with a man I was sure loved me. Turns out he and I had different definitions of love. He doesn‚Äôt think he lied but he didn‚Äôt love me the way I thought he did. We had different thoughts/ideas about love. I‚Äôll never know for sure what he felt for me but i didn‚Äôt like how he treated me so I left. I felt very betrayed for a long time because I thought he cared for me. But I couldn‚Äôt feel what he was feeling, i only had my perceptions. 

This is where things start to get metaphysical and confusing but it‚Äôs not as depressing as it seems! Love is a feeling that your thoughts create inside of you. That‚Äôs all it is. It doesn‚Äôt cost anything to feel love for someone- in fact it feels wonderful to love someone- the love I feel for my daughter is the most amazing thing in the world. You can feel that same love for yourself. 

Love is a feeling that only you can feel- you can‚Äôt feel it for someone else or make them feel it for you. The experience of love comes ONLY from your thoughts about yourself and the other person. It isn‚Äôt a sensation like hot or cold, it‚Äôs an emotion which comes from your brain.

[],,[deleted],,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"You‚Äôve been brainwashed to think that romantic love is necessary for happiness. Romantic love is a social construct and really didn‚Äôt even exist in people‚Äôs consciousness until the medieval idea of courtship. Even then, most people were married to further their families wealth or bloodline, while the poor women were often given away by their fathers and were left abused, raped, and often dead after their 12th child. 

IMO the notion of ‚Äútrue love‚Äù is as big a lie, and perhaps even more insidious, than the lie of religion. Actually, they are likely one and the same. As religion has gone down, the notion of true love and your one and only has been on the rise. How else would they get women to marry men despite all of the risks/health problems/reduced life expectancy/reduced wealth that comes with it? All of those things are statistically proven.

Religion is very hard to give up. People don‚Äôt just become atheists. There is a lot of back and forth, wavering, wanting to go back, missing the delusion. I say this as someone who used to be religious. It‚Äôs the same thing. It‚Äôs really, really hard. But you need to root yourself in reality.

Yes, there may be a man who improves your life, but it isn‚Äôt because of true love. It‚Äôs because he brings companionship, security, etc and the ‚Äúnegative‚Äù is outweighed by the positive. It would be equivalent for someone who knows god isn‚Äôt real to join a church for social and philanthropic reasons. 

For me, this will likely never be the case because the trauma I‚Äôve experienced at the hands of men.

Men who are attracted to young girls know they should be ashamed of being attracted to children so they spin the narrative to make it that older women are ""unattractive"" or ""undesirable"" but the reality is they are disgusting perverts.

Also when women get older and smarter they are less likely to put up with* the usual crap men dish out. These men know a real adult woman won't put up with they're shit unless hey first tear them down and destroy their self esteem. It's gross and you should completely ignore men like that. 

As to women who are victimized by the patriarchy and perpetuate these lies about women's aging I try to gently question them about it. For example my Mom always said that men age better than women and I just said to her, 'then why are there so many attractive older actresses while old male actors mostly look disgusting and decrepit? I think that women age better because they actually put care into their skin and hair and bodies where as men never even put on sunscreen because that might make them gay.' I could see her considering it and she's never said it again.

In the early/mid 2000s, she was happily single and living in the Bay area, but traveling around, doing Quirkyalone seminars, events, etc, re-editing the book with more info to distribute updated versions, updating the Quirkyalone website, etc.  About 5-6 years ago, she moved to South America because she got really into tango dancing.  She liked the way tango teaches you to use your body in confident ways - to move with open arms, open chest, head up, looking people in the eye, so it was not only for dance purposes, but to work on building her confidence and self esteem in physical ways.

While she was in South America, she started keeping a sort of personal/public blog that detailed her tango experience, not just learning to dance, but how it helped her personally, and also continued living Quirkyalone as a personal example and sharing it on her blog.  She also started giving online classes and personal sessions about what she called ""pussy walking,"" I believe.  I don't recall if that's the correct term, but I think it was something like that.

""Pussy walking"" came from her tango experience.  Cagen took the tango walk step and turned it into a walking gait - shoulders up, chest open, head high, and moving forward with your hips, using your hips and center of your body as your place of power, energy and confidence when you're walking.  Walking without projecting any shame.  Like tango, she found this helped her develop physical confidence and she started sharing it with other women so they could develop their own physical confidence.

Late last year, with COVID stuff going on, she finally left South America and returned to the northeastern US, where she grew up.   I don't think she's as actively involved in tango stuff any more and has curtailed her outreach stuff with her blog and the ""pussy walking"" classes and videos for now, but I think you can still find some of them on Youtube.  The move back to the US forced her to restructure her life a little, so she's been working on that.

When I was unemployed I always found my jobs alone (my brother for example, needed my mom to talk with some neighboors to help him find two jobs he had), I moved to a new city alone and took care of all the process of finding a house there and finding a way to move my stuff.

It was a process, a couple of years ago I was craving men attention because I never had. I was bullyed growing up, I thought I was so ugly, so having some male attention helped me understand that that's not the case. So then after a while, I slowed down in seeking male attention and entered a phase where I wanted someone to have a long lasting stable relationship that cared about me.

It took a few experiences to realize that that's probably not going to happen.

Trigger warning: animals as food




AND I also spent a fortune on frozen rats. I also found out how crappy of a life feeder rats had before they were frozen, and that made me sad. So I built a rat colony. All the moms and dads were tame pets and the others had a very happy life with lots of room to play and enrichment and fresh veggies. I humanely euthanized them with CO2 (they just get sleepy and relaxed) then my snakes get healthy food that had a good life and I get lots of pet rats. Any excess feeders get tamed and played with and given to niblings and neighbors who want pets or if I get a big surplus I can sell them on Craigslist to help pay for food and toys. 

So you know where my heart is, I used to work in the food industry and now refuse to be a part of that system. I have chickens for eggs and meat as well as dairy goats. They all live glorious happy lives, even the ones that I peacefully and humanely butcher for food. I rarely eat meat and only if sustainably grown. I felt like the same should apply to the feeder animals for my reptiles. Rats are so intelligent and social, being farmed in battery cages in sterile rooms just doesn‚Äôt seem right.

[],,Ruby_5lipper,,,[],,,,text,t2_4u2z9avp,False,False,[],"To a certain extent, I think my answer would be yes, although my toxic family wasn't the only reason I've made the life choices I've made and reached the conclusions I've reached.

My mom was the biggest cause of toxicity in my family of origin.  She had untreated borderline personality disorder which often seems very similar to narcissism, but doesn't always have the same severity of symptoms.  That's not to say people with BPD can't be extremely toxic and divisive, because they can and my mom certainly was.  It's just a slightly different set of symptoms and diagnosis than narcissism.

My mom also came with a hefty set of other issues, too - racism, homophobia, blind political conservatism and generic ""xstian values.""  She also had dry drunk behavior, which is when you adopt the behaviors of an alcoholic, but you're not drunk.  My grandfather (who I never knew, had died long before I was in the picture) was an alcoholic and my mom witnessed and experienced his volatility when he drank.  Growing up in that environment, my mom didn't realize she was absorbing his behaviors and later repeating them as an adult in her own life.  Just without the alcohol.  She could fly into an unexpected rage at the drop of a hat, suddenly become physically violent - throw things, slap, push or punch me.

Growing up with her, I got familiar with the signs pretty quickly and could usually tell when she was about to flip into a rage.  It would usually start with verbal bullying and abuse, which was her usual method of expressing rage, degrading us and keeping us under her control.  And as her verbal invective got more severe, the physical violence usually followed.  Sometimes, though, it would show up completely unexpectedly and I'd get a backhand slap across the face completely out of nowhere, or she'd suddenly grab a cup, a book or whatever was in her reach and throw it in my general direction.

We never knew when her volatility would show up and it was often not very far from the surface.  And I believe it was my experience growing up in that kind of environment that was one of the main reasons I have avoided creating any kind of familial relationships for myself.  I'm 52, single, unmarried, no kids, and just don't want to deal with the drama.

Some of that is not for lack of trying.  I did try for many years to find a partner and create a loving partner relationship for myself.  And while I've had a few relationships over the years, nothing has lasted, they've all been unsustainable for one reason or another, and the dating scene has never proved fruitful for me.  I've long since given up looking and have no desire any more to tolerate all the b.s. of the dating scene.

My decision to remain childfree wasn't completely due to my family of origin, either.  While my past experiences definitely play a part, I'm also self-aware enough to recognize that decision was mostly made on my own, and has most likely always been part of my personality.  I never liked playing with dolls when I was a kid, and found baby dolls especially creepy.  My mom loved them and always tried to convince me to like them when I was young, but they always creeped me out.  I look back on that now and realize it was a pretty clear sign that having kids was never going to be part of my future, and that came long before my mom's toxicity became a regular touchstone in my life.",,,1624935856,{},h3ed94y,False,t3_o9wxq8,False,False,t3_o9wxq8,/r/wgtow/comments/o9wxq8/how_many_of_you_dont_have_close_relationships/h3ed94y/,1625194497.0,6,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is easier for them to get what they want from us because we are older and more mature and know what we want from them (usually good sex and some fun companionship) and don't play games. It's a casual relationship based on fun and not drama. I'm not saying that some don't end up long-term or bring drama, but that often isn't the goal.

We've all been (or are) young women so we know that a traditional relationship can bring drama, games and hurt feelings, etc. Why? Usually, one person wants more of something from the other that the other isn't willing to give.

As for older men/older women relationships, I think some men avoid a relationship with older women their age because we are more mature than younger women and less likely to take any drama, etc. We know what we want and what we don't want. We are independent and have higher expectations and don't have to compromise our values, etc. if we don't want to.

It's also good to be conscious of the fact that random thoughts do not necessarily represent who you are as a person, or even your wants or needs. E.g. many people have thoughts like ""what if I just move the steering wheel a little and crash into that truck"" while driving on the highway. Those are completely normal and most people don't *really* want to crash into the truck. In fact, there are theories that many mental illnesses are based on taking one's own thoughts too seriously.

when it comes time to twist it in to place you need good grip and upper body strength *OR* you could outsmart gravity with the jack from your car.

Here‚Äôs what I did- there is a thick rubber gasket between the disposal and the sink so I put a bottle jack under there and a piece of wood to distribute the force and jacked it up juuuust enough to compress the gasket, then I could twist it into the lock position with both hands. Much easier! I undid all of it and did it again with little jack out of my car and it worked just as well.

Example: just the other day, I was driving out of a parking lot and got cut off near the exit by a guy in his car.  My car window was open, so I yelled ""hey!"" at the guy for cutting me off.  His window was open, too, so he responded with ""shut the f\*ck up, fat bitch!""  Had I been thin, do you think he would have yelled, ""shut the f\*ck up, skinny bitch"" at me?  No, I don't think he would.  He went for the obvious 'slur' (aside from 'bitch') that he thought would hurt me, which is commenting on my weight.

[],,Ruby_5lipper,,,[],,,,text,t2_4u2z9avp,False,False,[],"I'm curious to know how ""your family made you overweight and unattractive on purpose.""  I'm not sure what you mean by that.

I'm a fat woman and a size activist so this statement worries me for several reasons.  Firstly, ""overweight"" is not a positive term to a size activist.  Over *what* weight?  The prefix ""over"" implies that there's an ideal weight everyone ""should"" maintain, and that's b.s.  Everyone has value, is valid, is socially acceptable, no matter how much they weigh.  So the fact that you use terms like ""overweight"" and ""unattractive"" to describe your appearance suggests to me that the male gaze is deeply entrenched in your own thought process about your own appearance, as much as you might want to get away from it.

The first step in ridding the patriarchy from your life is to rid it from your own internal dialog first, and it seems like you haven't done that.  You won't be able to get away from the male gaze until you deprogram yourself from it.  And the first steps are understanding why using terms like ""overweight"" and describing your appearance as ""unattractive"" are deeply toxic and unhelpful to you in accomplishing your goal.

My strong recommendation would be to start educating yourself on size activism (i.e., radical fat activism) and radical feminism in relation to fat activism ASAP.  Books to read: Two Whole Cakes; Lessons From the Fat-o-Sphere; Landwhale; many, many others, but those are a good start.  Most of the authors of those books - Lesley Kinzel, Marianne Kirby, Kate Harding - used to have wonderful size acceptance blogs.  But they stopped writing them a few years ago to make room for other voices in the size acceptance community.  Jes Baker, author of Landwhale, still has a great size acceptance blog, The Militant Baker, worth checking out.  But there are plenty of other resources online, blogs and articles to read, videos to check out... so many discoveries for you to make on your journey of size acceptance, should you decide to make it and use it as the roadmap to help rid yourself of your own deeply entrenched patriarchal views of how women are ""supposed to"" look, how much we're ""supposed to"" weigh, what kind of appearance we're ""supposed to"" maintain.

Should you choose to take that journey, I'll give you 2 guideposts that will hopefully help along the way.  1) The point of the journey is not ""self love.""  The point of the journey is self acceptance and tolerance.  You're very right about 1 thing - fat hate and fear is deeply entrenched in our popular media, in the medical and weight loss industries, and in so much of society.  Your own fat fear of your appearance does not just come from within, but from almost everything else we encounter in the world.  And until that changes (which seems unlikely in our lifetime), learning to accept your fat self in a world that's been taught for years to hate and fear fat people, is a daily journey that never ends.  We'll never reach a point where we can say to ourselves, ""I love myself completely now! I'll never hate my appearance again!""  That just doesn't happen.  The world, in all it's fat-hating fear, will inject itself in our lives and continue to create hurdles that we must struggle over every day.

But if you work on acceptance and tolerance, which includes deprogramming yourself of your own patriarchal views on women's appearance, that journey can get a little easier over time.  Those negative self-talk voices we've all learned that tell us to hate ourselves, hate our appearances, can get quieter over time.  We can learn to be gentler on ourselves.  I've been on that journey for nearly 20 years and it's taken me nearly 18 of them to finally start to get there.  But I speak from experience when I say it *is* possible.  I've seen the difference within myself.

The second guidepost is this: 2) Get rid of the idea that ""no one will ever love you until you love yourself.""  This connects to the first guidepost - the point of the journey is not ""self love.""  The point of the journey is self acceptance and tolerance.  Those things are NOT self love.  ""Self love"" is a construct created by our patriarchal society to teach us to comply with our oppressors.  To clarify... EVERYONE is deserving of love, respect and value, regardless of how they feel about themselves.  You're deserving of love, respect and value whether you love yourself or not.  Telling people that ""no one will ever love you until you love yourself"" is essentially telling them that they're responsible for their own oppression.  It's blaming them for systemic oppression.  If you're a fat person living in a world of patriarchally guided fat hate and fear, you struggle every day with that systemic oppression just to achieve self acceptance.  So, no, you DON'T need to ""love yourself"" to be deserving of love, respect and humane treatment from anyone else on the planet.  The assumption that you do is just so much b.s.

Lastly, I'll address my concerns about your statement that your family ""made you overweight and unattractive.""  There's a lot of psychological baggage in that statement that needs to be unpacked, but I'll speak from my experience as a fat person with some similar baggage and try to debunk some of it.

From about age 12 or 13, my mother subtly encouraged me to eat and, like you, I could say she was at fault for ""making me fat.""  My mother was very overprotective, particularly when it was time for me to start having an interest in boys and to start dating.  If she could have prevented those things from happening, she would have.  Since she couldn't, she subtly encouraged me to eat, knowing that if I had a fatter body, it would make me less attractive to boys.

However, that's not the only reason I'm fat.  I can't completely blame my mom's overprotective and unhealthy parenting style for that.  I can, however, blame her genes.  My mom's fat, too.  Her mom was fat; her mom's mom was fat.  We come from a long line of fat bodied women.  *THAT's* why I'm fat.  Not because my mom encouraged me to eat when I was younger, but because I would have developed a fat body whether she'd done that or not.  It's in my genes.  I couldn't escape it.

Maybe that's not your story, though.  Maybe, unlike me, you don't have a history of fat genes in your family.  Maybe your parents encouraged you to eat and that's a big part of the reason why you gained weight.  Regardless, your parents are not entirely responsible for it and for why you dislike your appearance.  Continuing to blame them takes the focus off your own internalization of patriarchal standards, the male gaze.  And that's really where you need to be looking if you're truly sincere about getting away from the male gaze.

Start with your internalized patriarchal standards first, work on unlearning those, deprogramming yourself, start working on self acceptance and tolerance and learning about size acceptance with a hefty dose of radical (and intersectional) feminism, and you'll be heading in the right direction.",,,1625552986,{},h47m9r0,False,t3_oeg74w,False,True,t3_oeg74w,/r/wgtow/comments/oeg74w/before_i_go_full_on_wgtow_i_want_to_consume/h47m9r0/,1625760177.0,1,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How about we stop speaking for all women? Nobody is saying that societal pressure has nothing to do with women's choices. Are there many women who think they do things of their own free will, but are really operating on years of negative reinforcement from society? Of course. We all have patriarchal habits we're unlearning, because we've been bombarded with this shit since birth. Everyone here is all too aware of that. But to boldly say *ALL* women who choose to shave, do so because they're subconsciously giving in to that pressure - *especially* saying so in a community of women who are actively going against societal pressures just by being wgtow - is frankly an equally blind stance to take. 

I have sensory sensitivities. I don't enjoy shaving, so I don't shave anywhere close to the frequency that is expected of me as a woman, but at a certain length it rubs too much against my clothing in a way that is deeply uncomfortable and at times even painful. So I still shave my legs every couple months and my pits roughly every week. I also love the feeling of getting into clean sheets and pjs with freshly shaved legs. Not enough to shave more than every couple of months, but I enjoy it when I do it. In the same vein, I'm a very creative person and sometimes put on makeup just for the artistic aspect of it. I'll put it on just to play around with a different medium for a change and then immediately take it off (again, because of my sensory issues, I can't wear it for longer than an hour). If I had only said ""I wear makeup because I like the artistic aspect of it"" most of the people in this thread would probably be thinking ""she's just subconsciously doing it for men""... even though I never even leave the house with it. Yes, the reason I bought the makeup in the first place was due to me bending to societal pressure as a young teen (as most of us once did), but I think most of us here have evolved past doing things just because other people want us to or will shame us for it if we don't. 

Some people are still on that journey and that's okay too. If a woman is denying she does something to cater to the male gaze, she's already subconsciously acknowledged that she doesn't *want* to do it for other people (even if she hasn't fully broken away from those pressures yet). This is a woman that has taken a step away from happily being a slave for men. She will come around with time and confidence and seeing other badass women (like us üòò) model how to live life however they please. 

*Living how you please includes choosing what you do or do not do with your own fucking body.*

The point is, there are reasons for shaving that are not rooted in patriarchy. There are lots of things in life that affect a person's decisions outside of just patriarchy. There are people out there with different circumstances, that you may know nothing about that play into the choices they make (health struggles being an example that is very often overlooked by healthy people). These circumstances are deeply personal and nobody owes you their reasons for choosing something for themselves.

Even if someone is doing it to subconsciously avoid ridicule, that's an equally valid reason to do it. Yes, it sucks. Yes, it's patriarchal. But calling other women brainwashed isn't going to make them more willing to listen to you or feel more open to deprogramming decades of learning The Rules and the consequences of not following them. 

Calling them brainwashed isn't going to make those consequences disappear. 

Please keep an open mind. Singular thinking and disdain for women who don't live exactly the way they think you should is something I expect from men or women on the voldemort sub.

I‚Äôm sure her intentions were good, she wanted me to be confident and happy. For 15+ years I wore a full face of makeup almost every day. Even when i was so overwhelmed studying and working, having 18 hour days. I didn‚Äôt accept the bare-faced person I saw in the mirror - she was too flawed to expose to the world. 

At the beginning of the pandemic I worked from home, rarely left the house, and didn‚Äôt have many video calls. I had no reason to wear makeup. Over the year or so I gradually started to accept my bare face. 

When I got vaccinated and my office resumed in-office work, I decided to not wear makeup. Since I made that choice I LOVE my natural self for the first time in my life. This choice has had a multiplier effect across many areas of my life. Now that I fully accept and respect myself, I am finally able to stop being a doormat and demand respect from others. Now that I‚Äôm not worrying about how I appear to coworkers, I have better focus and confidence in my capabilities and professional aspirations. Now that I have defined what I deserve and what my standards are, I accept that it‚Äôs highly unlikely I‚Äôll find an adequate male partner. I‚Äôm finally content with who I am today, I know I can fulfill all of my needs as an individual. 

I have had zero negative repercussions from not wearing makeup the past few months. No one has said a word about it to me. At work no one has treated me differently at all.

We can see right through the bullshit of religious men, they can do everything right (treat you well) but the misogyny runs deep in their veins. They never fight for the change or rights of women in their religion, they want the benefits of it all. It's very obvious to us, so the minute we leave our community and religion, we try to overcorrect. We fall in the arms of liberal men because even if they don't externally do the right things for us, they are still miles ahead of the religious men. Until we come to realise after being treated like sex objects, that they too are covert misogynists. From most women, we are the ones who get to see both sides distinctly because of the transition and we really get fed up of men. Men lose their appeal to us. We see it for what it is, a losing game. 

Putting all that aside, I still would prefer to live in a non-religious world(secular). Yes they are still mental shackles, but they are there in both the cases.

Actually I have a question I made in AskHistorians and AskFeminists and nobody replied. It was about the relationship between the black people rights movements and feminism and also asking if its typical that civil rights leaders reject the help from whites.

This was based on my observation of Malcom X movement. Obviously nation of Islam was against race integration so naturally they'd refuse a black man to date white women. But then I found an article saying that Malcom X actually mistreated white women (slapping them and stealing money because they could always go ask more to daddy according to him) while never doing that to black women. He took revenge on white women and thought getting a white girl was like a trophy because he'd be ""stealing"" the girl from the white men who for centuries raped black women.

Also then I found another article of a black activist saying he often got the question from whites asking what they could do to help... And according to him it was mostly from white women. I was curious, why mostly women? Do black people consider white women were equally or less guilty for things like slavery and systemic racism? Also Malcom X yelled for the ""death"" of white men. Not sure that includes white women too.  A black activist of my country said something like that recently and everyone was offended but I was like ""weeeellll, he said white men... I am a woman"" lol

I do personally tend to be more complacent with black men because I feel like we both belong to oppressed classes...

(very impotant) If you're working a desk job or have to sit a lot at work, record yourself working while sitting and make corrections to your posture accordingly (did it with my phone or tablet every time for 30 mins). I heard getting lumbar support cushions/ergonomic chairs help a lot but I personally have not used them. 

4. This was pretty difficult for me to implement while in I was working in the office, but I try to go for walks/breaks/stretch my muscles after 30 mins of sitting down. Sitting down continuously for long hours actually strains specific muscles and thus it gets inflamed/achy/painful easily. 

5. Massages. Couldn't afford getting a massage every day so I read up on trigger points and how to effectively massage them. I do this at least once a day targeting problem areas like my neck, chest and back. I usually combine kneading with my hands and leaning against a wall with a lacrosse ball in between.",,,1619770421,{},gweggco,False,t3_kex0dg,False,False,t1_ggcj1hq,/r/wgtow/comments/kex0dg/thursday_self_help_day/gweggco/,1619796315.0,2,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the reasons why all women intentional communities fascinate me is because it gives Americans the opportunity to actually experiment with ways of living and see for themselves what it is that they want to do. Ultimately any and all freedom of Choice greatly increases the ability to make and accept any choice that is made. 

For example, when I talk to Americans who criticize the nuclear family and idealize a more blended family structure, I often ask them if they've read up on the draw-backs that come from THAT structure, which is largely that mother-in-laws RULE and younger women feel absolutely no autonomy to make choices in their children's lives.

I don't particularly think that any structure is perfect, or doesn't have its drawbacks. We need to protect the elderly, but we also need to innovate without the elderly burdening us with tradition. We need to protect children, but we also have to let go and accept when children make decisions that we don't agree with. We have to be caregivers, but care giving doesn't pay the bills. We all want the five current generations to be treated with equal dignity without sacrificing any of our self-respect.

[],,MedievalMadeliene,,,[],,,,text,t2_7q1kou4u,False,False,[],"Feminism has taken a huge backslide due to third and fourth wave feminism thinking the game had already been won. Now, radical feminists who follow second wave feminism focus on the wrong things as well and seem to have been co-opted by the right. Not ALL but quite a number of radical feminists--which are the only ones willing to still aggressively fight for women's rights--align themselves with right-wing association out of mutual hatred of ""Trans"" people.  


So who is left fighting against men? No one, really. Third and fourth wave feminists spend most of their time trying to educate and coddle men and do the emotional work of healing them from ""toxic masculinity"". Radical feminists show a lot of promise, but get side tracked by ideological hatred of gender situation to the point where they will sometimes SIDE with conservatives--which is fucking mind-blowing to me. 

I believe all of these movement have been co-opted--by men. Liberal men who see third and fourth wave feminism as  a way to refocus women's energy on men and reframing objectification as empowering, and hardly focus on women's issues at all. And then conservative right-wing men who find their way into radical feminist groups and redirect what was originally nuanced conversations about the current state of gender ideology to turn it into outright hatred and bigotry--and they use radical feminists to add legitimacy to their hatred of trans people.   


The latter really disappoints me. Where is the focus on MEN AS A CLASS? radical feminism flirts with it, but ultimately always goes back to freaking out about trans people. Even if their criticism is valid, trans people hold very little power and make up a small percentage of men at large. Why are they not focusing on MEN IN POWER--such as Greg Abbott as well as all of the other conservative politicians and their lobbyists who are now pushing our rights BACKWARDS?   


The problem with feminism has always been that men will find a way to co-opt it and direct it to do their will. Women have been too easily swayed by men's direction in their own movements. For instance, radical feminist groups that I was a part of would \*claim\* to be against all male allies, yet they would allow traditional, conservative men SIMPLY because those men questioned trans issues.

[],,mdiver12,,,[],,,,text,t2_etnmf,False,False,[],"I've lived in and done work for these communities, specifically in S. Oregon. Fly Away Home is beautiful and has two residents, but they are both incredibly stubborn and I imagine hard to live with, at times. I spent time working there and those two are so set in their ways it can be exhausting. They bought the land as romantic partners, split up shortly after, and have lived there together since the late 70s. They still bicker like they broke up yesterday.  However, I did have the wonderful experience of hiking through the mountains with a 71 year old woman who periodically needed to stop and push her uterus back in. The water line for FAH snakes through the siskiyou mountains about two miles to a spring box they share with neighbors. When it's dry, bears and other animals bite through the line hunting for water. Side note, it gets super dry in S. Oregon so they do this multiple times per summer. Men haven't been on their land in decades. 

The land I lived on was near Grants Pass and Rootworks (but wasn't Rootworks. I do have friends who lived there with Mountaingrove, though) and we ran the production offices for We'Moon out of our main house. We'Moon employed most of the women who lived there, and connected those who didn't work for them to a larger local community. It wasn't quite as strict as FAH when it came to men on the land- we have a good drag queen friend who visited frequently and also had men who were friends visit, though they were few and far between. 

I was able to easily support myself doing odd jobs for other women and lesbians (in particular) in the area. Unfortunately, the location makes it less than friendly to BIPOC. The lack of diversity is noticeable and feels VERY encouraged. It's one reason among many that my wife and I chose to leave the area. 

We still talk about buying a big piece of land and building homes on each corner of it, with a community home in the center. I think the younger generation of women values community, but also has a much stronger need for independence and solitude. Sometimes you don't want to talk about your feelings at the required weekly meeting, but that doesn't mean you're turning your back on your landmates. We've also been conditioned as women to hide our feelings, and that can lead to a whole lot of passive aggressive behavior when living in community. Think someone uses too many dishes when they cook? Let's vote to change the rules about who does dishes when that person cooks because I don't like getting my hands pruny. Have an opinion about how the shower curtain should hang after someone showers? Put it on the weekly meeting agenda, right after ""who ate my raw cashews and spirulina?""

In response to your comments about what I can take from people's responses to my post... I'm noticing that none of the people who responded negatively on this post responded on yours **at all**. In my experience, people who jump to be negative but say nothing when its their chance to be positive aren't the kind of people I can gleam any constructive criticism from.

From you, however, I can at least understand your intent because you are putting ideas out there... This is my introduction post where I am talking about who I am and why I want to talk to others... If the way I introduce myself comes off as self-centered, perhaps you could link me to an example of an introduction post that you didn't think was self-centered?

Lastly, as far as not vibing with the WGTOW culture because I want to speak privately with people.... Well, that IS my intention, I can't really help that, and if this group prefers all conversations to be held in public, that's not really something I would be able to gleam from just lurking.

[],,immortallogic,,,[],,,,text,t2_5n7jousc,False,True,[],"Lol I hear you, but this story should make you feel better about yourself and all the bullets you're dodging by pursuing this lifestyle. 

I'd suggest maybe getting off social media, especially if you're at the age when many of your acquaintances are getting married/having kids, and if you feel like it may have an impact on how you feel about yourself (although your stance seems very strong, it can be easy to see all these pictures that feed into the traditional societal narrative and think very briefly ""damn, am I f'ng up?""). The answer is, no, you're not. 

If you're looking for some words of support/validation here they are: you are literally making one of the best decisions a woman can make. To decide to be unencumbered by the traditional tropes that very often pull women down (marriage/kids), is one of the most liberating things you can do. The road will be lonely at times, but the satisfaction of knowing that you won't have to put up with a ton of bs that comes with the normal narrative and that you'll have the freedom to do whatever the hell you want with few strings, is incredibly powerful. If you want some quotes:

To live alone is the fate of all great souls  - Schopenhauer

The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself. - Kipling.

The stereotype says that girls who are virgins in that age is because they had some sort of sexual trauma (nop never had a sexual trauma, in fact a childhood friend of mine was molested by a family member and she has a LTR stable relationship so definetely not that), are religious (I sympathize with the Communist Party, that'd be an interesting combination lol) or have some sort of disease. I masturbated, I was not religious and never had any sexual trauma. Being a virgin, I felt I'd only attract the religious freaks, guys who like to slut shame women, arabs, and other freaks who want the girl to be a virgin for marriage (nop, not that either I am chilfree and don't believe in the traditional model of family).

So because I didn't like what being a virgin meant, I wanted to lose it. Also to see what's all the fuss about. I met a guy and lost it. I met him a few times in the context of events, we exchanged numbers, texted for a couple of weeks and then had a short weekend thing where I lost it. I didn't see him again after that, he doesn't live in my country, and then he decided to spend time with one of his exes so I told him to fuck off in a very unpolite manner so he blocked me anyway. 

Since then, I never had sex again (3 yrs have passed). I thought that I wanted to. I was chatting with a guy and was excited to meet him when restrictions were lifted, he seemed to be on the same page as me, not very sex driven, chilfree, he said he could live without sex and just wanted to focus on his stuff...that is of course until an available woman moved in to where he was staying. Then he started having sex with her and said that he was actually in love with her, but only told me this after she dumped him. While he was seeing her, he kept chatting with me normally and keeping up the plans to meet and never telling me he was involved with someone else. So I told him to fuck off. If that's what I have to endure to have a sexual partner, then hell no. 


Pre pandemic I used to go to events often, I actually made the first move to ask for number and invite guys I liked. So it's not like I am hiding. But the guys who are interested on me I don't find attractive and the ones I like always have something (either they are commited, or just passing by or not interested).

I am not willing to settle for someone I dislike, my sex libido is not that high, I am chilfree and I am used to being alone, so not very concerned anymore.

I'm sure that husband is a major contributor to the situation, but it is still really important to recognize that a mental health crisis induced by having to be both parents to a high maintenance kid is ultimately still a mental health episode and needs to be treated as such.

If she's stressed enough for her hair to be falling out, then this goes far past ""ugh look at what trash men are"". This woman needs help ASAP. and not to get too dark, but *especially* because shes the primary caregiver to a young child. Unfortunately it's a well known pattern that women will become mentally ill but not receive diagnosis or help because it's always dismissed as stress and it's allowed to exacerbate up until the point she kills her child. It's an invisible epidemic becuase of how taboo it is to discuss infanticide.

My dad is schizoaffective and that sudden strong urge to retreat into the wilderness always coincided with psychosis, during which he would became very erratic and aggressive. And this is a man with male presentation of symptoms -- it's strongly suspected were under diagnosing these types of symptoms in women.  This isn't married life, this is trauma piled on top of trauma sprinkled with physical exhaustion. This goes far past the normal degree of marital stress a woman in a bad marriage would experience. 

It's also the time of year where depression often gives way to energy which leads to violence (it's why were seeing SO MANY shootings. Suicide also spikes in that march-may window). She's consciously thinking about exist strategies.

OP, Im sure you already are, but I would be taking this situation incredibly seriously. She's verbally admitting she wishes she could abandon her child to others, which often means that she's progressed past the point of feeling these things to being *so* entrenched in them that she's not even bothering to hide it (or perhaps doesn't realize it is a major taboo). 

If you can find any kind of group to help round-robin provide childcare assistance so she can exist outside a caretaker and take care of herself for the first time in a long time, even a few hours a week can be such a big deal. Threaten her POS husband to get his shit together and pull his weight in helping. Encourage her to get medical care, etc.

Keep an eye on her, both for her health and for the little girls safety. ""She would never do that"" kind of stuff goes out the window if there's psychosis.

How did I feel about women friends/family: I loved them but didn‚Äôt consider them in daily planning or future planning. They had their own nuclear families. We were separate entities.

Could someone have been more important? As stated above, in an emergency I would prioritize them of course. And then my kids really did become the center for me once they were born. 

If he got the lions share (he did) why? I was raised to think that was the way things were. I am the only divorced person in my family of 12 first cousins, and many were married young like me.

I was married for 11 years before my eyes finally opened - I was married at 18, it was just a cultural thing where I was from. It wasn‚Äôt unusual. I divorced after kid 2. 

When I was married (before kids) no one else came first. I made plans around him. I grocery shopped with him in mind. I was only available to others with his blessing. Keep in mind, he became increasingly abusive over time. 

Once we had kids, I put them first and that‚Äôs when things got really bad. He couldn‚Äôt handle being second. We‚Äôd been married for 6 years when kid 1 was born.

So in short- no I didn‚Äôt have another important person in my life when I was married, and when I did it was a problem for him. But the grain of salt is that he was an abusive type.

The truth is that women are often *not* the most important person in their relationships, even for other women.  That's why relationships, even homosexual ones, are such a losing prospect for women.  Yes, they might feel like they've ""succeeded"" if they get married and have babies by age 30-35; however, when they reach middle age, the chances of them ending up divorced and poor are *extremely high*.  Aside from nearly always being the primary parent, they often lose out on promotions and better pay because they follow their spouses.  When they get divorced or if their spouse gets sick and/or dies, they often find themselves in poverty because they don't have the second (or only) income.  Family will suddenly disappear or give them the ""bootstraps speech.""  As for friendships, they won't have any of value, as they tossed them as soon as they became pregnant in favor of fellow ""mommies"" or ""couples"" who couldn't give a toss about their circumstances.

That is of course until I found out that relationships nowadays are not like my grandparents relationship that lasted 40+ years. Apparently people get into relationships nowadays just to pass some time and not with the idea that it's going to last. So I have a hard time investing in someone emotionally if I know that it's going to end in 1 or 2 yrs. Whats the point really?
Being chilfree also sort of complicates things because most guys will stick with you if you have a common purpose (kids) but if you don't want to have kids they might not take you serious as a partner. Also much easier to break up if you don't have common obligations together (kids, common house mortgage, etc).

On the other hand I am not sure I would be able to have a long term relationship like my grandparents. My grandfather wasn't abusive or a cheater. They both worked hard, saved money to build a house, don't rememeber seeing them fighting.

I can‚Äôt anymore imagine sharing my living space with a man. Even if you were in love with a man, he‚Äôd still be a flawed human, and with way more flaws than women generally.

pain is inevitable, suffering is optional

right now you are both suffering and in pain because of not being in acceptance

practice accepting things just as they are, it will feel painful but those feelings will pass and you will feel more at peace. even better to get a good cry out too

radical acceptance is really something that needs to be experienced/felt self explanatory however if it's easier there are worksheets and books etc. if you search the term

your pain will subside as well but to me it sounds more like suffering than pain right now which can definitely be improved. pain is much easier to deal with.

At face value, it‚Äôs about receiving validation from men that you‚Äôre still attractive and desirable. I‚Äôm at the point in my life where I know my appeal and don‚Äôt doubt it. So I don‚Äôt need them to tell me I‚Äôm pretty. Feels shallow to want that. I value more the health of my brain and work to preserving that, cuz I want to be mentally present way into my senior years. What is beauty if the brain is empty. 

Relationships with men are a high risk gamble to me therefore it‚Äôs stress that I would expose myself to if I volunteered myself for it. And stress is a common denominator for lots of diseases. I‚Äôve been self-sustainable and self-accountable for so long that it really bothers me both psychologically and physiologically to have someone come into my life and destabilize things. 

I still interact with men but not with the mindset of befriending or flirting with them. I treat them all like distant co-workers or acquaintances. I‚Äôve been applying this mental filter for myself that makes me less sensitive and conscientious, not that I‚Äôm rude. I just practice being grey rock which is being as bland, monotone as possible so they give up trying.

I really don‚Äôt know what a relationship with a man could enhance in my life. I don‚Äôt need that financial support, I have my friends and family for the emotional/mental well being. I used to be open to having children but my priorities are different now and if I seek a man‚Äôs company, it‚Äôs likely going to be temporary.

I think it is natural for human beings to want to belong. Also if you think about it when your closest family dies you'll want someone to call family and that's often a partner. Or used to be, when it worked out well.

About the money thing yes my biggest dream would be to have my own house. That's like what I really want. If I met a man who said ""hey here's a house for you"" I think I could give in. Problem is there's no free lunches, specially not with men and certainly not with rich men. Men are naturally selfish and self centered, rich men are even more and also they are entitled. And obviously have a not of options so I'd always feel like I'd have to fall in line and make him happy otherwise he'd leave... And shit I am not doing that I am not a dog.

Even in sugar type of arrangements they just don't give women a house. Sometimes they get an apartment and pay her rent but its conditional to her dating him. When it ends they don't keep giving. So yeah I highly doubt meeting a man that will add something as valuable to my life as that will ever happen. I am not super hot either, just average looking. 

If that's the case I don't see much advantage to share life with a man unless he was truly a decent person, a good friend, we had matching libidos and sex was not that important.

I heard a good piece of advice a while back that if you don't have a purpose just pick one, anything and then you can always pick a new one and pivot. It's just about going in a direction. 

I really like the book 'An Interview With The Devil' by Napoleon Hill and he says drifting is basically the ultimate 'sin' i.e. not having a purpose (he doesn't use sin in the traditional Christian sense the whole book is a metaphor it's really interesting). But I think sometimes we focus too hard on finding our ""Purpose"" with a capital P when we can have lots of little purposes on the way that lead us to our bigger one. Otherwise it's a lot of pressure. 

Also I'm personally of the belief that women are THE fundamental creators, not just of life physically but we are the creatrix of all.

As a young woman my purpose was learning.  I loved learning about pretty much everything. I read nonfiction voraciously, learned as much as I could about anthropology, medieval history, and folklore, but I was also interested in the sciences.  I took a really long time in college, because everything interested me.  I even took an additional year in graduate school, because I couldn't squeeze in all the courses I wanted to take in the normal amount of time.

For many years I had a career in a field that makes a meaningful difference to people's lives.  I believed in it (still do though I'm retired), and did my best to excel and also to push the envelope of what institutions of this particular type could be and do.  I spoke nationally about it, published a few articles and book chapters about it, and made sure that I helped women climb the ladder behind me.

Now in retirement, I'm done with all that.  I feel like I've made a contribution so I've ""earned my keep"" as a human, if you will.  So now my purpose is to be present in the moment, and also to care for the very small plot of land I have.  I care about making a safe space for pollinators, growing flowers and fruit trees, and improving the health of the soil.  I enjoy my dog, who will be 3 later this summer.  I also enjoy making art.  

You could say my purpose is hedonistic, but I think that's looking at it in the wrong way.  The world doesn't need all of us to be in the rat race.

To me, the concept of facing one's fear seems like a deliberate project, and that's not what happened in my case. 

 X3 misrepresented himself in a bunch of ways.  I thought I was getting a stable, conscientious, emotionally functional man with assets.  What I actually got was an anger-monkey who had less money than he claimed, didn't listen when I expressed my needs, pawed at me instead of considering what might get me in the mood for sex (even though I'd told him myriad times).  But when he tried to kill my 8 month old puppy because she was barking to alert him that her toy had gone under his recliner, I realized all in an instant that I needed to be gone ASAP.  So the next day I rented an apartment and hired an attack dog lawyer.  I moved out with my dog that weekend.

[],,[deleted],,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"Honestly, I think we have been sold down the river by the notion of romantic love and the way it is portrayed in the media...and we are fed this dream from a young age. Even people who have long and happy marriages would probably tell you that their lives look nothing like the romantic ""ideal"" and involve way more compromise than we are ever led to believe.

I have been purposfully single and celibate for almost a decade now and I still sometimes get that desire to fall in love with some great guy. When I take the time to think about it, I realise that feeling of me wanting romantic love is probably actually an expression of a deep down longing for companionship and connection both of which can be found in friendships (even online, with like minded people) without all the drama that the whole dating scene inevitably invites. I haven't yet met a guy with the capacity to be as kind, loving and generous to me as I am to myself.

I decided to walk away from dating for the sake of my sanity and so that I could funnel all of the emotional energy that relationships demand into my children, but many years down the line I have discovered that I can give myself everything that I would want from a romantic partner and without any of the fuss that comes with trying to align with another person. Yes, even sex! There is a peace and fulfillment that I never really expected to experience, since my whole being had been wrapped up in finding ""the one"" who would make everything suddenly fall into place. And somehow, things have fallen into place whilst I have been pusposfully single. I didn't expect that to happen!

I still have days when I get a pang. And I sometimes miss being intimate with another person, but there is a price to pay for relationship and for me, that always involved compromising far, far too much. 

How would you feel if you met someone tomorrow and the life you have built for yourself as a single woman suddenly had to grow and change to accomodate another person's needs? But not a perfect guy, because they don't exist.

Google the problem your car is having. You will likely be able to narrow it down to three or so causes. Research how much those generally cost to repair. Find out how much the parts generally are, and how many hours it takes to fix. 

When you get an estimate, it‚Äôll most likely be one of the causes that you already have a price range for. Have them break down the parts and labor. Now you have some leverage. 

‚ÄúYou are saying it will be $1200 to do &lt;thing&gt;. You are charging me $500 for a $200 part and $700 for labor for something that will take two hours to fix. Go ahead and put my car back together so I can take it somewhere else.‚Äù

Or maybe they are more reasonable. ‚ÄúAh the going rate for that is $400, not $500. If you‚Äôll do it for $400 / $425 / $450, we have a deal.‚Äù

Maybe they give you a cause you haven‚Äôt researched yet. Ask for the parts and labor costs. Tell them that the price sounds high, so you will call them right back. Then research and call back and haggle.

Another guy was literally insane too but in a way that didn't benefit me.

He could've been the devils son abusive and soulless. Just to tell ya that it's not in my head. I had an abortion once and he was there...

When he went away I got a Ted talk from the abortion doctor that was also a man that I need to break up with him cause he could sense that he's bad news and told me to focus on educating myself to the highest level and stay away from men. He basically encouraged me to be WGTOW. I know he told me because it was too late for him he had kids distracting from his studies so he became a doctor late. I've never ran into anybody boy or girl before or after that encouraged me to be WGTOW. I broke up with dude after the abortion was all done and said.

But, for some reason I never applied that same logic to relationships.  I was never particularly interested in being partnered, it was just, ""what you do.""  It took an abusive marriage and two failed long-term relationships for me to stop and ask why I was putting myself through so much drama and misery.

Whenever I was in a relationship, it always felt like my life was on hold.  I often compare it to a train derailment.  Then, once it ended, it would take me months to get the train back on the tracks and moving in the direction I wanted to go again.

My last relationship ended about 10 years ago when I was 30.  That's about when I figured out that I was likely on the ace-aro spectrum.  I never dated much anyway, but that's when I made the decision to bow out of the game entirely.  I stayed single until I briefly did a FWB thing about 5-6 years ago.  Decided that wasn't worth the headache either, and was blissfully single again until last year.  Out of curiosity, I decided to dip my toe in the dating pool again, but that only lasted a week or two.

Sex bores me to tears, so apart from companionship and someone to share the bills with, I really don't see what a traditional romantic relationship has to offer.  I can easily afford the bills on my own, and I can get companionship from a cat, so.... {shrug}

I just never really thought relationships where that great and didn't understand when others wanted one. When I was a teenager, I thought I wanted to have a boyfriend, but whenever I fantasised about being in a relationship, I really just thought about kissing, making out, sex. Turned out you could also have that without a relationship (yes, I know, these days everyone complains about people just having hook ups without relationships, but I grew up in a rather conservative area, and FWBs as a widespread phenomena did not really exist. ONS were something that you'd maybe do drunk once and then regret...). 

Anyway, I went my merry way just having hook-ups and sort of FWBs. At some point, I did have a relationship, mostly because romantic relationships are so ingrained in society and I thought I might just try it out. I did love the guy, but at the same time, I was relieved when the relationship ended. I just like having my freedom, doing what I want, and planning my own life without taking plans of another person into account. 

I just stayed single after that. I guess finding wgtow made me even more secure in my decision. I was also getting frustrated about the men I had sex with, because most of them were not that good at it and finding a good FWB was hard. The combination of reading more on feminist separatism, wgtow, and other alternative lifestyles made me question my own lifestyle. At some point, after my last (good) FWB ended and I was having a few episodes of bad sex while trying to find a new one, I just decided to quit dating/hooking up altogether and went full wgtow. 

Life is a lot more peaceful since. Ironically, even though I never wanted to bind myself to a men and always valued my independence, I had spent way too much time on tinder and dating men.

I highly recommend the app Headspace. I‚Äôd tried to build a regular meditation practice a few times throughout my life but was only successful after relying on the structured lessons of Headspace. Now, 15 months later, I still meditate 10-15 minutes a day about 5 days a week. It‚Äôs a big commitment to set aside that much time to ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äú but it was critical for me to get a handle on my anxiety when I was close to having a mental breakdown last year. Because of my meditation practice, now when a particularly anxious thought arises, I have the ability to examine it instead of letting it take control. I can objectively conclude that anxious thoughts are due to insecurity, uncertainty, low self-esteem, etc then move on.   


I believe that mindfulness meditation could help you with your anger and pain. In addition to lessening the intensity of these emotions by viewing them objectively, Buddhism and mindfulness meditation encourages us to treat others with loving kindness - especially  ourselves. When I think back to how I‚Äôve let men treat me in the past, I cringe then take a deep breath and think ‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned a lot from that experience, I deserve to be treated better‚Äù, and can move on much quicker than I could‚Äòve in the past.   


I love what you wrote about how the world at large - and particularly media and especially social media - constantly tell us that we‚Äôre not enough and we‚Äôll be happy if we finally have or look like X. Buddhist teachings say that desires harm us twice: before we have them we yearn, crave, feel incomplete til we obtain X. Then afterwards either X didn‚Äôt live up to our expectations, or if we lose it then we miss it and maybe even grieve it. I‚Äôve come to view sex this way. When you‚Äôre first dating someone it‚Äôs so exciting but for me it actually produces a lot of anxiety. ‚ÄúWhen will I see him again? Will he call me back? I want to have sex with him sooo badly.‚Äù Immediately after sex your hormones are satiated, but after a few hours or days - that wasn‚Äôt enough, you just want more!

[],,ProserpinaFC,,,[],,,,text,t2_49v9v7n3,False,False,[],"Well, I think a politically prudent place to start would be describing my dating history with men:

I was raised as Baptist Christian and was a Christian educator by my teenaged years. I took the commitment of Chastity until Marriage very seriously, it would be later that I realized that I was asexual and that's why it was never a temptation for me. This was often the first hurdle that any Christian, Muslim, or Jewish man had when dating me. They were always quick to say how much they valued my self-respect and honor, but they always assumed I was just initiating the ""I'm a lady, of course I won't put out on the first date"" dance they expected to dance anyway. When date 3-6 came around, it would hit them like a bus that I was serious.

Some of them had outright existential crises over how to date a virgin. One Muslim man cried and begged me to forgive him for heavy petting me, as if his grandmothers had materialized behind him and screamed at him for touching me. Another guy, a great guy I still think about to this day, couldn't bare dating me because of a 5-year age gap which, plus virginity, made it feel like a 15-year age gap to him!

Another man WAS a pastor and swore he'd never EVER do anything to jeopardize my honor, but also couldn't keep his hands off me. So, I told him we should cool it down and just be friends. That confused him even more. Women ALWAYS wanted commitment! Why wasn't I using his attraction to strong-arm him into a relationship?!

So, dating men has always been --- I dunno, anti-climatic. I've never felt personally rejected by it all... It just seems like men both overthink and act too much on instinct in that first month of dating. They both do little to control themselves but then over-analyze and categorize women to ""sus out the crazy"". (My best friend spent the first six months of our friendship ""sussing out my crazy"" while also shamelessly flirting with me. ü§£ Looking back, he's concluded that vasectomies should be mandatory upon high school graduation. I agree. Men should have absolute control over who they impregnate. The rate of single-motherhood would plummet.)

Once I became atheist and considered dating women, I became fully exposed to the song and dance men usually do... And I don't freaking dance and I don't have the tolerance to sus out other women's crazy. ü§£

1) Immediately, had women trying to trick me into paying for them. I dutch date. I ain't paying for no stranger's meal and no stranger has to pay for me. But in so many ways women would whimper and whine that because I was the more masculine one that I should just take a man's role. No.

2) Men felt overwhelming guilt over trying to seduce me. Women acted like I owed them sex. Was I faking being bi just to say ""I kissed a girl and I like it""?! Asexuality wasn't real if it meant they got rejected. 

3) So many tests of character, fake dramas, manufactured problems, conclusions jumped to, arguments that didn't need to happen if the slightest communication had been used. So much unnecessary bluster in the name of making them feel respected.

4) And just none of the intellectual stimuli that made dating men worth the trouble. No interest in deep conversations, no depth of thought. Just a surface-level rhetoric that was often based off what other people believed: politics without ideology, religion without theology, very little science and a whole lotta ""that's just my personal opinion"". And, pressuring me to agree with their ill-informed opinions.

A) Just throwing this in as well: sexual harassment at work. Male coworkers have inappropriately flirted with me, yes. But women have: slapped my ass, groped me, asked for my full sexual history or lack thereof, forcibly kissed me, and tried to pressure me into dating them and turned other people against me for refusing.

I heard somewhere that the ‚Äúluteal phase‚Äù during the menstrual cycle (the last 14 days of the month or so) is when your body purposely ‚Äúslows down‚Äù to make it easier to get pregnant, which in turn can make a person feel tired and drowsy, and honestly I fucking despise that.

I HATE knowing that I‚Äôm destined to be inherently less productive, alert, and energetic at certain points in the month solely because my stupid body is designed to infest a parasite I don‚Äôt want against my own will. Like what type of design was this? I absolutely despise how my hormones are destined to be messy, the emotions and constantly changing moods associated with these changes, the inherent anxiety and neuroticism that comes from this various hormonal changes, the fact that I‚Äôm more likely to get depressed solely due to my body and it‚Äôs stupid biological functions that I didn‚Äôt even ask for. It honestly makes me super mad at evolution as a whole for deciding on this. I hate feeling like a living incubator. 

Hell, I‚Äôve even read articles about women being more likely to get sick at certain points in the month as the immune system weakens to make it easier for sperm to impregnate, and it just makes me feel so disgusted as my own self. No wonder many women want children despite the fact that they risk losing their lives, identity, and sanity. When you realize that your entire body as basically designed to do one thing and that the way your hormones affect moods/personality all factor into the fact that you can give birth and had to raise children throughout history, it‚Äôs no wonder so many women think motherhood is by far the best thing they can do with their lives and themselves, and lack the confidence to believe otherwise. Obviously also because women that want children will be able to handle the realities of their bodies better, as opposed to being miserable about things like periods and hormones, unlike women who don‚Äôt want children.

And more importantly, why is it that girls have to go through puberty so early anyway and have to deal with all the frankly traumatic changes and inappropriate behavior from these disgusting men anyway?! A 11 year old shouldn‚Äôt have to be worried about things like bras, periods, cramps, etc. Female hormones feel more like downers whereas male hormones feel more like energizers tbh. I always get moody and depressed whenever I‚Äôm going through hormonal cycles, but I noticed that boys tend to get happier and more active during puberty. Not to mention the fact that they don‚Äôt have to deal with sexualization, maturity being forced onto them, being judged on their fuckability, negative stereotypes, etc.

I get so mad at the nature of evolution and how it‚Äôs screwed over women as a whole. I hate feeling like less of a person and less of an individual solely due to the body I was born in. I hate feeling like my own body isn‚Äôt my own, but some foreign entity that just makes me feel bad.

I also hate knowing how my body makes me inherently vulnerable and weaker than most men by default. Weaker, meaning easier to rape, harm, harass, etc. Weaker because it‚Äôs inherently designed to give birth to babies as it‚Äôs only purpose, ignoring my own mental health and sanity and my own desires in life.

Of course you feel angry and hateful. Your right to choose NOT to be a mother is under attack. It's a very real and imminent possibility. Fear/hate are two sides of the same coin. It's Ok to feel angry and upset and absolutely normal!

As for what to do to try to process this, I went through a period like this too. I'm still angry at the unfairness, because it IS unfair.

But the anger/disgust that made me feel bad did start to go away when I established real, actual things I can do if I do get pregnant. It gave me some peace of mind, I felt more empowered, and also when my friends needed help, I was able to direct them towards what they could actually do.

That helped with the burning, constant anger and helplessness I felt. Maybe it will help with you, too.

By the way, when I say figure out what to do, I don't mean just get a list of phone numbers for contraceptive advice/planned parenthood in other states or list of locations or websites. I mean, calling those phone numbers, perhaps calling those locations. Have a Google doc or an email with everything you need to know. Save up all the $$ you'd need for transport, accomomdation and the procedure.

Decide on a few people you could call if you're in that situation, and talk to them about what they'd do, and see if they'd be able to support you.

As for me, I ended up even calling a place in another country (I'm currently in SEAsia with few abortion rights) and a nice woman guided me through the whole hypothetical scenario, and I feel a ton better (while still knowing that this is NOT ok.)

Before, there's no such thing as 'romantic' love. Only economic partnership to procreate called 'marriage'  during the classic era.  

Further,  love you will feel, is usually the first 6-12mths is oxytocin. The binding hormone you get during/after copulation. After, it will stabilise and the real work is required i.e. effort is required 

Love = a verb.  Society seems to forget this word is not a feeling,  it is a doing word i.e. effort. 

Also, we tend to wax lyrical when we long for something that we don't have.  Only after you experience it yourself, you'll find the reality is almost always underwhelming. Especially when it comes to men. 

One says love is unconditional. Well it's true for our dogs. 

Hope you'll find romantic love in whatever form it may be.",,,1623932898,{},h22ygb0,False,t3_o17go9,False,False,t3_o17go9,/r/wgtow/comments/o17go9/even_knowing_everything_that_i_do_im_still_sad/h22ygb0/,1624245154.0,5,True,False,wgtow,t5_31ux8,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I believe in stillness rather than 'happiness'.

Happiness is fleeting, a deceiving social construct that must be achieved.  Resulting in a perpetual dopamine chase.  Which serves the neo liberal capitalism just right.  

Consume! Buy more! Experience the travel! It'll make you happy!. That's not happiness. That's just one minute rush of excitement = no stillness.
