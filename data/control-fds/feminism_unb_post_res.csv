There is no reason at all, that we as human beings should be valuing a person for their body alone. This isn’t a “women shouldn’t do that!” Thing I was posting here. I’m confused how being ok with  women to continue the cycle of male abuse in the name of “ we’re taking it back!” Also, “nobody seems to care when men do it” is a pretty bitter view. You’re essentially generalizing a mass group of people to defend the actions that, regardless of who is doing it, are detrimental. I don’t have a single friend that doesn’t care about the  way women are portrayed in media. Women are half the population, allowing someone to be devalued in such a way is not ok. This is my experience in life, yours I assume was different. The point I was making is invading a platform that is used by young children and teens and purposefully making sexual gestures in an attempt to lure someone with a credit card is not ok. If you want to do something like that, go strip, stay away from children. The only issue I have in this sense in the audience. Once again, I get it, but doing it in the realm of children is not ok. If someone walked up to a child in public, and made sexual gestures towards that child, you’d be ok with it because I gave that person $5? Maybe I’m wrong and I’m focusing on the wrong thing. I’m probably letting my emotions get the best of me here. I just can’t get my head around defending the actions of a person acting sexual to an audience of thousands of kids.

My issue with this is that the reason “titty streamers” are more successful is because more men want to watch them. People always point blame at the actual women catering to these people, but I don’t blame them whatsoever. They’re not “undercutting” other women, men are, because they would rather watch the girl with her tits out. That’s not the fault of the “titty streamer”, but of the male audience. 

“Does nobody acknowledge the damage being done to young women and men by being exposed to titty streamers acting in an overly sexualised manner?”

Women have always been objectified and sexualised by men. Nobody seems to care when men are the ones sexualising women for all of human history, but the second women take control of their own sexuality and use this for their own gain, people are concerned about the damage being done. I’m not saying women or anyone really SHOULD be objectifying themselves since obviously women are more than sex objects and are still struggling to be seen as that, but I really don’t blame these girls at all for profiting off of women’s sexualisation since, like I said, we’re going to be objectified anyway so why not have it be on your own terms?",rachulll,2019-11-02 22:28:28,2019-11-03 02:33:00,/r/Feminism/comments/dqjywk/as_a_female_streamer_i_encounter_this_a_lot/f690ivk/,t1_f68yh8z,Feminism,10,1,2019-11-03 02:33:00,0.75658,0.00705,0.43736,0.07428,0.38408,0.00214,0.29195,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have had to unlearn misogyny. Its a part of our culture and has to be actively unlearned. Sexism and racism too. The power of SS (above) is a thing. A male left unguided in our culture, isolated and alone has difficulty processing SS, as it is not a rational thing. They think they are rational, when they are not. They need to respect their animal selves and not  blame women because of the ""power"" they have. The idea that women have a power like this leads to the impression that these feelings are being unfairly manipulated. It means they think their reaction is unique, or stronger, unlike women's or others; therefore justifying outrage. Its all so wrong. Its also not normal. They are being set up and lack the maturity or wisdom to see this by a society that teaches them little about maturity but offers plenty of SS. No excuse for individual behaviors: but we need to teach young men how to be better while also teaching young women to demand more. People left alone in our culture and modern world dont get better through isolation.

---

I don't think calling someone out is a punishment  but I think it's better than ignoring them. T.I. already had millions of people watching him and he has connections with some of the biggest artists out right now.

Ideally calling him out will also have him lose some fans and connections (the podcast episode is now deleted), tho I agree that it will also appeal to people who are sympathetic to his point of view. But if the majority is publicly against it then wouldn't that make these platforms less friendly to the minority? Maybe even make them start to reflect and learn something or at the very least keep them away?

At this point I'm sure everybody already knows about using outrage to get recognition and I don't think that this is that or will turn to that.

I really don't get the mass shooter comparison, they're not comparable imo.

145,686,"i think it’s easy for words to get lost in translation, for instance when i think of a ‘gentleman’ my mind goes to chivalry - which is really undermining. i’ll elaborate in a moment on that, but i also thing a gentleman can be defined as quite literally a sweet man who goes out of his way for everyone, or is exceptionally positive - this definition being my preferred one lol. 

i think when it is defined in the chivalrous way it is bordering sexism, although there’s grey areas in this statement simply put it can feel as though you’re being undermined by ‘that’s too heavy for a woman!’ or ‘a woman can’t do that!’ mentality.

when a man is being a gentleman towards everyone, irrespective of gender, i think this is fine, in fact it’s lovely. however when a man specifically goes out of his was ONLY to help women it’s worth asking what his mentality is. does he think: oh well it’s apt to help as [insert sexist ideology here]? 

mostly these scenarios require context. often, men think they’re helping and shout-out to those who just do it to be a good citizens and don’t do it because of preconceptions of women. but on occasion those who think they’re helping aren’t, they’re relatively undermining. to elaborate, due to our long winded centuries of fighting to be seen as people and our day to day experiences of misogyny in few men it can be really hurtful for a man to undermine your ability to act independent. the nature of being a gentleman can often entail this. a specific example may be a man taking boxes out of your hand because surely they’re too heavy for a woman or a man saying ‘let the gentlemen handle this’ or something.

161,706,"So I did a lot of research papers in college (English lit degree) and I think this may help you figure out how to tackle this. 

1) pick a topic that YOU are interested in. Writing lengthy papers about shit you don’t care about can quickly become a disaster. 
During the course, was there a topic or lecture that you were drawn to? Roll with that. One I thought of is the psychology behind the female acceptance of inferiority to males. 

2) turn your topic into a question. Don’t worry about if it sounds good or not- were just getting ideas on paper for now. 
Using the example I gave: how does the psychological impact of certain events in a woman’s life lead her to accept her inferiority to men? 

3) hardest part, okay? This is where we turn the question into an argument. You want to frame it in a way that any person reading the question would be able to answer “yes I agree” or “no I don’t agree.” And(!!!!!) your teacher doesn’t have to agree with you. They don’t really tell you that, but it’s true. As long as you make a well thought out argument based on solid research you’re golden, pony boy. 

Using the example: the psychological effects of the puritanical view of shielding girls from learning about puberty and other natural processes of the female body, while not treating men in fundamentally the same way, leads to an early onset psychological delay in development of women leading them to believe they are naturally inferior to men.

198,771,"Hillary Clinton has continued her unlikely TERF rebrand this week by claiming that trans issues pose a “legitimate concern” for cisgender women.

The former Secretary of State stopped by BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday to promote The Book of Gutsy Women, a profile of 100 extraordinary women co-authored with daughter Chelsea. After the Clintons sparred over transgender rights in an October interview with the U.K. newspaper The Sunday Times, in which the former stateswoman said we must be “sensitive” to transphobia.

Clinton returned to the same line of argument yesterday, urging patience for those who are still “trying to sort it out.”

“I do think there is a legitimate concern about women’s lived experience and the importance of recognizing that, and also the importance of recognizing the self-identification [of transgender people],” she said. “This is all relatively new. People are still trying to find the language for it.”

“I think in the right mindset this can be understood,” the 2016 presidential candidate added, “but it’s going to take some time.”

The comments are fairly interchangeable with last month’s remarks, in which Clinton referred to trans rights as a “very big generational discussion” and claimed the subject wasn’t “something [she] grew up with or ever saw.” 

When Sunday Times reporter Decca Aitkenhead asserted that there are women from earlier generations who may be uncomfortable sharing a locker room or dressing room with a transgender woman, the 72-year-old was said to have nodded vigorously in response.

“I would say that, absolutely,” she said. “Absolutely. Yes.”

Clinton’s comments have been a boon to conservatives who have used them to exploit a wedge between trans-affirming progressives and gender-critical segments of the left. The right-wing news site Washington Times called the backlash to her Sunday Times interview “unhinged” and a “completely understandable perspective, particularly for a woman of her generation.” 

Meanwhile, U.K. newspaper The Spectator cited the remarks as proof there are “indeed legitimate questions” about whether trans people should be recognized as the gender they say they are.

However, at least one member of the Clinton family gets it. Chelsea Clinton came out in support of transgender children during the Sunday Times interview, saying that we “need to be doing everything we can to support kids in being whoever they know themselves to be and discovering who they are.”

The former First Daughter is also said to have shot a “furious stare” at Aitkenhead over the questions.

Her mother did not rule out a 2020 run in the recent interview with Radio 4, claiming that she is “under enormous pressure” to take on President Donald Trump in next year’s presidential election following his surprise win in 2016. Whether she would throw her hat in an already crowded ring, she would not say.",Yeahmaybeitsdetritus,2019-11-14 20:10:41,2019-11-14 20:10:52,/r/Feminism/comments/dwf1f8/wtf_bye_hilary/f7in0ge/,t3_dwf1f8,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-14 20:10:52,0.00848,2e-05,9e-05,0.01076,0.00137,0.00013,0.00078,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So yes, girls are over sexualized, but that's because women as a whole are over sexualized.

And you're very right!

&gt; Background: I was first alerted to it after award-winning trans author and NYT contributor Meredith Stroud (writes under the penname Meredith Russo) enjoyed a viral tweet whining about how beautiful 'cis' women often have abusive and unkempt male partners. Some commenters noted an aged blog post indicating that Stroud had been booked on charges related to domestic violence, and I began investigating.

&gt;I managed to reach out to Stroud's ex-wife, Juniper, who agreed to speak with me. **She turned over dozens of pages of legal documents which substantiated her claims of being brutally abused and raped by Stroud. Included in the document were messages which Stroud even admitted to the abuse** (see the article for screen caps, included with consent of Juniper). **Stroud also owes Juniper over $16k in child support, for which she has been trying to get Stroud to pay for years.**

&gt;I told her story.

&gt;Normally with these stories, like with Yaniv, the blowback is directed at me and my publication. That, I am more than prepared to handle.

&gt;But this time, in a very cruel and abusive fashion, the blowback was directed at Juniper. A sweet young lady who runs a wildlife sanctuary at her own cost.

&gt;I received more than one distressed call from her where her voice was shaking, and she was in tears. **Stroud had apparently been threatening to sue her for defamation (that's not how it works -- Stroud would have to sue me or my publication), bogging down her child support lawyer and racking up bills as this lawyer deals with these bullying calls from Stroud's legal counsel.* As a result, Juniper's lawyer asked for more money from her to be owed by today. Money she had to come up with by pulling out of trauma therapy, and applying for lines of credit.

&gt;I have fought bullies my whole life, and I have no intention of stopping now. But I am in that headspace where I feel entirely out-of-sorts.

&gt;I thought Yaniv was bad -- harassing and litigating against immigrant women for no other reason than racial and sexual animus, but this is on another level.

For girls there’s this obsession with purity and virginity and innocence. An older man manipulating a naive teenage girl who doesn’t understand what’s going on. Much like Aaliyah and R Kelly. 

With boys it’s more about people already seeing boys as men from a young age and not taking it seriously if they were to become involved with an older woman. The Mary Kay (don’t know how to spell her last name) situation is a perfect example of this. A lot of people felt he knew what he was doing and that he was willing to become involved with her, therefor it wasn’t seen as rape. Some people might even praise him for becoming sexually active. It’s not shamed upon like it is for girls.

**gen Ⓥ**, @vegbby

good statements for women to practice:

1) you interrupted me. i'm not finished talking.

2) no

3) that isn't funny

4) that isn't appropriate

4) i already know that

5) that won't be necessary

6) leave me alone

7) you're making me uncomfortable

8) stop ignoring what i'm saying

284,906,"Well, 1st things first, the 95% thing is bs. Second, all though you probably already hear this all day, killing humans is wrong. They have a unique genetic code. THEY ARE HUMAN. Now, that probably won’t change the hardheadedness of a full on feminist. Here’s some more: if killing humans becomes more and more tolerable, and human life is valued less and less, what will happen to our world in 10 years? 20 years? Think about this. Do you value your own life? Do you think you are more valuable then a fetus? In fact, I can almost say for certain you are misinformed about how abortion works. Wonder what happened to the president of planned pregnancies before the current one? She was asked to watch an abortion. She quit after that to say the least. Do you want to know what happens? If you have a heart at all you will at least feel some sadness. Typically the procedure is done around 12 weeks into the pregnancy. By now the baby is a little bigger than a plumb, has all of its organs, and has begun to. Develop nerves. This is what happens. First, they remove the “tissue’s” legs. According to Cecile Richards, the baby starts screaming. On the ultrasound, she said she saw the poor baby writhing in pain. Then they suck the leftovers up a tube. Then they remove the arms, then the rest is sucked up and everything is cleaned up. Is this really what you stand for? Is this what you support? The death of human children? Being ripped apart and sucked up? When I heard this, I cried. I didn’t sleep. Luckily I didn’t have school after that, because I got no sleep. I couldn’t believe it. People kill people for profit.

Racism is this nation’s telltale heart beating ominously in the collective subconscious. From time to time we come to believe we have expiated and silenced it once and for all. But then it is back — changed, perhaps attenuated, but unmistakable.

Eleven years ago, we were congratulating ourselves on a historic milestone: the election of Barack Obama, the first African American U.S. president. Some dreamed — foolishly, it turned out — that we had finally entered a “post-racial” era. Instead, we find ourselves at a hyperracial moment of heightened friction, a time when six in 10 Americans believe race relations are “generally bad,” according to a Pew Research Center survey, and nearly two-thirds believe it is now more common for people to express racist views than when Obama left office.

More than half of us blame President Trump for making race relations worse, according to Pew. But Trump may be more of a symptom than a root cause. If he exacerbates and exploits jagged divisions for political gain, he is able to do so because those divisions were already there.

It is depressingly easy to quantify the stubborn disparities that linger from our centuries of racism. The median black family earns just 62 percent of what the median white family earns, according to the Census Bureau, and has little more than one-tenth the accumulated net worth — gaps that have barely narrowed since the 1970s. Latinos fare, on average, just slightly better.


Much harder to catalogue is how Americans feel on a personal level. Racism hurts. A growing body of research shows it negatively affects the mental and physical health of its victims. Like any burden, it wears the bearer down. Sometimes it makes you feel like lashing out. Sometimes it makes you feel as if you are drowning.

In what surely is not a coincidence, racism is rising along with diversity. The country’s 10 biggest cities and two biggest states are already majority-minority, meaning non-Hispanic whites no longer constitute more than half the population. The nation as a whole will reach that tipping point around 2045. Hispanics are now such a huge minority that one could argue the nation is already functionally bilingual. Perhaps the sense that demography equals destiny has something, or maybe everything, to do with the fact that about half of white Americans, according to a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute, believe discrimination against whites is as big a problem in the United States as discrimination against minorities.

This is how the war against racism goes: progress, setback, optimism, despair — a cycle that frustratingly repeats and yet somehow inches us forward. Racism may be worse than in the recent past, but the individual and collective punishment it metes out is a shadow of what black Americans suffered a half-century ago. We have no choice but to believe that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was right when he said that the arc of the moral universe is long but bends toward justice. We have somehow taken a detour, however, and must find our way back to the true path.

This issue is devoted to photography that documents this moment — not just our external struggle with racism, but the internal struggles as well. Some of the images are beautiful and unsettling. Some are jarring. If some make us uncomfortable, that is progress. An easy conversation about racism is not a real conversation at all.

You use cultural differences as an excuse for how women are treated, but the treatment of women is not a western cultural phenomenon because patriarchy dominates throughout the world, manifesting in culturally specific ways.  One example of patriarchy in a non-western context is how men In the Brazilian Munduruku tribe control religious ceremony and women through the threat of gang rape.  

You have asked for specific examples of ways that you have privilege over me, but the answer to that is complex and unknown because I do not know you. You are the only one who can recognize the systemic privileges you have over others.  We would be much closer to equity if all people were able to do that.  In patriarchal societies, men generally dominate over various aspects of women’s lives, and women maneuver this domination in subversive ways.  To use the Munduruku example, the threat of gang rape forces women together and into the much more difficult daily tasks of horticulture and food production, but still they lack men’s privileges such as learning Portuguese to talk to outsiders, walking alone, and engaging in religious ceremonies.  

Women and Gender Studies is an entire social sciences discipline, and should you want to learn more, I encourage you to seek out some books like “A World Full of Women” by Martha Ward and Monica Edelstein, “Feminist Issues: Race, Class, and Sexuality” by Nancy Mandel and Jennifer Johnson, and “Gender in Cross Cultural Perspective” by Caroline Brettell and Carolyn Sargent.  I don’t have any more time to give to you, so I hope you’re able to give it to yourself by taking my suggestion.

In patriarchal societies, men generally dominate over various aspects of women’s lives, and women maneuver this domination in subversive ways.  To use the Munduruku example, the threat of gang rape forces women together and into the much more difficult daily tasks of horticulture and food production, but still they lack men’s privileges such as learning Portuguese to talk to outsiders, walking alone, and engaging in religious ceremonies.  

Women and Gender Studies is an entire social sciences discipline, and should you want to learn more, I encourage you to seek out some books like “A World Full of Women” by Martha Ward and Monica Edelstein, “Feminist Issues: Race, Class, and Sexuality” by Nancy Mandel and Jennifer Johnson, and “Gender in Cross Cultural Perspective” by Caroline Brettell and Carolyn Sargent.  I don’t have any more time to give to you, so I hope you’re able to give it to yourself by taking my suggestion.

Discussion

Across multiple neural analyses, we show that girls’ and boys’ brains function similarly during mathematical processing. We saw no evidence of gender differences in neural responses to mathematics content, neural responses during educational video viewing, or rates of neural development for mathematical processing in early childhood, and in fact we found statistical equivalence between boys and girls throughout the brain. Tests of statistical equivalence and a Bayes Factor analysis show gender similarities throughout the number processing network. Furthermore, boys’ and girls’ math abilities related to the rate of neural mathematics development in the same brain regions, and neural similarity was consistent across children of the same and of different genders.
Our results are consistent with the ‘Gender Similarities Hypothesis’, which argues that boys and girls function similarly in most areas of cognition.10,23 In particular, gender similarities in early childhood mathematics show, as proposed in the domain of spatial cognition,14 that gender differences in STEM fields in adults are not derived from intrinsic differences in children’s brains but likely from a complex environmental origin.
Any test of cognitive ability that shows gender differences faces the difficulty of disentangling biological factors from social ones. For instance, 4- to 7-year-old boys show an advantage over girls in tests of spatial skills, but parents also report more-spatial play with their boys compared with their girls,14suggesting a possible sociocultural influence on gender differences in spatial cognition. Similarly, in math and science, teachers tend to show differential distributions of time spent encouraging students, praising students, and explaining concepts to students, with boys receiving more time than girls.24,25,26,27 This is important because teachers’ perceptions of children’s math ability predicts later math achievement scores.28 Parents’ expectations about their children’s success also correlate with children’s own self-concepts of their abilities and their performance on math tasks.29,30 A strong sociocultural influence on early childhood math achievement makes it difficult to tease apart intrinsic gender differences from sociocultural factors in older children and adults.8,9
Given the broad similarities between boys and girls, gender differences observed in STEM performance during adolescence or adulthood are unlikely to originate from early childhood differences in the brain or cognition. Although gender differences in STEM may emerge later in development or from interactions between STEM training and sexually dimorphic behaviors (e.g., differences in hormone levels following puberty),6,31,32 the findings of widespread gender similarities in boys’ and girls’ brains do not support claims of biological gender differences in childhood. Instead, the data show that the neural functions underlying mathematical cognition are similar between genders and represent one heterogeneous population rather than two categorical groups.",MistWeaver80,2019-11-14 16:54:22,2019-11-14 16:54:33,/r/Feminism/comments/dwc6ud/neurosexism_link_in_comment_section/f7hzu19/,t3_dwc6ud,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-14 16:54:33,0.00273,2e-05,0.00036,0.00105,0.00062,5e-05,0.00071,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"" By the time they reach college, most students have been exposed to 18 years of prevention messages in one form or another. Thanks to repeated messages from parents, religious leaders, teachers, coaches, the media and, yes, the culture at large, the overwhelming majority of these young adults have learned right from wrong, and enter college knowing that rape falls squarely in the latter category.

RAINN does not recommend ""teaching men not to rape."" RAINN recommends a three-tiered approach when it comes to preventing sexual violence on college campuses. A prevention campaign should include the following elements: 1. Bystander intervention education: empowering community members to act in response to acts of sexual violence. 2. Risk-reduction messaging: empowering members of the community to take steps to increase their personal safety. 3. General education to promote understanding of the law, particularly as it relates to the ability to consent. 

In other words, show others how to recognize a bad situation and get involved, how one should protect themselves (not to victim blame anyone, just on what is the best way to protect one's self) and having a clear understanding of consent laws.",318RedPill,2019-11-14 09:40:33,2019-11-14 09:40:34,/r/Feminism/comments/dvvnhd/conservative_mp_candidate_nick_conrad_is_a/f7gyhhl/,t1_f7ftfxd,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-14 09:40:34,0.02231,8e-05,0.00131,0.00142,0.00181,0.00014,0.07527,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The common mistake that a lot of men make with feminism is that they treat it like some hivemind. Different feminists approach issues differently, hence you have some feminists who only focus on women and others who actually do put massive amounts of effort towards men.

&gt;  Why do girls have a need to turn literally everything into something about themselves?? 

This is why I said lurking is a good idea, you'd be surprised how many women deal with men saying, ""What about men?"" in a clear attempt to make it about themselves in spaces like this. Men do suffer under the current system of gender roles, no feminist worth their salt would argue otherwise but men's suffering needs to be tackled by those who live those experiences. After about a year of lurking and posting in feminist subs, I've realized that I can't waltz in here and demand women to fix my problems, I have to exercise some praxis of my own. Part of that praxis is talking to men who post here whether in good or bad faith and maybe help them see the feminist point of view.

&gt; It seriously amazes me to see how much self love and self respect you lack. 

It was when I adopted more feminist attitudes I developed better self esteem because my value isn't tied into society's idea of what a man is. It is places like TRP on the other hand that will tell men they are worthless because they failed the checklist of masculinity.

The oppression of women is very real, especially with the amount of dehumanization they experience even in first world countries. I understand it can be hard to wrap your head around something that isn't your own lived experiences, because it's hard for everybody to do so. 

Society is actively hostile to women, it shames women for their own bodily functions and urges (period and slut shaming), attempts to control their body (pro-lifers, PUAs), views them as mostly caregivers and housewives (traditionalists) and at the very worst, are said to be destructive to society (religion, TRP). So it's far from a wild guess to say that women in some parts of the world might need to have gender separated bathrooms or even public transport.

My advice would be to lurk here and ask meaningful questions of women's experiences, not sarcastic comments that imply what other people experience simply don't happen.

This is someone who wants more than anything to be rich, famous, and successful. This incident is going to teach him that by being outrageous, misogynist, and inflammatory, he can become rich, famous, and successful. It's not going to change his behavior. It's giving him exactly what he wants.

My argument is that we should apply the same rationale we use when we say that people should share the names of victims of shootings, rather than the names of the shooters. The shooters want fame and notoriety more than anything else. Forgetting who they are is a far greater punishment to them than ""calling them out"" would be.

&gt; anytime someone says others are too irrelevant for something I think of that one Instagram kid

Not sure what you're trying to say with this. In this video, the ""instagram kid"" is equating a person's value with fame, and trying to shame someone who presumably has no aspirations of fame for not being famous. The kid is a total sociopath, and his words and actions are reprehensible.

That's clearly not my argument. The power dynamic is reversed. T.I. is the one with a degree of fame, whereas I'm an anonymous nobody on the internet. I am not equating his value to his fame. I'm saying that fame is his goal, so increasing his current level of fame and notoriety by calling him out is counter-productive, and just giving him what he wants.",LennonsGhost,2019-11-08 12:03:34,2019-11-08 12:03:34,/r/Feminism/comments/dsw93a/this_is_absolutely_disgusting/f6w37se/,t1_f6u9joh,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-08 12:03:34,0.02501,1e-05,0.00085,0.00086,0.00593,0.0001,0.00033,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

511,2262,"As a guy, I agree. It's so frustrating seeing men dismiss feminism and terms like toxic masculinity, thinking that it means feminists believe being a man is inherently bad and masculinity in general is a problem.  


What they don't get is that toxic masculinity is something that should be fought by both sides of the gender spectrum, and that it doesn't mean women being mad at men.  


Anti-feminists will often say things like ""feminists say masculinity is harmful to women but men actually suffer as well, men have higher suicide rates, they work harder jobs, etc."" and I'm like YES EXACTLY. \*\*That's what toxic masculinity is.\*\* Men are raised to not show emotions and to never cry, which leaves them alienated and with supressed emotions that  end up being unresolved and accumulate over time. Why are mass shooters, suicide bombers, incels, all almost exclusively men? And why do they always turn out to be highly depressed and anxious? Does this perhaps have anything to do with the bullshit standards imposed on men that essentially robs them of their humanity?  


Men are also expected to be wealthy and successful, to be providers for the family, to be strong and to suck it up and work in order to climb the social ladder. This is immense pressure especially in today's generations when building a career and even finding work just keeps getting harder and harder.  


How can a man look at these things and say ""yep this is fine"" and not think this is a problem that affects them? The thing with toxic masculinity is that it's a closed loop which doesn't let you out, because if you question the way masculinity is imposed on you, you lose the ""masculine"" status and end up being alienated from society further (look at all the male feminists who get called ""weak"", ""betas"", ""soyboys"", etc.). It's a huge problem and it's something men should be serious about, and it cannot just be solved by feminist women doing the work for them.",curlfused,2019-11-08 09:57:06,2019-11-08 09:57:06,/r/Feminism/comments/dszed7/so_sick_and_tired_of_people_not_understanding_the/f6vy2kq/,t3_dszed7,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-08 09:57:06,0.09522,0.00034,0.01245,0.0341,0.01643,0.00063,0.01442,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

in terms of abortions, in 1967 it was legalised but very taboo and it took the consent of two men, usually a doctor and husbands

559,2330,"Elsewhere in this thread is my enormous post detailing why I don't think Rey is a Mary Sue, and why if she is, she's not *more* of a Mary Sue than Anakin was, or than Luke for that matter, who also routinely pulls skills out of his ass despite being a useless desert orphan, yet everyone seems to collectively forget that.

TL;DR: I think she has faults that people choose to ignore for no apparent reason, that she has a personality that people keep denying for some reason, and that she doesn't need ""something really good to understand all that"" because a bunch of other force things were bullshit before and the ""he was the chosen one"" explanation wasn't necessary in the 70s and 80s for people to be fine with stuff.

That said, I want to focus on something here:

&gt; And also the phrase Mary Sue was coined by a woman to call out men for trying to put in female characters with zero effort and not actually making them into actual people. 

No it wasn't. 

It was coined by a woman to call out other women who were writing poorly disguised self-inserts that saved the day in Star Trek Fanfiction. You can [wikipedia it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue). And I think that's actually important. Because the original satirical story is very much in the vein of ""Silly Novels by Lady Novelists"", by George Eliot. 

And the sentiment in both of those is actually very interesting and in keeping with what the original post of this thread was about, that being: Women who judge other women for not being XYZ enough, sometimes as a way of gatekeeping, sometimes as a way of showing yourself to be ""not like other girls"", sometimes as a way to demand better of representation and to tell women, or other people writing ""Mary Sues"", that they have a *responsibility* to write better. Sometimes, just because of the fear that other women are ""making you look bad"". 

No one demands that *every male protagonist* be an inspiration to men, well-rounded, complex, multifaceted and with a sufficiently clear backstory that all of their skills have a well-understood source.

I will concede, freely, that Rey isn't that great a character. Certainly not better than any female character in Game of Thrones, or Avatar: The Last Airbender. 

But there are a lot of bad male characters who aren't met with that level of skepticism or scrutiny (among them, imho, OG Luke Skywalker in the first film. He gets better later). There are a lot of bad characters who don't have explanations demanded of them. Why is a useless farmboy a fighter pilot too? ""Well, he said he liked flying""--yeah, and Rey said she was a pilot, and showed herself to be interested in flying. But one of those things is good enough evidence and the other one isn't. I wonder why?

As a writer, I have often struggled with the idea that something is ""forced"". I've been told that I need ""a reason"" for character X to be a woman, or to be gay, or to be black, etc. But no one ever demands ""a reason"" for a character to be white. No one ever demands ""a reason"" for a character to be a man. [Here's a thing I like to link.](https://fozmeadows.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/psa-your-default-narrative-settings-are-not-apolitical/) 

This isn't to say that there is a problem with thinking Rey could be (far far faaar) better written. I agree that she could. It's to say that *most male protagonists could be better written*. But people don't spend thousands of words talking about how shitty they are. They don't face that kind of scrutiny. If an annoying farmboy protagonist is an annoying farmboy, you *move on*. There is a lot of shitty writing that people get away with when the protagonist is a man.

This persistent demand that any poorly-written-yet-competent female character be EXPLAINED... tells me that the default mental space for many people is still ""women are incompetent unless shown otherwise. So you can't show them being competent without explaining why they're competent or else it's unrealistic"". 

And I don't know about you, but that troubles me far more than a cash-cow franchise that had two poorly-written protagonists before, has a poorly-written protagonist now, but she's slightly less annoying than them and that's a bad thing for some reason.",Eager_Question,2019-10-30 19:30:00,2019-10-30 19:30:24,/r/Feminism/comments/doqp7c/sometimes_you_need_to_reframe/f5tsrs6/,t1_f5sac4w,Feminism,1,1,2019-10-30 19:30:24,0.01691,0.0001,0.00308,0.00299,0.00394,0.00013,0.00996,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

565,2339,"During her exam in 1999, B’s own mother held her down on an exam table at a North Carolina clinic. The doctor inserted a long cotton swab into her vagina, searching for a sign that would convince her mom that she was a virgin. B had a urinary-tract infection, and her mom was sure it was because she was sexually active. The then shy, studious fifth grader had never kissed a boy, but that didn’t matter: Her mom would believe her only if a doctor checked her hymen. After a few minutes, the doctor declared, “Congrats, Mom, she’s still a virgin,” and B breathed a sigh of relief; she had been terrified her hymen had already “broken” during cheerleading practice. Looking back, B says the doctor could have just as easily said she was not a virgin, potentially submitting her to the wrath of her abusive alcoholic mother.

 year after the exam, when B was 12, a stranger molested her outside of a park. She never told her mother, fearing she would see her differently. When she was 14, a boy raped her at a party. Again, she didn’t tell her mom, worrying “she wouldn’t love me if I wasn’t a virgin.” B ties her trauma back to the messaging she received as she lay on the exam table shaking in fear. “I felt like I was, at that point, damaged—like no one would care,” B says. “If I wasn’t a virgin or pure in some way, I was damaged or unwanted.”


For Elena*, a 21-year-old woman whose mom forced her to undergo a so-called virginity test in Kentucky in 2012, the experience destroyed their relationship and left her traumatized. “I’m not raising a whore!” her mom screamed in the car on the way home from school after discovering Elena’s friend had sent naked photos of herself to a boy on Facebook. A gynecologist checked Elena’s hymen and handed a piece of paper to her mom saying she was, in fact, a virgin. “I never told her a private thing again,” Elena says.


In the first investigation of its kind, based on dozens of interviews with women, medical professionals, and health researchers across the country, Marie Claire and the Fuller Project have found that not only is virginity testing being requested in the United States with frequency by both religious and secular communities and occurring here, but the practice remains wholly unregulated. There are no federal or state laws banning virginity testing, nor are there clear medical guidelines or standards of care from the country’s top medical associations, like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) or the American Medical Association, to help physicians and nurses navigate the ethical and legal minefield that is virginity testing.


When doctors legitimize virginity by conducting fake tests for it, they arguably uphold one of the oldest lies used to control women: that whether or not a woman has had sexual intercourse determines worth. In 2005, in Birmingham, Alabama, a 12-year-old named Jasmine was killed by her mother after she told her she was no longer a virgin. “She straddled her daughter and poured bleach down her mouth, thinking it would cleanse her,” Birmingham police officer Warren Cotton told Marie Claire. He responded to the mother’s 911 call to their home, where he found Jasmine lying lifeless on her bedroom floor.The hymen myth is also at the heart of a multimillion dollar cosmetic-surgery industry. Often, women get cosmetic hymen surgery out of pressure to bleed on their wedding night (even though plastic surgeons stress there’s no way to ensure that). Other women say they desire to be “re-virginized” for a sexual partner. During the procedure, known as a hymenoplasty, the hymen is “re-created” by sewing together what remains of the membrane or a new hymen is created from the lining of the vagina. The procedure can cost thousands of dollars and, per ACOG, isn't medically indicated. Whether or not women request it themselves or consent is beside the point, say ethicists. Virginity testing is “incompatible with professional obstetric and gynecological ethics,” wrote Laurence B. McCullough, Ph.D., adjunct professor of ethics in obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City, in a 2015 article he coauthored in The Lancet. Medical professionals have the “responsibility to lead efforts to enact legislation that prohibits virginity testing,” it read.",MistWeaver80,2019-10-30 18:42:28,2019-10-30 18:42:44,/r/Feminism/comments/dpajyo/us_doctors_are_performing_mythical_virginity_test/f5tlm3o/,t3_dpajyo,Feminism,1,1,2019-10-30 18:42:44,0.22046,0.00106,0.0462,0.00827,0.01028,0.00116,0.43308,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

572,2348,"&gt;No it is not the same thing. You are over simplifying it. Luke was absolutely useless in the first film. He was unable to save his aunt and uncle, who raised him, whilst Rey managed to survive alone on a planet. 

So, more boring and annoying, while Rey is resourceful in a shitty situation?

&gt;Because of doing nothing of interest in his life Luke sucks at everything. Rey on the other hand can pilot the Falcon, Luke couldnt do anything like that. 

Really? Because I thought that *the entirety of the first film's climax* was based around Luke piloting a ship we never see him pilot before, in a trench we are told is too small for anyone to actually pilot in it, and then shooting a thing when we have no intradiegetic reason to think he should, because ""force powers"" that he hasn't used in a meaningful way until then.

Plus, we have no real reason to think the Falcon is a particularly difficult ship to pilot. Only fandom hype.

&gt;She had no training apart from living on sand and gave Han a run for his money. 

Is ""giving Han a run for his money"" just knowing stuff about machines? She's been scavenging her whole life, it's reasonable to think she would have learned stuff, in order to know which parts are useful, in order to get those parts, in order to get *food.* 

&gt;Luke is the son of the chosen one and protected by his mentor.

He wasn't raised from birth to be good at the force. He was declared to be too old by Yoda. His mentor was ""the old weirdo over there"" and didn't teach him anything except for a few hours, maybe a day and a half, tops. 

&gt;Rey meets these people who are incredibly important and who respect her instantly. The only person who respects Luke at first is Obi Wan.

Who? Han, the disgraced war hero and smuggler that everyone is mad at, who doesn't respect her until she speaks his ship-mechanic language? A random stormtrooper with a crush? Raz, who  has some destiny shit going on for Rey, at least in TFA? Why does destiny bullshit matter when it's about Luke but not when it's about Rey? Leia? She was probably just being nice to the poor kid who was dragged into the plot and then had to see her (ex?) husband die. Kylo Ren? He ""sees potential in her"", she's an exploitable resource in his eyes, at least at first. 

&gt;Luke is useless in the the first film and his mentor dies in front of his.Han, who is shown to already be competent with backstory of being a smuggler and Kenobi carry Lukes ass all the way through. The only thing Luke manages to do is blow up the death star with the help of a magic space wizard ghost guiding him.

So the ""only thing"" Luke manages to do just happens to be the climax of the story, in which he does a thing we have both a.) been told is impossible, and b.) been shown everyone else dies doing, even though c.) he's been fucking useless for most of the film up to now anyway?

You're telling me it's MORE REALISTIC to establish a character as useless and have them win the story, than to establish a character as fairly competent and  contribute to a *group effort* that wins the story? Why can Han be established to be competent, but Rey can't? 

&gt;Rey does nothing wrong, she is flawless with zero personality. 

She freaks out about her magical destiny and gets her ass kidnapped, wtf are you talking about? Also she spends the whole first film swearing up and down that her parents will come for her, which is not naïve after that many years, it's just stupid. 

[Also she sucks at counting.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CW9y6ZmWwAAVbcP?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900) That is not proper counting and everyone knows it. 

&gt;She helps Han and Chewie more than first film Luke ever could. 

It just sounds like ""she's not useless enough"" over and over at this point. But if she was more useless, a lot of people would be complaining that she's ""too useless"". 

&gt;In the space of a few hours Han sees her like a niece. 

Does he? Or does he just think that hey, she has some talent, maybe he should take her under his wing? Because he has so many issues about having been a shitty dad, perhaps? That says more about Han than it does about her, to be honest. 

&gt;Oh and she defeats the grandson of the chosen one with minimal effort. And beat him in the use of the force despite her never having lessons whilst Kylo trained all his life by Luke and Snoke.

This is the one that pisses me off the most. 

So you have this elite warrior. And he *just got shot*. And he *just killed his dad*. And *all of his dreams are collapsing in front of him*. And again he keeps hitting the injury to draw attention to it. And he's *not trying to kill her* because he wants to *turn her to his side.* And *he just fought someone else*. 

Yet somehow, having her *run away for most of that battle* (with him *directing the battle* for the first 2/3rds) and then getting a second wind that knocks him off balance because ""the force awakened"" enough for her to be able to knock him on the floor *at which point the ground beneath them cracks* and there isn't *actually* that clear a winner...

That's the unrealistic thing? Not that *none of them get frostbite?*

[Watch this again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJTz-ahXyyI) He fights Finn. He's injured. And he still *controls most of the battle*. The first chunk where she attacks involves him redirecting the battle easily. There is a whole section where he's basically backing her into a corner and she's falling for it because she's scared and not really strategizing very well. And the turn in the fight happens after she does the trust-the-force thing *while he was telling her she needed a teacher*. He *wasn't really fighting at that point.* And the moves that ""win"" her the fight? They're *kicks.* She *kicks* him. She's fighting *dirty*. Which we know she has done before, because she *does it before*. 

There's a lot more set up on this than there is setup for Luke being able to fly... anything, let alone a ship that can go in a small enough place to shoot a vent guarded by turrets that kills other pilots there.

&gt;Daisy Ridley an amazing actor but shitty writers btw who were straight white men ruined Rey as a character. Why are you trying to defend the fuck ups of Adrams and Johnson, a woman should have been a director. Do you really want female empowerment to be written by straight white guys pretty much exclusively? Because that is what you are condoning. Why do you support this? Women should own their narrative more than they do, like Natalie Portman calling out all director nominees as they were all men.

What? Yes, I think more women directors would be better, perhaps in Star Wars specifically.   
 That said... I also think *anyone* should be able to write female empowerment. Whether it be polygender TPOC or straight white guys. I don't think white guys should be told NOT TO write female empowerment. Especially since, in the current Hollywood setup, that means a lot of female empowerment will just stop happening if that was the case.

&gt;Instead of making out anyone who has issues with the new trilogy hates women maybe look at our actual individual arguments.

I think I have. But I would like to note that *I don't actually think* ""anyone who has issues with the new trilogy hates women"". I think everyone who hates the new trilogy has nostalgia goggles on. As someone whose first Star Wars experience was the prequels... I have never held any illusion that Star Wars is full of convoluted nonsense and bullshit plot excuses about how its every protagonist is a super special awesome character. 

I don't think everyone who hates Rey is *necessarily* sexist. I think a lot of this is people having watched film A when they didn't really have a lot of critical skills, and then watching film B when they are older and have more critical skills, and then using those critical skills to go ""hey, this is a bunch of bullshit!"" with the new film, without really noticing that the old films had those problems too. A disparity in skepticism. 

Weird desert orphan with superpowers that the plot bends around because the writer said so describes all three Star Wars protagonists. Except Rey is a.) not a man, and b.) *not as annoying*. By ""Star Wars Protagonist"" standards, she seems like an improvement.

If Luke was a girl, and the first movie was **released now**, people would probably go ""what, we never see her fly anything but she can fly in places where trained pilots can't?"", or ""she's *so whinny and annoying"".* Or ""oh so not only can she fly for no reason, but she's secretly the chosen one's daughter? What a special snowflake!""

&gt;The new films are just a rip of Lucus' ideas gone wrong. Disney killed one of the greatest female characters in star wars, Mara Jade. Look her up. Oh also Ahsoka is one of the most loved star wars characters of all time and is amazing. Everyone loves ahsoka. She fought Vader and Darth Maul.

I 100% agree that Mara Jade and Ahsoka are better characters than Rey. Ahsoka might in fact be MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER in all of Star Wars. I just also think that Obi Wan and Yoda are better characters than Luke and Anakin. Both of whom are overhyped and annoying desert orphans who shouldn't have been the protagonists.

&gt;You may think you are making a good comparison but I argue your views are problematic. Rey is a shit character made by men wanting to make a female lead without putting too much effort in. If you want decent films for women advocate for more women in higher positions so they stop making this garbage.

I think that I can believe that ""there should be more female screenwriters and directors"" while *also* thinking ""Rey isn't *worse* than the Star Wars movie protagonists before her, and all the hate is disproportionate, and indicative of something other than bad writing.""",Eager_Question,2019-10-30 17:33:05,2019-10-30 17:33:07,/r/Feminism/comments/doqp7c/sometimes_you_need_to_reframe/f5tefue/,t1_f5sbexz,Feminism,1,1,2019-10-30 17:33:07,0.56131,0.00069,0.43333,0.0028,0.14484,0.00023,0.00474,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, decriminalizing prostitution does still send a message that it is okay to buy women, use her for sex and throw her away (just like a toy). I personally don’t want that attitude to spread. 

When I said that we should look at sex workers as people who need help, I meant that we should implement institutions to provide guidance and a pathway for women to get out of the industry. The best way to do that is by catching the ones who have already been arrested. Just like in courts that mandate people with drug and alcohol violations to attend AA meetings and complete programs, the same application could be required for sex workers (a lighter sentence if they go to X facility). These facilities could also be care centers for women who have encountered a dangerous situation in their line of work. It doesn’t sound pretty at all but it could help a lot of women. 

I can’t even imagine the toll it takes on a persons psyche to sell out their body.

Furthermore, because females are ignored in medical testing, doctors often lack the understanding of how a non-sex-specific disease (like for instance heart disease) can present themselves in females since all their knowledge and data is specifically focused on men, which causes many misdiagnoses and deaths among females worldwide.

Making the language surrounding reproductive and vaginal health gender neutral doesn’t reduce people to their genitals any more than it did when we only referred to women in these discussions, in fact I’d argue it does the opposite. Using gender neutral language detaches genitals from their gendered associations and admits people are more complex than just their genitals. I’ll admit some of the language is a bit clumsy, but destroying that genders association is good for both trans people and for cis women.

If we want to help our national interests, girls not going to school while boys do is definitely one of the major problems in other countries that will affect international relations in the future.",blueberrygrayson,2019-11-02 17:28:55,2019-11-02 19:26:14,/r/Feminism/comments/dqb1nn/keeping_girls_in_school_act/f671rrd/,t1_f661ok4,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-02 19:26:14,0.00194,1e-05,0.00017,0.00081,0.00041,6e-05,0.00027,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Given the amount of steamers present on Twitch, Mr. Classy has the choice to just go watch a streamer who doesn't show tits or doesn't even have tits, and yet Mr. Classy chooses to go on social media and rant about a streamer that shows tits when no one is forcing him to watch them. 

Mr. Trashy is a much more simple man: out of all the things that he could be doing with his free time, he goes on a steamer's page and just floods her chat with ""SHOW TITS"".

What do Mr. Classy and Mr. Trashy have in common?

Even if those statements come from different men, it's still a societal catch-22. The options are either to fail at streaming or be called a slut.

This post isn't to say that there aren't any other catch-22s in our society, it's to point out that this one is a direct result of society's disparate opinions about what women do with their bodies. It's highlighted here because feminism is partially about pointing that shit out.

Be ready for a couple natural defensive mechanisms.

He might...

1) disarm the whole situation with humor; let him know that you're serious, you might laugh but you're not dropping it until you feel you've gotten your point across

2) become suddenly extremely defensive about being compared to ""those guys"", ""those guys"" being men who he sees as much worse to women than he thinks he is. Let him know you're not accusing him of being a through and through misogynist, you're just letting him know that sometimes he says things that can hurt coming from him.

3) over exaggerate what you're asking about. ""So what I can never joke around you anymore?"" type of response. This is the most obnoxious to deal with, and is usually a sign they are having a major emotional reaction. Bring the conversation back down to the fundamentals, don't give into this attempt to turn the conversation into an argument. Reiterate how you feel ""I'm just saying that sometimes you say things like **[specific example A]** and **[specific example B]**, I feel like we're close enough friends that you should know that those things make me feel like **[however it is that you feel]**""

You're not trying to police their language, you're trying to get them to be more mindful about what they're saying. Don't get drug down into a battle of specifics.

You wouldn't be having these conversations if you didn't care about your friends, if your friends care back then they'll listen. Having these conversations is a sign of trust and respect from you to your friends. They need to be adults and understand this.

&gt;In a socialist society unemployment is not a thing. 

This is... blatantly untrue? Cuba's probs the closest thing we've got today (running a weird version of planned market socialism w/ state enterprises and self-employment), and it has an unemployment rate of about 2%. 

&gt;Workers have no incentive to try hard because they know they won't be fired

You can lose your job in any kind of socialist economy, it just generally can't happen on a whim because your boss decided they don't want you. If it's a version with social safety nets, it just means you won't starve as a result (kinda same goes for capitalist societies for that last bit tho). 

&gt;Why would anyone bother to work hard if they know that their means of survival will be taken care of even if it requires zero effort on their own part

This is more of a criticism against safety nets than against socialism, but I'd still point out: we don't need them to? [The vast majority of jobs in our current economy are completely useless.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs). We're not subsistence farmers anymore. We have the ability to strive for better and happier lives for everyone and our obsession with forcing people to perform useless tasks to ""earn"" the ability to survive is a major impediment to progress on that front.

That's not what the article says, it says that women make more than men until they're 30.  £1,111 more to be exact. It then goes on to say that the roles are reversed once 30 is surpassed, at which point men are apparently making *£8,775* more on average. It states that the reason for this gap is that there are less women in senior positions than men, indicating that it really only accounted for age in its analysis, so I'm not sure how it supports your point.

It also warrants mentioning that two researchers actually calculated what percentage of the current wage gap can be explained by differences in industry, experience, education, etc. and what percentage cannot be explained. Their findings indicate that a significant portion of the wage gap has no explanation, which can be inferred to be due to sexism due to a lack of other possible causes.

765,2602,"If you want to thrift because you are directly supporting less wage exploitation, go ahead. My comment below is in response to people who believe that thrifting will solve wage exploitation or is an adequate alternative to actual change via policy and movements.


Thrifting or ""voting with your dollar"" ultimately *doesn't do anything at all, in any way shape or form to fix wage exploitation*. Pretending that it does is a way for people who either do nothing to pat themselves on the back or use it as a cover to avoid solving the real problem. When someone pushes the responsibility of fixing capitalism to the consumer, they are either being extremely disingenuous or naive because it doesn't work. This is similar to the people that say things along the lines of, ""[Oh YoUr A sOcIaLiSt BuT yEt YoU OwN aN iPhOnE](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/444308640032358430/643262892145377310/vur079s60ix31.jpg).""


In this context, say I thrift everything I own or I buy from companies that use ""less exploitative"" labor. This, I suppose, is a good thing by itself. But I also support politicians that enact policies that enable wage exploitation, here and abroad. My net impact on stopping wage exploitation is negative because buying or thrifting doesn't solve structural or systemic issues.


What I'm trying to say is thrifting is a good thing to do if you want to, but it is not in any way enough or going to solve wage exploitation. If you care about ending wage exploitation you must, at the very least, support policies that will actually do something to fix the problem.

773,2614,"As a Palestinian Muslim American, a woman of color, and a Brooklyn-born organizer, I’ve been fighting for the needs of my community and other communities of color for years.

So when Senator Bernie Sanders ran for president in 2016 on a platform championing racial and economic justice for all, supporting his candidacy was an easy decision. When his campaign sparked a movement in the years following, I continued the fight across America with other candidates and causes committed to progress. And when Sanders launched his 2020 campaign, I joined as a national surrogate to continue the political revolution we had all built together.

But in both 2016 and 2019, my decisions have been doubted and questioned. Other Democrats could not fathom why people like me –– a progressive woman of color who advocates for representation — would support a 78-year-old white man for president. Many women of color across the country also find themselves in this trap: we are told our voices matter and our concerns must be amplified, but simultaneously find ourselves needing to defend our decisions.


Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar have both enthusiastically endorsed Sanders’ campaign, shocking Democrats who have been preaching the “Bernie bro” narrative for years. But for some women of color across the country, the endorsement simply affirmed what we already knew: Sanders stands alone as the only candidate who will bring the transformational change our country so urgently needs.

Ocasio-Cortez and Omar understand this need for change on a visceral level. As women of color, we are the Americans shouldering the greatest levels of student debt of any demographic, according to a report this year from the American Association of University Women. We are among the Americans disproportionately suffering without health insurance. We are the Americans most affected by high housing costs and most burdened by income inequality. And we are the Americans who would benefit most from raising the minimum wage and empowering labor movements across the country. It is for these reasons that young women were found by an Economist analysis to form a larger core of Sanders’ base than men do — and less than half of his supporters are white, according to an August Pew Research Center report.

Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, former Ohio state senator Nina Turner, San Juan, Puerto Rico mayor Carmen Yulìn Cruz, New York state senator Jessica Ramos, Princeton professor and author Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, and Missouri congressional candidate Cori Bush are only a few of the thousands of women of color who support, volunteer, and donate to ensure Sanders is the next president of the United States.

We support Sanders because he consistently champions our voices, our concerns, and our communities. His policies speak to women of color in meaningful ways — but it’s his willingness to uplift and engage communities of color that truly built a movement (this past September, Sanders was the only candidate who has consistently polled among the top five candidates to attend this year’s Islamic Society of North America conference and participate in their presidential forum hosted at the conference by a coalition of Muslim organizations, including Emgage USA). Though there are other great candidates running, Bernie is the only one who has built a movement that will outlast any individual campaign.

Women of color are exhausted from bearing the disproportionate burdens of inequality – and with so much at stake in this election, we are exhausted from having to explain ourselves. Every time our choice for the presidency is discredited, our agency of women of color is stripped away. Every time people echo the patently false “Bernie Bro” narrative, they erase our voices as well.

Regardless of who the Democratic nominee is, we will not hesitate to support them in the summer of 2020. But by supporting Sanders in the primary, women of color are simply continuing the fight for justice we have spearheaded for generations.

Certainly, our voices have been disparaged and discounted throughout American history as we’ve fought for progress. But it’s 2019 — and we urge our fellow Democrats to do better.",Yeahmaybeitsdetritus,2019-11-11 20:53:18,2019-11-11 20:56:26,/r/Feminism/comments/duypeu/yes_women_of_color_support_bernie_sanders_its/f79cfxp/,t3_duypeu,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-11 20:56:26,0.01054,0.00029,0.00079,0.01924,0.00231,0.00043,0.00076,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I grew up always feeling like I wasn’t like other girls because I didn’t care about taking selfies or wearing makeup or dating. It was a weird sense of entitlement I had. I even used to pride myself for not fan girling over Justin Bieber when he had just came out. It felt good when boys would give me a pat on the back for not being obsessed with him like “other girls.” 

I am honestly ashamed that I used to think this way. I look back now in shame. I realize now that it is absolutely ridiculous to think you’re better than other girls who like typically girly things. 

Most women have to gone through this. Our society is set up to prioritize masculinity over femininity. So of course girls are going to grow up thinking that girly things are shameful and embarrassing. Of course girls are going to seek validation from boys and men. 

I’ve always had a feminist heart and my feminism used to be so narrow. The important thing is to always be open minded. If I wasn’t, I’d still be out here shaming girls for sleeping around while still calling myself a feminist. 

Another thing to remember is that unfortunately we’re all suffering under patriarchy. (Men too if we’re being honest) That’s why I don’t participate in shaming women anymore. 

Not sure if I’ve answered your question. But lastly I’ll say, we all are dealing with internalized misogyny. Internalized racism, homophobia, transphobia, fatphobia etc. I think it’s great that you are aware of it and are trying to evolve.

As you rightly point out, ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" labels for traits such as using makeup, natural body hair/hair removal, clothing, are arbitrary and imposed by society. 

I would go a step further and say that defining your ""authentic self"" using your appearance (hairy, makeup free, comfy baggy clothes) is also arbitrary. If you choose to dress differently on Monday than on Saturday, are you betraying your authentic self? I would say your outer shell doesn't matter. Your authentic self is who you are inside. ""We're all born naked and the rest is drag"" as RuPaul would say.

Talk to your therapist about why you might be feeling pressure to dress a certain way in public, pretend to be dumber than your boyfriend, avoid leadership roles, etc. etc. and explore where these internal pressures might be coming from. It may be related to gender and there may be other factors at play, too.

you already know that your mother is able to do it. your boyfriend loves it when you are comfortable and yourself around him. you owe it to yourself to allow yourself to act and dress however you want. you don't have to prove anything to anyone. if you want to wear your boyfriend's clothes and not shave, then do that! if one day you want to wear makeup and act more feminine, then do that! you're not stupid or pathetic or whatever else for wanting to be masculine, especially since you said you've been like that since a child!

it can be hard to get over the things you've been through. you aren't the person you were pretending to be. you are whoever you want to be and again, you owe it to yourself to be who you are. ease yourself into it. start little by little to do the things you are so desperately wanting to do. eventually you will become more comfortable with it and let yourself shine.

How bout you stfu, if you look at the clothes of girls from the age from 14-18 at school or in their  free time you'd see that they basically ask us boys to look at them. THEY ARE FUCKING ASKING US TO LOOK AT THEM BECAUSE THEY WANT THE ATTENTION!!

But instead of thinking rationally and making a fair statement, NO YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT BOYS ONLY WANT TO FUCK THEM!!

 This entire subreddit is a joke. 
Feminism is ok until a certain point but if Women or girls are starting to act like they have a higher worth than mens the whole shit will start all over again and we get masculinism.

Women and Man have the same exact rights from their day of birth and everyone who thinks/says different should just be quiet!!",FinalSauce,2019-11-26 09:45:04,2019-11-26 09:45:05,/r/Feminism/comments/dt75ft/im_a_teacher_and_saw_this_posted_on_campus_today/f8rzpfh/,t3_dt75ft,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-26 09:45:05,0.95779,0.0795,0.93984,0.11144,0.59093,0.00711,0.44428,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

That’s just wrong. It assumes that my personal experience is the only circumstance and completely omits the experiences of the victims that do get assaulted, it assumes that no men need to change, and it also generalizes that the entire male gender has the same mentality, 

If we want to achieve true change, we need to all be on the same page and we need to encourage positive change. There’s no need to attack men that change their mindset to fight for women’s rights; if you encourage that behavior, more people will see the positive in it and want to change, whereas if you attack it, people won’t want to change out of fear of being attacked.

To add to your point though, OP is also assuming that every father of a daughter that shares this change in mindset is under the same circumstance. To generalize this to all men is wrong, and to suggest it’s just the fact that the daughter is their possession so now they suddenly care is worse. Maybe that’s the case for some men, but not all. Maybe the father had a one night stand with the mother, and interacts largely with men in his life. How could he understand the challenges women face in that case? Of course his mind will likely change when he has a daughter and can experience it first hand. Is that cause he treats his daughter as his possession? No. And that’s a dangerous/sexist generalization to make. 

That’s just one example. Maybe the mother and father communicate but the mother doesn’t share her struggles. Maybe the mother comes from a higher class background where she’s never had to worry about typical problems, and so the father doesn’t see them. There’s lots of potential examples where the father could only learn of the struggles women face after having a daughter and experiencing it himself through his care for her.

939,2852,"I used to be right leaning not too long ago (circa 2 years ago(?)), and when I say right leaning, I mean an extremist conservative that belived in ""states' rights"", that race based police violence is because black parents teach their kids to be fearful of and violent towards cops, and that while sexual assault is not the fault of the victim ""that they should know that there are SOME sickos out there and these reactions are to be expected"" (especially ashamed of this one) and I can say this, with 100% confidence, that that argument does not work at all, unless you are a feminist yourself, you will not buy this argument (for the very simple fact that if you did actually know what feminism is and are a good person, you'd be a feminist already)

This is especially the case with actual far right wingers, they view that argument as an increadibly weak attempt way to fool them and infiltrate their minds and thoughts with lies to only to then reveal our evil cis straight white man hating agendas when it's already too late.

I'd say the best way to actually do that, is if the person is not as much a right winger as I used to be, and is much more open minded and liberal, simply bring up feminist talking points when talking about feminist issues, if you've managed to change their mind to actually agree with feminism, all it takes is a simple ""ta da!"" And even if they won't adopt the lable immediately, they at least already agree with most of feminism.

I'd also recommend avoiding feminist terms, when talking about toxic masculinty, maybe say ""the damaging expectation society has on males to be/do:"".

Another thing to take into consideration is to discuss the cause before the result, people not open to feminsim or just coming out of the right will take a ""men are usually taught to suppress all emotions other than anger"" slowly shifting towards ""and because of that expressions of anger or strength are usually either rewarded or disregarded"" and then finally ""which later causes a lot of problems (ie. Lack of communication with partners. Violence. Difficulty with emotional vulnerabilty/connections. Etc.)"" Than a quick ""men are a lot of the times violent due to toxic masculinty""

What I do see is feminists saying that men believing they can touch women (hugs, pats on the back, etc) is part of our rape culture - it's a sense of entitlement to give unwanted attention without consent.  I also don't see what is very hard about asking someone if you can touch them or sticking to high-5s where they have to consent unvocally to exchange a sign of happiness to each other.  I also have to say do you stop and ask yourself if you would touch your male coworkers/peers in the same way?

You don't seem to understand that the pay gap is about refusing to put women in positions of power.  Men aren't better at being C level leaders in businesses, we just end up with the job more often. 

Lastly, I'm going to discuss violence against men because this has absolutely been a part of my life and you're not helping by lying about it. 

We cannot have a discussion about the violence against men because to even discuss it is a violation of the current masculine template.  It's to enter into the idea that you were weaker than someone else and to open yourself to ridicule; men are always supposed to solve their own problems, asking for help is a sign of weakness, etc.  This is why MRAs and MGTOWs, and the other manosphere types will never solve any of the issues that men face because in order to solve it we have to believe that men can be vulnerable, and be allowed to express those emotional traits which are commonly associated with the feminine. 

All I ever see the idea of violence against men being used for is exactly what you've done; as a bullet point to try and misdirect someone else's conversation away from what they said to make the conversation about men.  I have never seen them actually discuss any type of healing process, or how we can nurture one another back to normalcy and out of the path of violence.  Again in order to do so it's going to require re-shaping what it means to be a man and no one but people ready to dig into the deepest pits of their souls are really ready to have this conversation in 2019.",chackosupreme,2019-11-23 22:27:36,2019-11-23 22:28:42,/r/Feminism/comments/dxyri6/what_yall_think/f8fqnfu/,t1_f83r716,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-23 22:28:42,0.06018,0.0001,0.00188,0.00851,0.01498,0.00029,0.02998,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It’s pretty realistic to assume that the quickest way to ward off a coercive and abusive man is to find another man who is kinder and stronger to stand in the way. 

...

&gt; **Before I worked in prisons, I had assumed that sex work must be quite well paid per hour – that even those with a pimp could surely enjoy a 60:40 split of the takings.** This was wishful thinking. Although there are plenty of women like Phoebe, they are less likely to end up in jail, meeting people like me. Most of the women I met were getting more like 10%, or being paid in drugs and housing rather than cash. The almost universally male pimps often have a group of women in their employ and rake in the takings in return for protection. In other words, it’s a racket. Survival sex work has a worse gender pay gap than almost any other industry. “Does anyone disagree with Phoebe?” I asked. There was a silence, then Lesley piped up. “I don’t see anyone’s boyfriends having to go out on the game,” she said. Phoebe rolled her eyes. “No one’s making you, babe. And no one is setting your prices that low either.” I started to sense that there was some sort of argument from the wing going on here that I was not aware of, and the spat was working its way into our discussion in the guise of a price war. “You’re bringing everyone’s prices down with what you charge on the pavement, you slut.” By this point, they had both got up. “We do the same thing,” Lesley shouted. “Don’t you go thinking you’re better than me.” By this point, I had lost the room. Security had arrived. **And the questions I had planned about unionisation and female solidarity were drowned out by more immediate concerns.**

Your defensive reactions in this post are no different than other forms of science denial. You are part of the ongoing problem of politicizing science to fit the well-intentioned, but often misguided feel-good sentiments of popular culture. Also, denying science, lowering science literacy, and denying differences exist between sexes is no way to achieve equality.  How can we accept and appreciate who we are while ignoring or denying crucial aspects of ourselves? Your rhetoric is inflammatory; fixing divides with divides.

You are not engaging (or ceasing engagement) with most people in this thread; just parroting the same explanation of neurosexism. I don't know how you're missing it, but the reality is that no one in this post - or any legitimate scientist that I've ever seen referenced on this topic - believes that the differences found in the brain between sexes bear any significance on one being ""better"" than the other. Nor does any one of any merit have an interest in making this kind of claim. I mean, think about it. The brain is SO COMPLEX. How in the world could any self-respecting scientist (or anyone for that matter) answer a question we quite clearly don't have the evidence or ability to answer. What is so harmful about studying this? It's essential for many different reasons, including the study of gender dysphoria.

997,2963,"This is unfortunate to hear about.  Misuse of that defense risks killing actual rough sex for its fans.  If people are afraid that it'll be used as an excuse to get away with murder, they'll stop trying things that might look rough.  If it's known in advance that someone doesn't like rough sex, the rough sex defense won't hold up in court.  Making that the demise of things people would otherwise consent to and enjoy would deepen the misfortune.

I've never been into roughness myself, but I've met people who were without being any danger to others.  I had a friend of a friend who was into using knives in sex - knives!  I found that shocking, but he did no great harm to anyone; there was one mishap with damages purely psychological.  He was into well-planned scenes - I'll return to that point.  I'm always leery of ""blame the porn"" responses too, since I've seen some pretty wild art that I liked without wanting to do anything like it myself, and I've known people who are into unbelievably weird porn without any sign that they're a danger to themselves or others.

I believe we ought to tell people to *plan* rough sex encounters, and to *never* tolerate impulsive roughness.  To make it a life rule, an acknowledged footnote in one's open presence.  I can't be sure about this, since I wasn't into the rough side of things myself, but that planning seems like the kind of rule that would've been up in that side of life.  There was definitely always a lot of pro-negotiation chatter floating around.  Making it acknowledged was definitely part of that scene, since people also flagged their roughness levels pretty clearly.  I don't remember ever being shocked by where someone fell on the rough/gentle continuum.  The slogan ""Safe, Sane, and Consensual"" can be used to introduce some pretty exotic things sometimes... if people are still into exotic things after they've done all the ""boring"" scene planning work to equalize the power differentials and establish the boundaries in advance.  Safety is key.

Safety is the fruit of planning and boundaries.  Sexual wildness should only be simulated.  People with impulse-control deficits shouldn't be having rough sex.",ShengjiYay,2019-11-23 17:27:53,2019-11-23 17:28:03,/r/Feminism/comments/e0gw0u/calls_to_end_rough_sex_gone_wrong_defence_uk/f8ell9z/,t3_e0gw0u,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-23 17:28:03,0.1021,8e-05,0.00406,0.00109,0.00199,0.00015,0.21553,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No, you are wrong. And this is a very hateful and malicious statement towards women and their childbearing health. 

&gt;The fetus is not a baby, it was never a person or viable without medical aid.

Yes it was you idiot. We are talking about viable babies that die right before or during birth because of some unexpected reason. Not because they were undeveloped and couldn't withstand their birth. Some die because the umbilical cord gets wrapped around their necks and are choked, some might be breach babies, and others just have their bodily functions stop working without any real discernible reasons but are otherwise completely viable for life. 

A wilfully pregnant woman loves that child even as a fetus because she decides to go through the many pains and difficulties of pregnancy in order to have the baby. If we did not love the fetus, if we did not develop biological love early on, few to no women would ever choose to go through the excruciating pains of pregnancy. The love for your baby at every stage of the way is biological. Being pro-choice does not mean you don't love the baby inside of you. It means you have choices to plan your life.

Who went through the entire pregnancy process waiting to finally have that baby in their hands.

1051,5036,"The claims were made this weekend in an official promotional video posted by the verified Twitter account of Saudi Arabia’s Presidency of State Security, but this now appears to have been deleted.

According to Reuters, the video listed homosexuality, feminism and atheism as takfir – the Islamist militant practice of labelling followers of other schools of Islam unbelievers.

“Don’t forget that excess of anything at the expense of the homeland is considered extremism,” said the video’s voiceover, adding that “all forms of extremism and perversion are unacceptable”.

Homosexuality and atheism have long been illegal and punishable by death in the absolute monarchy, and the country is considered to have one of the worst LGBT+ rights records in the world.

The law punishes acts of homosexuality or cross-dressing with fines, public whipping, beatings, vigilante attacks, chemical castrations, life imprisonment, capital punishment and torture.

Even supporting groups classified as extremist organisations can lead to imprisonment, which immediately puts any activists at risk.

I think it might help you to try to recognize that all the dress up and cuteness are tools that can occasionally add a special flair to your social being. If you go to the store looking unkempt in a hoodie then that is perfectly fine, it means in that situation you just wanna focus on doing your chores or whatever it is and other people will probably perceive it the same. Even if there's other women there dolled up they would probably recognize that you're just being comfy and if they act a weird way towards you it's because they feel resentful that you allow yourself to be comfortable like this and they aren't, and you might even inspire them to feel similarly about it. Just remember that if you wanted to you *can* get all dressed up and looking pretty for special occasions, you have that ability as a woman and it's actually something powerful. Doing it sparingly will give a greater effect too, even if your boyfriend likes the natural you if you get all pretty going on a date with him he will appreciate it and find you attractive even more. When you do it every time you go outside it can lose some of its magic so just be aware that it's something that you choose to do, that you have that power and it's not just imposed on you by society.

The notoriously reclusive actor hasn’t been pictured on the red carpet with a romantic partner in years. Cue surprise and admiration when he was photographed on 2 November in Los Angeles holding hands with artist Alexandra Grant.

Of course, part of the joy some found in this unremarkable event is the result of Reeves’ recent return to fame via the medium of internet meme. “Sad Keanu” is now shorthand for a lost-looking man, forlornly eating a sandwich or staring into the distance, contemplating the utter loneliness of modern life, a reflection of our own isolation and existential yearning. Or so I’ve heard.

The actor has also spoken candidly in interviews about grief and loss, sharing the tragedy of losing a child at birth and then his long-time partner in a car accident. The people of Twitter want Keanu to find happiness; he’s well overdue his happy ending.

1115,5119,"The summary of the comments you are responding to amounts generally to ""They are sexist because they want to control women's bodies."" I don't doubt that the majority of Pro-Lifers have no such intentions. Though, I do believe that sexism is an unconscious extension of lingering culture norms with the Pro-Life stance specifically stemming from religion.

There's nothing inherently wrong about wanting to protect life. There are many ways we can do that, such as environmentalism, universal healthcare, welfare programs, better education, positive growth of our country's inmates, combating gun violence. I've not seen, on a significant level, Pro-Lifers adopting inclusive stances on these issues. The general stance is that they don't need to, in order to simply combat the killing of the unborn. The problem with that is it drums up some serious doubt. Rather coincidentally the only focus on preserving life involves the bodily autonomy of women. Not only that, but regardless of intentions, it does amount to controlling women's bodies in a way that doesn't impact men which is precisely *how* women have been persecuted for thousands of years- being valued through the capacity to birth children.

More doubt gets piled on when one considers that prioritizing the rights of embryos over that of women actually gives the unborn individual *more* rights than any born man, woman, or child. A person is never legally obligated to donate their organs to a dying person, even if that dying person is their dependent, even if only one person could save that life, even if one was responsible for putting that person in the hospital.

With a Bible in one hand and a national flag in the other, Camacho bowed his head in prayer above the presidential seal, fulfilling his vow to purge his country’s Native heritage from government and “return God to the burned palace.”

The problem is a system that forces women into survival sex work or starve/be homeless. We should be fighting that and working to make the sex industry controlled by the people who work in it.

1145,5164,"It's totally reasonable to feel that way OP. History has largely been written by men about topics they pay attention to all while erasing the stories of others, neglecting to investigate why we should care about the things they highlight in the first place. There's been an innumerable amount of women that shaped every society they lived in but you could easily miss knowing about it reading popular books. This doesn't mean history as a topic is worthless though, it just means that you need to search for the stories that have been purposefully neglected or suppressed to create this frame of reference where history appears to be just men fighting other men for glory. A good way to do this is search for books that fall under the purview of critical historiography as they often encompass the kinds of things that oppose the stories you read about in conventional history books and connect them to how the world ended up the way we know it today. 
A really good example of this is Silvia Federici's [Caliban and the Witch](https://libcom.org/files/Caliban%20and%20the%20Witch.pdf) which details the social transformation that women experienced with the rise of capitalism. It talks about really interesting historical information that is invaluable for feminists and I'm sure that if you start reading it you would find it engaging.

I'm doing the second highest level of maths my school offers and the top class is evenly matched girl to boys (and may i add the girls perform better).

In my experience, physics is 'for boys' and biology is 'for girls'. There's no surprised medicine courses are majority female in my country while engineering is so male. While it's huge girls are at least entitled to one science (even though the all male physics department refers to it as colouring in), it makes me so angry that for three years there has been one other girl in my physics class. So many mathematically talented girls are pushed out of stem, and so many boys never learn biology because of the bullshit construct of gendered sciences.

Seeing boys belittle biology when its so clear the wish the could learn. Watching girls silently sitting in the back of the class, afriad to ask for help because then theyll take up space.

1246,5309,"I'd agree with you on this. 

My ex wife made more than I did for about 1 year after we graduated from college.  Prior to that she controlled all of the money with an iron fist and when she became the breadwinner for that period her attitude intensified dramatically and it became ""me spending her money.""

I never, not even one time remarked about her habits, I always wanted her to take care of herself and get whatever she needed to feel like she was put together enough for her daily life.  Shed cry lots before work and I hoped that shed get whatever she needed to avoid feeling so bad about herself. 

So when she had that extra power on top of her already dismal attitude and behaviours, I couldn't wait for the tide to turn so that I could get her sights off of my back.

When we got divorced I learned that she had 50k squirreled away in 2 separate  bank accounts,  she also had diligently paid her student loans while we deferred mine.  And I  took out 35k in student loans that went directly into our joint account that she spent half of and then refused to own up to.   And she sold our condo and put the money in a relative's name as well.

And that's just the start of it.  Never hit her.  Never cheated.  all of her girlfriends encouraged her to plan for the separation and take as much as she could from it.

So I guess feminists can all do a high five over this story.  Doesn't much fit the narrative though, of men always being the predator.",flyonthewallguy,2019-11-20 06:30:38,2019-11-20 06:30:38,/r/Feminism/comments/dyraq7/husbands_are_least_stressed_when_their_wives_earn/f845cgj/,t3_dyraq7,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-20 06:30:38,0.00613,1e-05,0.00035,0.0015,0.00175,4e-05,0.00067,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If applicable this includes attempting to reimplant an ectopic pregnancy. As that is impossible with current technology I guess it would not be applicable.

I think they are just trying to cover themselves for future technological developments or they are just ignorant, both are likely.

In short this bans all abortion except when the mother will probably die before the child is viable (so if you had a 10% chance of dying in the first 8 months you are out of luck).

I personally feel that violence towards women is much more publicized than violence towards men. Just from skimming the news there is always a rape case against a women but barely ever one against men (could very well be that men get raped less; this is just what I've noticed). 

Also people need to chill out when it comes to rape/assault. A man accidentally bumping into you is not rape. A man accidentally tripping you is not rape. Heck, a man touching you isn't rape (in a appropriate spot). People overreact so often when it comes to women getting ""raped"" it's ridiculous. Yes rape is a terrible thing but bumping into you is not rape. 

And finally, equal pay: Look if a woman and a man do their job equally well (like teaching for example) then of course they should be played equally. But if the man does the job better than the women (and vice versa) then they should be played more.

The study of over 6,000 American heterosexual couples over 15 years showed husbands are at their most anxious when they are the sole breadwinner, shouldering all the burden of responsibility for the household’s finances. Stress levels decline as their wives’ earnings approach 40 per cent of household income. But as women’s earnings go above that point, the study showed husbands’ stress levels gradually increasing.

“These findings suggest that social norms about male breadwinning – and traditional conventions about men earning more than their wives - can be dangerous for men’s health. They also show how strong and persistent are gender identity norms,” said Dr Joanna Syrda, an economist at the University’s School of Management.

“This is a large study but of a specific group – other conventions apply in other groups and societies and the results may change as times move on. However, the results are strong enough to point to the persistence of gender identity norms, and to their part in male mental health issues. Persistent distress can lead to many adverse health problems, including physical illness, and mental, emotional and social problems,” she said.

Dr Syrda noted the study also showed that husbands did not suffer psychological distress about their wives’ income if their wife was the higher earner before marriage and the existing and potential income gap was clear to them.

Figures from the Pew Research Centre in the US show only 13 per cent of married women earned more than their husbands in 1980. But by 2017 the figure was close to one third and the trend was likely to continue. Dr Syrda said she and other researchers were increasingly interested in how this would affect social norms, wellbeing, and our understanding of masculinity.

""The consequences of traditional gender role reversals in marriages associated with wives' higher earnings span multiple dimensions, including physical and mental health, life satisfaction, marital fidelity, divorce, and marital bargaining power,"" Dr Syrda said.

“With masculinity closely associated with the conventional view of the male breadwinner, traditional social gender norms mean men may be more likely to experience psychological distress if they become the secondary earner in the household or become financially dependent on their wives, a finding that has implications for managing male mental health and society’s understanding of masculinity itself,” she said.

Dr Syrda said her study also shed light on the ‘bargaining power’ between husband and wife.

“The elevated psychological distress that comes with husbands’ economic dependence on their wives can also have practical underpinnings due to bargaining in the shadow of dissolution or the fear of reduced economic status in the event of an actual divorce. These effects are larger among cohabiting couples, possibly due to the higher probability of dissolution,” she said.

The study also showed a disparity in the way husbands and wives assessed their own psychological distress and that of their partner. Survey respondents were asked to measure distress in terms of feeling sad, nervous, restless, hopeless, worthless, or that everything was an effort. Men reported better mental health than their wives reported on their behalf.

""This too may be down to gender norms. If masculine social roles preclude the admission of vulnerability, and men are inclined to hide symptoms of stress and depression, it follows that wives' responses about their spouses will be less accurate,"" Dr Syrda said.

In fact, wives reported their husbands' lowest distress level was when they were contributing 50 per cent of the household income, while husbands reported lowest distress at 40%.

“The fact that a wife observes to a lesser degree her husband’s elevated psychological distress when he is financially dependent on her may be simply because he does not communicate it – this may be yet another manifestation of gender norms,” she said.

The research was conducted by Dr Joanna Syrda, an economist with the University of Bath, School of Management and published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin (DOI: 10.1177/0146167219883611).",Yeahmaybeitsdetritus,2019-11-20 02:46:38,2019-11-20 02:46:40,/r/Feminism/comments/dyraq7/husbands_are_least_stressed_when_their_wives_earn/f83q3ya/,t3_dyraq7,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-20 02:46:40,0.00727,0.00064,0.00153,0.00278,0.00267,0.00127,0.00346,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1320,5406,"I'll send you my bank details!

But seriously, the POV point is not unique to me. I believe there have already been feminist academic articles on this point. But if you still want to send me that money anyway... 🤣

You might want to check out some of the discussions in r/menwritingwomen for this trope of a female character being ""hit with the rape stick"" to make her interesting / give her depth.

Something to consider: the rape stick trope is common to literature and film, but the POV trope is exclusive to the cinema &amp; TV storytelling format. So, if your focus is on film, then this might be more relevant?

But then, I'm just trying to get that $500 for you to use my suggestion ;)

One last thing: the rape scene in *The Accused* (1988, starring Jodie Foster - she got an Oscar for it). I saw this at the cinema when I was 15yo. I remember being HORRIFIED and disturbed by the gang rape scene - as, no doubt, the filmmaker intended. But what made me nearly throw up was afterwards, reading about this in the press and reviews of the day. Many reviewers said that the scene was ""titillating."" Fifteen-year-old me BOGGLED that ANYONE could find that scene AROUSING rather than HORRIFYING. Now I'm older and less easily shocked, but still disgusted. 

Same thing really for *I Spit on Your Grave* (1978 rape revenge film - I am not familiar with the 2010 remake or its sequels). The filmmaker's intention was subverted by the audience. I remember, growing up in the 1980s, teenage boys constantly rented this film solely for the nudity and ""sex."" I guess the end-user defines the product? 🤷‍♀️

Okay, that was a long rant. Sorry!

No I don't think that women in general have the same status as men. At all. But I don't believe I've said anything suggesting that.  
I agree that imperial 'feminism' is a horrible thing but no I don't think that the kind of feminism you guys are talking about will ever get us there.  
My criticism is more subtle : I am arguing that while having all the prizes won by women is a good thing at a global scale because it helps to balance out the inequalities between men and women in terms of recognition in the scientific field, at a more local scale it isn't necessarily such a good thing because having all the winners be of the same gender constitutes a lack of gender diversity and equality. So in my opinion, the way you report this event can give either a pro gender equality (global focus) or a somewhat anti gender equality (local focus) message.

1346,5439,"I think the answer to your question is that postmodern feminism, or intersectional feminism/4th wave feminism, is a movement that pushes the importance of understanding how institutions like racism harm women of color and how they have long been ignored by previous feminists who were almost all white and cisgender. Postmodern feminists draw on the lived experiences of minority women to argue how we still have a long way to go for not only women to be equal to men, but for women of color to be equal to white women. 

Critical Feminism takes more of a theoretical, scholarly standpoint. It seeks to understand past gender dynamics and how that shapes how we think about women, sexuality and gender today. Critical Feminism isn't a movement perse, but rather a method of literary and historical analysis.

My take is rather radical. Don't read it. 

I guess you seem to try to debunk fucking feminism, because women in general get the same status as men? Surprise. Men are not all goody-shoes gentlemen, most really aren't, and yes, people, humans, are not ethically and morally good all the time. Humans can be horrible. But that's not Feminism is about. 


This is I think it's called Imperial ""Feminism"", where women take place of a normally ""male-position"" and do just the same thing as the former person would do. It's horrible and hideous.

I think it's good to cover that kind of things in the media a lot to restore the balance.

So these guys will generalize this wrongly, by saying to themselves, “Aha, so personal experiences mean nothing when it comes to backing up propositional knowledge. So when a feminist comes up to me and tries to appeal to her experiences or statistics that essentially are the experiences of other women, I can shake them off with this heuristic by letting them know, obnoxiously, that anecdotes aren’t evidence!”

Obviously our changes in behavior are causing changes in the behavior of men. There is the expected backlash to that. The role of a men’s lib movement in my opinion should focus on freeing men from the misogynistic behaviors that affect their quality of lives and argue the point of gender equality from a male perspective. Technically we are both preaching the same points, but I think that perspective is the key here. Male feminists tend to take what they learn from feminists and just attempt to share it in the original form which is a female focused perspective. Now, to a male that is resisting what they believe is women disrupting the social order the last point of view they are going to relate to is a woman’s . Men’s lib needs to be about finding a way to use that male power to make a gender equality movement relatable to men. If men control the norms they have the ability to change it.

We're seeing public support for assault victims, acknowledgement of how much better the world was when we weren't under strongman fascists, and the understanding that we're moving forward.

That's okay.  It's the same as the backlash against gay marriage.  Remember how viciously it was fought against for decades?  Making wedding cakes, signing marriage contracts... such vitriolic drama.  And before that it was miscegenation.  Oh the horror, a white person marrying someone else who wasn't white WHAT WAS THE WORLD COMING TO?!?!?!?!?!?!?

Religion is essentially a story, who do we blame for a story with a poor message, the book or the authors or even the society the author was raised in? Its all three, I think you need to focus on them all instead of merely the book itself. At least that is what I think. 



There are plenty of gender neutral gods and those societies were sexist too. Hinduism is a sexist religion too, just as much as Islam. Btw women could own their own property in several Islamic caliphates a thousand years before European women could own their own property. I have actually done a thesis on India, albeit under British rule. The caste system, albeit further enforced and manipulated by the British was formed by Hindu's. As was burning a mans wife to death when the husband died. The British had to force them to stop doing that and is one of their very few achievements there. Hinduism was much more pro gay rights than most religions or cultures but it also oppressed women and its followers are culprits of immense sexism. Islam did cause some further issues under the Mughals but like I said Hinduism was sexist far before Islam had any meaningful presence there. There are also many roman and ancient greek goddesses and they were some of the most sexist ancient civilisations in history. Hinduism and its sexism cannot be excused by its invaders as it already was sexist and maintained many sexist beliefs even while under the control of other powers.

1517,5736,"No it is not the same thing. You are over simplifying it. Luke was absolutely useless in the first film. He was unable to save his aunt and uncle, who raised him, whilst Rey managed to survive alone on a planet. Because of doing nothing of interest in his life Luke sucks at everything. Rey on the other hand can pilot the Falcon, Luke couldnt do anything like that. She had no training apart from living on sand and gave Han a run for his money. Luke is the son of the chosen one and protected by his mentor. 


Rey meets these people who are incredibly important and who respect her instantly. The only person who respects Luke at first is Obi Wan. Luke is useless in the the first film and his mentor dies in front of his. Han, who is shown to already be competent with backstory of being a smuggler and Kenobi carry Lukes ass all the way through. The only thing Luke manages to do is blow up the death star with the help of a magic space wizard ghost guiding him. 


Rey does nothing wrong, she is flawless with zero personality. She helps Han and Chewie more than first film Luke ever could. In the space of a few hours Han sees her like a niece. Oh and she defeats the grandson of the chosen one with minimal effort. And beat him in the use of the force despite her never having lessons whilst Kylo trained all his life by Luke and Snoke. She is not a character she is a caricature. Daisy Ridley an amazing actor but shitty writers btw who were straight white men ruined Rey as a character. Why are you trying to defend the fuck ups of Adrams and Johnson, a woman should have been a director. Do you really want female empowerment to be written by straight white guys pretty much exclusively? Because that is what you are condoning. Why do you support this? Women should own their narrative more than they do, like Natalie Portman calling out all director nominees as they were all men. 


Instead of making out anyone who has issues with the new trilogy hates women maybe look at our actual individual arguments. The new films are just a rip of Lucus' ideas gone wrong. Disney killed one of the greatest female characters in star wars, Mara Jade. Look her up. Oh also Ahsoka is one of the most loved star wars characters of all time and is amazing. Everyone loves ahsoka. She fought Vader and Darth Maul.

You want some good female characters? Sadie Adler, Gwen Tennyson, Katara and Toph and Azula from ATLA, PB and Marceline, all the women from teen titans and Mandy from GAOBAM. Oh and nearly all the women from Game of Thrones. For some reason cartoons are better than blockbuster films at making believable, interesting and well rounded characters. Probably because blockbuster films are all directed by a bunch of straight white men and cartoons have a more diverse set of writers. You are falling for corporate bullshit. Rey was made by a bunch of white guys to appeal to a new demographic. Straight white men should not be creating all the female characters, women directors should. Do you really think big companies run by pedophiles and rapists (Walt Disney himself was both of these) give a fuck about women? They care about generating a profit, thats it. Star Wars has tanked because its been lazily cobbled together, not because its fanbase hate a female protagonist.

Rey is the same as Anakin down to being a slave as a child, the only difference is she was never pulled out as a child, she grew up in that situation and likely had to learn to remove her emotions as a result.",swanfirefly,2019-10-30 03:14:16,2019-10-30 03:14:17,/r/Feminism/comments/doqp7c/sometimes_you_need_to_reframe/f5rxajn/,t1_f5rfo2r,Feminism,1,1,2019-10-30 03:14:17,0.00347,2e-05,0.00017,0.0016,0.0011,9e-05,0.00048,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They want to keep the power they have because they can't legitimately gain power without using privilege. Which is why I love the Labour Party (Yeah I'm British oh and I'm also a man but that doesn't mean I can't be a feminist 🙂) because if shortlisting candidates or if any board is choosing a Candidate for some reason they preference people from working class backgrounds and they always strive for diverse shortlists or just a diverse range of candidates so when we the members get the vote we will always have someone to vote for who will represent us and won't only have to choose between which rich, white man to vote for. We also always have a woman's officer at Branch Level, at CLP, at Constituency Level, at Regional Level and Nationally. You also have LGBTQI+ Reps at all levels. You won't see any reps for racial issues however within the party you have organisations who look after people of the same race or religion to prevent xenophobia, racism, Islamophobia, and anti-Semitism. You won't find a more diverse range of mechanisms and organisations to protect minorities within the Party and that's what makes Labour so good. They recognise and celebrate our diversity and make sure it is protected. You won't be challenged to find powerful strong women within the Party, for example the Shadow Secretary of Education Angela Rayner. A fantastic person who has come from a family in Poverty to a leading Woman in politics. Look at Diane Abbot. First Black Woman, well first Black Person as well, to speak for a Party at PMQs.

1546,5777,"It’s a term from fan fiction. It has to do with having a protagonist that’s a thinly veiled shoe-in for the author. Usually these characters start the story with little to no flaws. This kind of deflates any kind of character arc they can have because they’ve already “grown”. 

Instead, they’re faced with challenges that only require them to use their infinite power/wit to overcome. Makes for boring storytelling. 

Nowadays, it’s used by the literary experts of the internet to criticize any character that has any kind of power they feel is “overpowered” which is not a thing in storytelling. It’s a video game term to do with balance. These critics don’t consider that powerful characters don’t necessarily mean arcless characters. By that logic, Heracles is overpowered and all the character growth he goes through is meaningless because he’s able to kick anyone’s ass. 

Furthermore, the misinterpretation of Mary-Sue completely ignores character backstory or logical reasons for the character’s skills/abilities/powers. Rey fights with a staff, is strong in the Force etc but because people feel she is “overpowered” and didn’t “earn” her powers by training, she is a Mary-Sue. 

The real answer to this isn’t some in-universe explanation as to why: Star Wars isn’t real. That’s the reason why. She’s a character in a story about space wizards and evil empires. The audience was given logical reasons to accept her skills and they’ve chosen to reject them, as Star Wars fans commonly do with anything new. And seeing as how everyone on the internet has a Master’s in Literature and Storytelling, they’ve interpreted her character to be a Mary-Sue and it apparently TOTALLY doesn’t have anything to do with her gender and the fact that Mary-Sue is a girl’s name.",Gap1293,2019-10-29 23:20:03,2019-10-29 23:20:13,/r/Feminism/comments/doqp7c/sometimes_you_need_to_reframe/f5rawhq/,t1_f5r7zqv,Feminism,1,1,2019-10-29 23:20:13,0.08754,0.00019,0.03536,0.00188,0.00699,0.00019,0.06986,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1561,5805,"you take scriptures and act as if theyre inherently bad and patriarchal when thats your perspective thats making you think they are. there are some meanings lost in translations to english form hebrew and greek. 
 
These verses are all  taken completely out of context and context is SO so so important so we dont misunderstand something. within the bible or not. context is always important in all aspects of life
Leviticus were old laws written for the culture at that time to separate the Jews (Gods people) from the rest of society at the time. These laws werent meant for eternity. Clearly because Jesus provided a new covenant.

Women were the final thing God created. And he created her perfectly. she is considered the crown of creation, the final piece needed. Women can birth life, and can speak into people differently than men can. not less than them, but equal. 
God took adams rib to form her, representative of her being taken from his side, not his feet to be below her or his head to be under her, but BESIDE him. symbolizing 2 equal parts.


God gives a curse to man as equal as is to woman in genesis. but if you have a biased perspective, it isnt going to help you read beyond the surface level of scripture.

The verse right after the wives submit to husbands thats also in ephesians, states for

""Husbands to love your wife as christ loves the church, his body and is himself its saviour.""

which mirrors Christs sacrifice for us. Husband is supposed to love and act in the same way.
So that is equal parts in submission/sacrifice to eachother.

Scriptures about women not being able to teach were from paul and his own patriarchal opinions. not God. Many women have been called to preach and council others and they live full lives doing so. so obviously God is ok with that. And throughout the bible there were women who were given authoritative, history altering roles. 
God gave women roles to teach. Paul isnt God and he stated those things about women that you quoted. There are multiple times in his writings where he states he is speaking from his own opinion as well and not from God.

Many of the New Testament books were letters paul wrote to early churches at the time. they were specific letters for the churches specific struggles and shit they had going on there that truly was some crazy stuff and outta line with Jesus' teachings.",bbarrettart,2019-11-02 15:57:59,2019-11-02 17:12:20,/r/Feminism/comments/dp2r80/hot_take_being_a_christian_and_being_a_feminist/f66fele/,t3_dp2r80,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-02 17:12:20,0.01609,0.0011,0.00422,0.01501,0.00357,0.00084,0.00157,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1591,5853,"Quoting Dr Ed Dutton on feminization of universities...

""The universities used to be about nurturing genius. You'd get these, who is it that is geniuses, who is it that solves these amazing problems, people who have outlier high IQ plus moderately anti-social personality. People like James Watson, those people will tend to do what they do because they are highly intelligent so they can really conceive of these difficult problems. They're moderately low in conscientiousness so that means can sort of think outside the box so they're not bound by rules traditions or conformity. They're moderately low in agreeableness so they either don't care that they offend people or they're kinda autistic or a bit spergy and they couldn't conceive that they would offend people even if they didn't want to. New ideas will always offend so they don't care about that so they come up with brilliant ideas. Now women are the opposite of that. Women are the exact opposite of that, they are the opposite of genius. Well, A because women don't have outlier high IQ; the female IQ is bunched towards the mean. And B they tend to be higher in conscientiousness than men and higher in agreeableness than men, so you just DON'T GET many female geniuses. So when they take over university which is happening they will come across as the MUCH better candidate for the job than this kinda autistic wierdo who might if you leave him alone for ten years might come up with something brilliant. Who are you going to employ? Him or this girl who is positive, confident, outgoing... OBVIOUSLY you're going to employ her. So it changes the whole nature of academia. So academia doesn't become about the cut and thrust of debate and harsh disputation to get to the truth, it becomes about cooperating and being kind and creating a bureaucracy where you make incremental steps and publish every so often and this is A anathema to genius types and B very difficult for genius, because they are a bit autistic and will offend people so they get pushed out of uni. and this is happening. "" because of women in university they have changed the WHOLE CULTURE of university to make it where TRUTH is plays second fiddle to Cooperating and everyone feeling good and happy and getting along. whereas truth is amoral of course and doesn't care...""

""Female empowerment will make you less harsh to outsiders, more cooperative to outsiders, it will take the institutions of society which have adapted to and elivated the (masculine) martial values which help us survive and it will make those more feminin and kind and loving, and therefor it wont prepare people for the battle that is group selection.""",some1arguewithme,2019-11-02 13:08:59,2019-11-02 13:15:09,/r/Feminism/comments/dqe7n4/this_video_is_really_cool/f6593j3/,t3_dqe7n4,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-02 13:15:09,0.00402,2e-05,0.00018,0.00213,0.00127,6e-05,0.00043,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

&gt;Although pregnant women are typically more likely to have male babies than female babies at a ratio of 100 girls to 105 boys, which is known as the sex ratio, the study found that women who are psychologically stressed had two male births for every three female births.  
&gt;  
&gt;The results were more drastic for pregnant women who showed signs of physical stress: for every four male births, women had nine female births.

If men want sons, it's important for them to be very kind and caring to their wives.  Instead, primitive misogynistic cultures tend to beat and abuse their wives, leading to sex selection effects, especially on a demographic level.  The resulting abundance of daughters does make it easier for sons to be married off; there is, unfortunately, a biological reason for the historic association of abusive cultures and polygyny.

1632,5910,"Ok this is one of my favorite half-responses that seemingly undermines both the capacity of women to hold agency AND the social engineering of the last 47 years (using Title IX as a line of demarcation). 

1) the argument is that there is a pay gap. The data indicates there isn’t when you control for relative age and experience. This needs to be addressed because to assert that there is a gap one has to strain credulity to interpret the data in such a dishonest manner it defies reason.

2) if you allow that there is no pay gap for like work and then argue that the “career choice” gap is the fulcrum on which the arm of oppression swings then you belittle the choices women make to do, well, whatever it is they want to do. Every study done ever (slight exaggeration) has found that women prefer to extreme degrees to leave the workforce and take primary caretaker duties for children. This is something that’s very hard to argue around. If the argument is that society is just that goood at tricking all the woulda-been high earners into raising babies then you seem to presume women are so incapable of advocating for themselves that they would as a broad demographic be unfit for leading anything. Or, I would argue, it’s probably a lot to do with biology and the way hormones change with women when they bear children.

3) to argue socialization explains the career choice gap and thus the earning gap (no discussion about the myriad fields in which women out-earn men, of course) is also possibly the most damning indictment of the failure of post-Title IX social policy imaginable.  Freed slaves were ascending the ranks of social class and achievement in the first decade post-slavery, by 1915 or so you had entire enclaves of high black achievement within two generations of literal enslavement. Women haven’t been held in bondage in nearly a century and a half (and even then it wasn’t more than 5-10% of all women) and we’re still hearing about the totalitarian oppression of women despite having had the vote for a century and having surpassed male academic attainment some 15-20 years ago (using base-level attainment as HS Diploma and a BA/BS, men still receive the bulk of the terminal degrees, of course). All this despite hundreds of millions of dollars of spending by the state and millions more by advocacy organizations and Madison Ave firms selling the “Future is Female” branding on cheaply made Nike t-shirts. Virtually every school in the country has a “women who X” club or group for math, coding, running, sporting, etc and we still see these broad divergences in life choices. Is the solution to spend millions more or are we at some point going to concede that maybe there’s something to the differences in life preferences that breaks down on a sex/gender line? 

It doesn’t mean that women should be treated poorly, it means that we should treat them as equally capable of making their own choices and not spend precious dollars and time begging people to struggle against their own interests and desires.",ChanceSiscoTheRapper,2019-11-01 05:52:58,2019-11-01 05:52:59,/r/Feminism/comments/dcdzec/i_hate_getting_this_question/f5ztt1i/,t1_f295cmp,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-01 05:52:59,0.00639,8e-05,0.00047,0.00693,0.00156,0.00021,0.00071,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1633,5911,"Did you ever have a response for the point that there can be no wage gap if wages (as in the compensation offered per unit of productivity be it hours or widgets or whatever) are roughly equal? There absolutely exists an earnings gap but this is better explained by life choices and priorities. 

As to the talk about “women’s work as a whole” I’m not sure I understand your meaning (unless you’re referring to total earnings in which case see above). If you’re talking about “men’s jobs” and “women’s jobs” I’d love to know more a bit about how you came to those categories and what data you’re using to back up the claim that there’s an indication of a compensation gap when one controls for relative age and experience.

Re: leadership - I think distilling it down to the standard distribution of IQ amongst men and women is really surface-level analysis but there is a decent logic to the idea that when you look at traits and behaviors that often make up “leaders” you tend to see them more highly correlated with men/males.

""Dohn't worry, this is just a routine checkup to make sure your fertility is at least average, and that you don't have the cahncer."" 

His fingers then poked and prodded my tight ass until they found that sweet spot. I tried, and failed, to conceal a small gasp when my prostate was at first lightly tickled. And the doctor was right, it did only hurt for a few seconds. Then, what was at first pain, became embarassing pleasure as my own medical practitioner fingered my asshole for what was surely only medical reasons. Surely. The pleasure mounted more and more as his fingers somehow worked a magic I never new existed within my body. It was then I realised I had a chub on. Really? Did... did I actually enjoy this? But then, with that, the magic stopped as my doctor slid his fingers out of my body and assured me that my prostate was indeed a healthy size. 

""Th-thanks,"" I managed to studder as I tried to hide my growing member, ""I hope that wasn't too much trouble.""

1668,5969,"""44 As for your male and female slaves whom you may have—you may acquire male and female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you. 45Then, too, it is out of the sons of the sojourners who live as aliens among you that you may gain acquisition, and out of their families who are with you, whom they will have produced in your land; they also may become your possession. 46You may even bequeath them to your sons after you, to receive as a possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your countrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over one another."" (Leviticus 25: 44-46)

So God leads them out of slavery yet tells them it's ok to own slaves? You're God just told his people it's ok to own another human being as property. 

""20 If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies at his hand, he shall be punished. 21If, however, he survives a day or two, no vengeance shall be taken; for he is his property."" (Exodus 21: 20-21)

Not only is it ok to own slaves as long as they don't die it is ok to beat them also! 

Before you come at me with some ""But that's the old Testament"" crap I have this for you: 

""For I am the LORD, I change not."" (Malachi 3:6)

""God is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind."" (Numbers ×3:19)

So if God viewed Slavery as ok in those times then he must still do because as you just read he does not change. 

Also the New Testament advocates for slavery also: 

""Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ."" (Epheaians 6:5)

So yeah there you have it. You might say that a couple verses later it says for masters to treat their slaves fairly but it does not change the fact that a human owning another human as property is wrong no matter how you try to spin it. In both testamants the Bible regulates slavery. I don't want to be a part of such a religion. Ever.

1809,6152,"I definitely agree with you there, comrade. I think the dialogue between anarchists an ML’s in the USSR was very poor and that lead to the Marxist Leninist repression of anarchists, and it still resonates today. 

The eventual goal of all communism, ML or Ancom, is global unification. I think once we get there anarchism will be easily possible. However, in our current political climate, I don’t think an anarchist society can put up a fight against imperialism and fascism. Sure, if the first anarchist country we’re to be the US then the world wouldn’t have as many imperialists to fear. However, this seems far fetched and I’m not necessarily concerned with how well the richest country on earth fares. I think until we can defeat western imperialism anarchists will have to trust MLS to get us there

Most communist revolutions happen in countries who cannot defend themselves against imperialism outside the countries walls. That’s why MLS believe we have to create national militaries and planned economies for quick economic growth. For instance, in Bolivia, Evo Morales did not assemble a national military of the native South American population to combat the still standing (after 14 years) fascist military, which lead to his eventual coup. He had no way to defend himself against a fascist military coup, and all it takes is a little CIA magic to make the world, including anarchists, think the takeover is justified (of course, ancoms always realize it was a coup after the fact unlike the global right wing who will never figure it out and defend the coup to their dying days)

I think AnCom society can be achieved, you’ll just have to trust us MLs long enough for us to defeat imperialism, together. However, when ancoms cheer on obvious fascist coup attempts against standing socialist governments, that’s when the dialogue begins to dissolve. We have to trust each other eventually or we’ll never get anywhere . I’m not saying we have to stand hand in hand forever and always. All we have to do is stomp out imperialism together and then you can overthrow the ML government for all I care. The ideal world has already been achieved at that point, and anarcho-communism can thrive",jimmyk22,2019-11-17 18:54:17,2019-11-17 20:20:24,/r/Feminism/comments/dxa16d/be_the_ceo_your_parents_always_wanted_you_to_marry/f7upn13/,t1_f7ucp8w,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-17 20:20:24,0.01286,1e-05,0.00039,0.00145,0.00223,9e-05,0.00011,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1845,6199,"It frightens me that you would boil down such a multi-faceted issue into a reductivist sound bite. It is true that IvyPark clothes were reported to be using sweatshops in Sri Lanka - their employees were paid 64¢/hour and there were reports of worker abuse. Further investigations uncovered that this was the case across the board with clothing made by IvyPark's business partner Topshop. 


In fact last year Beyonce bought out Topshop's share of the company so that she [could come sever ties with them entirely](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/11/15/beyonce-ivy-park/) and run her business in a way that actually reflects her morals. 

⁣
As Sophie Slater, co-founder of Birdsong an ethical, feminist brand, [ponts out](https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/18/beyonce-ivy-park-harsh-lives-garment-makers-fashion-branding-consumers): ""across the fashion industry in general many workers are paid pennies an hour, and living and sleeping in cramped compounds – no one can deny the level of exploitation that is endured for the sake of leisurewear. So to pin the blame on Beyoncé is absurd, and perhaps yet another example of the double standards that women of colour face in the fashion industry.""


""Picking on the alleged cruelty behind Beyoncé’s new line of leotards as a personal failing of hers distracts us from the larger issue at hand. While people would be right to note the irony of a brand that commodifies “empowerment” yet is made by women on a poverty wage (80% of garment makers are women, after all), the icon isn’t to blame – it’s our entire fashion industry.""


""It would also be naive to assume that Beyoncé is any different from most stars or designers at the top of a big brand campaign. A quick look inside most “special range” labels will show clothing made in Bangladesh, the country with the highest density of sweatshops in the world. In fact, unless your label explicitly states otherwise, your clothes were probably made in a sweatshop. Whether in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka or even Leicester, underpaid workers in poor conditions make most of the clothes we wear.""


""Beyoncé might not have done much to change this situation as an individual, but we have the power as consumers to challenge all brands, and the systems that profit from exploitation. The solution lies in supporting brands that do things differently.""",ducaelion,2019-11-10 07:39:25,2019-11-10 07:39:26,/r/Feminism/comments/du1nxu/beyoncé_the_idol_of_bourgeois_liberal_feminists/f72ofsz/,t3_du1nxu,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-10 07:39:26,0.00451,2e-05,0.00017,0.00247,0.001,7e-05,0.00059,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1855,6214,"&gt; Where are you from if you don't mind me asking? 

Ages 0-to-11 in Venezuela, 11-to-23 in Canada with a brief diversion to Australia. But within Canada, I live in Alberta, which is like the Texas of Canada in a lot of (exhausting) ways. 

&gt;What made you feel that your intellectual gifts were devalued? How did the teachers respond when you asked for more challenging math tuition?

I went from Honor's student in Venezuela to ""behind everyone"" in Canada while I was learning English, and then went back to Honor's student within a year. In my first year, I asked a teacher for extra math, and I got it, but I was very disorganized, and so even though I finished every assignment within the day, I kept forgetting to hand them in until far later in the year. She was the only teacher who actually tried to push me in any way in Canada (in grade 6).

Then, the next year, the next teacher just... refused. For some reason. I don't remember why, I just remember that I told her I was bored doing math and... I think she just said math was supposed to be boring, or something? I don't know. 

Then the next year, the teacher gave five of the boys advanced math questions. And I asked, and asked, and asked, and I never got any advanced math to do until like, the last week of classes. This is the same teacher who, when I asked how I was supposed to write with a broken finger on a test, told me ""you don't write left-handed"" (I am left-handed, have always been left-handed, I would literally swap crayons from my right to my left hand when I was 2 years old). He said he was giving advanced questions to the students who were better at math. But I literally had better math grades than three of those boys, so that was some bullshit.

Throughout those two years in that school (grades 7 and 8), basically anytime a teacher talked to me about anything that wasn't me lifting my hand up in class to ask or answer a question, it was to tell me to put on a hoodie, or to dress more modestly. I'd been wearing tank tops as casual clothes my whole life, but in ages 11-through-13 I developed DDs, and suddenly tank tops weren't ""appropriate"" for me anymore. Even though they were appropriate for my flatter classmates. The literal same clothing. I was also bullied a lot and they kind of did nothing about that, which is fucked up in retrospect even though I didn't realize it at the time. 

In Australia, I was at an all girl's school, and the math teacher was nice there, but wasn't really interested in pushing me, and after three years of that bullshit, I had just kind of given up on getting math teachers to give me something not-boring to do. Thankfully, we also had computing classes, and while everyone else was learning incredibly basic stuff like how to customize things in Word, the computing teacher *there* noticed that I was really good, and I did a Flash animation with buttons that did things and everything. He encouraged me to get into computers, and I was really into them for a few months because of that.

Then I moved back to Canada, and that's when (after spending 4 years of not learning new math) I had a really hard time with doing grade 10 math after the first few weeks or so. Then I had a really hard time doing grade 11 math, because I still hadn't re-learned how to pay attention in math class, because I'd spent the last four years not paying attention and acing the classes anyway. And then I realized I could apply to university without doing grade 12 math, so I just didn't do it. 

In university, I ended up doing some formal logic and set theory stuff. And I aced stats easily and tutored it for three years. I taught myself R, and had no problem acing a MATLAB course. But I never actually tried to do more advanced stuff until my last year of uni with formal logic because... well, because it didn't seem to matter. And I was behind, now, my math talent had been neglected for so long that it didn't feel like it was ""worth it"" to deal with that kind of... dismissal, again.

But then I *really really liked* formal logic, even though it was kicking my ass the whole semester through. And now I'm looking for jobs, and nobody wants to hire me with a BASc in Philosophy and Psychology, and I just keep thinking that I don't want to take on *more* debt, but if I had just swapped Psychology out for Statistics or something, I wouldn't be 70+ job applications in, unemployed and feeling unemployable.",Eager_Question,2019-11-10 04:56:23,2019-11-10 04:56:24,/r/Feminism/comments/dsdjxr/for_the_first_time_in_history_girls_won_all_five/f72g10v/,t1_f6zeeww,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-10 04:56:24,0.09796,0.00014,0.12861,0.00071,0.01153,0.00019,0.00151,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Numbers are probably of because they were taken from a site for Sri Lankan reports, but the math is solid. Also, the wages can be enough to sustain single-person households. With two people working, these numbers exceed the minimum for familial support, so if the report are correct, these conditions should be okay to work on for supporting financial need. However, assuming they are wrong and people have greater need than the government reports, these 50-60 hour working conditions may not be not suitable for working (though people work similar good in factories here with higher compensation). They may also have different needs. But the numbers are correct and have been at least since 2016.

&gt;The sexual consent form includes an “Accidental Violation” section to ensure the safety and protection of both parties involved. Furthermore, the “Failure to Perform” section recognizes the possibility of an inability to perform the activities listed on the form and does not consider this a violation of the agreement.


Nothing about revoking consent, only ‘failure to perform’ and a space for accidental violation?!?

They mean ‘accidental’ sexual assault, which assumes that intent decides assault, it does not.

That goes as much for race as it does for gender.  And with some of the comments about masculinity, that's how it can feel, like it's a generalisation that some people think is the rule.  The concern I always had was that it's something that's just going to be assumed about me until I prove otherwise, when I feel like I've spent my entire life proving it already (although with my fair share of failings too).  That's not a good feeling, to potentially have a stereotype applied to you that you don't think applies.  It's something feminists have rightly fought against for decades now.  Saying something like, ""Women marry men for money"" for example... I can later qualify that by saying 'of course I don't mean all women, just the bad ones' but the original statement is going to be perceived as a generalisation about women altogether, and an unfair one.  The natural reaction is going to be to say that it's not a fair  depiction of  women, because many of them don't engage in that behaviour.  I don't think it would be fair to then turn around and say ""if you're protesting, it's because you are one!""

1987,6431,"You're welcome! I just thought of something else I'd like to mention: in the BDSM community as I've experienced it, there's a concept known as ""[aftercare](https://hellogiggles.com/news/what-is-aftercare-bdsm-fifty-shades/)"". It's mentioned during some classes, but the most significant thing (to me) about it isn't some ""technique"", more that there's this premise that the recovery from intense emotions and stimuli associated with BDSM is an important part of the practice.

From the link:

&gt;The care is usually focused on the Submissive (the person who receives the stimuli during a BDSM scene) but it can also be performed for the Dom. It is as much about physical comfort as it is emotional support. The aftereffects of a long and intense scene can range from cuts and bruises, to anxiety and discomfort following the drop from an intense surge in endorphins. So taking time for care is essential.

&gt;The first step in aftercare is to carefully move the partner being pampered to a warm and cozy setting. Partners’ states of mind during BDSM play isn’t always set in reality.

1998,6450,"Youth: Transgender People Should Use Bathroom They’re Most Comfortable In

Transgender rights continue to be under threat in several states, but a new study reveals that young people’s views may conflict with older Americans when it comes to bathroom policies affecting transgender individuals.
Rainbow restroom graphic
Young people clash with older adults when it comes to bathroom policies related to gender identity, a new University of Michigan study suggests.

As an increasing number of “bathroom bills” are debated around the country, eight in 10 young people aged 14-24 years polled (79%), say that bathroom use by transgender people should not be restricted, according to the findings in the Journal of Homosexuality.


The findings are in sharp contrast to a recent Gallup poll that surveyed 1,017 Americans ages 18 and over which found that about half (51%) of surveyed adults think transgender individuals should use the bathroom that correlates with the gender they were assigned at birth.

Michigan researchers analyzed data from 683 respondents of a weekly text messaging survey, “MyVoice,” which includes youth from across the U.S., but predominately from Southeast Michigan. 

“Contrary to current policy in many schools, the young people we polled do not support restrictions on bathroom use by transgender people,” says lead author Halley Crissman, M.D., M.P.H., an obstetrician gynecologist at the U-M Von Voigtlander Women’s Hospital.

“The majority of respondents believe bathroom use is a personal and private decision and a matter of equality, freedom and human rights. This suggests that young people’s views on bathroom use by transgender individuals differ from the narratives often represented in public debates.”

Young people in support of the right of transgender people to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable with also said that transgender people are not sexual predators, and that forcing them to use particular bathrooms may put transgender people at risk.

**Clashing views**
Crissman says researchers decided to explore the issue based on previous data suggesting that as a whole, young people may be becoming more accepting of people who are transgender. 

“The adult dialogue we hear in the media often includes a lot of fear and guesswork about how this issue may impact children in schools,” she says.

“We wanted to tap into the beliefs, experiences and voices of youth surrounding current policies. Youth are the ones most impacted by school policies and they are also upcoming voters.”

An estimated 150,000 13-24 year olds in the U.S. identify as transgender, previous data suggests. Nearly 60 percent of transgender youth say they have been required to use the restroom corresponding with the gender they were assigned at birth, and 70 percent report avoiding public bathrooms because of feeling unsafe and uncomfortable.

**Peer support**
Crissman says that research shows that transgender youth who grow up in social situations where they feel supported in their gender identity have improved mental health outcomes—including rates of depression similar to those of non-transgender youth.

Given that social support impacts the mental health outcomes of transgender youth, experts say peer support is likely an important factor.

“If there is indeed peer support among youth for allowing transgender individuals to use bathrooms that match their gender identity – as our study suggests – there may be profound positive implications for upcoming generations of transgender youth,” Crissman says.

“Children spend a lot of time in school every day with peers— peer support really matters and has the potential to significantly impact the well-being of transgender youth.”

Even the tone of discussions around current policies in the news could influence psychological stress experienced by people who are transgender.

Says Crissman: “While transgender youth continue to face harassment at levels far beyond peers, the school environment may gradually be becoming a less hostile space for these students.”",Yeahmaybeitsdetritus,2019-11-25 02:49:55,2019-11-25 05:10:46,/r/Feminism/comments/e19iif/study_suggests_young_peoples_views_may_conflict/f8nq8t1/,t3_e19iif,Feminism,2,1,2019-11-25 05:10:46,0.01744,5e-05,0.00015,0.03124,0.00194,0.00013,0.00229,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To elaborate: in a case where we are discussing an active predator, someone who has so far escaped any real punishment, who benefits from the distinction? Not those who have suffered similarly, the definition doesn’t change their trauma. Not those looking to raise awareness of the issue, it turns the discussion to semantics.

The only people who truly benefit are the abuser and the people supporting him.

Christianity is filled with many illusions of choice. These are options that *seem* like freedom, free will, and choices but actually aren't. For god, for example, to say ""Believe in me, worship me, love me, and let me forgive you...or else it's straight to hell with you"" is a non-choice. It's more of a threat, really. For what occurred in Eden, Adam and Eve were incapable of making informed choices. They didn't know any better, were given a non-explanation of what it was, and were mentally children. A nonchoice in the same way we recognize that children are not capable of making certain decisions.

The Tree of Knowledge is an allegory for how knowledge tarnishes innocence. One is no longer 'pure' as they are marked by the experiences of adulthood and with adulthood comes knowledge and experience.This becomes even more blatant as one of the first punishments is to force Eve to bear children in pain, a mark of adulthood in pre-modern times.

I feel casting out your children from their home, forcing half of them through the pain of labor, and presenting their future descendants with the nonchoice of choosing either him or hell is incredibly abusive, yes. That's not getting into any of the crazy stuff god justifies in later chapters either.

Women are continuously throughout the Bible told they are second best to men. This is not one verse but many. 

As noted by my flair, I believe as a feminist and ex-Christian that religion and particularly Christianity, has been a crucial piece for subjugating women. Prior to its development, we saw a number of pagan religions where women played more important roles as any number of goddesses. Not only are women stripped of positions of power in Christianity but the religion has a history of stealing elements from these prior religions. My goal here is not to dissuade you from being religious, but to defend my points and showcase how and why I've come to my own beliefs.

At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul. First A) God did gravely punish man, taking away his immortality and forcing him to have to live off the very land he lived on until he died. Unlike the garden of Eden where he had unlimited food and would never die. B) No they weren't mentally children as it is implied that they had spent quite sometime living in the garden before committing the first sin. C) God was very warchful of them, gave them everything they needed to live in paradise, and loved them as they were his creation. And D) The both are very much to blame as at any point they could have denied there temptations as it was against what god wanted.

2018,6492,"Here we have a demonstration of how both Adam and Eve are the sources of sin. Notice how the female one is more to blame and thus paints the rest of 'her sex' in a lesser light, a concept that is gleefully taken advantage of throughout the Bible. Specifically Eve was tempted first and not, say, the two of them unanimously or jointly deciding to first eat the apple.

In this story, we get a disproportionate punishment towards two people who are mentally children because their dad is a shitty father. What god does here is the modern day equivalent of putting pot brownies in the center of the room, telling them not to eat them, and then leaving them home alone with no babysitter. Then when he comes home he casts his children out of their home and physically punishes specifically his daughter. Then we call this 'forgiveness.' 

So yes, I would say Eve did nothing wrong. She was manipulated, abandoned by her father, and didn't have the mental capacity to know any better.",Ruefully,2019-11-24 19:16:12,2019-11-24 20:28:34,/r/Feminism/comments/dz16bx/when_religion_meets_misogyny/f8lka1x/,t1_f8kprtu,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-24 20:28:34,0.34301,0.00221,0.1719,0.01397,0.16835,0.00069,0.05263,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Have you thought about seeing a counselor or someone else regarding your experience? This isn't a silly thing for you, it is something that represented a real tangible problem for you growing up. I don't have a lot of advice for you, I just want to tell you that you are welcome in the feminist space. TERFs are not feminists, they use feminism to propogate hate against other people. And I know you know that, but I want you to know that I know that, and the vast majority of feminists know that. We do not support TERFs. But we do support you. All people have a right to dignity, to a voice, and to take up space. This means that TERFs have a voice as well, but the more we promote inclusivity and support, the more their cause looks like the pile of trash it is. 

I grew up in a homophobic household. But as time wore on and my parents were exposed to different people, they realized they didn't have anything to fear. They are now very supportive of gay rights. I am not saying that this is possible with your mom, because she is the one that has to want to change and it is not up to you. But it is possible. These negative feelings she holds are coming from somewhere, and it could be that she learns how wrong she is. If she doesn't, that isn't your burden to bear. Her actions and thoughts reflect on her, not on you. While it is easy to say that, it is extremely difficult to live it.

Hmmm I think I see what you mean with the breast. 
The one on the left has a heavier shadow because it is nearer to her friend, blocking some of the light. The left breast has more light on top because that’s the only place light is able to hit it from that angle. The one on the right and the rest of her body has more direct light shining across it, so I did not make the shadow as bold.

I am someone who has mental and physical disabilities myself, as well as chronic illness. I look like a healthy neurotypical cisgender 25 year old, but I am not. There are plenty of “conventionally attractive” disabled, ill, gay, diverse, and transgender people out there. I get your point though and will try to incorporate more diversity into my work. 
I actually started using a lot of texture because of my own disabilities. I have no sense of smell whatsoever (anosmia), little sense of taste, almost no hearing in my left ear, and vision loss due to my autoimmune condition. Because of this I wanted to start making art that everyone can experience. I think maybe if I add enough texture even the colorblind and blind can enjoy my work or see depth in it. Having ADHD means I can be a little sensory motivated in the first place. Every time I tour a museum I resist the urge to touch everything, I think most people do. I want to make art that even the visually or sensory impaired can enjoy because of literal texture and feeling. Maybe I can somehow spin this to include disabled representation.",p0uringrain,2019-11-04 06:25:23,2019-11-04 08:23:12,/r/Feminism/comments/dqw3f9/i_made_this_piece_about_censorship_of_art_and/f6hhl76/,t1_f6gra98,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-04 08:23:12,0.02366,0.0014,0.001,0.02415,0.00503,0.00202,0.00207,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2059,6563,I actually added texture to her hair on the left and made their hues quite different to indicate they are not both white. I also tried to incorporate stronger more pronounced features as opposed to a dainty and softer ones to make their faces unique. You can see the individual long thin braids or dreads on the left if you pay attention to their different hair texture. I wonder if the dappled spotting I added to their faces takes away from this? That was inspired by little soft spots on fawns. I wanted to make them a more innocent and I enjoyed the texture.

“When my mother was pregnant 

with her second child i was four

i pointed at her swollen belly confused at how

my mother had gotten so big in such little time

my father scooped me in his tree trunk arms and

said the closest thing to god on this earth

is a woman’s body it’s where life comes from

and to have a grown man tell me something 

so powerful at such a young age

changed me to see the entire universe

rested at my mother’s feet”

2076,6591,"I read everything you guys had to say &amp; appreciate all of it. To those who liked my piece &amp; understood it in some way, thank you. To those of you who were offended or didn’t appreciate it, I would like the opportunity to elaborate a little. Please excuse my grammar &amp; spelling. I’m dyslexic and my talents obviously lie in the arts.  

 I’m a 25 year old bisexual female with ADHD, PTSD, an eating disorder that has gone on for 12 years, and chronic illness. I have a rare and deadly autoimmune condition that prevents me from being able to take psyche drugs. This autoimmune condition has also caused my sense of smell to be destroyed (anosmia), my left ear to go deaf, and my vision to deteriorate. I am likely infertile and will be pursuing treatment on the 15th after a year of unsuccessful attempts at pregnancy. I am white and my mother immigrated here from Russia after the fall of communism. 
I guess I feel I had to explain myself so people could see that while I am privileged by being white, I have had struggles and my own disabilities. 

I want you to try to think of all of the famous female painters or visual artists you know that are considered greats. I am a self proclaimed artist and can only name two off the top of my head. Georgia O'Keeffe and Frida Kahlo. They were women who really broke the mold &amp; stepped out of the box. That isn’t a lot of ladies influencing history and society with their art. We have Warhol, Dali, Van Gogh, Picasso ENDLESS male painters who were “different” and made people contemplate things. I guess that’s what I’m trying to do. Make people scratch their heads a bit. Force people to listen to my tiny voice by making graphic art about femininity. 

I chose a lotus flower because it symbolizes femininity, the vagina, womanhood, and birth in many cultures and religions. I myself am struggling with infertility when everyone around me is starting families or questioning my fiancé and I. The petals on Georgia O’Keeffe’s flower paintings always remind me of gorgeous blooming vaginas. Folds and lips nestled between lovely velvety petals. If I painted a simple vagina people would insist my art was pornography, regardless of my intent. 

I can understand why people could be offended by their chests, so let’s play devils advocate and say my nymphs do have fake breasts. Maybe feeling feminine and beautiful to them required changing themselves. I knows I hate the body I’m in and I won’t likely recover from my ED. Binging, purging, and starving has destroyed my body and mind for many years. I don’t find anything wrong with changing yourself for yourself if it is healthy. I actually liked to think that with the flower in place of her genitals that these women could be transgender. You can say her vagina is a flower or that a flower covers the space behind it. You can interpret it however you want. Transgender breasts are not natural, but they are just as beautiful and valid even when round and gravity defying. Sex workers are no less beautiful or valid for choosing to change their bodies either. To shame a fake chest is to shame women who don’t deserve scrutiny over their chosen happiness. 
I am glad I offended some people though. Art is subjective. It is allowed to be offensive and beautiful all at once. In my opinion art is best when it makes you feel something. I would rather you hate it than not pay it any mind. 

Finally I want to explain how this is about censorship. I am seeing more art, photography, and artist pages taken off of social media lately because of censorship. To be unable to post or share art somewhere because it depicts the human body or breasts is ridiculous. These silly things on our chests make people go nuts and forget the purpose of breasts, which isn’t sexual. With this piece I wanted to push nudity to the point of being almost offensive without actually making phonographic art. I wanted to make people question what is offensive about femininity and the female form. I used nymphs to add a modern spin and commentary on Pre-Raphaelite art. The church and high society used to commission religious paintings that depicted nudity or graphic violent/sexual acts. Now with media being so filled with graphic violence and pornography, people are concerned about censoring art and the female body. 
ANYWAYS I have rambled long enough. Thank you so much for reading all of this. If you’re interested in my art or wanna pick my brain my Instagram is third3yemermaid

Yes. I was groomed by a camp counselor. 
He was an English student and I was in Russia for the summer. I’m bilingual so he was able to target me and nobody was the wiser. My mother and grandmother even somehow had bad feelings about him. They reported him to the camp but I don’t know if anything happened. The memories only came screaming back at 24. 

It makes sense to me now that I got my period at age 9 (many young women who are molested begin puberty early.) It makes sense that I was intrigued by pornography and sexual content soon after. Hentai was the first pornography I saw. As a woman who has undergone sexual and interpersonal violence, hentai feels safely indulgent. It’s colorful and cute even when graphic. It’s bazaar to wrap my head around so I make art to articulate my thoughts better.

2102,6652,"Experiences of stigma and discrimination can dissuade sex workers from seeking mental health services, according to new research published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy. The study uncovered a “concerning level” of stigma facing sex workers who seek support from professional psychologists and psychiatrists.

“Sex workers face routine stigma and discrimination in all areas of society,” said study authors Josephine Rayson and Beatrice Alba of Monash University.

Rayson in particular witnessed “countless examples of sex workers facing negative treatment, stigma and discrimination, including by mental health professionals and in mental health settings” when she managed the Western Australian Sex Worker Organisation (Magenta).

 
“We don’t believe the general public are aware of just how extensive this kind of negative treatment is. Often the general public may assume that professionals like doctors, police, and mental health professionals (which may be accessed during a time of vulnerability) are always helpful and don’t cause harm. In reality, they can be a source of trauma for marginalised communities,” Rayson and Alba explained.

For the study, the researchers surveyed 189 current or former sex workers (ages 18 to 60 years) regarding their experiences of stigma and discrimination from a range of professionals. The participants were from 22 different countries, but the majority were born in Australia and the United States.

Approximately 64% of the participants said they had “sometimes,” “often,” or “always” experienced negative treatment, stigma, or discrimination in general because of their status as a sex worker.

Similarly, approximately 57% of participants who had sought mental health support said they had “sometimes,” “often,” or “always” experienced negative treatment, stigma, or discrimination from mental health professionals.

The researchers also found that experiences of stigma and discrimination were associated with a lower likelihood of seeking professional help. Approximately 79% of the sex workers said they would be very unlikely or less likely to seek mental health support in the future because of past experiences of stigma and discrimination.",Yeahmaybeitsdetritus,2019-11-05 16:42:50,2019-11-05 16:43:08,/r/Feminism/comments/ds1rn2/stigma_from_mental_health_professionals_could/f6mfl3f/,t3_ds1rn2,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-05 16:43:08,0.01018,0.00017,0.0008,0.00137,0.00233,0.00052,0.00091,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

&lt; The wage gap between male and female young high school graduates has narrowed since 2000, while the wage gap between male and female young college graduates has widened.
Stark wage disparities between men and women occur even at this early part of their careers, when they have fairly comparable labor market experience.
Among young high school graduates, women are currently paid 90 cents for every dollar paid to men (compared with 86 cents in 2000). Among young college graduates, women are paid 86 cents for every dollar paid to men (compared with 92 cents in 2000).
Young male college graduates earn 5.4 percent more than young male college graduates in 2000, while young female college graduates earn 2.2 percent less than young female college graduates in 2000. These gender wage discrepancies are primarily driven by faster wage growth for top-earning men than for top-earning women, which drives up the average male wage.",HastoEatSteak,2019-11-05 14:20:10,2019-11-05 14:20:20,/r/Feminism/comments/drn4ra/apply_for_the_jobs_ladies/f6ly9g5/,t1_f6ljbp2,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-05 14:20:20,0.00268,3e-05,0.00022,0.00177,0.00088,0.00011,0.0006,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rape culture, rape myth, state-sanctioned misogyny and rape cheerleading is responsible for that. Not mythical kink shaming culture. Rape victims are ashamed and oppressed by a trifecta system of heteropatriarchy-- state, law and culture. Your case is not an unique situation due to your sexual practices. Women and girls who get raped by their husbands, boyfriends, fathers, brothers, priests, teachers, police, politicians etc. experience that same oppression. In other words, oppression of rape victims is a universal fact. And you don't actually know if a lot of these murderd women were actually into BDSM. They are not alive to confirm that fact. Misogynists killed them and then victim blamed and dehumanised their dead bodies. And if indeed mythical ""kink shaming "" is responsible for these murders and your rape, then why on Earth males are not being murdered by women at the same rate? Why there are no women on women incidents? And why on Earth these incidents are a recent phenomenon ? People have been practicing BDSM for eons....and there are plenty of men who are sexual submissive and enjoy genital torture play and they are still not getting killed by their dominatrix.  

&gt;None has the right to talk hatefully about the idea of someone else participating in something that affects only the person participating. That's a body autonomy issue.

Dead wrong. There's nothing wrong with hating a sexual practic just as there's nothing wrong with loving it. You don't get to enjoy special treatment for your choice. Sorry. Right to hate a sexual practice is also a part of body autonomy.

Critique is very different from judging the phenomena as an absolute evil. At least where I live, BDSM communities are acutely aware of safety concerns, and any rumor of unsafe behavior means you are fairly quickly shunned. Lots and lots of education and discussion happens in BDSM communities. When 50 shades of grey came out, BDSM groups were the first to point out how the acts in it are against every guideline for safe conduct, and immediately distanced themselves, saying that the books and the movie are dangerously romanticizing behavior that is extremely problematic.

Problem comes with people, who are not aquatinted enough with the community or the concerns regarding a kink trying it out, and not understanding the risks involved. There has been a lot of shift with fetish communities trying to educate people about safe sexual practices, consent and boundaries due to this very issue. People not knowing what they are doing, and blaming it on the fetish damages all those who participate, as highlighted by this very discussion.",Northern_dragon,2019-11-22 07:52:48,2019-11-22 07:52:49,/r/Feminism/comments/dzo4w0/6bdsm_is_now_a_strategic_defense_for_men_in_the/f8as5v5/,t1_f89fli6,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-22 07:52:49,0.00259,0.0,0.00012,0.00031,0.00051,3e-05,0.00029,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

&gt;You want to take your BDSM practices to public spheres so that you can violate other non-consenting people's boundaries! What an asinine take!

I literally never said I wanted to take BDSM practices to public places. I said I want the **discussion** of BDSM issues, safety, and consent to happen publically instead of being hidden behind closed doors. Do not put words in my mouth.

I was accusing some of the people in this thread of kink-shaming me and the women who are dead (as well as the many other survivors, many of us don't report out of fear and shame). BDSM is never an excuse for someone ending up dead and the men who killed those women should be in prison for murder. What I am saying is that some of those women, specifically the ones who did consent to some type of BDSM (but obviously not death, I don't think I should have to say that but I am trying to be extra precise), could be alive today if society was more open and accepting about BDSM thus allowing them to seek help if things started getting out of hand. No, this would not have saved them all. Probably not even most of them.

BDSM is a variety of often erotic practices or roleplaying involving bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, sadomasochism, and other related interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practising BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent upon self-identification and shared experience.



The term ""BDSM"" is first recorded in a Usenet posting from 1991, and is interpreted as a combination of the abbreviations B/D (Bondage and Discipline), D/s (Dominance and submission), and S/M (Sadism and Masochism). BDSM is now used as a catch-all phrase covering a wide range of activities, forms of interpersonal relationships, and distinct subcultures.

Why are not men being murdered in ""rough sex gone wrong "" scenarios ? After all, plenty of men are sexual submissive and love dangerous sex plays such as CBT and breath play. But still, they are not being murdered by women at the same rate. There are 59 UK women and 7 men who've died in what the person accused claims is sex ""gone wrong"". All accused in these deaths are males. And a lot of these male murderers are actually getting away with this ""sex game gone wrong "" excuse.

Your rapist partner is the only one to blame here. No one else, especially women who hate BDSM or love BDSM. 

Women who love BDSM are suffering the consequence perpetuated  by heteropatriarchal pro-rape men and women who hate BDSM are being accused of ""kink shaming "" by those same afore-mentioned women.  Strange! No one is blaming those heteropatriarchal men. What women like you don't understand is that you yourselves are perpetuating the vicious cycle of victim blaming. You want to take your BDSM practices to public spheres so that you can violate other non-consenting people's boundaries! What an asinine take! Just as you have every right to love BDSM without any fatal consequences, another woman who hates BDSM also get to enjoy that same right. You are not more important than the other women. You like it or not. It's infuriating that so many  feminism appropriating handmaids adopt the pretense of intersectionality, socialism, anarchism so that they can advance their own brand of heteropatriarchy. This murdered woman is not the only victim, there are more of them. Here's a list of women who have been murdered by men due to ""rough sex"". Feel free to accuse these dead women of ""kink shaming "" you.

2187,6758,"As someone who has been hit with some amount of DARVO abuse myself, I'm familiar with that feeling of loving and empathizing with an abuser.  After I became sexually undesirable to a community that I'd been in touch with for a long prayer of polite political and philosophical discussions...  Well, my attempts to step back sexual engagement and form chaste friendships in that community weren't well-taken.  But I was blessedly never treated violently, just stalked and isolated by a whispering campaign.  It's not fun to become the target of a creative abuser's narratives.

I used to be a practicing polyamorous person.  Now?  Well, I'm still happily married, heh.  I miss being one of three, but I miss it quite abstractly.  I don't think my great antagonist was even the third part of that relationship...  I don't know.  I've never known.  I was stalked by unknown abusers.  Whoever they were, the only two things that have been confirmed to me by my own extensions in the whispering networks is that they did indeed recruit allies against me, and they hit me in my politics, claiming that my pro-technology positions, staunch anti-militarism, and defenses of honest government were a cover for secret violent bigotry.  It wasn't.  I actually consider the liberal regulatory state to be essential and underprovisioned for its work.

I'm looking forward to off-world settlement.  Off-world settlements will be dangerous places where there will be an authentic need-to-know about the details of peoples' lives.  Life support reasons, structural integrity, etc.  Narrow margins will empower more honest surveillance... and that means everyone will live in glass houses.  I want to know if people will still throw stones when their own misdeeds will be caught reliably.  I want to *live* that.  I've been treated as a liar, but I haven't been; I want that glass house experience.  It feels like safety now that I've seen what people do when they're allowed a darkness into which they can insert their own stories.  I've always been myself in the open, but it was internet-era openness; I was blogging and forum-going.  I want next-level openness now.  I could live my life behind glass... and I've *learned* that abusive people don't like to allow transparency for their victims.  Abusers tend to want the right to present their false histories as ""THE"" transparency that their victims get.  They want to jump in front and poison every well.

Well, I can live a glass house, and nobody who ever hurt me can say the same.  This person Meredith Stroud doesn't look like someone who can live in a glass house.  Perhaps Juniper Russo could live in a glass house.  I have to hope, as a weirdo futurist who thinks society is going to change pretty radically in the coming decades, that everyone who ever became a victim of false light gets to join me in the glasswall societies that I believe are going to start speckling the solar system.  Humanity can build societies of light and glass.",ShengjiYay,2019-11-22 02:18:39,2019-11-22 02:18:40,/r/Feminism/comments/dzchz9/a_bestselling_trans_authors_tweet_thread_about/f8a6mp8/,t3_dzchz9,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-22 02:18:40,0.04556,3e-05,0.00291,0.00059,0.00494,9e-05,0.01439,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here's the thing that has just gotten to me though: There are people, on this vary subreddit, pushing the narrative that blames the victims. Yes, the start post of the chain now has -20 points, but bellow that? There are posts that assume a dominant is always male and the submissive is always female; there are posts shaming pain play; there are posts shaming those who are, in their own words, ""stupid enough to allow someone to abuse \[them\] and physically harm \[them\]"".

These are the exact narratives that push those of us into BDSM, especially women, to hide it rather than talking publically about what is and is not acceptable in the community. Maybe I'm just overreacting, but these kinds of shaming narratives are exactly why one of my first 'serious' BDSM partners was able to get away with stepping over boundaries for as long as he did.

2230,6812,"Of course. If someone says ""oh, I could never ever have just have boring vanilla sex in missionary position. So boring!"" I would tell them to consider that statement again, that it can be hurtful to those who like sex best that way. It's judgemental and comes across as passive agressive. In fact I've called people out on making such sweeping statements. Sex positivity should be about expressing sexuality based on what the individual enjoys the best themselves. If it's just an extremely tender moment once in 3 years, nice. If it includes ropes and whips and latex and happens daily, nice. If it's absolutely never because they are asexual, neat. The sex positive movement has in many ways lost it's original purpose: that everyone enjoys. 

If I legally was allowed, I would personally castrate anyone, like the person in the article, who use kinks as an excuse to abuse. It's the exact opposite of how I would like to see people act sexually, I am ultimately always in the mindset that consent is needed for everything vaguely sexual, and killing someone is far from consent. So are the acts of all the other misogynistic abusers. I am incredibly sorry if you in your anger read into my messages in a way that came across as defending those who use fetishes as a gory excuse for murder, because why would I ever? I am defending those BDSM and otherwise kinkily aligned people, who set clear boundaries, respect their partners, would never imagine on slipping up with proper safe words and signals. Those who take the time to assess the session after, and point out even the tiniest issue in it, all those who communicate and care. In a correctly done BDSM relationship, it's the submissive who in fact always has the power and determines what happens. And these assholes doing the opposite are bringing all this hate on everyone doing it properly. 

But that there is my point. Don't hate on the kinky/BDSM people doing things with extreme care and respect, just because some men don't, and use vulnerable women. If the woman wants rougher sex, is that so wrong? To have self determination, when it comes to how they wish to act sexually? Saying that no woman should want to submit sexually, is as sexist as saying that no woman should have the right to choose to stay as a housewife. So how about we concentrate on letting people have sex as they wish, but educate others on how to do it safely, both mentally and physically?",Northern_dragon,2019-11-23 09:15:11,2019-11-23 09:15:12,/r/Feminism/comments/dzo4w0/6bdsm_is_now_a_strategic_defense_for_men_in_the/f8dnqhp/,t1_f8cwqio,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-23 09:15:12,0.14228,0.00056,0.00974,0.01292,0.0057,0.001,0.44383,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have often said that consent is important in any relationship, it is doubly important in a BDSM relationship. Anyone who uses ""BDSM"" or ""Rough Sex"" to justify killing someone as just the result of particularly rough sex is either lying or doing BDSM wrong. The core tenents of BDSM are Safe, Sane, Consensual. It really irks me when someone uses the BDSM community as a shield against prosecution. When they throw the BDSM community under the bus because they killed someone. BDSM isn't exactly mainstream. 50 Shades of Gray helped (to an extent) legitimize the BDSM community and enter it into the public zeitgeist, but murderers using BDSM to excuse murder, saying it was just a ""kink taken too far,"" hurt the image of the BDSM community writ large. There are resources on the BDSM community and none of them say that kink should be taken to the point of death. All of them say that if the submissive can't verbalize then either an alternative safeword should be used, or the scene shouldn't progress to that point. Every resource on the subject says that a safeword *needs* to be established prior to anything that would make either party feel even a little uncomfortable. This person isn't just a ""bad dom"" they're a murderer. And anyone who can't abide by those rules has no place in the BDSM community.

Deborah shared her mourning, depression, and response to the triggers that she experienced in the aftermath of her loss. Five months after the stillbirth of her son, Deborah (not her real name) continues to reel from her loss. 

As Dr. Danny Horesh of Bar-Ilan University, an expert on trauma and the emotional implications of pregnancy loss, explained, “Stillbirth and pregnancy loss occur on a daily basis, but because it has to do with pregnancy, the loss goes under the radar. Stillbirth is highly traumatic and we should not neglect it in any way. Just like how we look at soldiers coming back from war, or someone who has gone through sexual abuse.”

While existing pregnancy loss literature has focused on sadness and grief surrounding miscarriage and stillbirth, researchers like Horesh believe more attention needs to be paid to the trauma of the experience. 

The loss of a pregnancy can be a deeply distressing event for the parents and other family members, whether as a miscarriage (prior to Week 20 of gestation), or as a perinatal loss (any time after Week 20 until one week post-birth). In the United States, there are approximately 24,000 stillbirths each year, the cause of which may be from maternal health issues, placental complications, hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, or other still unknown causes.

In her thirty-plus years as a midwife at Israel’s Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, Malka Nukrian has cared for many patients who have experienced pregnancy loss. Noting the struggle patients faced, in 2006 Nukrian started a support group for women who had experienced pregnancy loss. She noticed a trend in the women who attended the meetings – participants shared their experiences of depression, loss, impact on their marriages, but also how the loss was traumatic.  The women had spent months excitedly anticipating the arrival of their babies, only to return home, as Nukrian explained, “with empty hands, but full of the pain of the loss. The woman feels confused after the birth. She has experienced a birth, but has no baby to bring home.”

Wanting to better understand those who had lost a child during pregnancy, Nukrian was delighted when Horesh, who was interested in researching that same cohort, contacted her. Together Horesh, Nukrian, and Yael Bialik gathered a sample of 97 women at Hadassah Hospital who experienced pregnancy loss after their second trimester. Of this sample, the vast majority of women had experienced a stillbirth, with the average loss being occurring around Week 28 of pregnancy.

Horesh was astounded by his findings. “Over 40 percent of women in our sample had full-blown posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is very, very high.  Almost thirty percent of the women met the criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). These numbers highlight the magnitude of distress,” Horesh said.  There was also a high co-morbidity between posttraumatic stress and depression.

Further analysis of findings showed that for women who were further along in their pregnancies, as well as expectant mothers with a shorter amount of time since the pregnancy loss, faced a higher risk of suffering from PTSD and MDD. Findings also showed that younger age and lower religious observance were associated with more severe PTSD, but not MDD.

Horesh and Nukrian urge mental health and medical professionals to pay closer attention to women in the aftermath of late pregnancy loss. As part of that, they seek to develop improved specific, personalized screenings and interventions for patients – both immediately in the delivery room, as well as in the weeks and months following the stillbirth.  As Nukrian said, “The loss of the baby is a significant loss. It is important to give recognition and space to the loss, mourning, and pain. Mourning takes time.” 

Referencing his research in this area, Horesh encourages professionals to acknowledge that women after late pregnancy loss are often highly vulnerable. “We believe this vulnerability should be identified in the maternal ward at the hospital. Talk to these women and screen them for depression and PTSD,” he says.  Given the pain and shock of losing a baby, professionals would do well by their patients to see the experience through the lens of trauma. As part of that, they might begin offering support quickly in the face of the mother’s shattered expectations of birth and parenthood, and not wait until symptoms are more pronounced.",Yeahmaybeitsdetritus,2019-11-23 01:21:07,2019-11-23 01:21:09,/r/Feminism/comments/e0at8v/stillbirth_as_a_trauma_more_attention_needs_to_be/f8cxemz/,t3_e0at8v,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-23 01:21:09,0.00295,3e-05,0.00021,0.00143,0.00057,0.00011,0.00107,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You’re right in that sexual practices are gendered and due to the structural patterns and systems, men who are violent benefit. But to say that a man who enjoys a practice that another partner actively consents too makes that man “fucked up” is just....wrong. Consent is the backbone of what defines “kink” from assault, rape, and abuse.  
  
The system doesn’t understand consent. That misunderstanding is what is causing abusive and violent men to get away with crimes. Men who understand consent and other qualities that define basic human decency should not be labeled as “fucked up” for possessing these qualities.",qt_314159,2019-11-23 01:18:50,2019-11-23 01:18:51,/r/Feminism/comments/e00j14/bdsm_and_male_violence_against_women/f8cx8jq/,t1_f8cvmks,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-23 01:18:51,0.79821,0.01674,0.66647,0.07535,0.19012,0.00511,0.59467,1,0,1,0,0,0,1

""Against large government"" doesn't work for the same reason, unless you mean shrinking the military and prison system...but then you're not talking about conservatism anymore.

Or maybe you support women's rights but just don't want to pay any taxes? I can understand that, but that doesn't actually make you a conservative, despite what right-wing propaganda claims. Communism involves paying *zero* tax, proper socialism (but not social democracy) means paying very little; while conservatism doesn't mean low taxes at all, unless you're rich. So if that's your perspective and you call yourself conservative, you're mistaken.

Or maybe you support equality for women but not minorities? Maybe you think those scary brown men are coming to take away the rights of our white women who must be protected from the scary Mooooooslem hordes at any cost? Sorry, you're not a feminist, you're a racist concern troll.

A lot of the Bible is written as history (I'm not arguing about whether any personally wants to believe it, but that's the intention it has to its audience) and so it assumes a historical perspective.

I think feminism is kind of like a spectrum in a way. 

Conservatives want to conserve the traditional and the status quo. They want things to either stay the same, or to go back to a previous time period. Neither option is one that describes gender equality or an elimination of gender roles, oppression and sexist indoctrination. 

So if you're in favour of the status quo, you are by definition more feminist than someone who would prefer to go back to earlier (and more oppressive) time periods like trad cons.

&gt;In recent years, analyses of hundreds of neuroscience studies offered clear evidence disproving the idea that males are less hormonal. In some cases, male rodents living in groups were messier because their testosterone (which essentially works on the brain like estrogen) fluctuates, depending on dominance hierarchies in groups.  
&gt;  
&gt;That males were hormonal, emotional and messy still didn’t get them kicked out of studies.

The NY Times cites this study: [https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-016-0087-5](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-016-0087-5)

&gt;Across all traits, there were no sex differences in trait variability, as indicated by the CV, and there were no sex differences in any of the four neuroscience categories, even in instances in which mean values for males and females were significantly different. **Female rats were not more variable at any stage of the estrous cycle than male rats.**

&gt;We \[men\] may not routinely bloat and bleed, but a new study makes it clear that we too are at the mercy of our hormones – specifically, the one produced between our legs. After testing hundreds of men, researchers from the California Institute of Technology, Wharton School, Western University and ZRT Laboratory reported (pdf) “a clear and robust causal effect of testosterone on human cognition and decision-making”.

2678,9881,"Man here. I used to be this way so I have some experience here. At least for me, I always felt like an outsider because I didn’t  have a lot going for me. Not athletic, not particularly attractive, and so when I convinced myself that I was smart for reading what amounts to basic history of philosophy texts at a 10th grade level of reading comprehension, I convinced myself that that was the thing I had going for me, which lead me to start constructing and reflecting this toxic notion of what a smart man is like. A smart man has to be cool, and cool is detached, and just sticks to the cold, hard facts. Who decides what facts are and how did we get there? Who cares? If they sound sciencey and dismiss feelings, that’s rational. So when I encountered women who espoused feminist ideas, well, feminism sounds to me like an appeal to emotion so I have to prove that the feminist lady with conflicting ideas to my own is wrong. I find that the ones who are especially aggressive are actually the most insecure because they know that feminism has truth to it, and they don’t want to admit it. The day I seriously listened to the arguments that serious feminists made was the day I finally realized how stupid I was being. And that same situation tends to repeat itself every couple of years. 

So tldr men with nothing going for them get convinced by their overestimation of themselves that they are smart but our culture has a lot of baggage around how we view intelligence so men try to conform and get upset when their firmly planted biases are called into question by women with DIFFERENT OPINIONS, so we have to get them to surrender so we don’t have to admit that we were wrong",matthewkind2,2019-11-06 05:49:47,2019-11-06 05:49:48,/r/Feminism/comments/ds58zj/is_this_a_man_thing_patriarchy_thing_or_a_thing/f6oirnx/,t3_ds58zj,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-06 05:49:48,0.07264,6e-05,0.00229,0.00665,0.05159,0.00013,0.00167,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But the world is very different, and maybe women are just a little better suited to leading in our current environment. I'm not saying every woman is smarter than every man, or anything extreme like that. But when we're talking about the best of the best, the top 1% of the 1%, maybe the statistical distribution is just a little skewed, and it turns out that for almost every important role, based on merit, it should be a woman running things?

???   No one who brings up the injustice of male circumcision is telling women to accept FGM.   Everyone agrees already that FGM is wrong.  It's already illegal pretty much everywhere, and you have probably met no women who have had it done to them.  The reason why men bring up circumcision is because it is legal, widespread and most Americans consider it no big deal.  

Genital cutting of children is not a feminist issue or a men's rights issue.  It's a child's rights issue.  Adult men and women can have as much of their genitals modified as they wish and no one will object.  If women want FGM to end, the only way that will happen is to demand ALL genital cutting of children stop regardless of sex.

2809,10048,"**Postmodernism** by it's nature views people in groups based on their race, sex or sexual attraction. Rather than, based on their individual identity. It's because of this, that the concept of the patriarchy arises, with the idea being that the patriarchy (a ruling class of men) are and have been pulling the strings to suppress and oppress other groups. Postmodern feminism essentially uses the concept of the patriarchy as a sort of enemy, a reason to abolish certain practices under the pretense that said practices are oppressive. 

**Critical feminism** is similar to gender critical feminism which delves into things such as the transition of men into women and how this can oppress women, particularly in the sporting scene. It fundamentally rejects the idea of trans women being legitimate women. The arguments put forth stems from women who have been abused by men and became sexually attracted by women as a result, only to be expected to be okay with dating a trans women. The premise being, a trans women is a biological male and responsible for most of the domestic abuse among lesbians. Ultimately this suggests that the patriarchy is manifesting itself among the gay community by forcing an expectation among lesbians to date trans women. 

Critical feminism remains critical. Through remaining critical, critical feminism refuses to be controlled which in turn, would otherwise be a tool utilized to control women.

IF that’s the case, she must be hiding it from him because she fears his anger and punishment, but it’s obviously not stopping her from having sex. That means she could be getting mixed up with people who pressure her, exploit her, and have generally unhealthy relationships, and her parents won’t be able to help because they’ve discouraged her from talking to them about sex.  Not saying she necessarily has - just that she’s more vulnerable to exploitative relationships because her parents have made her afraid to tell them what’s going on. Also not ignoring her autonomy in her relationships - just saying that teenagers are already vulnerable enough to unhealthy relationships, and being the daughter of a famous rich rapper only makes her more of a target. A healthy, open, mature attitude about sex from parents is important in teaching kids what a healthy relationship is. In this poorly thought out attempt to protect her from men like him, he’s only put her at a greater risk. 

Hope I conveyed that alright, I don’t mean to talk as though she doesn’t have total autonomy. Just trying to say that the way parents teach their children about sex makes a big difference, teenagers (especially with rich powerful parents like hers) are vulnerable to exploitation, and it’s important that parents have an open, mature attitude about sex so that their children are comfortable asking for help if they need it.

&gt;Gyms with vending machines that contain feminine hygiene products, hair bands, and hair pins

I get it, but are we babying women? I would say to any independent person, pack for your own needs. If women become reliant upon the state, do they ever really become independent?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Feminine hygiene products covered under public assistance/food stamp programs (idk if it ever is, it’s not where I live)

It's like, do we give women free tampons or do we put that money towards the homeless? We talk about privilege but never our own, so let's check ours and try to help the homeless. -Put that money towards taking the more vulnerable homeless off the streets, the homeless women. Technically sexist, but it's true homeless women are more vulnerable.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I would push the idea of benefits for mothers and a service that gives parenting advice, you may have to go to a lecture/focus group every week to be eligible for monetary aid. Ultimately providing utilities to help mothers raise their child and educating the mother to properly give that child the best opportunity in life.

\-Aid for sex workers. A service that provides advice for sex workers. Maybe they're looking to leave the trade and need help to apply for a job, despite having a gap period of unemployment on their CV. Liberate and legalize their trade while offering support for those who want to get out. This way we don't criminalize desperate women, instead we provide help.

\-Aid domestic abuse victims. Give them a place to seek help and refuge. Even a community which understands and can give them advice necessary to escape.

&amp;#x200B;

These points involve the most liberating thing that can be offered: Education. You can throw as many tampons at women as you please, but nothing is more necessary than teaching ~~women~~ people how to deal with the realities they may have to face. I would argue that men need support too, any society that has weak men has weak fathers, brothers and sons, which ultimately means they're unable to provide support to their daughters, sisters and mothers.

So I fail to see how the foundation of a colonial society has to be white supremacy, I don't quite see the reasoning you're using. 

With regards to the examples of countries I gave, the fact that those countries don't have any real number of black or white citizens, shows us what a society that rejects the idea of diversity of race might look like. It would look rather mono racial. America is not mono racial in fact, America has many minorities who thrive, proven by the fact that America is a desirable immigration hot spot.

&gt;Color blindness is a false promise. If you are a person of color, that effects your life and world view, and should not be ignored. It operates on the assumption that “no color” means “everyone is white” 

Color blindness wouldn't mean everyone is white (white happens to be a color). It would mean everyone is equal and skin color is irrelevant. In that, no one should be able to judge someone based on the color of their skin.

We can both acknowledge there are white people who are true racists, but are we both able to acknowledge there are black people who are true racists too? I think your flaw here is you're so focused on 'white racists' that you're neglecting racism in a broader sense. Why do you not target racism across all races?

There's a multi-billion dollar legal industry which promotes and perpetuate legal but medically unnecessary FGCS on women and girls -- literal definition of FGM, according to WHO.  These FGCS procedures are far more severe and unnecessary than male foreskin removal.  It's considered ""no big deal"" in such a manner that Americans skip right over that fact and instead compare it with male foreskin removal. Women who argue against FGCS industry get attacked as kink shamer, prudish, sex-negetive. 


&gt;Genital cutting of children is not a feminist issue or a men's rights issue. It's a child's rights issue. Adult men and women can have as much of their genitals modified as they wish and no one will object. If women want FGM to end, the only way that will happen is to demand ALL genital cutting of children stop regardless of sex. 



Black lives matter is not a racial issue or a black people's rights issue. It's a human rights issue. Adult people can have as much of the  self-harm as they wish and no one will object.

Color blindness is a false promise. If you are a person of color, that effects your life and world view, and should not be ignored. It operates on the assumption that “no color” means “everyone is white”.  I think that is wrong.

2937,10223,"If I had created the platform, personally, I would not feel comfortable that it was being used as a gathering place for hate groups. You're right that we should not trivialize violence, but it is important to recognize that people who go out and commit violence aren't doing so out of nowhere; they're being radicalized in online forums that tolerate radical hate speech (not sure about reddit itself but the chans are notorious for producing alt-right/incel mass shooters). I'm not talking about a simple difference in political opinion or referring to all right-leaning subs as ""hate groups"", but specifically to communities whose singular focus is an intense hatred of minorities/women. Thousands of people go to those subs specifically to whip each other into a frenzy over \[X group\], share stories, cartoons, and propaganda about why \[X group\] is bad, and obsess over how \[X group\] is taking over and needs to be put in their place, and because Reddit, also unlike the social media sites, allows self moderation, these forums become echo chambers in which anyone who confronts the group mentality or has a a less extreme opinion is downvoted or banned. It's an interesting experiment in free speech, but it also encourages extremism and allows dangerous ideologies to flourish imo

Edit: Also I'm not sure about the ratio of right wing subs to left wing subs, but I don't think it matters particularly, given that there's very little discourse between the left and right on Reddit (again, due to modding and banning).

3023,10375,"I think one of the most valid arguments is that it results in better conditions/outcomes for sex workers. You said yourself we should look at sex workers as ""people who need help"". Based on that, you'd want prostitution to have whichever legal status is most helpful to sex workers.

And I'm not an expert by any means, but I think criminalisation results in the *worst* conditions and is probably the least helpful policy, for sex workers. [That's just my impression based on what I've seen/read].

The smaller argument I just want to mention, is that I don't think laws should be a mechanism for signalling appropriate behaviour in the first place. People are always asking ""what message does this send??"" but I think it's way better to be pragmatic. All we need to ask is ""What effect will this have?""

People are going to do *the thing* anyway. We can either accept that and legislate for the best possible outcomes. Or we can stay in the business of using laws to indicate desirable behaviour, and then have negative results because ultimately we can't control behaviour like that in the first place.

But I realise you're also talking about more indirect effects. Like, the potential broader (misogynistic) message about what are ""acceptable"" ways to treat women, how our society *thinks* about women, or where it places women.

I don't really agree, but that is an interesting point, imo. I would be interested in looking at countries where sex work *is* legal, and trying to answer that question; of whether there *were* any negative effects for women due to the message that was sent by making sex work legal.

Tbh, I think the effects may be more positive than negative. I think that on a large scale, sexual harassment often grows out of cultures that are sexually repressed. Like there's a social need that can't be fulfilled so it expresses itself in perverse ways, like harassment.

So, opening up and regulating the sex industry - taking control over it -might actually give *some* measure of control over some of the things that give rise to sexual harassment in the first place. Like, I think a society that regulates sex work has more of a grip on sexuality and as a result *probably* has less sexual harassment because its less puritanical and perverted. A society like that cares enough about sex workers (mostly women) to regulate the industry; whereas the society that makes it illegal, has more of a ""fuck you"" attitude to women sex workers, I think. It's like ""our morality is more important that your life"" - and that aligns with the type of mentality that would justify sexual harassment, to my mind anyway.

More of a rant than I intended, I'm sorry. And that's all just speculation and opinion on my part. All of that may be completely misguided, just felt like commenting anyway.",jfartster,2019-10-29 13:05:17,2019-10-29 13:05:18,/r/Feminism/comments/dokbwn/how_does_legalizing_sex_work_promote_equality/f5pamlg/,t3_dokbwn,Feminism,1,1,2019-10-29 13:05:18,0.0345,0.0001,0.00096,0.00526,0.00159,0.00031,0.10345,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3037,10393,"A lot of feminist discourse focuses on decriminalisation rather than legalisation. This is a key difference because currently (in many countries) people can be prosecuted for being a sex worker. They are being prosecuted for making a living - these are often people in very difficult circumstances and they do not deserve to be treated in this way. It's believed to be safer that sex workers are not afraid of prosecution - so for example it is easier for them to report if a crime is committed against them. One country which has decriminalised sex work is New Zealand. 

Legalisation would mean setting up rules around this (e.g. The Netherlands has legalised) and can remain problematic in terms of some will still operate outside of the law (so it doesn't combat the issue of reporting crimes for those sex workers who aren't at, for example, a legal brothel).

It's a feminist issue because a lot of sex workers are women and while you don't have to like what they choose to do, I would say decriminalisation is a way to help support them and ensure that they are as safe as possible.

What complicated the matters for her was police harassment, difficulty in paying taxes and safety issues. Legalisation would help resolve a lot of that, and I'm pro it (although personally, I'd rather just tear down the whole capitalist system that makes us sell ourselves in various ways).  

If someone thinks that ""women are sluts and whores"" because sex work exists, it's a problem with that person and not with sex workers.

3071,10438,"This is interesting. I am not a lawyer but this is a topic I am interested in. 

In India the minimum sentence for rape (section 375 penal code, which is only male on female, similar to UK) or for ""Unnatural offences"" (sorry for the term, you can blame the British Raj, section 377 penal code) is 10 years. Unnatural offences covers forced sodomy against both women and men, the supreme court decriminalised voluntarily sodomy but kept the section 377 wording the same. [Penal Code](https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/2263/3/a1860_45.pdf). 

I am unsure how a third gender is viewed in law but the supreme court said: 

&gt;Transgender persons' right to decide their self-identified  
&gt;  
&gt;gender is also upheld and the Centre and State  
&gt;  
&gt;Governments are directed to grant legal recognition of  
&gt;  
&gt;their gender identity such as male, female or as third  
&gt;  
&gt;gender.

So I legally the minimum sentence for rape (in the vernacular sense) should be 10 years all round, it did use to be 7 years.

Same term as verbal abuse. WTF!

The problem is not that you are not informed of feminism ideology needed to value women, but that you lack the empathy and conviction that are necessary to even consider the lives of women as worthy.

The way you’re coming across is “give me proof to analytically deduce that women are equal to men, because I think they are inferior.”

Like there is some burden of proof on our part as women for you to see us as worthy or capable. 

You either respect, value, and have empathy for women or you don’t.

You want a place to start. Ask yourself why it is you don’t. And more importantly, how beliefs like yours hurt women, and how they most likely have hurt your wife. Ask yourself if you want to be part of the cruelty in the world that women suffer. 

It would probably be beneficial for you to read literature rooted in psychology to see the trauma caused by oppression, misogyny, or sexism.

Thus, every sexual crime (be it rape, harassment or any other) falls into any of the two categories above. The differences between them are just whether or not the criminal had to use violence to perpetrate their crime. If there is, then the crime is formally an aggression. If there is not, then the crime is just abuse. Of course, they have different sentences.
Therefore, if the judge considered there was no violence in the rape, then the crime is just abuse, and not aggression.

3181,10615,"I think your paragraphs are a bit jumbled, so I will reply to like... The general themes of your arguments. 

1.) ""Luke is the son of the chosen one""/""his dad was a pilot"". 

We *don't know that* in the first film. That's information from later. Judging TFA's Rey on those grounds but not Luke is BS because of that. 

Like, what if Rey was the new chosen one? Does that explain everything now? It doesn't. Everything is still basically terrible. 

And *in the first movie* we don't know who Luke's dad is (except for he was a Jedi and this was kept from him) and even if we did it doesn't actually mean anything because he's never met him. We know he *wants* to be a pilot. But also, he's a teenager or something. Could be the equivalent of a high schooler saying ""I want to be a fighter pilot!"", which gives us no reason to think he should be competent at that. At all. 

But we don't *question it*. Because it's *fine*. 

2.) The writing was bad. 

Yeah. But I think it's bad like... Everywhere except the clone wars cartoon, tbh. And even then sometimes in the clone wars cartoon too. Of the film's, Episodes IV and V are probably the best, but I would still edit a lot of things, and there's plenty of bullshit in them. 

Maybe some comics and books are decent? Iunno. I haven't really had the patience to go through many. Star Wars has disappointed me enough times that I've become a Trekkie by process of elimination. 

3.) Rey has no personality

I think she does. I think she's something of a fangirl, and she's helpful and honest, but also kind of naive and too eager to believe her own bullshit. I like her smile, and her little annoyed groans, and the way she gets giddy when she does something and it works. I also think she has a freakout that gets her kidnapped, so it's not like she doesn't make mistakes. 

Perhaps the best diagnosis for what's wrong with the sequel series is that the sequel series is *written like fanfiction*. In the sense that it doesn't feel the need to properly introduce a lot of things, and by relying on pre-existing knowledge too much it fails to make its own frame known. 

We are shown a lot of things in Rey's introduction. She lives in the desert and all alone. She has Jedi dolls. She feels worried that she will end up like that old lady, stuck in this life forever. She works hard for shit pay every day. She sucks at counting on walls. Her food is cool. She can ride a floaty motorcycle. 

After her introduction, we learn she cares about droids, and she thinks the millennium falcon is garbage, and she can handle herself in a fight against two trained enemies. 

These are all things that are established about her, from which we can deduce other things. She's had a hard life. Nobody ever taught her how to count in a wall. She knows about mechanical parts and about spaceships. 

But because the entire fucking *mode* the movie tries to engage you in is ""Hey, remember that thing?"", people are too busy remembering the other movie to like... Notice that. 

I mean, she spends like two scenes geeking out but nobody seems to remember it. If you *pay attention* to what Rey does, you can tell that she has a personality. Like, she's not *shy* or particularly *insecure*, for one. She's friendly to the point of idiocy and eager to jump at the call to adventure but reluctant to leave her home because maybe her parents will return. And yet, everyone insists she is perfect and has no personality. 

4.)  Details about the fight 

It just doesn't seem that crazy to me? Like, the force pull thing didn't seem to me like her ""winning"" a force pull contest. It seemed to me like he had used the force to like, throw it at his hand, and she highjacked it when it was in the air but not actively being guided by the force. But also the force apparently awakened in the movie so maybe the force just likes Rey more? 

If he was *keeping his internal organs internal* when he was hitting his injury (which, I didn't mean he was doing it to show people his wound, I meant, the camera focuses on it and he does that so that the audience is *aware* of it)... That's more reason for him to lose...? 

And maybe a sith should have fought dirty but the worst he does is jab the hand guards against Finn's shoulder. Mostly he just focuses on sword-hitting, and doesn't try to punch or kick her. Which makes sense since he doesn't *actually* want her dead. 

And let's say it was bad. Like, let's just assume it was. I concede.

Lots of characters just have skills suddenly or become able to do a thing because of an epiphany in modern filmmaking. The Shazam family in Shazam, Thor in Thor: Ragnarok, Peter Quill in Guardians II (he's had superpowers for like two days and he can go against his dad???). Maybe it's a failure of modern filmmaking, but it's a failure nobody seems to give a shit about in male-led franchises. 

5.) All female characters should be awesome like Ahsoka and Katara

This might be where our biggest *actual disagreement* lies. I think that in a franchise with poorly written protagonists, another one is just keeping with the trend. 

Would it be better if ALL CHARACTERS, male and female, were awesome and interesting? Yes. But will that ever be the case? Probably not. I think it's kind of weird to persistently hold female characters to a higher standard. Some female characters are going to be shitty, and they will be shitty because most characters are shitty and statistically it's just gonna happen. 

6.) Better female characters exist and straight white guys writing bad female characters is bad

But its just shoved together so lamely and with zero effort. He's not hitting the injury to draw attention to it. He is using the force to keep his organs inside. And he still managed to beat finn. If Rey used his strategy and won I would have loved that. But no she out performs him in a force pull contest. She has never been trained to force pull but she beats Kylo, its ridiculous she could force pull at all without explicit training, let alone against not just a force user but a force user in the Skywalker bloodline. There should have been no force pulling, a force feeling is...ok. And that fight was fucking lame, even Samuel L jackson said it sucked in nicer words of course. If Rey just picked up the sabre and did what she did against Kylo as his body shut down as he fought to keep his intestines inside I would 100% agree with you, but that did not happen. Bullshit happened. Oh not to mention when Rey killed all those red guards with a weeks experience of hitting a rock with a stick. A kylo begged for her help when he literally could of used the force to break his neck or ANYTHING. Johnson explained why she got so skilled in a week. Its because in her force connection with Kylo she learnt ALL his powers. From a connection...yep thats literally what he said, he is a moron. Why didnt Yoda just shove all his skills into the younglings through a force connection. It makes no sense. Even Star Wars theory was annoyed and he is the most chill guy on the planet.

Wow fighting dirty, I dark side user would never stoop to that level or anticipate something as wicked as that. If you reply to this you can explain more because I am sure you did not articulate this the way you wanted to and I wont go into you here too much. But really, fighting dirty, he is being trained by pure evil, he probably stabbed his dad (whoever activated it is up for debate) five minutes ago. Dark side fighting is about fighting dirty. Form seven lightsabre combat was banned by jedi and used by sith because of its callous and dirty tactics. It was fuelled by rage and evil, it was not gentlemanly calm combat. I have already explained Luke could fly and was going to join thr empire to become a pilot plus his dad was a famous pilot so there is further backstory. So that explains that. Luke could fly like superman in legends through years of learning the force. She actually superman flew in space and thats why the star destroyed on Jakku is there. Luke literally went around the universe for years honing that art though. 



I agree anyone should but since its 95% white men to tell a womans story. It feels so lazy and half arsed. Whilst Ahsoka is amazing. Guys can but you need a more diverse set of directors and more talented ones at that. Abrams is a shameless plagiarist and Johnson just fucked up on every level. I was so bored I lost interest in the cinema. That hasnt happened to me since the first Robert Downey Jr sherlock holmes movie. The person who was supposed to make the 9th film left because Johnson fucked up so royally. Or it can be done by new directors who care about people other than straight white men. The current empowerment movement imo is a shameless cashgrab by Disney who use tabloid press to make out all critiques are due to gender swaps, not the shitty plots. Thats why they are making remakes, they want to make easy money and use gender changes as a way to call all critiques as made by alt right nazis. We are not and its patronising. I cannot believe you are contempt with this and fear it would stop if we stopped 95% of high up directors being white men. I want to see real movies made by passionate directors on female empowerment. Movies on real women like Nanny of the Maroons or the Dahomey Amazons. Not this shameless cashgrab and exploiting social progression. Hollywood needs to change, this female empowerment is just to take your money with zero effort put in. We need actual new films with powerful women. Not making the old ones slightly differently and expecting to get a pat on the back for being lazy fucks. 


Thats still a generalisation. I was born in 1997, many young fans hate it. Ahsoka was invented like 10 years ago and so was her show and we love it. The new trilogy is pathetic. Care to explain some of the bullshit plotholes as many you have pointed out I have contested with explanation. Some are valid though. Most people who hate the new trilogy are our age. My Dad saw Star wars come out in 77 and he disliked the new trilogy but nowhere near as people our age. He basically went oh well. He also also the guards sword about to stab rey magically vanish. And he think Ridley is a great actor. He just thinks the films are lame. 



I think everyone saw faults in SW prequels cough cough Jar Jar but they were still ok. And everyone loved ROTS. They had storytelling issues but no massive plotholes, the new trilogy is just one giant shitstorm however. 



It has nothing to do with Rey having a vagina, even Ridley said Rey has no faults but she thinks thats fine. I sent a video I believe saying what if Luke was like Rey as a counter. If Luke was a woman i doubt most people would care as long as she was attractive (which is sexism but a different kind altogether). Hardly anyone gave Leia or Ahsoka or Mara Jade shit did they? Why, they are good characters. Luke was callled whiney and annoying, BY EVERYONE, my Dad says he is. I just came back from a Disney movie marathon and asked people about this and my friend said Luke was whiny. Half the people I know call him whiney. Its not to do with gender, George just made Luke a bit too whiney for some people. Rey is at least not whiney because she lacks the personality to even be whiney. Are you serious? People are still pissed Leia could not use the force like Luke, decades later and she is a woman. Thats why Johnson made her fly in space. I loved the idea but like usual he fucked up the execution. You are generalising the critiques here. 



Ok thank god we agree on that. I love Ahsoka too. Easily in my top 5 characters. She is awesome and a great role model. The only reason im not upset she was underplayed in rebels is because rebels sucked. If she doesnt get her own series im gonna be pissed. Yeah yoda and Kenobi are better characters but I still love Luke, and the comics really make him grow. Lucus fucked up with Anakins personality, i feel so bad for Hayden. But he is awesome in the clone wars cartoons. The clone was cartoon made so many characters awesome. Maul, palps, Ventress, Ahsoka, Anakin, they even made Jar Jar tolerable. Protagonists dont need to be the most likeable. Like Aang in the atla. He is annoying occasionally but a great lead. I resonate far more with Zuko and Katara, but Aang should still be the lead regardless of being a bit less awesome. Being a lead does not mean you should be the best character. I love Lukes optimism and love to try redeem his father. I love anakin is ROTS. They needed to be leads and both had flaws and lost limbs. Rey beat everyone and beat Kylo again in the next movie, she got up first and Kylo was at full strengh, she had a week of hitting a rock. 



Rey is result of bad writing. I dont think Rey is a dislikable person, honestly she is more engaging than Anakin in the first two films. But she is just too good at everything and has no personality and is just a tank with no explanation as to why. She is a Mary Sue in the minds of many, I dont think she is bad or annoying because being boring or whiney is a personality trait and she has none.",ElephantsOnTurtle,2019-10-31 06:42:30,2019-10-31 06:42:32,/r/Feminism/comments/doqp7c/sometimes_you_need_to_reframe/f5vwz7t/,t1_f5tefue,Feminism,1,1,2019-10-31 06:42:32,0.58235,0.00051,0.29081,0.00335,0.27462,0.00042,0.00353,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you rewatch a new hope you will see that Luke already knew how to pilot a ship. He was telling the other guy at the start he was going to join the Empire to become a pilot. Luke can fly, its been established. It being too narrow is because of Lucus' writing issues, not because Luke has a penis (or whatever you are trying to say here) and Obi Wan's force ghost was the reason Luke successfully made that shot. He needed the ghost of a space wizard to help him do it. Plus it also stated many, many times how great of a pilot Luke's Dad was. It also backs up Luke having a talent, whilst also showing Luke had been training as and wanted to be a pilot for a very long time. And Luke stayed out of the action almost the whole time. Red squadron took the hits and Luke for the most part did nothing until he was pretty much last man standing. The Falcon is a ship almost unrivalled because of its special features, like the parsecs thing (lets not get into what a parsec really is because they are real and George fucked up knowing what they are. Its a special ship and she flew it, and had a knowledge of being a pilot which was on PAR with one of the greatest and most experienced pilots in the universe. 


If you want to go into a male character being OP like Rey then you should have used little Ani in the Phantom menace during the gungan battle. He destroys an entire army whilst spinning around in a ship he can barely see out of. And before you say he was not given shit for this, yes, yes he was. Its a massive criticism by fans and the actor who played Ani was bullied into insanity essentially. And you're right no one called out Ani for being a male, just a OP character for no reason. He was a Gary Stu but no one called him one, just a stupid script. I agree some criticisms are gendered but Rey is still, by all definition a Mary sue and Ani is a Gary Stu in that one scene but is not called one and is a called a shit character moment and plot point instead. 



Scavenging does not equate to being a damn pilot. My dad used to look for bits of WW2 planes as a kid. And has a masters in physics and is good with making technology (essentially scavenging but he bought the parts) and Rey is cool for being a scavenger. But doing that does not equate to flying a fucking spaceship. My Dad did all that and did not jump into a plane and fly like a RAF veteran, no he had to slowly learn like anyone else. Oh and Rey said a bunch of space mumbo jumbo that made Hans eyes pop from how amazing it was. She had a profound understanding of piloting a ship in space despite never piloting a ship in space before. 



No he was not raised with a sense of the force. Hence why he was so useless in episode 4. But you misunderstand what Yoda was saying there. Yoda did not say Luke was too old to use the force. Yoda was saying he was too old to be trained because he, like his father or any other jedi who is over the age of a toddler should not be trained because they have formed bonds and attachments to others which makes it dangerous to train them. Because attachments in the views of the jedi lead to strong emotions to protect those people which can cause a person to go to the dark side to protect them. And Luke DID almost go to the dark side when he cut Vaders hand off. He had to let go of the dark side (how he bested Vader who was not trying until the end and was caught off guard) and thats why he said to Palps I will never join you. He almost did join him by almost killing his father. 



Yes Han the still important character and also Chewie. Both important to the original story and Lukes best friends. Regardless of how the film made everyone angry at him is not the point here. Yes and she knows this amazing language of ship mechanics from jack all. She got an easy friendship with a person it was very hard to gain respect from. Han shat on Luke the whole first film until he proved himself when he is being chased by Vader. I didnt have an issue with Rey and Finn respecting eachother. The destiny shit matters because its not explained at all, we are told Lukes father was a jedi and kenobi was his dads best mate and they are going to save a princess because thats what kenobi needs to do. Whilst all we know about Rey is Kebobi's ghost is these are her first steps, TO WHAT? We know there is some reason she is like this, but they never even explain why or a single trait of her perdonality apart from she is good at everything. And its not even about the destiny, Luke had a destiny and he sucked in episode 4, Rey is told these are her first steps, with zero explanation and is amazing at everything. Yes kenobi only gave him a fee hours and thats why he sucked ass. Rey has zero training and over powered Kylp in the force. Luke could barely swing a lightsabre after months of training with Yoda learning jedi philosophy and skills from him with actual evidence of his training. Unlike Rey who spends a few days hitting a rock with a stick. And then manages to do into a dark side cave which terrified Luke. 


Han saw her like a fucking relative after 10 minutes, it was lazy. I will say this again. After Han died Leia hugged Rey not Chewbacca, her and Hans close friend. She hugged a person she only just met over her old friend. Rey is respected every person the fanbase loves from the old trilogy after ZERO effort. Kylo is not a loved hero of the franchise. Han and Leia and Chewie are. Oh and Abram ADMITS he fucked up. He realized after Chewie was there and how strange it was Leia wanted to hug a random over her best friend who saw her husband die. 



He only did it BECAUSE OF KENOBI GUIDING HIM. Thats why you hear him. Kenobi guided Luke and Luke would have fucked up with ghost magic. No Luke did not save the day by himself, Kenobi did it for him with his force ghost powers. Its realistic because they gave Han a back story which made him competent. He shot Greedo in the first few minutes we see him. He is introduced as a person with years of being a competent pilot, smuggler and one of the fastest shooters in the galaxy. Rey has lived doing nothing but scavenging to survive. She has no competence. I wish above all else they made Rey a bounty hunter at the start to explain how she does all this shit. It would have been awesome and explained her skills. So yes it is more realistic for Han to be competent because it is explained and shown he is. He doesnt start like a harmless puppy and magically turn into a skilled person, he starts off with those skills present and explained. 

 
If you want to see a competent female character with a decent backstory check out the person who Rey is stolen from. Mara Jade. Abrams just made a lazy Mara Jade. Mara Jade is awesome and has a detailed history to prove. She learns to be a pilot, a jedi hunter and a hand of palpatine. She is what I wish Rey was. A fleshed out character instead of a caricature. It would be more realistic if they explained HOW a person who has done nothing but scavenge seemingly is able to be so overpowered. Freaking out over a sword talking to her is not a personality trait. She rejects a mind control by KYLO REN THE GRANDSON OF VADER. Most fully trained Jedi would not be able to resist that from the grandson of the chosen one. And they never explain how, Kylo fears her and she manages to not only repel his powers but read HIS mind. With no training. It took Luke three years training with yoda to read minds and do mind tricks. She does it off the bat. She is not useless enough she is a god damn tank.",ElephantsOnTurtle,2019-10-31 06:38:54,2019-10-31 06:38:54,/r/Feminism/comments/doqp7c/sometimes_you_need_to_reframe/f5vwu45/,t1_f5tefue,Feminism,1,1,2019-10-31 06:38:54,0.34751,0.00141,0.33541,0.00214,0.02381,0.00037,0.1846,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3213,10654,"There was another issue posted on here and I put a thought forward as to why it's always men voted in?  My thought was the reason is men ,  overall,  will vote men in above women.   Thus men get most of the male vote while women don't get most of the male vote and also don't get a lot of the women vote because women don't back women simply because they are women.    Women seem to do what is actually fair and right and look at the policies of the person and vote according to that.   But I wonder if that is actually hindering women in what seems to be a massive task of breaking what's been the tradition of only males entering the presidency.   Come on they voted Trump in, an imbecile and criminal, before they would vote a woman in.   He wasn't more qualified.   And men seem to back men simply because they are men.     They come out with but the men are more qualified and I get a very sneaky feeling that those men would still vote for men even if the woman is way more qualified.   And I get a feeling that if women don't start following the example that men are following,  in that they will vote a man in above a woman no matter what,  women will never be the president. 

&amp;#x200B;

They seem OK with women getting so far but not the top position.   I think this stems from traditional family values where it's the man being the head of the family.

They are correctly pointing out that a lack of historical knowledge of feminism is not the source of your problem, your attitude towards yourself and others is.

Then consider the fact that despite your supposed analytical thinking, you apparently had based these views on so little analysis and knowledge of facts that your counselor simply told you to do research on the subject.

The way that you are approaching this, and ignoring anyone that dares impugn your dismissive attitude and views, suggests that you will approach any reading given to you with the same dismissiveness.

3217,10659,"Even though I am a Christian, I can't help but say What the actual fuck? Not only have you cheery picked through out the bible, but half of them you took completely out of context. For instance, when you mentioned Genesis 3:16, you left out the part as to why they were ""cursed"". God punished both woman and MAN because they disobeyed him and sinned. He punished man by forcing him to now have to grow and work for his food rather than have it provided by the garden of Eden. He punished him with mortality and doomed to die and be buried in the very earth he lived off of rather than live forever in the garden of Eden. Heck in the verse before it states ""And I will put hostility between you and woman and between your offspring and her offspring"" Genesis 3:15 NET. As for the Leviticus verses, you either did a typo or something because the verses you are refering to are in chapter 12 not 22. Either way, the teachings are not used in modern day christianty. The next Leviticus verse you referanced you took completely put of context. It is refering to when a man commits adultery with a slave woman, which was a thing back then, that is not his own, then the MAN is supposed to ""He must bring his guilt offering to the lord at the entrance of the Meeting tent, a guilt offering ram, and the priest is to make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the Lord for the sin that he has committed, and he will be forgiven for the sin that he has committed."" Leviticus 19:21-22 NET. You also mentioned Colossians 3:18 and completely forgot to mention the next verse that CLEARLY STATES, AND I QUOTE: ""Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them."" Colossians 3:19 NET. Both of these verses are explaining the both halves of a marriage are EQUAL. Both must be committed to the other in love and faith. As for the 1 Corinthians verses, it is not refering to women to always remain quite in church, but rather to remain silent when the prophet is speaking and teaching a lesson. The next 1 Corinthians passage you posted is also completely out of context. Men are the glory of God and his image because it is stated in the beinging of the bible in Genesis that God created man in his image. In that exact same chapter, he created woman from a rib from man to BE HIS PARTNER. That is why it states that woman are the glory of men. The part about women be creating for men is to be taken very literally. Women were created by god to be the partner to men. It has nothing to do with equality. And if you had looked at the next two verses, you would see that it states: ""In any case, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. For just as woman came from man, so man comes through woman. But all things come from God."" 1 Corinthians 11:11‭-‬12 NET. As for the 1 Timothy verse, the context there is that woman are not to teach the word of God and remain submissive to men as part of the punishment God delievered to humanity when Adam and Eve disobeyed him and fell into sin. This is merely the context of the words in the context of the bible.

What you have effectively accomplished with your rant here, is that you believe you can judge whatever you want to based off of cherry picked evidence and taking things into whatever context you want to believe in. The bible and Christians teaches that Gods love and teachings are spread out to everyone regardless of whatever sin they have committed. Christians are taught to show love over hate and see everyone equally. The bible is not a sexist text as you are claiming it is. So what I honestly suggest is that you sit down with a priest of a modern day Christian church and speak with them about what the religion is about and what the teachings of God actually mean, rather than rant about them online because they don't fall into your agenda.",agent_felix,2019-11-01 00:17:52,2019-11-01 00:17:53,/r/Feminism/comments/dp2r80/hot_take_being_a_christian_and_being_a_feminist/f5z57bl/,t3_dp2r80,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-01 00:17:53,0.07185,0.00222,0.03576,0.02133,0.01137,0.00122,0.00618,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When I say broadly true general things like most women have felt sexually harassed at some point in their life or rape is far more common than men think, I’m immediately inundated with things like “women rape men all the time and it’s a huge problem!!” Or “women falsely accuse men of rape constantly!!”

I’m not saying women cannot abuse or rape others and it’s true, not everyone tells the truth, but the larger point being extending empathy for the women who have suffered, who continue to suffer or fight back, seems to be buried constantly.

I don’t hate men, but I feel like many men lap up women’s care, love and attention then leave, lie or just not return it.

Another thing, marriage seems to be a hated topic among men on Reddit. It’s just seen as a tool women use to use and abuse men.

This term is usually used by a butthurt person who cannot deal with their own feelings and thus insists that the friendzone was all that stopped them from the relationship they should have had. **The imagined reasons for being put into the friendzone usually include that the girl just wanted to lead them on, use them, and/or enjoys watching them suffer.** This term is a way to take away the autonomy of a women's right to choose for herself.

3322,10793,"The Latin Grammys have long been a flashpoint for the complicated ways the U.S. relates to Latinxs, and the way our vast and infinitely diverse diaspora relates to itself. The short answer to the main prevailing question—why there gotta be a separate “Latin” Grammys tho?—has been U.S. English-speaking audiences’ disinterest in Spanish language music, and also the separate music industries that have emerged because of that. But as English radio has embraced certain Spanish-language artists in the post-“Despacito” era, even as U.S. leadership has become increasingly racist and xenophobic towards every stripe of Latinxs and Latin Americans, the conversation has become more nuanced within Latinidad (including whether “Latinidad” is in itself a racist concept).

In this context, the Latin Grammys red carpet has become more of a site for making a statement, whether protesting Trump for his racist policies against immigrants or, in the case of Thursday night’s red carpet and Mexican-Chilean singer Mon Laferte, above, drawing attention to ongoing human rights abuses in Chile by pulling off a topless protest.
 

“EN CHILE TORTURAN VIOLAN Y MATAN”—they’re torturing, raping, and killing in Chile—in support of the protesters rallying for a more just government that does not abuse its citizens. It got the appropriate amount of attention, the point—and she wasn’t alone in turning the carpet into a sincere, real-time plea for people to give a shit.

Singer Alex Anwandter, in sleek black, also stood up for freedom in his home country; Laferte’s full look, which is sending me; Robert Vogu stood up against xenophobia towards immigrants from his own home country, Venezuela (and wore a fantastic coat); Vanessa Añez was subtler, holding up the Bolivian flag in light of the recent U.S.-supported coup against now-former President Evo Morales.",Yeahmaybeitsdetritus,2019-11-15 18:02:41,2019-11-15 18:02:43,/r/Feminism/comments/dwuewq/latin_grammy_attendees_mix_fashion_and_antifascism/f7li5hy/,t3_dwuewq,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-15 18:02:43,0.26727,0.00043,0.06373,0.03255,0.03538,0.00049,0.00397,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3367,10854,"To my view that just seems far too dismissive of what girls go through. It is extremely difficult to find a bra that fits right and even harder to find one that fits right and doesn't show a loose strap on occasion (my gf has gone one this at length).

Clothes for girls are also pretty limited. What is in style is usually marketed heavily to the exclusion of all other clothes, and those clothes do not adhere to what is deemed appropriate by school officials.

I also don't see how a bra strap is at all distracting? I personally have never paid much attention to a girls shoulders or thought that I needed to stare at exactly that spot? And furthermore that would be my own problem if it was. Imo, if you are easily distracted, you need to deal with that and find ways to handle your own quirks, not force others to change for you.

I also have trouble buying that bra straps are in any way inappropriate. Adult women go to work with their bra straps sometimes out, and it is just clothing no ome blinks an eye, why is it such a big deal in schools? And honestly if I were a woman my response to showing bra strap being too inappropriate would be to remove the bra entirely and refuse to wear one. After all, if covering it is the problem to my thinking getting rid of the cover solves it (I understand I am privileged enough that I can say I would do that because it doesn't really affect me personally, but that girls and women obviously don't want to take the inherent risks involved in rebelling in that fashion but I still feel it is all so ridiculous that a strap is supposedly a problem).",Sliderule21,2019-11-17 02:52:21,2019-11-17 02:52:32,/r/Feminism/comments/dwy9qo/instead_of_shaming_girls_for_their_bodies_teach/f7q5ns5/,t1_f7pz46x,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-17 02:52:32,0.01644,2e-05,0.00047,0.00279,0.00773,0.00013,0.00091,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The first is generally seen as a social thing - men like to talk up their achievements more than their female counterparts, making it appear like they're doing more.  The perception of managers is often more important than statistics, and if managers believe that a man will do or is doing more work, they're more likely to hire at higher base rates, give more benefits and non-monetary compensation, and give more/larger raises.  


The second is human nature.  Business people are people, and their perceptions and beliefs will affect how they do business.  Few business people have significant training in economics beyond what's required for a business degree, and they aren't accountants.  For most of them, so long as they routinely turn a profit they're happy.  They're not constantly self-auditing to make sure they're making the most money by cutting costs.  They're willing to spend extra on things if it doesn't cut into their profit too much.  They're willing to pass on opportunities (either to expand or cut costs) if it's not urgent to fix their business.  


Profit-maximizers can also threaten a business because if they're in it for their own profit over the longevity of their business, the profit-maximizer can be easily tempted to destroy the business in a way that makes them money.  Business health is not really best measured by shareholder profit, even if it's one part of a nuanced take.  Companies being destroyed after a buyout because it makes the new owners more money is a really common occurrence.  I'd argue that having a profit-maximizer as a CEO or President is probably the riskiest thing a major business can do.",Nutarama,2019-11-17 02:24:27,2019-11-17 02:24:40,/r/Feminism/comments/dx3554/the_accuracy_hurts/f7q1ho6/,t1_f7onytf,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-17 02:24:40,0.00146,2e-05,0.00012,0.00111,0.00052,6e-05,0.00026,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3382,10869,"I think that this is the kind of topic that people who disagree on will never find common ground for. You mentioned that girls were being punished for bra straps, and I immediately thought that showing bra straps at school shouldn't be allowed. Students come to school with the knowledge of what they can and can't wear, and putting on an item of clothing that intentionally breaks those rules shouldn't be rewarded. 

You compared it to the boys who wear baggy pants, who don't get punished as severely. This is because with pants, the solution is to simply pull your waistband up, whereas the girl couldn't just put something over her shoulders because there was nothing to do so with (but that would certainly be an option). In my experience, if people with baggy pants continued to pull them down again, then of course they would be punished more severely too.

Students (boy and girl) are not allowed to wear tank shirts at all at my school. So I can't comment on what you mentioned about it. 

However, I will say that this kind of victim attitude doesn't sit well with me. The main arguments that people give for this are that *men need to learn to not be distracted* and *being punished for clothing effects education*. This is where we will probably never have a common view on. 

I do believe that the **main** reason for punishing students with innappropriate clothes is not because it's a distraction, but because school is simply not the right place to wear such things. And I can even sympathise with people who do view it as a distraction, because I'm one of those people! It's something that I genuinely can't help!

If you don't want to miss out on a day of learning,  the solution is to just not wear innappropriate clothing at school in the first place.",caijin,2019-11-17 02:08:35,2019-11-17 02:08:45,/r/Feminism/comments/dwy9qo/instead_of_shaming_girls_for_their_bodies_teach/f7pz46x/,t1_f7o6xje,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-17 02:08:45,0.00225,1e-05,0.00029,0.00075,0.00046,4e-05,0.00041,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3385,10872,"Assuming they're working at an engineering firm.  They only state a company with an engineering and HR department.  What if they work for an HR outsourcing firm which has a software engineering department to better interface with client systems and provide more complete service through software solutions?  Then the HR department is actually the leaders and the software engineering team supports them, not the other way around.  The most value-adding the engineering team would be doing would be better optimizing their client software, whereas the most important stuff at the core of the product, like continuous updates to compliance frameworks, would be under the purview of the HR people.  


Note that that doesn't mean the HR people in such a firm would necessarily be paid more.  In most labor markets, there are more qualified HR professionals than there are qualified software engineers.  Given that demand for software engineers is high, the software engineers can command higher wages through competition by employers for their labor.  


In this kind of ideal labor market, lower wages to female workers or departments is described by a lack of women choosing to work in the most competitive labor markets.  This is complicated because as the meme above notes, women get paid less for the same position, which is partly social (managers seeing women differently from men and awarding raises differently) and partly because corporations dislike having an actual open labor market and instead try to get away with underpaying people as much as possible, especially through obfuscating what your colleagues are getting paid.

“The official Bureau of Labor Department statistics show that the median earnings of full-time female workers is 77 percent of the median earnings of full-time male workers. But that is very different than “77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men.” The latter gives the impression that a man and a woman standing next to each other doing the same job for the same number of hours get paid different salaries. That’s not at all the case. “Full time” officially means 35 hours, but men work more hours than women. That’s the first problem: We could be comparing men working 40 hours to women working 35.”

Top 10 most dangerous jobs (from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics): Fishers, loggers, aircraft pilots, farmers and ranchers, roofers, iron and steel workers, refuse and recyclable material collectors, industrial machinery installation and repair, truck drivers, construction laborers. They're all male-dominated jobs.”  

“Men are far more likely to take work in uncomfortable, isolated, and undesirable locations that pay more.Men work longer hours than women do. The average fulltime working man works 6 hours per week or 15 percent longer than the average fulltime working woman.

Men are more likely to take jobs that require work on weekends and evenings and therefore pay more.”  

“Even within the same career category, men are more likely to pursue high-stress and higher-paid areas of specialization. For example, within the medical profession, men gravitate to relatively high-stress and high-paying areas of specialization, like surgery, while women are more likely to pursue relatively lower-paid areas of specialization like pediatrician or dentist.”

3399,10889,"Well, it's hard to say that someone is or isn't talented when you're discussing art.  You have to either rely on expert opinions (which are still opinions and not facts) or you have to go by one of the metrics like sales, which is flawed because it's really just an aggregate opinion of the masses through economic polling and again that's opinion.  Even if you go by a metric of ""impact"" or ""provocativeness"", that is flawed.  If you measure by impact, you are at best making a magnitude judgement and you definitely aren't making a quality argument.  The most ""impactful and provocative"" artist might sound good, but think about it in terms of other types of people: the most ""impactful and provocative"" world leader in the 20th century was probably Hitler, which should show you that using that as a measure of quality is flawed.  


Ultimately, whether there are good or talented rappers at all in an objective sense is thus questionable.  


Thus, if you don't simply return troll fire with troll fire, you shouldn't directly answer his expressed question but instead engage on what your opponent thinks shows good rap and talent for rapping.  Then, in many cases, you will have an opportunity to show your opponent that by their own definition, that there are good female rappers.  Your opponent might actually have a self-consistent definition that means there are no good female rappers, in which case you lose, but most people haven't thought critically enough about their opinions to have definitions and beliefs that are perfectly in sync.  Rather, people tend to start with a belief and then create a quick definition to (imperfectly) rationalize their beliefs.  


Arguing in the current way you are, without clear definitions, is little different from schoolchildren yelling ""Yes!"" and ""No!"" back and forth as an ""argument"".

For instance, socialism has nothing to do with welfare. The latter is a separate layer that's tacked on for general wellbeing. Socialism is merely that the people who are providing labor for a company ought to own the value associated with the output of that labor. This is in contrast to capitalism where the holder of capital ultimately earns 100% of the spoils and then decides who/how much to pay from there.

In socialism, we almost wouldn't need labor laws because the companies would literally be run by the workers in a democratic or elected-representative fashion.

3472,10984,"While you can start teaching with just a bachelor's, every school district I've  seen requires ongoing education every year (minimum 8 credits/year-ish), plus to get anywhere near a decent living wage you need a Master's degree anyways - the wage charts I've seen only add another 3-5k/year for each additional degree.

So not only do you get paid shit, have 100k+ in loans, you still need to spend approx 6k+/year on further education. Which may or may not be subsidized by your union, but if it isn't- average starting salary for a teacher in the US is $39,249, so approximately 15% of your income goes to paying for classes to keep your job. On top of living expenses.

So while teaching doesn't require the same intensity of education and specialization, the pay gap is still too extreme. There's already a shortage of both teachers and doctors, so you would expect both professions to have incomes on the rise, but that's not the case.",Ceylaway,2019-11-17 17:09:07,2019-11-17 18:04:19,/r/Feminism/comments/dx3554/the_accuracy_hurts/f7u4ol4/,t1_f7u1d39,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-17 18:04:19,0.20322,0.00014,0.25058,0.00044,0.01967,0.00014,0.00082,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3481,10995,"&gt;&gt; And what prevents those in power in a socialist structure from abusing that power?

The people”in power” under socialism is the working class. The people determine democratically what is to be done with the value their labor produces, not billionaires who never work. Furthermore, socialism/communism are based on the decentralization of power and distribution based on need, rather than distribution to whoever has money and ONLY whoever has money. When power is decentralized, it’s almost impossible to abuse like it is abused under capitalism. And may I remind you, the abuse of power under capitalism leads to ramped poverty, starvation, and death. 

&gt;&gt; There is a reason why capitalism works, even with its flaws.

It doesn’t work. It’s estimated that 20 million people a year die from starvation and curable illness the world over. If the world were socialist, this would never happen, because as I said, things are distributed based on need, not based on who can afford it. Healthcare and food are considered basic human rights under communism, as well as housing

&gt;&gt;While socialism looks to mitigate disparity in income equality, it creates inequality of opportunity with fixed outcomes.

The fact that you care more about opportunity for yourself and other privileged people than the literal lives of millions of people who die under capitalism each year says a lot about you

&gt;&gt; All this said though, the free market thrives on proper regulation.

The “free market” is actually not free at all, and it’s controlled by the wealthiest class, who would sooner let millions starve than undergo the SLIGHTEST bit of regulation. It is just plain sickening

&gt;&gt; I do think we will need to incorporate more aspects of socialism

I’m curious as to what aspects of socialism you think we should incorporate

&gt;&gt; Capitalism allows for the potential for some upward mobility. In a failed socialist structure, there is no potential.
 
Yikes, you’re literally citing capitalist propaganda as an argument. That is beat for beat what the 1% tells us to keep us pacified and to stop us from asking questions about where the value our labor produces is going (hint: it’s their pockets)

Ultimately, I don’t understand why you would want a system where the people who already have more than everyone continue to choke out the resources from the working class. You’ve heard of lobbyists right? Millionaires and billionaires who pay off congresspeople to vote based on corporate interests rather than the interests of the people. That’s entirely a product of capitalism, and it’s an example of how capitalism is more corrupt than communism could ever be.

Do you really think there is hope for regulation to ever increase in a system that allows billionaires to do this? I don’t, but maybe it takes others longer to open their eyes and see the forest for the trees. You’re asking people who have never done any good to suddenly start putting the lives of the many over their own gross amounts of wealth, just so you can have “opportunity” to move up in the world",jimmyk22,2019-11-17 16:58:09,2019-11-17 17:48:26,/r/Feminism/comments/dxa16d/be_the_ceo_your_parents_always_wanted_you_to_marry/f7u2c59/,t1_f7qt7wl,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-17 17:48:26,0.00336,0.0,0.00021,0.00022,0.0007,5e-05,5e-05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3512,11031,"Marriage is very much a sexist concept, though I'm far from an expert, and I'm sure others can explain it better, I'll try to give you some points on why marriage is inherently sexist.

Historically, getting married was essentially like changing ownership, women were owned by their fathers until they got married, at which point they were property of their husbands. I say property, because they had to take the husband's surname, look after the house, look after the kids, not allowed legal representation, not allowed to inherit property, no sexual autonomy, and far more, under legal doctrines such as [Coverture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverture). Marriage is still like this in some countries, and even in western countries, many aspects of these marriages remain.

Aspects of those marriages that still remain, include women taking men's name, or the fact that spousal rape was only fairly recently outlawed, as of around 1993, though it still has loopholes that states are working on fixing.

[An example of spousal rape laws failing is that some underage girls can be married to their rapists to avoid the rapist being charged with rape and arrested.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/fb2ba47b-8d50-4df1-aa42-b756e9fb26b4)

3594,11158,"I don't think it _has_ to be like this. Looking back on it, I think I just had a hard time decoupling my identity from the abstract concept of ""maleness"" and the social performance of masculinity. I had very little sexual experience at that point, which may have contributed to an unaware drive to want to participate in that ""maleness"" and prove that I really was a part of it (but also not a rapist). 

So hearing things like ""men misinterpret friendliness for consent"" sounded like a kind of cluster bomb that I knew didn't apply to me (because I wasn't having sex at all) and didn't want to get caught in (because not having sex at all, I felt unsure about my masculinity and wanted to be included in maleness in general).

I hope that makes some kind of sense.

Anyway, I'd guess that for sure, for some dudes it is like that. It's the old ""rape is [just] when someone wearing a ski mask breaks into your house at night / drags you into an alley / catches you alone in the prison shower"" trope. There's no way what _he_ did was rape because she went on a date with him, so if it's rape then it's not ""legitimate"" rape and so on, the kind of stuff we see all the time.

3616,11196,"Men who endorse social hierarchies are more likely to objectify women when their own power is threatened, according to new research published in the journal Psychology of Women Quarterly.

“I am generally intrigued by identifying subtle social psychological mechanisms that reinforce gender power relations and traditional gender roles. These subtle forms of oppression are especially interesting because they are harder to recognize and resist and sometimes even more damaging than overtly hostile forms,” explained study author Orly Bareket, a member of the Improving Social Relations Lab at Tel Aviv University.

“I have a particular interest in subtle and mundane manifestations of objectification (e.g., gazing at women’s bodies), which are not overtly hostile or oppressive, and are often assumed to be driven solely by sexual motivations.”


 
“I wanted to show that sexual drives clearly are not the whole story by demonstrating that the objectification of women is also driven by the motivation to maintain men’s dominance,” Bareket said.

An initial survey of 80 heterosexual women and 72 heterosexual men in Israel found that men’s social dominance orientation — a measure of the acceptance of hierarchical and dominant relations between social groups — was associated with their tendency to objectify women. But women’s tendency to objectify men was unrelated to their social dominance orientation.

People with a high social dominance orientation agree with statements such as “It’s probably a good thing that certain groups are at the top and other groups are at the bottom.”

The researchers then conducted two experiments — one with 117 heterosexual men and the other with 129 heterosexual women — to examine how having one’s own power threatened influenced the relationship between social dominance orientation and objectification.

In the experiments, participants were assigned to work as either subordinates or as equally-powerful teammates with a partner of the opposite sex. The researchers then assessed the participants’ objectification of their partner and their general tendency to objectify people of the opposite sex.",Yeahmaybeitsdetritus,2019-11-10 14:09:02,2019-11-10 14:11:54,/r/Feminism/comments/dtyez0/what_a_surprise/f73te7x/,t3_dtyez0,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-10 14:11:54,0.00445,7e-05,0.00027,0.00407,0.0007,0.00014,0.00725,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I agree that this meme is pretty trite and glib, given that the exploitation (primarily of women) in the rag trade both as workers and, ultimately, consumers goes way beyond Beyoncé. I also think we are way too quick to criticise women, particularly women of colour, for 'failing' us in a social justice sense. I suppose it's because we feel betrayed by their hypocrisy as we put our trust in them as vanguards of 'the movement'; but, ultimately, holding these women to a higher standard than we would hold Marc Jacobs (for example) results in just the same kind of sexist/prejudiced discrimination that we claimed to be against.

I disagree with the sentiment of us having power as consumers to change the fashion industry, but obviously a brand that sells 'ethical fashion' is going to say that.

Beyonce has more than enough money to choose a company that pays their employees fairly or literally start her own company from scratch and build a whole factory. The argument that you should blame the industry instead of the person is true for people who aren't filthy rich.

I don't think it's correct to say that all the blame is pinned on Beyonce. The use of sweatshops by retail companies has been a topic of controversy/discussion for decades, and there have been many, many journalistic investigations into this practice that have 'pinned the blame' on a variety of companies. It's not like the media never focused on this until Beyonce came around. 

&gt;Beyoncé might not have done much to change this situation as an individual, but we have the power as consumers to challenge all brands, and the systems that profit from exploitation. The solution lies in supporting brands that do things differently.

This narrative unfairly places all responsibility on consumers while not holding those in power accountable. This is like saying that we shouldn't blame governments for failing to take action on climate change because we as individuals can make more environmentally friendly choices -- no, neither climate change nor sweatshops will ever be effectively addressed by individual consumers. The people in power are the ones responsible and the ones who need to be held accountable.

3680,11291,"What does my prior posting to ProtectandServe or my posting in another subreddit have to do with this current discussion at all, the argument being my being a troll or advocating for cops to not test rape kits? You’re bringing up items that were not put forth in the initial/original argument and using other items not put forth to discredit the person bringing forth the argument; it’s an ad hominem, wherein you avoid the discussion at hand by attacking the character or other attribute of the person making the argument. Had you looked at this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/dz952q/unightstalker98_v_urandybrobro_for_holy_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app), you’d find a substantial amount of evidence showing I’m telling the truth and not being deceptive in any way. 

As well, insinuating I’m running a cop apologist subreddit is completely misinterpreting the content of what has been posted and said within my sub. If I were a bootlicker, then I would not even acknowledge the items I’ve posted exist or just outright respond to every post defending the police; that’s not at all what my comments or posts in r/policeaccountability2 do or say. Had you examined those posts and comments in depth or examined the entire thread within the r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut post that is linked above or looked through my own comments, you’d find that none of what I’ve said is inaccurate nor misleading. 

As well, I made only two posts on ProtectandServe in the past two months, both of which I’ve made available to you below with proper context;

*Awful to hear he got blinded. Hopefully he’s recuperating as best he can* (https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/dnd987/update_rpd_officer_stabbed_responding_to_a/f5a4htf/?context=3)

*Sucks to live in Texas then* (https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/do7hi9/meme_extremely_accurate/f5mnxzt/?context=3)

For example, gaming is too often coded as a male interest. That means that people who don't fit into the mold are excluded and pushed out if too many outsiders as seen with Gamer Gate. Abolishing gender in this case would mean the only barrier to entry would be actual interest in the hobby.

Masculinity and femininity are also subject to gatekeeping. I was often told I wasn't a real boy because my hair was too long.

3703,11340,"Edit: My original comment came out really negative-sounding... What I mean is, changing people's minds is a skill. Learning rhetorical/debate strategies can help. And knowing your ""debate opponent"" -- and knowing deeply about yourself -- can help you make better inroads at less cost/with less friction. Trying to change people is hard and rarely works the way you want it to, but if you respond with concerned empathy (tough love?) that is what gets you the farthest, in my experience. (Learning to stand up for yourself is also a skill in and of itself. Doing so in a proportionate way, that nonetheless is firm and forward enough to protect and assert your needs, and that doesn't burn you out, takes a lot of empathy, emotional intelligence, and determination in the long term.) And while it came across negative in my main comment, I do think sometimes it's not worth trying to change somebody -- a person has to want to change, or they won't. You can't force it. So best of luck, and I hope you get what you need out of the situation, and you can save the relationships from these rough/undesirable aspects. Best to you.

/Edit.

Trying to change people uses up ""political capital"" -- if you push too hard too fast, they can feel like the cost to them for staying friends (having to self-examine and change, gasp!) is higher than the benefit of laughing and having a good time and whatever bond has been formed thus far.

So the flip-side of that is wondering whether these friendships are good enough to you, to worry about saving them.

IMO, why not; Either you get better friendships out of it, you learn and grow as a group by working these things out, or you drop friendships that weren't worth keeping.

(The other option is to keep hanging out but invest less in those friends -- demote them from ""best friends"" to ""those guys I hang out with"".)


---

As for how to bring it up... Well I think these guys are saturated in masculine norms. You'll probably want to learn more about masculine norms so you can guess where this stuff comes from. ""Stuff they hear everywhere without questioning it""? ""In-jokes specific to this group""? ""Stuff this one dude keeps saying that no-one gets but he keeps saying it""?

And likewise, knowing the differences between ""guy norms"" and ""lady norms"" might give you a clearer picture of the stuff they still need to learn. Being well-researched can hopefully help you pick out the right things to say, and respond to pushback.

A psychology note: Guys have a higher tendency toward aggression, which manifests in slightly offensive humor that tests boundaries. If it doesn't test boundaries, it doesn't provoke, and it doesn't implicitly check who's the most likely to go off or assert themselves. And in that case, it doesn't blow off steam either. It's basically play-fighting. One if the few ways that norm-following guys get to sort out emotions in public. If you can call it that.
If they stay set in their guy's guy ways, this type of humor will always be there, even if the target shifts from women to somebody else. Sad, but the change you're hoping for seems unlikely, given the group dynamics you've described. But maybe they can find an acceptable (not genuinely at-risk) target somehow?

Also, having more girls/women in the friend group might change the dynamic. It's harder for everyone to change for one person than for half the group to change for the other half -- the latter just sort of happens, or else the group falls apart. And it ideally makes it clearer what is a gender/demographic divide vs. personal differences.",myalt08831,2019-11-03 15:49:14,2019-11-03 17:04:54,/r/Feminism/comments/dqjdc7/my_guy_friends_are_becoming_more_sexist_the_more/f6dpy42/,t3_dqjdc7,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-03 17:04:54,0.00363,2e-05,0.00059,0.00045,0.00065,8e-05,0.00026,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If there's a major, time-limited threat like construction or demolition or eviction in a neighborhood, a person being harassed or bullied, etc, then speaking out and direct action is probably more appropriate.

They are also portrayed in a manner as if they  are demure and very obedient.  

This glorification of oversized boobs in arts, movies and video games is actually very unethical and misogynistic.

3801,11529,"He wasn't justifying harassment nor was he denying the existence of it. If you have any intention of genuinely improving the situation then you need to stop making an enemy out of everyone you don't understand or don't agree with. 

Do you think anyone is going to change from your attacks? No. People change from understanding, empathy and genuine conversation. You trying to attack him for his point without even trying to explain your side is incredibly detrimental to the purpose of feminism. 

There are scenarios where a shy or socially inept Male may not entirely understand or properly read signals, so it's not entirely foolish for them to have a way of double checking if the girl is actually interested. 

Think about it this way-- we've got a well intentioned Male and a girl. There are two scenarios here. The first, the girl is interested. The second, she's not. 

In scenario one-- the shy boy has the courage to ask her for her number, and she offers it to him. He's not sure if she's really interested or if she's feeling pressured. If she's interested, he wants to talk to her. So he uses the test and decides the number is real and they talk and have an excellent night. 

In the second scenario the situation is the same-- but he realizes the number is fake and that she's not interested. So instead of continuing to bother her, he takes the hint and leaves her alone. 

It's a win/win. Would you really rather he thought the number was real and continued to try and get close all night? Or would you rather he found the truth and moved on?

It's obvious there are possible misuses of this technique and also obvious there are awful men who would keep pushing regardless. But the point the commentor before me was making, and the part I agreed with to some extent, is that the technique itself isn't what's evil or wrong, the way the man acts after finding out it's a fake number is what is right or wrong. 

I understand though, that the idea of evil men using it is scary. The idea of losing the option top handout fake numbers threatens yours and many others security-- and for that, I feel for you. I wish I could end all evil and stop all unwanted advances. I get absolutely infuriated when I see a Male take advantage of a girl, and I will never hesitate to step in and stop them. 

But do you really think attacking someone who simply had a different perspective is bringing us closer to unity? We need to understand eachother and talk about our feelings and concerns in a mature way. This is how bonds are formed. This is how humanity stays together. Not by fighting eachother. 

So please, understand that we don't mean to justify the atrocities that occur or undermine your feelings. I only meant to explain to him the other side in a way he could understand without attacking him, and I also meant to show the other perspective to those who didn't understand him. 

I apologize that I offended you by saying that others were emotionally charged, I don't mean it as an insult. Emotions are natural, especially when dealing with these kinds of conversations. But they do cloud our ability to talk things out. 

I won't argue further, but I'd be glad to discuss things.

1: The wage gap from my own observations at the facts and statistics is something made up to show how ""Women earn less than men for the same job"" which isnt true. The ""wage gap"" Should be called the page gap because it simply shows the average earnings between men and women, it doesn't count for days off, over time, specific jobs. So on average, women earn 77 Cents to every dollar that a man make, this has been twisted to having people think that in america if you are a woman you will be paid less. Logically if that waas the case, then women should make up at least 75% of our work force because if people could get away with paying women less for the same job, then most people would hire mainly women as they could pay less for the same job.'

2: Feminism has always been about pushing towards equality towards men and women in America. Since things like women's suffrage. In todays society, it seems to me based on my own observations that todays feminist are extremist who seem to push for female supremacy in the name of equality. The reason why I say this is because feminist today will scream left and right 24/7 about womens issues in america (which the do have issues im not saying they dont and they have the right to discuss that if they want) but will group together and protest and block men from getting together to discuss mens issues or claim people who do are sexist towards women. Like how men are 3x more likley to commit suicide but when an annoucement came out that men would be doing that they joined together and tried to block men, or when men talk about how wrong it is for a women to lie about being raped which will greatly hurt a man if that lie came out, they claim those people to be sexist. Now there are issues that women face today that they are fighting for. Abortion rights (while I dont agree with the act I DO believe that a woman has the right to do what she pleases with her body and I just hope when they do it doesnt hurt others or themselves), Cat calling is something i know that annoys most females, since they are treated like some walking showdog to be hollered at because of their looks. However many of todays feminist get a bad reputation because of the handful of trigger happy ""Feminazis"" that are man haters who believe all men should either die or be subjected to a womans beck and call. 

3: The patriarchy is a society that is mainly ruled by men. While there are countries today that are a patriarchy, America is not one of them. A woman get attain any position of power in America and have a fair chance to do so.

4: I dont even need to be part of this subreddit to know that of course colored women are accepted here. Everyone is accpeted here.

The wage gap isn't real, the study is based of taking all jobs that all women and men work and taking that pay. it only shows that men tend to choose higher paying jobs usually in business. Where as women tend to choose a career in childcare or other jobs where they are around people because by genetic makeup they are more social than men.
2. the first two waves of feminism were great, as women got the right to vote through this. In this day and age feminism is about depreciating males and establishing fallacies like the patriarchy and the wage gap which used to be a huge problem when feminism first started but is no longer the case.
3. there is no patriarchy. if it was true that our society is male orientated then why would men be more likely to be homeless, more likely to be in jail, more likely to be killed on the job, more likely to be abused and/or assaulted as well as **3x more likely to commit suicide**. so if that isn't enough for you please provide me with statistics that prove me wrong.

The first person is giving advice on how to tell if a girl is giving you a fake number, presumably to call her out or something or other. The second person is saying if she did give you a fake number, then obviously she isn't interested and you should just leave her be. 

So there's no reason to test if it's real or not, since you can just text her later. If it's real, cool. If it's not, then she wasn't interested anyways. 

The reason I disagree however, is that some people are genuinely unsure-- so if you use the trick and find it's fake, you know not to bother her for the evening, or ever. If it passes, then maybe you are actually hitting it off.

That being said, even if you, as the artist, *intend* something to be a certain way within the world of your painting, it’s still subject to the interpretation of its real-world viewers. 


The subjects of this painting meet male-dominated standards of femininity. I *personally* like that about this painting. I’m a feminist who loves performing femininity and I find the subjects aesthetically pleasing. However, I agree with the commenters who say that this piece isn’t exactly subversive when it comes to the “censorship” theme, as classically cis-feminine women have been painted by men throughout the ages. 

It’s okay if you intended these nymphs to be AFAB. I don’t think you have to justify that.

But I do think they are trying to look like the hot but still cute mid to late teen girl.   I put this as I don't think men are becoming more pedophilic i.e sexually attracted to prepubescent children.   I think men are and have always been hebephiles i.e sexually attracted to young girls and boys who are just maturing.  That is around the 11 to 14 age group.    Traditionally many countries including America and most Western countries girls were found male suitors around that age and many were married by 13/14 and having children.   Some other countries still today push that.

&amp;#x200B;

So it is only fairly recently due to laws and a change in societal expectations that men are not openly going after or letting it be known that they are sexually attracted to people of that age range.     I however,  think that is men going against their natural biology and I do think that is a good thing.   But if you look at nature most animals will start to breed or begin having sex with the female of the species once she starts to go into season or menstruate which is around the age of 11 to 14.  

&amp;#x200B;

So to me men are not becoming more hebephilic they have always been hebephilic.   So these little things adverts do,  Anime does,  video clips do is to play to that.

The gender pay gap or gender wage gap is the average difference between the remuneration for men and women who are working.  Women are generally considered to be paid less than men. There are two distinct numbers regarding the pay gap: unadjusted versus adjusted pay gap. The latter typically takes into account differences in hours worked, occupations chosen, education and job experience.

As a result of her visions, she never lost a single person. She saved hundreds of slaves and brought them to freedom. She was never caught and she never lost a single passenger.

I didn't think I would be harassed to the point of needing to add this. I didn't think it was a big deal that I didn't elaborate because this was on r/feminism, not r/history.

Gastrulation is a phase early in the embryonic development of most animals, during which the single-layered blastula is reorganized into a multilayered structure known as the gastrula. Before gastrulation, the embryo is a continuous epithelial sheet of cells; by the end of gastrulation, the embryo has begun differentiation to establish distinct cell lineages, set up the basic axes of the body (e.g. dorsal-ventral, anterior-posterior), and internalized one or more cell types including the prospective gut.

In triploblastic organisms the gastrula is trilaminar (""three-layered"").

Majority of these victims are women and people who are forced to become prostitutes/prostituted due to poverty, dehumanization, lack of access to education and workplace.

4009,11824,"&gt;In my opinion, kink shaming is an entirely valid term. It is used to explain misogynistic opinions that a woman having an actual sexual appetite with fetishes and interests is somehow wrong. I do not see how mocking an entire valid way for someone to express themselves sexually would be anything but sexist. Criticism is fine, and the fetish community for example does carry many internal issues which need constant cultural checks and conversation. But anything short of a open and civil discussion will achieve nothing.

 Totally heteropatriarchal understanding. Women have every right to love BDSM but they should also be free to hate it if they want without any heteropatriarchal consequences and tone-policing from males and hand maidens.  By accusing them of kink shaming, you silence  them in a heteropatriarchal manner. They are now being downvoted by boot-licking hand maidens and heteropatriarchal males.  Violence against women in the name of ""BDSM sex"" is far more concerning than your heteropatriarchal feelings.  And it's noteworthy, women victims and feminists randomly get accused of ""kink shaming "". Also, getting shamed itself is a form of kink for some people and thereby making the term useless.",MistWeaver80,2019-11-21 22:27:24,2019-11-21 22:27:36,/r/Feminism/comments/dzo4w0/6bdsm_is_now_a_strategic_defense_for_men_in_the/f89lobv/,t1_f89echy,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-21 22:27:36,0.12956,0.00015,0.00194,0.0191,0.04361,0.00031,0.04522,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

4030,11851,"I am so confused. I am in fact the director of kinky services for my university's sexpositive club. Never in my years of interest for fetishes and working to promote positive sexual environment has anyone come to me, claiming that ""kink"" is an unacceptable term. 

Kinky as a term refers to any sexual activity considered ""unusual"". I'm sure any fetish behavior falls under that umbrella, and thus BDSM would be a type of kink. Simple enough. Obviously sorting types of sexual activities into normal and not is problematic, but that's an entirely different discussion.

In my opinion, kink shaming is an entirely valid term. It is used to explain misogynistic opinions that a woman having an actual sexual appetite with fetishes and interests is somehow wrong. I do not see how mocking an entire valid way for someone to express themselves sexually would be anything but sexist. Criticism is fine, and the fetish community for example does carry many internal issues which need constant cultural checks and conversation. But anything short of a open and civil discussion will achieve nothing.

My aim was never to silence the person to whom I replied to. I wanted to bring attention to the fact that human sexuality is wonderfully complex, and when done correctly, safely and with boundaries and consent, BDSM is as valid a way of behaving sexually as anything else is.  Why is it such a mind boggling idea that women in fact do have the right to partake in BDSM activities, if they find sex more enjoyable as such?",Northern_dragon,2019-11-21 21:27:20,2019-11-21 21:27:39,/r/Feminism/comments/dzo4w0/6bdsm_is_now_a_strategic_defense_for_men_in_the/f89echy/,t1_f89bz49,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-21 21:27:39,0.03706,0.00013,0.00122,0.00545,0.00163,0.00033,0.1591,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

She could be in gym class, art, PE, homeroom, etc. with other 8 year olds and working on her degree when they're doing their core classes. It's pretty common for gifted children to be pulled out and/or bused to higher level schools (though of course it's typically a 6th grader doing 10th grade or a high schooler attending community college, not a 3rd grader in university).

She could attend an alternative or part-time school. One near where I grew up held classes twice a week and parents could enroll their kids in whatever classes they wanted (again, things like art, PE, music, etc.) and homeschool or send them to a different school on the other days. This was popular for advanced teens who wanted to start doing university credits. 

She could be primarily socializing through non-school avenues like sports, church, scouts, community center activities, etc. 

You're assuming that the only options are ""crazy intense life that is school and only school with people decades older than you"" or ""attend local school with kids your age"", but that's not reality. Socialization is important, and I hope she is being properly cared for in that regard. Intellectual engagement is also important and valuable. An 8 year old who is ready for college is going to benefit from college for its own sake, even if her education and career path are unconventional. 

We're not talking about a typical smart kid being pressured and forced to perform a decade ahead of her peers (I don't even think it's possible to force a typical smart kid to do that). We're talking about an exceptional child with exceptional educational needs. It is possible that she is being pressured--and that would be wrong--but it's not a given. University classes could be to her what third grade is to other kids her age.",ami_anai,2019-11-21 19:51:40,2019-11-21 19:51:52,/r/Feminism/comments/dzj01p/congratulations_adhara/f892njt/,t1_f890it6,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-21 19:51:52,0.00255,1e-05,0.00013,0.00106,0.00059,2e-05,0.00021,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The authors note that in Denmark abortions can be accessed legally, and so it is not clear whether the results generalise to other contexts, particularly where access to abortion is legally restricted. They also note that not all women with mental health problems may seek help, therefore, the effect of previous mental health problems may be underestimated.

Writing in a linked Comment, Dr Jenneke van Ditzhuijzen from the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands, says: ""The increased risk of non-fatal suicide attempts in women who have had an abortion might be related to other co-occurring risk factors around the time of the unwanted pregnancy and abortion, such as intimate partner violence, unstable relationships, or other negative life events, for which Steinberg and colleagues could not adjust.""

She continues: ""This does not mean that having an abortion is an indication that women are going through a difficult time, or that the symptoms of mental disorders are attributable to the abortion, but rather that some women are at an elevated risk of multiple adversities at a certain period in their life, which could include an unwanted pregnancy and abortion.""",Yeahmaybeitsdetritus,2019-11-21 19:37:44,2019-11-21 19:37:55,/r/Feminism/comments/dzmdeo/abortion_does_not_increase_a_womans_risk_of/f89107s/,t1_f88ym63,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-21 19:37:55,0.01166,0.0007,0.00146,0.00305,0.00388,0.00365,0.00184,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At the end of our conversation, I respectfully told him that the whole interaction felt like mansplaining, because he’d given me unsolicited advice, and wasn’t hearing me when I told him he was wrong, and to maybe ask people if they want advice before giving it in the future.

Reviewing her sex life and her tendencies in the Court room was a necessary part of justice (unfortunately) - but doing that doesn't mean it was victim blaming. 

Grace's spirit and reputation will always remain in tact.

The saddest thing about the enquiry into her sex life wasn't actually the enquiry itself (As that had to be done unfortunately) - it was how the media reported on it disgustingly. The media continue to get away with so much and we don't hold them accountable?

The OP you responded to claiming kinkshaming said the reason she couldn't imagine doing BDSM wasn't that it was gross, or that she wasn't theoretically interested. For all you know, she's a lifer in regards to what she reads, fantasizes about, or watches.

But that the main reason she wouldn't that she was afraid of being assaulted or worse or her interest being used to dismiss an unrelated assault or homicide, kind of makes my point.

One thing I stress to a lot of people is to really get to know the devices you use on a regular basis. If you can, learn how to fix minor issues yourself, if something is over your head and you need to get it fixed by someone else, make sure they explain everything they are doing. I fix my own folk's computers and I do my best to explain what I'm installing and removing. For example, if you handed me a computer and told me to reinstall Windows, I have no business opening up the computer unless I show a reason I needed to. It's YOUR device, not theirs.

&gt;The rape and murder of Stites was hardly Reed’s first or last foray against women. First was Connie York, a nineteen-year-old who had come home late one evening after swimming with friends. 57.RR.34–35. York was grabbed from behind and told “don’t scream or I’ll hurt you.” 57.RR.35–36. When York did not listen, she was repeatedly struck, dragged to her bedroom, and raped multiple times. 57.RR.37–42. 
&gt;
&gt;Reed was interviewed, and, while he admitted that he knew York from high school, he denied raping her. 57.RR.123–24. When confronted with a search warrant for biological samples, Reed had an about-face, “Yeah, I had sex with her, she wanted it.” 57.RR.138. The case went to trial four years later, 57.RR.30, 60, and Reed was acquitted, 57.RR.61.  
&gt;
&gt;Next was A.W., a twelve-year-old girl, who was home alone, having fallen asleep on a couch after watching TV. 58.RR.36–42. A.W. awoke when someone began pushing her face into the couch and had blindfolded and gagged her. 58.RR.42–43. She was repeatedly hit in the head, called vulgar names, and orally, vaginally, and anally raped. 58.RR.43–49. The foreign DNA from A.W.’s rape kit was compared to Reed; Reed was not excluded and only one in 5.5 billion people would have the same foreign DNA profile from A.W.’s rape kit. 58.RR.51, 92;61.RR.26.  
&gt;
&gt;Then came Lucy Eipper, who Reed had met in high school, and whom Reed began to date after her graduation. 59.RR.10–12. Eipper had two children with Reed. 59.RR.13–14, 19–20 Throughout their relationship, Reed physically abused Eipper, including while she was pregnant, and raped her “all the time,” including one time in front of their two children. 59.RR.14–17, 21, 25–32.Afterwards, Reed began dating Caroline Rivas, an intellectually disabled woman. 60.RR.39–41. Rivas’s caseworker noticed bruises on Rivas’s body and, when asked about them, Rivas admitted that Reed would hurt her if she would not have sex with him. 60.RR.41, 61.Later, Rivas’s caseworker noticed that Rivas was walking oddly and sat down gingerly. 60.RR.43. Rivas admitted that Reed had, the prior evening, hit her, called her vulgar names, and anally raped her. 60.RR.44, 63–65. The samples from Rivas’s rape kit provided the link to Stites’s murder. 60.RR.89–90.Shortly thereafter, and about six months before Stites’s murder, Reed raped Vivian Harbottle underneath a train trestle as she was walking home. 59.RR.87–92. When she pleaded for her life for the sake of her children, Reed laughed at her. 59.RR.94. The foreign DNA from Harbottle’s rape kit Awas compared to Reed; he could not be excluded, and only one person in 5.5 billion would be expected to have the same foreign DNA profile. 59.RR.95, 113–14; 61.RR.26.  
&gt;
&gt;Finally, and about six months after Stites’s murder, Reed convinced nineteen-year-old Linda Schlueter to give him a ride home at about 3:30 a.m. 61.RR.10, 37–47. Reed led her to a remote area and then attacked her. 61.RR.47–58. After a prolonged struggle, Schlueter asked Reed what he wanted and Reed responded, “I want a blow job.” 61.RR.60. When Schlueter told Reed that “you will have to kill me before you get anything,” Reed stated “I guess I’ll have to kill you then.” 61.RR.60. Before Schlueter could be raped, a car drove by and Reed fled. 61.RR.62–64.

4161,12545,"This is referring to this law that was passed over the summer: California becomes first state to ban discrimination based on one’s natural hair

JULY 3, 2019 1:15 PM  Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday signed a bill into law that legally protects people in workplaces and K-12 public schools from discrimination based on their natural hair. The new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, prohibits the enforcement of grooming policies that disproportionately affect people of color, particularly black people. This includes bans on certain styles, such as Afros, braids, twists, cornrows and dreadlocks — or locs for short.
Newsom said the need for the protection entered the national political consciousness in December when a referee forced a black wrestler for a New Jersey high school to cut his dreadlocks or forfeit his match. That indignity forced the student to choose whether to “lose an athletic competition or lose his identity,” Newsom said.
“That is played out in workplaces, it’s played out in schools — not just in athletic competitions and settings — every single day all across America in ways that are subtle, in ways overt,” Newsom said during a morning bill-signing ceremony at the Capitol in Sacramento.
The CROWN Act, which passed unanimously in both the California Assembly and Senate, adds traits historically associated with race to the state’s list of classifications protected from discrimination, including race, sex, religion, color, national origin, disability and sexual orientation.
Supporters have said the legislation’s acronym reflects its intention: creating a respectful and open workplace for natural hair.
The bill’s author, Sen. Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles), said the new protection provides all Californians the right to wear natural hairstyles without fear of repercussions. Students will be able to go to school, and workers do their jobs, without feeling pressure to change their appearance based on someone else’s “comfort level,” she said.
“For us, it is a symbol of who we are. I know when I locked 15 years ago, I knew it was both a social and political statement to the outside world,” Mitchell said.
Mitchell wrote the proposed legislation, SB 188, and before the Senate unanimously passed it, she described the bill’s purpose as twofold: to dispel myths about black hair, its texture and the black hair experience, and to challenge what constitutes “professionalism” in the workplace.
The bill has inspired similar legislation in other regions: New York City officially banned natural hair discrimination in February, saying that hairstyles are protected under the city’s existing anti-discrimination laws because policing black hair is a form of pervasive racism and bias. Lawmakers in New York and New Jersey also proposed legislation modeled after the CROWN Act in June.

[*All usernames have been redacted with purple.*]

asking 'who benefits?' is very useful in feminist analysis. it reveals the shocking extent to which our society is male supremacist.
&gt;
&gt; Who benefits if young women are taught that violent p@rn is empowering?
&gt;
&gt; Who benefits if young women are taught that violent and abusive sex is liberating?
&gt;
&gt; Who benefits from young women being taught to demonise &amp; shun older feminists?
&gt;
&gt; who benefits when women focus their attention on their fuckability?
&gt;
&gt; who benefits when women quietly accept misogyny and oppression as inevitable?
&gt;
&gt; who benefits when sexual exploitation and objectification is reframed as empowerment?
&gt;
&gt; who benefits when women are coy, delicate and nurturing the way we're socialised to be?

Our need to arrange things into neat piles or boxes is so strong, due to our cognition and schemas. Right and wrong, left and right, black and white. We naturally want things to fit into a neat little label, and of course any label that perfectly separates something into two separate things is the best.

So, what features can we use to clearly divide up the human population into two easily comparable groups? Not really anything but sex/gender. I admit, the idea of a nice clear cut ""us and them"" difference is tempting, it would make everything so much less complicated. Would be so convenient to have these two, fairly evenly numbered and descriptively separate types of human. 

Except that things really always are more complicated. Right and wrong depends on perspective. Every deed hurts someone and and is good for another person.  Left and right are simply abstract descriptions. Black and white includes the existence of grey. Only way humanity can develop and move on, is to accept that nothing in this world is clear cut, there are no absolutes ever and everything you believe to be true is only your perspective. It goes further than gender issues, but the inability to accept that literally everything is ambivalent, is what drives sexism and transphobia.",Northern_dragon,2019-11-18 14:59:50,2019-11-18 14:59:52,/r/Feminism/comments/dy2xlr/makes_you_think/f7y8d79/,t1_f7y3n8y,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-18 14:59:52,0.03351,4e-05,0.00038,0.02485,0.00308,0.00018,0.00025,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

4318,13044,"Well I have been reading about symbolism in art a bit and perhaps that is what drew my thoughts so quickly to the horns. Being in England, and having quite a bit of ""royal news"" lately, there have been mentions of symbolism and totemic representations bubbling around the edges. For instance Princess Megan recently received a coat of arms, which are by nature rich in symbolism:

[https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/25/meghan-markles-coat-arms-revealed-kensington-palace-featuring-songbird-californian-poppies-7578418/?ito=desktop.article.share.top.twitter](https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/25/meghan-markles-coat-arms-revealed-kensington-palace-featuring-songbird-californian-poppies-7578418/?ito=desktop.article.share.top.twitter)

And there is a bit of intrigue going all the way back to cave art. Right across Europe cave art seems to have sprung up very quickly and almost certainly in an unconnected manner. And the subjects of the art are often very similar, and are almost never people, but similar animals. Horses and deer and horned creatures. But not predator animals. So in England you can walk through almost any city centre and almost assuredly see a White Hart (stag) pub - the symbolism of the antlered sign out front easily traceable straight back through thousands of years to a cave drawing. 

It is interesting that you mention too a relationship between your mental state and your work! Some think that the reason early people didn't draw human figures in those caves is that they may have felt drawing a person would mean the transference of part of the ""spirit"" into the work. And that perhaps drawing an animal would imbue the artist with some of the ""spirit"" of the subject. It sounds like hocus pocus, except that almost any artist will tell you that there is certainly some form of mental/emotional/spiritual link too their work!",Togethernotapart,2019-11-06 09:35:04,2019-11-06 09:35:05,/r/Feminism/comments/drcwfd/i_seem_to_have_offended_and_intrigued_a_few/f6osr1x/,t1_f6ogjah,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-06 09:35:05,0.0092,2e-05,0.00049,0.0017,0.00176,0.00011,0.00046,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

4332,13066,"Thing is, the Internet has educated people, expecting mothers especially, on the functions of the foreskin, the potential issues of circumcision, and the experiences of men who had no consent in the matter. Most people, once educated, are generally against circumcision if it's against the penis owner's consent. I know the conversation has really heated up, since when that Netflix documentary came out, I had my own mom point blank tell me she was so, so , so happy to have never circumcised me or my brothers. Before this, it seemed like she wasn't completely sure if she made the right choice.

Male circumcision, at this rate might die out in a few generations. The majority of men around the world are intact, even major religions have sects that are questioning it, there's more knowledge about the foreskin and related parts being shared than ever, and the general attitude towards foreskin in places like America has changed, we have the entire foreskin subreddit where men just post their intact penises and complement each other 24/7. And I don't usually see women coming into male spaces to derail the education and body positivity with ""stop talking about foreskin and talk about FGM!"".

Meanwhile, someone points out how FGM and assorted other abuses are really bad (and not really talked about), you get some guys who more or less say, ""What about men?"".

If that's your argument, then all the practitioners of FGM have to do is reduce the level to what you find acceptable in boys.  And that is exactly what they are doing to keep the practice going.

[http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Female-Circumcision-An-Islamic-practice-brings-untold-benefits-to-women-155646.html](http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Female-Circumcision-An-Islamic-practice-brings-untold-benefits-to-women-155646.html)

Here are the options:

1. Male and female cutting are both equally unethical. I condemn both.
2. Male and female cutting are both benign. I favor both.
3. Male  and female cutting are different from each other. The reason for the  difference is the amount of flesh being cut and the negative  consequences to the child. These styles of cutting can be deemed either more or less ethical by calibrating and measuring the various anatomical functions affected. The  consequences are debatable and mostly subjective as they depend on the  cultural context. In cases where the degree of physical cutting done on  females is less than that performed on males, we must weigh the factor  of intention to suppress sexual experience.  And I will be the judge of  whether such intention is present.   Also claims of the innate value of  the tissue being removed needs to be investigated.  Again, I will judge  whether such innate value exists, even though my own body lacks the  tissue in question.  And consider there may be advantages for males if  it reduces the chance of some maladies by (some random number of)  percentage points, but not if that percentage is too low.  But potential  health benefits do not apply in the case of females because ...  excuses, excuses, blah blah blah...

If you adopt option 3, you will never stop FGM.  

Stop all cutting of children's genitals.

This may not be a popular thing to say on this specific subreddit but it's pretty obvious that the number one issue facing society today is not racism or sexism but wealth inequality. And we currently have a system where maybe about 100 men and their cronies control the entire world, including the 3.5 billion men who don't have billions of dollars. He's wrong to dismiss any mention of being ""Male-dominated"" because come on seriously? Of course we're Male-dominated, but his point is interesting when you read it as: Men and woman have always cooperated to keep society moving forward and removing that cooperation from all stories of the past is a wrong interpretation of how humanity has gotten to this point, and removing that cooperation from the future is a terrible idea for everyone.

They are not LIKED by the majority of republican party for their own right leaning reasons but the only place where they are truly not ACCEPTED is in 3rd world countries, to be exact, countries where women are viewed less as human beings and where homosexual people get stoned to death.

They ARE accepted in countries where feminism is an ongoing topic, but in countries where feminists are unheard of, they AREN'T accepted and that's the hard truth, but in North america, Europe, Oceania and in certain eastern asian countries, there is a certain ''freedom of speech/expression''.

My problem is that this picture doesn't help trans-women at all, considering many TERFS are starting not to gatekeep as much and the majority of feminists already accepts trans-women. I find it very strange however how feminists always put an emphasis on women, can't men be respected and/or be feminists too? What about trans-men? Or is feminism exclusively for women?

4448,13233,"There are some interesting stories, poems and essays from 17/1800s European literature that you might want to take a look at, like:

Mary Wollstonecraft - A vindication of the rights of women
Various works by Hedwig Dohm 
Annette von Droste-Hülshoff- Am Turme (a poem... She had other works as well. She was a writer at a time in the German speaking countries when being a female writer was considered a moral/practical failure in the basic performance of womanhood).

There are others as well, of course, but I think that time period is particularly important because there are so many people who seem to want to go back to it. In reality, women being relegated to pet/mother/maid status was a byproduct of the shift to capitalism from feudalism. In some ways, women lost status during this period as a result of backlash against the movement, and only began to make progress in the late 1800s/early 1900's. Also many of the hypotheses regarding women's so called ""inferior intellect"" and ""physical/mental/emotional frailty"" originated from Victorian era science... Much of which was no more than simple guesses reinforced by the guessers personal biases and anecdotes. Arthur Schnitzler wrote a story called ""Andreas Thamayers letzte Brief,"" in which he illustrates (and thus invites criticism of) the thought processes involved in much of the enlightenment and Victorian era scientific ideas. I don't know if there is an English version, but you might be able to use Google translate to get an idea of what it's about.  There were alot of ""scientific ideas"" floating around that were not really based in science at all, but rather religious and cultural norms of the time (It is worth noting that many modern fundamentalist christian groups base their guidelines for female behavior, appearance, and performance on enlightenment and victorian era ideas about gender, although many are unaware of these origins). The enlightenment was not particularly kind to women in the short term, contrary to popular belief. There was a move toward science and reason, but much of what was considered science and reason was actually personal experiences and observations filtered through a lens of vestigial religious thinking patterns.",Oyngoboingo,2019-11-01 21:11:15,2019-11-01 21:11:27,/r/Feminism/comments/dpr1de/firstread_feminist_history_for_a_nonfeminist_male/f61mn6p/,t3_dpr1de,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-01 21:11:27,0.00227,4e-05,0.00017,0.00178,0.0005,7e-05,0.00029,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

4502,13313,"So you are talking about the act of liking someone but they do not reciprocate and see you only as a friend.  This happens and is okay.  The person with the feelings has a choice to either A become their friend and accept that they do not reciprocate romantic feelings or B decide to terminate the relationship because they cannot settle for being friends since it will cause them too much emotional distress.  Either option is fine.  What is not fine is the way the word is used against women.  Saying a girl put a guy in the friendzone is usually used to imply that she didn't have a right to refuse the sexual advance, that she should have been grateful he had interest, that her doing so was wrong.  This term is usually used by a butthurt person who cannot deal with their own feelings and thus insists that the friendzone was all that stopped them from the relationship they should have had.  The imagined reasons for being put into the friendzone usually include that the girl just wanted to lead them on, use them, and/or enjoys watching them suffer.  This term is a way to take away the autonomy of a women's right to choose for herself.  That is what the sign means.

That would depend on the rate at which people are actually violating the rules. If for example, girls were violating dress code at an equal rate, it would be unfair to them. If at 2x the rate, it would be equal. If at 4x the rate, it would be unfair to boys.

Equally important as enforcement would be that there aren't double standards for different sexes. If for example, girls were not allowed to expose their knees, then boys shouldn't be able to expose their knees either wearing shorts.

Sounds cliche, but research shows that if you increase women's economic resources and political power within a community, this sort of thing decreases, as women are no longer beholden to the whims of men for their survival and the survival of their children. 

Thing is, similar research has also shown that you need to keep that power away from the men.

4625,13567,"And what prevents those in power in a socialist structure from abusing that power? There is a reason why capitalism works, even with its flaws. In the end though, regardless of what system you prefer, be it socialism or capitalism, the people in power will always be flawed. Capitalism allows for the potential for some upward mobility. In a failed socialist structure, there is no potential.

In the end, everyone has different goals. Socialism is idealistic. In small groups it can work or even large homogenized groups. If everyone was able to contribute in the same way, then you could have some equality. While socialism looks to mitigate disparity in income equality, it creates inequality of opportunity with fixed outcomes. The free market can quickly adapt to allow for opportunity.

All this said though, the free market thrives on proper regulation. Since we don't have that, capitalism suffers. I do think we will need to incorporate more aspects of socialism, simply because of automation, but the issues we have now with capitalism will simply transfer to any socialist structure.",Adroite,2019-11-17 05:40:40,2019-11-17 05:40:51,/r/Feminism/comments/dxa16d/be_the_ceo_your_parents_always_wanted_you_to_marry/f7qt7wl/,t1_f7qbho1,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-17 05:40:51,0.00075,0.0,2e-05,0.00028,0.00022,1e-05,2e-05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The patriarchal influence in these countries is far far stronger than in ours. It is oppressive. You can't escape rape by just carrying a weapon and you cant get access to education through protests. Sometimes theres no other alternatives. And those mothers are no doubt desperate to protect their daughters from the abuse. Imagine knowing how bad it is, because you've experienced much violence in your life by then, and having this daughter you love more than anything, and knowing shell be subjected to the same horrors unless you can keep others from noticing that shes becoming a woman. That choice must be horrendous, but if it keeps their daughters safe for a bit longe.r, it might be worth it in their eyes 

As well, if it were me, I would no doubt do breast ironing if I had to. If two mounds of flesh stood between me and safety and education, you bet your ass I'd sacrifice them for that.

Your 2nd point I agree with. But it's an idea that's become so commonplace in mainstream feminism today: the patriarchy and gender norms oppress men too, they would benefit from dismantling them. I guess I'm mostly critical of it because of its instrumentalisation - many discussions now adopt some sort of ""both sides"" view of the patriarchy, where men and women suffer and would gain from its disappearance.

4693,13652,"Reading the comments down here makes me think a big part of this message was miscued, or it was just projected to the wrong audience.

I'm no Priyanka Chopra fan, but 'parents getting you married to a CEO' is still a thing in India, because a lot of marriages are still arranged. If someone holds any sort of good position in an organization, let alone lead one or draw good pay, parents of girls in India aspire to have their daughters married to him. Girls are told to 'study well' or they won't have the good picks in the marriage market, or contrarily, 'studies don't matter much', because the parents are influential enough to get them married off to a well-off lad who's studied in a university abroad. 

A lot of girls get this message time and again. (Although I feel this culture is slowly decreasing in India)

She isn't telling girls to 'be a CEO' like this sub seems to think she is. She's telling you to go be that person their parents wanted the girl to marry, CEO being a very prominent example in India. 

To tell them that they don't need to study or be this or be that for any man, regardless
 of whether he is a CEO or anyone really is an important thing, especially to girls growing up in India.

I love her perspective but I could honestly feel the “my old country is bad” message that just feeds 2nd wave feminist racists.  I wish she would have talked about what she loves about being Nigerian, and how being a Nigerian feminist is in America - not just how many times her family slut shammed her. 

Yes. Reminds me a lot of [Ayaan Hirsi Ali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali) feeding the islamophobia fire, or ~~TERFs~~ FARTs working with the alt-right to keep transwomen 
out of female designated washrooms.

&gt;I feel badly typing this out tbh. I just.. expected more from her? I guess? I know she has so much more to give, and she won’t. 

Something something something ""dying a hero or living long enough to become a villain""... I think a very real criticism of feminism (or the left generally tbh) is that we're perfectly able to understand that there is no perfect victim, but we're not able to accept that there is also no perfect hero. 

&gt;On the transphobia topic, lmfao my Women and Gender studies class tried that shit. “oh female is an EXPERIENCE and that experience is SHAME and OPPRESSION”. 1) trans women get it worse than cis women, especially trans WOC. 

Sure. But isn't it a different type of shame and oppression? I would argue that intersectionality obligates me to acknowledge that female-presenting transman very likely experienced the shame and oppression of being a woman **and** the shame and oppression of being trans... but that they are different experiences. 

&gt;2) is being a woman about the negatives of the patriarchy or is it about the celebration of an extremely amazing group of people?

Why not both? But I do love your positive take a lot more. 

&gt;However, forcing women to appeal to their oppressors is kinda fucked up. So all I ask is that she accept trans people and celebrate being a woman and Nigerian.

But she comes from a culture that is likely 40 years behind us in economic development. My mother, a staunch feminist, is struggling with a similar level of acceptance. She's trying, but she comes from a different era. It's hard for her to grasp the concept of non-binary gender. I'm not trying to make excuses, just maybe saying we can focus on her positive messages and tell her to shut it when she starts going off about how genitals define us.",6data,2019-11-16 17:18:41,2019-11-16 17:18:54,/r/Feminism/comments/dwvura/ive_just_attended_a_conference_at_the_university/f7obpwu/,t1_f7mko4o,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-16 17:18:54,0.3833,0.0016,0.06237,0.26673,0.0505,0.00191,0.01963,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And I honestly distinctly remember girls getting in trouble for bra straps to the extent of being sent up to the office or home.

Boys who allowed their pants to fall down and show their boxers however, were simply told to pull their pants up but we're otherwise allowed to continue their education. Despite the fact that we all know as soon as that adult leaves, the boy is just going to let his pants fall again, and more adults ignore it than say anything.

Why is a bra strap so offensive it requires discipline but boxers on full display gets you nothing more than a comment before you can go on your way?

Boys were also allowed to wear tank jersey shirts (that show pits and nipples, shoulders and hairy chests) and gym shorts that go well above their knees, but if a skirt went above a girls knees, she also got sent up/home for it.

**beauty_sick** If you want to compliment a woman, compliment her for who she is or what she does -- not what she looks like. There's no evidence that telling women they are beautiful makes them feel more beautiful. On the contrary, evidence out of our ""Body and Media Lab"" suggests that for many women, drawing attention to how they look reminds them of all the facets of their appearance they don't like. If telling women they are beautiful alleviated body image struggles, so many women wouldn't still be carrying around so much pain. If what you mean when you say ""You are beautiful!"" is that a woman is a beautiful human being, or that you admire her character -- tell her that instead.

Every time I've heard a mention of &gt;!FGM!&lt; since, it's taken me straight back to that mindset.

Not the unexpected deaths in the family, not my father suddenly disowning me 7 years ago, not the actual abusive relationship I was in, not being verbally harassed for my identity, not my eye splitting open after a surgery...nothing comes close to that powerless feeling of fear that my subconscious mind was so kind to simulate.

I totally think all kids not going to school should be recognized, but keeping girls in school is definitely a more common issue than with boys in many countries. 


There have already been efforts to help children of all genders. But if we only focus on all the kids as a whole and not the sub groups where there are specific issues, the problem can’t fully be solved. This is just an act to help a more marginalized sub group, and since there are other ways in which the US has put resources into helping all international children out of school, I think this act is still extremely important.  

Also, another major reason why girls drop out is because of forced marriage. In fact that’s probably the biggest reason. If girls are given opportunity and potential to succeed in school, they are much less likely to be forced into marriage by their parents.

4842,13864,"Real advice: try learning about how people approach people who have been taken in by cults. Also, try looking at resources for talking to people who have very partisan views that are different from yours. 

Don’t open with judgement (even when it is correctly held). Ask questions. Questions are disarming. People expect judgment and offense, and that just makes people defensive and dig in to their camp. Use the questions to disarm them and to get to the bottom of why they think about things the way they do. You need to be calm. It’s hard, but that is the only way it works. 

I know this is the internet where we can’t fathom that different experiences cause people to have different views (even bad ones) of the world, but that is reality. Find out why they feel the way they do. Share your experiences and why it makes you think the way you do. It may not have an immediate effect, but that is the only way   to break through. It may have no effect at all, but you are commendable for trying. 

Try to determine are they lacking knowledge or exposure? Are they actually lacking empathy? That’s pretty rare, but sometimes that is the problem.

If they can’t be respectful to you, don’t bother. If they engage in bad faith, call that out. You might be surprised; people really don’t expect to be confronted about their views, let alone in a disarming  manner.",fancyguesttowels,2019-11-03 22:35:00,2019-11-04 02:29:24,/r/Feminism/comments/dr5au8/how_to_convince_a_transphobic_feminist_that_trans/f6g0z76/,t3_dr5au8,Feminism,2,1,2019-11-04 02:29:24,0.00065,0.0,3e-05,8e-05,0.00018,2e-05,1e-05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

4866,13915,"Okay, I'm willing to try this again. I'll give some context for my views and maybe better explain my position. I've noticed that I sometimes have a hard time actually explaining myself to others. So, to start if I sound like I focus a lot on men's issues or point of view, it's because I do focus on men's issues from a feminist angle and I'm often here to learn other people, usually through lurking and reading.

But on the topic of your game idea, I actually liked it. It sorta sounded like Return to Mysterious Island, which I'm playing off and on now where you are stuck on an island and trying to survive, and I love it specifically because it focuses on non-violent solutions. What I considered gross was what I thought was ""Only women would make/play such games"", I don't usually play FPS games I actually play way more music, point and click adventure, puzzle, and other similar games more than most action games now. I saw that comment that anyone could play the game, but whenever I hear ""Women play certain games and men play other games"" it's usually from someone, usually a guy, who is weakly justifying the status quo of people's socialization. Every time I find something I like, an anime or hobby, and I see it's considered a man's or woman's hobby through adverts and how people talk about it, I can never make heads or tails of why it's considered masculine or feminine. Anyone who explains to me will give me answers that feel more like, as I've said before, biological determinism such as, ""Women like romance more than men"". I can only speak for myself, but that does not feel like a good enough answer.

I feel like, if we were to abolish gender, it would be less of making it ""banned"" and more being more supportive of those who were traditionally pushed out. If you are a manly man, there is nothing wrong with that. There is something wrong with that if you are making yourself depressed because you can't live up to the masculine ideal. There is also something wrong with that if you are trying to put others down because they aren't living up to that ideal either. I also don't see how making society more friendly to other types of people is going to make them blobs. I think people are going to naturally pick how they will express themselves and there is nothing stopping people from being super feminine or masculine. But in our current culture, social pressure is stopping people from expressing themselves. It's also a big reason why I got a little upset at this idea of ""conservatism is okay"", I don't agree with this idea at all. I think there is nothing of real value of the status quo because a lot of the status quo hurts too many people.

And I won't deny that there are biological differences between men and women but I feel that non-zero difference should not really matter in the majority of situations and especially when the bulk of the non-zero difference, in my opinion, is socialization; boys don't cry, boys like things but girls like people, etc.",VastScene,2019-11-03 19:51:33,2019-11-03 22:54:48,/r/Feminism/comments/dqw3f9/i_made_this_piece_about_censorship_of_art_and/f6f4wxv/,t1_f6epgak,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-03 22:54:48,0.00369,3e-05,0.00027,0.00278,0.00086,9e-05,0.00129,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The way gap refers to the fact women as a group earn less than men - this can be down to various factors including women being less likely to get a raise, devaluation of wens jobs, impact of parenthood on career, type of work women go into, and opportunities in education or employment. There are also wage gaps when it comes to race and disability.

I can agree that men and women are more alike than we are different. We’re still a nonzero amount of different. It really seems like you’re refusing to acknowledge the base realities of that. 

Clearly, you feel invalidated by something I’ve said. I feel extremely invalidated by the things you’ve said. I’d like to be able to communicate better with you, but as far as I currently understand, we just disagree. 

Gender shouldn’t be mandatory. It also shouldn’t be banned. There’s a reason that it cropped up so universally as a cultural marker. It’s useful social information. People want to know if they’re sexually interested in others or not, and if those others might be interested in them. For most of us, that’s at least partly dependent on gender. If that’s not true of you, bully for you. But you’re not going to get rid of people’s innate need to classify others. 

It would be like saying, “if we ban race, we can solve racism.” That’s just not going to happen. People aren’t going to forget where they came from. People aren’t going to abandon their traditions. And people don’t have to all conglomerate into a single Uber-Culture to be treated as equals. 

Race is just as much of a social construct as gender, and it’s had just as much influence on situations that subjugate people. And yet, even with all other factors being equal, we as humans are compelled to place ourselves in these identifying groups and talk about what they mean to us.

Many trans women have breasts that are ""real"" because hormones are sufficient for a lot of trans women to have breasts they're happy with and not all trans women have access to or want top surgery.

The comments on your last post were largely positive but the critiques that painting two hypersexualized women who are attractive by heteropatriarchal, caucasian beauty ideals in an intimate moment for an outside observer aren't invalidated by your mother's immigration status or your physical and mental health. 

Yes, you're a woman, but even women can propagate the male gaze and while that is challenged perhaps by your own queer identity, being bisexual in itself is not an absolution. It's not immediately obvious to a viewer and coupled with the passivity of the women in the painting still leans more on objectification than subversion. Perhaps giving the women a gaze of their own either to one another or towards the viewer might challenge that more, but as it stands, the painting's an erotic nude study that happens to involve two women, not so much a statement on any sort of active feminine sexuality or power. 

There could be some sort of perspective to explore regarding body dysmorphia and beauty myth as an artist recovering from an eating disorder insofar as idealized feminine forms go, it just doesn't feel like that's something you've spoken to

And while it's easy to understand where the O'Keefe reference is intended to fall, it kind of misses the mark. What's subversive about O'Keefe painting flowers as genitals isn't that she painted realistic flowers, but that she painted flowers that were evocative of genitals. With the flower you painted over the reclining woman's genitals, it doesn't evoke a vagina, nor does it really evoke obvious censorship (as say a more obviously cartoonish flower might have), it reads more like avoiding painting a body part like drawing books instead of hands.

That said. While I don't think the piece is really a strong feminity or challenge to censorship, it's a nice piece. I think it's a lovely figure study that's technically very good. It has a languid sort of sensuality and as a lesbian, I like it.

I’ve had this piece taken off of tumblr or other nude art reported on social media, but I know different platforms have different rules and ways of viewing art. Censoring art is like censoring books, it just shouldn’t really happen regardless of subject matter. Fahrenheit 451 does a fantastic job explaining that when creativity and free thought are censored history and morality can be manipulated or done away with. 

What I was trying to explain is that all censorship is bad, especially pinpointing differences or disabilities. It’s also wrong to assume a woman or artwork depicting a woman has no substance or depth because her body or face is “conventionally attractive”. Ugly and pretty are subjective, and no woman is better or worse than another for her outsides. 
As someone who is differently abled it made me feel that my disabilities aren’t real to others unless you can see them. It made me feel like visible disabilities are ugly to some and not valid to others and I couldn’t quite process that.

I saw some people talking about how this is sexist because it's also two white women (although I thought it was obvious the woman on the left isn't white), and it doesn't say anything about trans/intersex or disabled women. Does every individual feminist painting have to cover every single basis? Does it not do each of these subjects true justice to give them each their *own* piece, instead of colliding them clumsily together so no one subject shines through truly?

I have a great many burdens that I bear, both psychological and physical, and I deeply connect with this piece and your message behind it.

I for one absolutely adore the unbridled femininity and beauty displayed here. It makes me feel that feminine beauty isn't for anyone else - being feminine and enjoying your body no matter what it looks like is something everyone should feel empowered to do. I love that the two figures seem to be looking down at the lotus flower, as if the horned figure is gently encouraging and comforting the other. The flower itself is interesting, too, seemingly censoring the piece even as the figures' breasts are fully exposed and almost exaggerated. I see it as almost a statement on what can and cannot be shown. I also greatly appreciate your words about the identity of this woman - that in your mind she could be trans is such a beautiful idea.

Anyway, I sincerely hope you keep up this incredible work and that you continue to fight so avidly and bravely for your own artistic voice. As others have asked, I would absolutely love to buy a print of this piece, or see other work of yours. If you wanted to send me to your portfolio or somewhere to help support you, I would be honored and thrilled.

I actually don’t work besides my art because of my chronic illnesses caused by my autoimmune condition ravaging my body, so I cant really afford prints. 
Kinda embarrassing to admit I can’t afford to make prints because I don’t sell many paintings. I’m trying to see if I can get two or three made and work my way up from there. It’s just hard because people don’t wanna buy originals for what they are worth and any money I do make gets dumped back into art supplies. 

I make my work really textured because my Steven’s-Johnson’s-Syndrome destroyed my sense of smell, a lot of my hearing, and my last reaction went straight for my vision. I saw Bob Ross paint in black and white for a colorblind viewer and fell in love with the idea of making art for the sensory disabled. 
I wanted to get canvas prints made so that I can hand embellish texture back onto the pieces. A lot of my paintings are very layered and textured so even the blind or colorblind can literally FEEL them. I want people to touch my work.

She fixated on how the women were looking at one another. In her eyes it seems that they are gazing suggestively down at their bodies. I told her she really can’t say where they are looking because their eyes could be closed. It is awesome to me that she wanted to be offended, so she saw the eyes as open. I don’t know how you perceived this piece, but your mind said closed. It’s all a matter of perspective. My mother’s world view is that two women naked is gay and offensive regardless of subject matter. Other people found it offensive or beautiful for other reasons. 

I just love art and being an artist. It makes me happy to know so much can be felt and expanded upon just from my image.

4948,14033,"Nymphs are mythological creatures that assume the form of young attractive women. They are strikingly beautiful minor goddesses of the forest. They are immortal although minor gods, and summoned to the assemblies of gods on Mount Olympus. They are known to have a naturally soft or loving nature, they embody Mother Nature and the spirit of the earth. 
Nymphs have been consorts to mortals and immortals, and even taken mortals for lovers or life long companions. Nymphs are gentle and passive, although there are cases of them taking what they want or becoming vengeful. 
I am bisexual so I may have made them alluring because I find sexually liberated women beautiful and powerful. 

I affectionately refer to them as my girls, but they have existed in our stories and forests long before I ever did. I don’t really like that you simplified them to be vapid empty husks because of their bodies. I understand, but it hurts because they are my girls. One has her legs spread wide but looks a little bashful, not meeting the gaze of the viewer or her companion. The other is looking cautiously down, delicately holding her leg open while gazing curiously at womanhood and life unfolding before her. 

I also like the idea of nymphs being so mesmerizing that men are literally frozen or startled by their beauty upon encountering them. I have been stopped by the sheer beauty of my fellow women. Feminine beauty is nothing to be ashamed of. Some women find power in their sexuality and having control over others. 

My PTSD is from molestation at age 8, rape as a teen, a house fire, and two long term relationships rife with physical and mental abuse. I am only now embracing my feminine power and sexuality as an adult. To me femininity and brazenly sexual women are inspiring and amazing. I was forced to shut up, stay quiet, and suffer for men my whole life. I never had an orgasm from sex until 24 because I just shut up and let men control my body. I worried I was asexual until having my first lesbian experience, and then finding love after abuse. I let men poke, prod, and use my body with no enjoyment because that is what was expected of me. A woman using her body to control men is powerful in my eyes because my body was controlled by men. 

I would also like to draw attention to the nymphs being “white”. They are nymphs so I don’t really think they have a race, which is why I tried to make them diverse in my own way. To give representation to the real world without giving them too human like qualities. They are two different colors, the navy and blues being darker on the left. I made the left nymph have more pronounced and strong features, while the right has a more dainty face. Look at their noses and mouths as well as their cheek bones and facial structure in comparison. I also made their hair quite different. On the left you can see that the strands are thicker and much darker, which is meant to resemble braids or thin dreads. On the right her hair is finer and feathery, not weighed down by braids or texture. It could be the dapples of color on their faces that gives them the illusion of having freckles, but I was going for soft fawn spotting. 

Thank you for stimulating my brain &amp; encouraging me to think about my work and the message I am trying to get across.

4949,14034,"I don't know if you want other examples, but I have a few experiences:

When I was about 16, I asked my grandma to bring me a box of pads from the store because I was wearing my last one and she was about to go get groceries. She told me my grandpa was actually going, and apologized and offered to pick me up a box tomorrow. I was confused and just went to ask him to buy me a box. He threw a tantrum! He was like ""I'm not buying that gross shit for you because I'm the man of this house and it's not my fucking business!"" Then he ranted to my grandma about it for like 15 fuckin minutes before storming out of the house to go get groceries, obviously he didn't buy me pads and I bled on my sheets that night. 

When I was 13, I went to a friend's birthday sleepover on my period. Her older brother saw a tampon that had fallen out of my backpack and grabbed it and asked us ""which one of you is slut???"" In this big over the top way. I didn't claim the tampon and he spent like 10 minutes grilling us before her mom finally called us for pizza.

I've had boyfriends refuse to touch/look at period products, I've been shamed for talking about my period, or asking about it. I've had countless men/boys ask me ""are you on your period"" when I'm upset as if it minimizes or invalidates my feelings. 

Some people didn't experience this, some didn't care, but a lot of us do experience this. I can almost guarantee at least one of the women in your life had an experience like this, they may not look at it in the same way though.

The first time I used it was with my brother, who crossed a line when he was joking around with me and a couple friends. He legitimately didn't know that he had, and when I finally said ""you're making me uncomfortable,"" he immediately stopped, startled, and said ""oh, am I? I'm sorry,"" then later commented that he hopes that I've never been uncomfortable around him before, thinking hard on what he had said.

4983,14084,"Policies based on the notion that undergoing an abortion causes or increases women's risk of suicide attempts are misinformed, according to the results of a 17-year-long observational study including more than half a million 18 to 36-year-old Danish women who had a first, first-trimester abortion, published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal. The study is the first to compare the risk of women attempting suicide before and after an abortion.

Although women in the study who had abortions had a higher risk of first-time non-fatal suicide attempts, a closer look at the data suggests this cannot be attributed to the abortion itself. Instead, pre-existing mental health problems (which were more common in women having abortions than in women not having abortions) were associated with the increased risk of attempted suicide.

""The view that having an abortion leads to suicidal thoughts, plans, or even suicide attempts has been used to inform abortion policies in some regions of the world, particularly laws requiring women seeking the procedure be informed of this view,"" says lead author Dr Julia R. Steinberg from the University of Maryland, College Park, USA. ""The evidence from our study does not support this notion."" [1]

Previous research on abortion and suicidal ideation has not considered prior mental health, has had low participation and high attrition rates, or has relied on self-reporting of abortion (and suicidal ideation). The new study is the first to address these limitations. It is also the first to examine rates and relative risk of first non-fatal suicide attempts in the year before an abortion, as well as the year after, and as more time from the abortion increases, allowing researchers to unpick whether abortions are a contributing factor.

The authors examined data from 523,380 Danish women aged 18 to 36 years. They compared the risk of non-fatal suicide attempts associated with a first abortion relative to having no abortion between January 2000 and December 2016, and examined whether the risk of suicide attempts changed before and after the abortion. In their fully adjusted model, they adjusted for age, calendar year, women's history of childbirth, mental health, and physical health, their parents' mental health, and their parents' socioeconomic status.

The authors only considered data related to non-fatal suicide attempts and first first-trimester abortions, not multiple abortions nor abortions beyond the first trimester. They excluded women under 18 because consent from parents or legal guardians is required for an abortion before this age.

Of the women included in the study, 9% (48,990/523,380 women) had at least one first-trimester abortion. In addition, overall in the group, 2% (10,216/523,380 women) had a suicide attempt during the seventeen-year study period.

For the women who had an abortion, there were similar unadjusted rates of suicide attempts in the year before and after the abortion - 8.9 attempts in every 1,000 women in the year before an abortion, and 8.6 attempts in every 1,000 women in the year after the abortion.

Over time, the unadjusted rate of suicide attempts decreased to 4.6 attempts in every 1,000 women per year between one to five years after an abortion, and to 2.2 in every 1,000 women per year after five or more years - similar to the rate of 2 per 1,000 women per year for women who did not have an abortion during the study period.

""Five years after an abortion, the unadjusted rate of first-time suicide attempts reduces to the same rate as in women who have not had an abortion, countering the notion of 'post-abortion syndrome', in which it is hypothesised that the effects are not experienced until a long time afterwards,"" says Dr Steinberg. [1]

This pattern of similar increased incidence rate of suicide attempt in the year before and after an abortion, compared with women who had no abortion, persisted but the association was attenuated after adjusting for age, calendar year, women's history of childbirth, mental health, and physical health, their parents' mental health, and their parents' socioeconomic status. The risk decreased as more time from the abortion increased. This indicates that the abortion could not be causing or increasing women's risk of suicide attempts.

The strongest risk factors for attempting suicide were having previous contact with a psychiatric service, previous use of antidepressant medication, previous use of antianxiety medication and previous use of antipsychotic medication.

""Our findings suggest that when a woman is seeking advice and care surrounding an abortion, it could be appropriate to screen for mental health issues in order to pick up on pre-existing problems and to prevent future ones occurring,"" says Dr Trine Munk-Olsen from Aarhus University, Denmark. [1]

The authors note that in Denmark abortions can be accessed legally, and so it is not clear whether the results generalise to other contexts, particularly where access to abortion is legally restricted. They also note that not all women with mental health problems may seek help, therefore, the effect of previous mental health problems may be underestimated.

Writing in a linked Comment, Dr Jenneke van Ditzhuijzen from the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands, says: ""The increased risk of non-fatal suicide attempts in women who have had an abortion might be related to other co-occurring risk factors around the time of the unwanted pregnancy and abortion, such as intimate partner violence, unstable relationships, or other negative life events, for which Steinberg and colleagues could not adjust.""

She continues: ""This does not mean that having an abortion is an indication that women are going through a difficult time, or that the symptoms of mental disorders are attributable to the abortion, but rather that some women are at an elevated risk of multiple adversities at a certain period in their life, which could include an unwanted pregnancy and abortion.""",Yeahmaybeitsdetritus,2019-11-21 17:10:19,2019-11-21 17:10:30,/r/Feminism/comments/dzmdeo/abortion_does_not_increase_a_womans_risk_of/f88khb4/,t3_dzmdeo,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-21 17:10:30,0.00982,0.00044,0.00113,0.00249,0.00242,0.00234,0.00274,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

5017,14152,"Abstract
Introduction: The relationship between masturbation activities and their effect on partnered sex is understudied.

Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the alignment of activities between masturbation and partnered sex, and to determine whether different levels of alignment affect orgasmic parameters during partnered sex.

Methods: 2,215 women completed an online survey about activities during masturbation and reasons for orgasmic difficulty during masturbation, and these were compared with activities and reasons for orgasmic difficulty during partnered sex.

Main Outcome Measure: Degree of alignment between masturbation activities and partnered sex activities was used to predict sexual arousal difficulty, orgasmic probability, orgasmic pleasure, orgasmic latency, and orgasmic difficulty during partnered sex.

Results: Women showed only moderate alignment regarding masturbation and partnered sex activities, as well as reasons for masturbation orgasmic difficulty and reasons for partnered sex orgasmic difficulty. However, those that showed greater alignment of activities showed better orgasmic response during partnered sex and were more likely to prefer partnered sex over masturbation.

Clinical Implications: Women tend to use less conventional techniques for arousal during masturbation compared with partnered sex. Increasing alignment between masturbation and partnered sexual activities may lead to better arousal and orgasmic response, and lower orgasmic difficulty.

Strength &amp; Limitations: The study was well-powered and drew from a multinational population, providing perspective on a long-standing unanswered question. Major limitations were the younger age and self-selection of the sample.

Conclusion: Women that align masturbation stimulation activities with partnered sex activities are more likely to experience orgasm and enhanced orgasmic pleasure, with sexual relationship satisfaction playing an important role in this process.

5033,14170,"&gt;This strikes me as saying ""someone else has it worse so you should not talk about your problems at all"".

If you only deliberately distort it, I can do nothing. What I'm trying to say here is that sexual women, regardless of their status as vanilla or kinky, get dehumanised and marginalised. This oppressive dynamic becomes further intensified if these women also happen to be disabled, trans, Dalit, intersex, indigenous, etc.. Heteropatriarchal state, law enforcement, and males don't actually shame women but outright dehumanise them in a violent manner. Shaming is just a form of secondary side effect resulting from that dehumanised atmosphere. So, why do you want to ignore this primary ""dehumanizing part""?   And again, feminists have long been criticising and making fun of these heteropatriarchal marriage, vanilla sexual practices, romance. When vanilla males commit violence against women, feminists criticize them without walking on eggshells. Complicit vanilla women also get to receive criticism for their internalized misogyny against their fellow sisters. So, why on Earth kinky males should be getting a free pass? Why do you think that any criticism of violent kink males is an expression of ""kink shaming "" ? Also, your claim that kinky women don't get slut shamed is very troubling. Each and every women get slut shamed. So, what's your actual ultimate goal, I wonder? This rhetorical and regressive decrying of ""kink shaming "" actually won't do anything to solve anything. 


&gt;There is a difference between saying this that shame someone for engaging in kinky sex (ex It's disgusting to be kinky, it's crazy, it's horrible.) and talking about it. My initial message was literally talking about violence in kink against women

So, how about these: 

I hate marriage , you are such a vanilla, marriage and romance is disgusting, romantic love is an irrational thing for fools,  ewww, you are such a vanilla, marriage and romance are heteropatriarchal social construction, vanilla is for prudes ....

Does this sound familiar.  Vanilla women still don't decry any kinds of shaming, right? Most importantly, vanilla women don't get out of their way to defend vanilla males when feminists criticize their misogyny. But, a minority of kinky women (not all kinky women. Majority actually) dominate online discussions and just manage to do that. And you have no right to deny that fact. 


&gt;You don't, just don't insult women who are into BDSM when you do it.

And when did I insult you for your BDSM practices. Rather I was yelling that women should be free to love/hate BDSM without any fatal consequences. I have explicitly stated multiple times that no women should be blamed for males' vile actions, regardless of these women's relationships with BDSM.",MistWeaver80,2019-11-22 12:26:17,2019-11-22 12:26:18,/r/Feminism/comments/dzo4w0/6bdsm_is_now_a_strategic_defense_for_men_in_the/f8b3i3d/,t1_f8b0a8l,Feminism,1,1,2019-11-22 12:26:18,0.64551,0.00286,0.05842,0.1945,0.23792,0.00202,0.32061,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Show how much environmental and cultural factors can play into an iq score, which leads into a bigger question:

How does one determine “intelligence”? What does it mean to be intelligent? To know a lot of things? To be good at memorization? To be a good problem solver? To be good at reading? To be good at multi-tasking? A mixture of these things? Who decides to put what importance on each aspect? Why? For example, I don’t believe emotional intelligence and interpersonal communication is usually factored into IQ, but who’s to say that isn’t just as valid a form of knowledge? And if these are the components that make up the concept of “intelligence,” you have to concede that a lot of it isn’t inherent, but through education and environmental exposure. 

To reiterate, IQ not completely useless—for example, if someone scores a 50 on an IQ test, they probably have a cognitive disability, and knowing that could mean a better way of educating/interacting with them to give them the most from life.

5038,14175,"&gt; If you want to downplay this by levelling it mythical ""kink shaming "", then I can do nothing. 

It's only downplaying it to you because that's how you see it.

&gt;May be you are not aware but vanilla women still get stigmatised and every aspect of sexual openness such as sex education, polyamory, relationship anarchy, promiscuity are still heavily stigmatized. 

I am quite aware that vanilla sexuality is still stigmatized, however, this discussion is not about vanilla sexuality.

By the way, I am acutely aware of how polyamory is received, and about how a lot of people assume it's a kink or a fetish. My girlfriend's mother has argued against it many times since we came out as poly. I am also well aware that I am in a privileged position to be able to come out as poly at all.

&gt;In parts of this very planet, a woman can still get shunned for daring to commit love marriage and referring to her sexual partner by name. 

I know. This is horrifying and should definitely be talked about but I don't see why that means I can't also talk about the problems of kink-shaming and the personal effect it has had on my life as well. This strikes me as saying ""someone else has it worse so you should not talk about your problems at all"".

&gt;Women who have sex with women and women who are trans and intersex are still violently dehumanised if they dare to have any types of sex -- be it vanilla or kinks. 

Thank you, as a trans woman who currently has a girlfriend I needed to be informed of this, it's not like I have to worry about this any time a relative suggests international travel or anything. (Sorry for the sarcasm but your assumption of my ignorance on these topics is really grating).

&gt;I have never seen any woman using ridiculous ""vanilla shaming"" tag. 

Most use the tag slut-shaming for this, not sure how that's different. The reason ""vanilla shaming"" isn't used is because they are shamed for openness about sexuality, not for being vanilla.

&gt;My question to you is why you want to downplay gendered sexual oppression that are being perpetuated against women by male soceity?

I don't. I want it talked about openly. Kink shaming as well as slut shaming (as well as a lot of other forms of shaming) all prevent this from happening.

&gt;Vanilla women don't become irritated when we talk about vanilla men's violence against women. Then, why in the name of 9 planets, you kink women keep behaving like that when we talk about kink men's violence against kink women ? 

There is a difference between saying this that shame someone for engaging in kinky sex (ex It's disgusting to be kinky, it's crazy, it's horrible.) and talking about it. My initial message was literally talking about violence in kink against women. I think we should talk about it more, and I think we should talk about it without insulting women who chose to do kink.

&gt;Why I have to walk on eggshells if I want to criticise misogynistic kink males? I don't have to do this when I criticise vanilla males. I don't have to face any form of attack from my fellow sisters if I want to criticise marriage and romance. So, what's so special about violent kink males that I have to walk on eggshells around them ?

5058,14197,"&gt;Rape culture, rape myth, state-sanctioned misogyny and rape cheerleading is responsible for that. Not mythical kink shaming culture. Rape victims are ashamed and oppressed by a trifecta system of heteropatriarchy-- state, law and culture. Your case is not an unique situation due to your sexual practices. Women and girls who get raped by their husbands, boyfriends, fathers, brothers, priests, teachers, police, politicians etc. experience that same oppression. In other words, oppression of rape victims is a universal fact. 

My case is not unique, but it does carry the element of BDSM and the kink-shaming that comes with it. I am not saying that that element is the only element that should be focused on but it should not be ignored. It is part of the issue of culture that you mentioned.

Having said that, here is what I think your statement should be corrected to ""Rape culture, rape myth, state-sanctioned misogyny, rape cheerleading, **and kink-shaming culture** is responsible for that.""

&gt;And you don't actually know if a lot of these murderd women were actually into BDSM. They are not alive to confirm that fact. Misogynists killed them and then victim blamed and dehumanised their dead bodies. 

That is entirely fair. I am sorry for saying a lot, I should have said some. I think it's fair to claim that some of them were, unless you are suggesting that a man has never killed a woman who consented to BDSM with him.

&gt;And if indeed mythical ""kink shaming "" is responsible for these murders and your rape, then why on Earth males are not being murdered by women at the same rate? Why there are no women on women incidents? And why on Earth these incidents are a recent phenomenon ? People have been practicing BDSM for eons....and there are plenty of men who are sexual submissive and enjoy genital torture play and they are still not getting killed by their dominatrix.

I did not say kink-shaming was responsible for all those murders, I intended to convey that had society been more accepting of kink some of them may have been prevented. Social forces work in combination, a lot of factors besides kink-shaming were involved, I am just saying that it was involved and it is a problem.

&gt;Dead wrong. There's nothing wrong with hating a sexual practic just as there's nothing wrong with loving it. You don't get to enjoy special treatment for your choice. Sorry. Right to hate a sexual practice is also a part of body autonomy.

Not wanting something done to oneself or refusing to participate in something is an issue of body autonomy. The 'right' to shame someone else for doing so is not, it is a violation of their body autonomy.

&gt;No one is ""kink shaming "" anyone on this comment thread and you still don't know about those dead women's preference. So, stop assuming. 

I am sorry I said a lot last time, but I believe that saying some of them were is fully valid. The only alternative is to assume that no man has killed a woman who consented to BDSM with him.

&gt;One person state their personal hatred regarding BDSM and they didn't say anything about kinks and fetishes and as a result, being downvoted to oblivion by heteropatriarchal boot lickers. 

It was a lot more than one person, though admittedly most of the posts are deleted at this point. What would you call someone saying ""stupid enough to allow someone to abuse \[them\] and physically harm \[them\]"" as though that's a realistic representation of consensual BDSM?

Also can you please stop calling anyone who disagrees with you a  bootlicker or a handmaiden? I am not always right, but you are not either. Someone can disagree with you in good faith without being a devil's advocate.

&gt;Rape culture, rape myth, state-sanctioned misogyny and rape cheerleading is responsible for that. Not mythical kink shaming culture. 

You are fairly close, let me fix that to what it should be: Rape culture, rape myth, state-sanctioned misogyny, rape cheerleading, *and* kink-shaming culture were responsible for what happened. My case is not unique, but it does have an element of kink and the shame our society places on it (part of the culture element) which played a role and should not be ignored.

&gt;And you don't actually know if a lot of these murderd women were actually into BDSM.

True but I said some, not all and not a lot. To assume that none were would mean assuming that no women who consented to BDSM with a partner got killed by that partner, an assumption I consider absurd.

&gt;And if indeed mythical ""kink shaming "" is responsible for these murders and your rape, then why on Earth males are not being murdered by women at the same rate?  

I did not mean to claim it was the single cause, nor that it was responsible for all of such attacks, rather that it was part of the system of oppression. I am sorry if what I said came off as implying that it was the one single cause. Women are kink shamed more and have our sexuality policed more than men in our society, and that contributes to the issue. Social forces work in combination.

&gt;Dead wrong. There's nothing wrong with hating a sexual practic just as there's nothing wrong with loving it. You don't get to enjoy special treatment for your choice. Sorry. Right to hate a sexual practice is also a part of body autonomy.

The right to hate and refuse something being done to oneself or hating or refusing to participate in something oneself is a part of body autonomy. Shaming others for what they do with their own bodies is not, it is infringing on other people's body autonomy.

&gt;No one is ""kink shaming "" anyone on this comment thread and you still don't know about those dead women's preference. So, stop assuming.  

I did not say it was many but, unless you are claiming that men **never** kill women who are consenting to BDSM with them, some of the women on that list were likely consenting to some BDSM.

Workplaces, in my opinion are allowed to have standards. They can't say you can't have traditionally black hairstyles like braids or cornrows or afro, but those styles should be able to be well kept in order to abide by whatever workplace rules exist. Like for men if you've got long hair, usually the standard is to cut it - it doesn't matter if you've got dreadlocks or braids or straight greasy neckbeard hair - that's the rules. For black women idc what your hair looks like as long as you're clearly taking care of it. Not stinking up the office space as a general rule for everyone - good hygiene is important, however that looks for you.

The CA law seems to state that even if you don't give a shit about your hair you can get a job which is kinda dumb.

5093,14306,"And you're someone who probably doesn't acknowledge the actual changes being made bc you're too caught up in the history of the church. Yeah it WAS fucked - not so much anymore. Sure theere's still assholes who practice the fucked up and outdated stuff but you find that everywhere and it is I L L E G A L in the USA. The only people that want the illegal shit are people who belong in jail. And the general church in the United States today finds all of those things illegal and works diligently to eradicate illegal acts within it itself. Yes I will talk about those things- they're0 illegal and the church in the US finds them reprehensible; you know how I know they are disgusted? Look at all the articles published by CHRISTIAN news sites reportig on them. Above any ""religious justification"" for marrying a child or abusing women/POC/LGBTQ, there are laws in our country that say that it's illegal and if those people get caught, they will stand trial for their shitty pedophilic and abusive behavior.

Sexual minorities while they're fighting they're damndest do have a hard time and that's the only deficit the church has but it's not usually the fault of the US. That might be the only place I'm willing to concede.  Just recently the methodist church voted whether to be inclusive of LGBT people; it was a literal 50.1% to 50.9% (give or take  %) not in favor. The countries that opposed were not the US; if it was only a nationwide vote and not a worldwide vote, the US would've been inclusive. I'll agree with you when it comes to countries outside the US but I can't agree with you when it comes to the US. Due to the wonderful capitalism got here, a church that wont cater to women, lgbt, or minorities gathers dust while inclusive churches are packed with people - the numbers are clear. The majority of people want inclusive churches. The churches you talk about are dying out and good riddance.  The church is changimg and the only ones not changing with it are outdated rapists and misogynists that are going extinct and bitter people like you that can't acknowledge change.

5094,14307,"Yeah you are missing something here. Some hair structures can't just be pulled back into a pony tail and require protective styles like braids or locks in order for the hair not to get damaged.


Hair length and unnatural hair colours are personal fashion choices- in my opinion, employers shouldn't get to regulate them either apart from for safety and hygiene reasons. But having to wear your hair in a way that damages it and having to hide its natural structure to conform with some outdated idea of ""normalcy"" is in a whole other boat. It's also inherently racist because most people with that hair structure are black.

There's lots of really good hair care and tutorial videos on YouTube where people with kinky hair structures show their daily routine. As someone with completely smooth 1a hair, the amount of work that goes into keeping type 3 and type 4 hair structures healthy was eye-opening for me.

We wouldn't have gender expression, just personal expression. Would it really be that horrible if men and women can just live how they want without arbitrary expectations? Are people going to kill themselves because some men want to wear pink or some women want to be grease monkeys and society gives them the thumbs up because no one really cares? No.

&gt;  Gaming is a great example of this. Gendered marketing made it unfairly  geared toward boys, but a reduction in that sexist attitude doesn’t  abolish all gendered concepts in gaming. Women tend to enjoy different  types of games than men enjoy. Again, a tendency, not a universal thing. 

And basing marketing on this ""tendency"" is why gaming is still pushing out women and really anyone who isn't a typical guy. Are you really trying to imply that women don't enjoy action games I mean...

 

&gt;Women are really great at “found  object” puzzles, for example. I think a first-person RPG with strong  found object mechanics could be quite compelling. You’re trying to  navigate your family through nuclear winter, finding areas that are safe  vs not. Finding food that’s poisonous vs not. Raiding the abandoned  shells of houses for clothing and supplies. Finding where your children  have hidden from monsters before the monsters can find them. A 3D game  world and awesome graphics would only make this sort of thing even more  difficult and harrowing. And women who have only ever played the crappy  mobile-phone version of these games would feel seen.

Oh, I see, gross. You are stereotyping women and men's taste in gaming. You are basically trying to craft a game where women are put into their ""role"". Why would a nuclear fallout game with a non-violent premise be coded as feminine? Some men, myself included, can and do enjoy non-violent games and even prefer them. And there are women who love ultra violent games. You don't need a penis to play what I consider the most enjoyable action game, Bayonetta.
