We even go to the same college. We have only talked once, and she gave me a good response. 

It turns out she is close friends with one of my coworkers’ sisters. Apparently she thinks I’m “very very attractive” but doesn’t want to date a non Christian. Mind you, I was raised Catholic and believe in a god but not the fundamentalist Christian version. 

(She goes to Jesus camps and listens to Christian music so you know what I’m dealing with)

How should I approach this, or should I approach this at all? I dont want to fake or exaggerate my faith, but I’d love to date her.

Need some assist.

Ask qns where necessary. 

What’s up G’s I [M24] am in a bit of a bind and I would like some assistance.  5 yrs ago I traveled to study abroad and now ( atm ) I am back in my native land. Before I left my country I knew this girl, Yvonne, [F23] from church and while we were in communication, it always centered around church activities.

On 05/10/2019 I went to the church to look for her as the night before, I run into our mutual friend who mentioned that Yvonne would be glad to see me. Yea, I know! I should have swallowed more than one red pill but naaah I got too excited to reconnect with a female human who I haven’t seen/spoken to in years.  

I was in church and I noticed she was part of the choir and sung well if I may add. I left church after she was done singing plus I couldn’t handle the preaching (personal reasons).  I did not speak with her but I did see her. A positive confirmation that not only was she alive but in a good state of mind ( atm ).

Her image was burned in my mind but her unique single voice did not accompany it and so I was back in church on 12/10/2019. Long story short, we interacted, exchanged numbers and have been talking till today when she tried to insinuate that I have been lying to her about my adventures abroad.  She would ask for specific dates, months and location of the stories I narrated to her. Which actually came up as a result of her asking questions. Females!!

Whenever I would ask her a question she would refer to the bible and god which got extremely boring for me and I stopped asking about her life...yea, god. Some questions she would flat out refuse to answer and a “No” was enough on her part. The audacity she had to continue interrogating me after her “no” response was just unbelievable. It’s all good though, your boy got nothing to hide. 

From our conversations, she’s so open and wiling to share fables of the bible but whenever I want to share the works of Carl Jung regarding the unconscious mind ( or basically any works regarding the human condition), she would get into a fit, snarl and make undesirable noises. WTF!!

I went to the extent of showing her pics of the women I have been intimate with while traveling to( Mexican, Swede, Korean, American) their respective countries but that seemed to have ‘angered’ her. SMH

My logic dictates that I should cut off communication and be a passive participant in her life while my “ bloody feelings”  dictate that I should be patient with her as she has not taken full accountability of her life but instead chooses to place it to a “higher power”.  I understand religion is important but doesn’t it become like a story similar to Santa and fairies at some point !? 

I can not and will not be the one who leads her from her garden of Eden. It is until the unconscious mind becomes conscious, it will interpret everything happening around it as a manifestation of “fate”.

Your tone of voice suggests the tone of the interaction. It is the way you project your frame. 



In a recent post about [https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/degi09/lets_talk_pillow_talk/](pillow talk), the top comment pointed out the middle ground between saying nothing and telling your whole goddamn life story. This is important comfort building time. The tone of voice you naturally drop to after fucking is the tone you want to project when talking to any women.


As a mental tool, I've heard from Dante Nero to imagine you have already fucked a girl you're about to talk to. It creates a frame of intimacy, and I think by establishing this pillow talk tone with the way you speak, subconsciously you will trigger a woman's desire to be in that state of post-fuck euphoria. 


Try it out.

So you met someone really attractive who is looking for help paying the rent?  Buying groceries?  Car broke down and needs repair?  Credit card is almost maxed out and she needs new shoes?  These are the classic signs of a damsel in distress.

The cost of rescuing a damsel is nearly always very high.  It can drain you financially and the emotional vacuum can suck the moisture from your soul.  A damsel nearly always is in distress because some other schlub left her high and dry without the financial means to sustain herself.  She will tell you ad-infinitum about that schlub and detail his flaws like a horror story on Halloween.  Just think, she is staging you to become the next schlub.

There is a woman I know rather well who has played the damsel in distress game all her life.  She is now 55 years old, in the middle of divorce number four, and in the process seeking victim number five.  Her first husband ""rescued"" her from her parents who were suppressing her ability to be herself (lasted 11 years).  Her second husband rescued her from the local bar and in the process took a large chunk of the money she kept from the first marriage (lasted 9 years).  Her third husband rescued her from poverty by payinig her bills and keeping her in modest comfort (lasted 7 years).  Her fourth husband rescued her from loneliness and in the process learned that a chameleon narcissist is a very bad mother (he had 3 young children but it lasted 8 years anyway).

This woman was rather good looking when she was young.  She weighed 105 pounds, had long blond hair, sensuous lips, and she was careful to always look attractive.  Now she is 200 pounds with a bad back and the beauty she relied on no longer makes her the center of attention in a room full of men.

And she said in my class although the ""Great Man Theory"" had not been used during today, she is agreeing more to that theory because she had a experience at work that make the ""Great Person Theory"" not so ideal.

She had work for consultant firm before and the working department she is assigned in had entirely female staff and she said women likes to be praised over unimportant things because her boss loves to be praised everyday like if you love her shoe or handbag , if she doesn't praised her boss then her boss will give her extra work without warning

Just wanted to write something that happened to me while gaming in the past couple of weeks. 

I was invited to a small social circle and met this girl, who showed massive IOIs - following me around, laughed at all the shit I said. At the end of the first day meeting her, signs of hostility started coming from two of her beta male friends, let's call them A and B and digress a little bit. 

Beta A is very passive aggressive, he appears to have a crush on the girl. Beta B is an ""alpha"", often overly aggressive in shit testing (over and over again). B started calling me a piece of shit in front of everyone for no reason. 

Back to the end of first night of meeting her, B started calling me a piece of shit in front of everyone. I didn't know him so I treated it as friendly banter, even though his tone was a bit aggressive. I addressed to everyone in the group and said, ""I like this guy already, we're gonna be best friends!"" To be honest, at the time I thought he was pretty cool. We went to dinner, girl following me around even though we had to change seats a few times, ended up sitting next to me every time. We talked a lot, joking a lot, her attention was 90% on me. Beta A is sitting across from her, the first shit test from him after we cheered before we had our drinks. He said, ""You didn't give me eye contact when you said 'cheers'"". I naturally responded with agree and amplify, I leaned towards him with my hands on the edge of the table as I gave him my laser eye contact. I had not realize that it was him being aggressive at the time, there were 5 people who did cheered, I could have been giving someone else eye contact and just not him! All in all, first night was a success, treated all aggression as friendly banter. Girl was very responsive when I told her my goodbye, her whole body just turned in my directions after I said  as I walked away.

Second day of meeting her, her friends were absent and I met other friends of her, two girls and beta C. Beta C is a try-hard. Apparently he has a PhD, I'll give him that, but he is just one of the most feminine guys I know. I didn't feel like talking to anyone - too tired due to work. Girl and beta C were isolated on their way home, I was in the some bus. They knew I was there and I didn't react and ignored them while looking at my phone. I consider this as passing the girl's shit test.

Third day was when shit hits the fan.  Beta A and B was on me the whole time. They were picking out everything I did and let everyone know that I should have done otherwise! I ignored beta B's aggressive comments, such as ""I bet you are too chicken to piss in the trees"" when I said I needed to find a restroom, while agreed and amplified beta A's passive aggressiveness. Girl was in my frame until the end of the day (I'll get to it later) - we were doing running exercises, I was leading the pack, while beta A and B hanged back and talked to her. Girl ran ahead and caught up with me later, and slapped my shoulder and said ""Hey, don't run so fast!"" Kino from her!  We went to dinner as usual. This is when I started to feel that they were intentionally trying to piss me off. This is the first time I felt so much aggression from other guys and I lost frame. We were in an argument, beta A and B supported each other, girl started siding with them. Girl went with beta B when we parted ways. At this point maybe I shouldn't say B was a beta, since he got the girl. But I do believe that he's insanely insecure and I'll do better than him in the long run.

It was not until the next week that I realized the girl disrespected me by siding with them. I stopped rationalizing and just hard nexted her. Removed myself from their social group, burning bridges and experiencing fallout from their friends. But what can they do for me? Some of the guys were cool, but they were around with their loser friends (A and B), and that makes them loser by association. 

The next night I flirted with a young beautiful lady and got her number.

At the end of those two months, you'll have sunken eyes, and be more skinny fat than when you started.  

&amp;#x200B;

Confidence is developed because of actions, not because of words. A true belief in yourself is developed due to internal and external validations that occur again and again. There are one offs who, since birth, have had irrational confidence in themselves. More so, this irrational confidence really brings these people the ability to lift themselves up by their boot straps, and know that they will eventually prosper at the something they're after. These irrationally confident people still know of the hard road ahead of them. The only difference between them and your average Joe is that they have decided they will never give up. That they will get what they're after, no matter the cost.

 

Here is the shitty truth; in order to become confident about something, you must prove to yourself that you are great at that thing. However, if you want to become great at that thing, you must do it over and over again. And, if not the first day, before long, you will fail. No one likes failure. Many failures can hurt your ego and your self-esteem. Years and years or even months and months of this punishment can really put people in a bad way. And, here we reach the tipping point for most. They will begin rationalizing whether or not it is worth it, and decide whether or not they should abandon their goal. The comfortable will almost always abandon their goal because, why bother... they don't really need to do that, they have X, Y, and Z anyway?

&amp;#x200B;

This is why you will easily develop confidence in the things that you are most passionate about. But, if you're not naturally passionate about it, you must sell your soul in order to prosper and gain an unwavering confidence. Whatever it is must own you for a least a period of time. It must consume you and make your knuckles white. Or, you must box yourself in and force yourself to become passionate about it. You must remove the comfort, in order to create a desire.

&amp;#x200B;

However, there are some things you can do to make you more confident in starting something at all. At it's root, confidence is really a convergence of life experiences. Confidence for all those things you have sold your soul to, and the confidence developed from your passions, all begin to compound to create a smoother journey for those things you lack confidence in. In this way, your ego takes over, and helps you to power through situation you're less confident about. ""I can talk to her without being nervous, I am the guy who came from nothing, look what I made myself into."" Or, ""I can talk in front of all these people, I was able to overcome X, Y, and Z. What I went through was hard, and look at what I can do.""

&amp;#x200B;

However, what is still missing is the succession of the task, and succession over and over again. You must have a track record in the particular task in order to feel an unwavering confidence. Whatever it is you want to be confident about, you must practice it until you're blue in the face. You must understand that pain is a normal part of this journey, and so is failure. When you reach a state of confidence, nothing feels better, or makes you feel more alive.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,If you want to be confident you'll have to mount up and prepare to fail,0,1572045252.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dha6oz/if_you_want_to_be_confident_youll_have_to_mount/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Is he a pushover? Do you respect him?  

In chimps, smiling is a sign of submissiveness, it's asking for acceptance, for people to like you and accept you. It's not a dominant trait. [Some studies suggest that women find smiling men less attractive](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/smiling-men-less-attractive-to-women-study-1.1066058), others the opposite but you need to consider that there's 2 types of attraction: **that guy is friendly, he seems like someone I could talk to**; or **that guy is hot, I wanna bone him.** Don't be the harmless friendly guy, be the dominant male that gets what he wants, isn't afraid of confrontation (remember, smiling is avoiding confrontation and playing it safe).  

**MASTER THE SMIRK;** Look at the great suave and male sex symbols of old: Harrison Ford; Marlon Brando; Sean Connery. They don't smile a lot, they smirk when they have to. What impression do these people give you? Suave, chill, reliable, manly, and leader-like.   

Finally, I couldn't help but notice in my life that those who smile most are usually at the bottom of the social hierarchy, they are submissive, agreeable and conflict-adverse. Look at AMOGs, or strong charismatic leaders, they do not smile a lot. I also feel like I don't respect those who smile too much.

Most of these fighting posts have been absolute garbage and that needs to be addressed.

I'm an MMA fighter who has fought at the world level, been involved in combat sports for 10 years, with an athletic and TMA background before that, and too many street fights.

You need a lot of experience through sparring and fighting to be able to construct a workable system for the books and the internet to enhance. Without experience you're trying to learn how to swim by practicing on dry land. Helpful if you've swam before and you're trying to modify your system, worthless on its own.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAqEf7ZRmmI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAqEf7ZRmmI)

With that out of the way, I will teach you how to cheese fights. This means doing the best you can with no regard to your actual ability to fight. In order of importance:

1. Get fucking jacked and strong. Strong people are more dangerous and generally harder to kill than weak people.
2. Go first and go hard with violent intent. If you're going to fight someone, go first, go balls to the wall, and try to fuck them up as much as possible as quickly as possible. Surprise and aggression have taken out many skilled fighters before they could ever put their training to work. We want blood red hazy vision mind numbing aggression.
3. Do 400m sprint repeats. The more you can put into an all out effort in about a minute to a minute and a half of sustained violence, the more dangerous you are.

Alright, as an addendum let's go over the fastest way to build a base for violence. No substitute for real training, but it's the best you've got in a pinch.

Ideally you get into lots of street fights and learn in the fire. This is also retarded and will get you killed or arrested. So the next best thing is one minute of nonstop punching with a similarly sized friend.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR2ZARY6SoE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR2ZARY6SoE)  
This will teach you more about violence than 100 youtube videos and 10 years of jacking off your karate sensei. You will learn how to fight back while getting seriously hurt, will build a workable system for violent situations, and will reinforce violent intent/aggression. Plus it's a lot of fucking fun.

Another addendum, for fun. Miyamoto Musashi the legendary samurai, known for winning over fifty solo duels to the death, advocated brutality. In his first duel to the death at the age of thirteen he fought a competent swordsman. Musashi's strategy and weapon of choice? He grabbed a heavy staff vs his opponent's sword, rushed him, and violently beat him to death with it.

The excerpt from wikipedia for those who find violence entertaining.

"" In 1596, Musashi was 13, and Arima Kihei, who was traveling to hone his art, posted a public challenge in Hirafuku-mura. Musashi wrote his name on the challenge. A messenger came to Dorin's temple, where Musashi was staying, to inform Musashi that his duel had been accepted by Kihei. Dorin, Musashi's uncle, was shocked by this, and tried to beg off the duel in Musashi's name, based on his nephew's age. Kihei was adamant that the only way his honour could be cleared was if Musashi apologized to him when the duel was scheduled. So when the time set for the duel arrived, Dorin began apologizing for Musashi, who merely charged at Kihei with a [six-foot quarterstaff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C5%8D), shouting a challenge to Kihei. Kihei attacked with a [wakizashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakizashi), but Musashi [threw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throw_(grappling)) Kihei on the floor, and while Kihei tried to get up, Musashi struck Arima between the eyes and then beat him to death. Arima was said to have been arrogant, overly eager to battle, and not a terribly talented swordsman. ""

I implore everyone here to go and watch the Joker at least once. Ignore the usual left pandering bullshit like inter-racial coupling, rich white douchebags, etc..

The movie is about a boy raised by a violent, and sadistic single mother.. as a consequence of this upbringing, and lack of a fatherly figure, he becomes one of the greatest villains of all time, Joker.

The Joker single mum, sleeps with bad boys, &amp; often violent men. She allowed the man she was fucking to beat the living shit out of the young Joker and tie him to a radiator.

Because of this incident, the Joker had brain damage and suffers from serious mental illness, delusions of granduer and narcissism. You see.. if the Joker had at least a fatherly figure to put him in his place and show him right from wrong and that he should throttle his limits, he may not have become the cunningly smart, psychopathic murdering maniac, that is the Joker.. This movie lays the blame solely on single mothers. 

And that is the main message and why the blue pillers are losing their heads over this movie. Citing that it will inspire mass shootings.. no, as the liberals would like you to believe... it won't. 

it's because of the message that single mothers are not fit to raise kids.. especially males. These are dangerous times we live in. The males being raised by single mothers more often than not, have serious mental issues and do not understand their limits. This is how real psychopaths are created.  

Besides that, Joaquins acting was incredible and helped made this movie very realistic. He deserves an oscar.

However, I have been in more than my fair share of fights in my youth and have seen and separated hundreds in my role as a teacher, coach, and bouncer.  First of all, avoid it if at all possible. I have seen winners lose by going to jail and then being fired when the news broke and even saw one guy at the bar beating the brakes off of an inebriated cunt only to have his knee irreparably damaged as the bouncers tried to pull him off. However, if push comes to punches here are a few tips.


Don’t be a sucker
Sucker punches are very effective; generally because the sucker is unaware, has no time to duck, dodge or block.  Even if you are about to walk away, keep your chin tucked and watch out.  Last Saturday night I saw a guy (you know the type) who was angry that some dapper dude was giving his guarded mate undue attention.  I saw his target hold up his hands in the universal signal of, “I don’t want no trouble.”  Just as he turned away the jealous one struck him hard above the left eye. I wrapped the douche up and drug him out in the parking lot where two other bouncers watched him till the police arrived. The victim never saw it coming and left with a nasty gash in his eyebrow.  On the flip-side, if you infer that you are about to be smashed by a beefy Neanderthal, a well-placed sucker punch might be your only option.


 
Grapple
I could go on for days about wrestling, judo, sambo and BJJ and have dabbled a bit in each.  You should be versed in some form of grappling.  I have never done a longitudinal study, but most of the fights I have witnessed turned into a wrestling match and many ended up on the ground.  A good wrestler can determine where the fight takes place.  I saw a former high school wrestling star take down a notoriously mean biker who outweighed him by 80 lbs and ride him till security got there. I can tell you there are few things scarier than having a guy sitting on your chest and you can’t get away.  Don’t be the guy on the bottom unless you have a good guard and a tight arm-bar.



Hands up
As soon as you expect blows, get your fucking hands up, fist closed, knuckles above you temples. Be especially sure to keep your left hand high and tight.  Fully 70-90% of men are right handed, and drunks are known to throw long lopping punches with that hand. Tuck your chin; duck your head, and move away from the blow often circling to your right.



 Now it’s your turn.



To grapple or not to grapple
A take-down might be your best option, especially if you want the plausible deniability of just holding someone down who just swung.  However, this may not be the best option in crowded bars or if you expect his friends to join in. Or, maybe, you just want to throw hands … or feet.



Be a straight shooter
I wish I could tell you how many time I’ve seen men, and women, sling looping hooks and hit nothing but air. Straight punches or controlled hooks are far more effective in most circumstances. I recently saw a thin thot dot the eyes of a hefty ho with good straight punches while the whale wailed away at nothing.



Boy Scout outlook
If you don’t have a heavy bag, get one or go to a gym that does. A good striking workout is invigorating and instructive. If you’ve never studied a marital art, particularly a grappling one, do it. A real man doesn’t have to fight … because he chooses not to, not because he can’t.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Notes on fighting,0,1570894519.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dggvgs/notes_on_fighting/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

I was born with a mixed genetic inheritance.  I have a high IQ, which has allowed me to earn a decent living relatively easily, and when I was younger I was good-looking enough that I had no problem picking up women just by showing up.  On the other hand my mother's side of the family has a history of mental illness, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.  While I don't have either of those conditions, I've always suffered from anxiety and depression, which led me to become an alcoholic and a drug addict until I got sober in AA over twenty years ago.

When I was nineteen I met and started dating a seventeen-year-old girl who was literally the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life.  When we'd walk into a room every pair of eyes would turn to her.  She was also smart and creative and just about as crazy as me and we had the most intense, ecstatic, and wildly co-dependent relationship I've ever experienced or ever imagined experiencing for that matter.  When we would go out I would feel like a million bucks with her on my arm and the sex was beyond anything I had ever experienced before, physically and emotionally.  When I met her I had dropped out of college for a semester to work as a waiter and I had just come off of a run of sleeping with at least one new woman every week or two for the past several months.  As soon as we started dating I threw out my little black book without giving it a second thought.

We dated for roughly two years, during which time I dropped out of college a second time to start a business with a friend.  As the business was starting gaining traction, she left for college and soon after she broke up with me.  When she left for college I was kind of relieved because of what a handful she'd been to date and I figured the relationship would just peter out and I'd meet other women in NYC.  I had even started to get women's phone numbers again in the expectation that I'd be single again soon.  I guess I was what you would describe as someone who was ""not in touch with his emotions"" because much to my surprise about a day after we broke up it suddenly hit me lick a ton of bricks and I found myself suddenly completely devastated.  I knew she was crazy and I was crazy and we were bad for each other but losing her absolutely broke me.

At one point not long after she left she wanted to get back together, but I was still too hurt so I got drunk and said some mean shit and that was the end of that.  I had relationships with other women, some of them pretty good, and tried to put her out of my mind and focus on the business, but I never really got over her, or at least I never got over the pain of losing her.  I had slept with a bunch of women before her without really letting it affect me (partly because I was usually drunk) and I had no idea until then what a broken heart felt like or that it was even possible to feel that much emotional pain.  My drinking gradually spiraled out of control, I fucked up what was a once in a lifetime business opportunity and I spent years just being depressed, feeling sorry for myself, and obsessing about having lost her.

After I got sober I gradually started to rebuild my life.  I learned to let go of a lot of shit in AA and I got a series of increasingly better jobs as I learned how to be, or at least act like, a relatively normal human being and channel my talents productively.  I met people who were smart and funny and kind and also alcoholics like me and made real human connections with them.  I heard people who were incredibly successful in life, even a few celebrities, share stories that made mine seem like a walk in the park, and I finally felt like even with all my shit I wasn't alone and there were other people like me who had come through worse and turned out fine.

As I got my life back together over the years, my former dream girl and I occasionally stayed in touch until she showed up again in her mid-30's and made it clear that she wanted to start dating me again.  For better or worse though, too much time had passed.  Neither of us was the same person anymore and to be honest her looks were starting to fade.  I gave dating her a shot out of curiosity as much as anything else and while I enjoyed the time we spent together and found it sort of healing to see for myself that I'd really gotten over her, my heart wasn't in it.  It was also clear that the only reason she had come back was that she wanted to settle down and have a kid with someone.  She made comments about things like all the various irresponsible men who'd let her down and how she just didn't understand these rich older guys she knew who only dated women in their 20's.  I wasn't gonna be the last resort guy she'd finally settle down with after she'd spent all those years fucking other men.  Truth be told I could barely even conjure up the enthusiasm to have sex with her and we broke up again after a few months.

My suspicions about her were confirmed when I ran into her six months or a year later and saw she was pregnant.  I don't know if she knew the donor or went to a sperm bank or what but I guess she had decided to give up on men and become a single mother.  I was completely unsurprised by this and felt like I had dodged a bullet.  I haven't been in touch with her since then but from what I've occasionally heard she's unsurprisingly still single.

Since then I've dated here and there but it's mostly been with women who've drifted into my orbit through AA or my social circle.  I've mostly focused on work and I think on some level I just sort of gave up on finding a woman that would excite me.  I've procrastinated and made excuses.  I don't know where the hell the time has gone but I'm in my forties now and for whatever reason after barely giving this girl a thought for almost ten years a lot of the old feelings of loss and rejection she left me with the first time we broke up have come flooding back.  Maybe it's just because I'm facing my mortality and it's normal for regrets to surface at times like that.

What's hit me hard the past few days is that I can't go on like this.  I make a good living at a job I mostly enjoy and am pretty good at, and because of a very lucky investment I made years ago I was able to buy a very nice apartment in Manhattan, but my life is dull and my sex life is either boring or nonexistent.  It's too easy to just be comfortable and safe and hold hands and talk about spirituality with my AA friends, but it's not enough.  While I healed a lot in AA, I've realized that I've internalized some terrible advice, or at least advice that's probably good for people who are in their first year or two of sobriety but not so much after a decade or two.  I've used slogans about letting go and turning things over to a higher power as an excuse to be passive and take the path of least resistance.  I think on some level what's also held me back is that I've always been afraid that nothing else I'll ever experience in a relationship will measure up to the intensity of what I felt with that girl or that I'll get hurt again the way I was when we were kids and it's just been easier to give up and not try.  

I'm determined to try though.  I've started going back to the gym again, I've cut out all junk food and processed sugar and started to upgrade my wardrobe again.  I'm regretful of all the time I've wasted but I'm absolutely fucking determined to stop making excuses, stop feeling sorry for myself and make the most of what I've got.  

Sorry if this bored the shit out of anyone but I really needed to unload it and I have no idea where else I would do so.

It shocked me, as this is so not typical of me. After 3 and half decades of life I do consider them all the same no matter if they're a 6 or a 9, but this one was 1 SMV point too far above my averages and it apparently fucked up my rules of thinking about any and all AWALTs.

I do not care that she eventually destroyed everything, one more to add to the list of thousands, it is a thing to be expected from a female so no biggie - actually surprises me a lot more when female doesn't preemptively fuck everything up, no matter her SMV, they're all the same.

I am way more shocked by how much my frame shifted when a female, ***which could actually be worth for me to waste my time on***, appears (out of the pile of shit that is the online dating today) totally unexpected out of the blue.

However, flaunting your interactions with other women, particularly to the point of overt touching and flirting is counterproductive and insulting. A faithful LTR, assuming that cryptozoological creature exists, deserves a modicum of respect.

I am 51 years old and my wife is 50. We have been married for over 30 years and have been a couple for 34 years. I have always lifted and kept my self in decent shape, and, as a result, so has she. I have never had to even encourage her to watch her diet and workout. When I was 17, I would go to the gym and soon she was right beside me. Even as a teen, she witnessed the attention that the gym gals gave me and responded to the subtle competition they represented.

I have been a teacher for the past 25 years and she knows that most of my colleagues are females, many of whom are well educated ... a few are even attractive. I am certain that those women have inspired my wife to be well-read and to be the hottest bitch at the faculty Christmas party.

Though my wife has always had a high sex drive I expect her penchant for fellatio is, at least partly, an intuitive response to an unspoken challenge.

In recent years, as a hobby and to help convince myself that I'm still a badass, though an antiquated one, I have taken a part-time job as a bouncer in a pretty rough bar/club. The servers there are young, cute, and slutty 20 somethings. She often visits me at the job and sees the young thots touching me and though I am friendly with them, I never go out of the way to take part in the constant game of grab-ass that takes place among security and servers.

This recent job/hobby has made my wife even more affectionate. It is almost as if the competition makes her moist.

That quarantine shit was just a trap attempt to make us all go rage and crazy so they would bring actual reasons for our banning because they didn't had any at the time, like they don't have any now.  
**Other thing we can learn is also to never be dependent on one source/platform.** Like we all know here we have that Plan B(TRP Forum) that is I believe going to be a special place after these morons cut us here.

Also don't be dependent on one person and have few good friends you can lean on if one fucked you up in exchange for some cheap shit, because people do that.

I urge everyone to backup their saved post history using the old.reddit url using archive.is bookmark button no matter how painstaking a task it is.

Furthermore I would request you to download the TRP offline backup, and askTRP and TRP sidebar PDFs for they contain invaluable material for those that need unplugging from the matrix in the future. Keep an offline (saved on hard disk or physical memory system) and online (cloud) copy saved.

While archive.is links may stay up download links in all probability will be dead in the future. At which point the copies present with the red pillers will act as sources for the newly introduced.

As our subreddit's goals and mission statement already fall in line with these policies, **there is no reason why we cannot adopt these policies and continue discussing red pill truths.**

&gt;**We do not tolerate the harassment, threatening, or bullying of people on our site; nor do we tolerate communities dedicated to this behavior.**

&gt;Reddit is a place for conversation, and in that context, we define this behavior as anything that works to shut someone out of the conversation through intimidation or abuse, online or off. Depending on the context, this can take on a range of forms, from directing unwanted invective at someone to following them from subreddit to subreddit, just to name a few. Behavior can be harassing or abusive regardless of whether it occurs in public content (e.g. a post, comment, username, subreddit name, subreddit styling, sidebar materials, etc.) or private messages/chat.

&gt;Being annoying, downvoting, or disagreeing with someone, even strongly, is not harassment. However, menacing someone, directing abuse at a person or group, following them around the site, encouraging others to do any of these actions, or otherwise behaving in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit crosses the line.

Steps we have already taken:

* No inter-reddit links allowed
* No pictures of private citizens

Steps we will be increasingly moderating:

* Don't harass individuals, make comments in good faith and be light hearted
* Don't threaten violence or malicious acts against anybody. That includes telling people they should hurt themselves, or that ""it should happen, but I would never do it myself..""

Nothing on topic should change under this. Only people violating the rules in practice will be seeing a change- such as fringe users and incels will see their content removed more quickly.

In my two year observation of this forum, I’ve noticed that the most frequently espoused advice on TRP is to “hold frame”. The concept’s importance has been drilled into our heads with such frequency that any member of this sub should be able to produce a girthy explanation of what frame is and provide examples of someone holding frame. While this may seem like a great accomplishment on the surface, an understanding of this concept serves little benefit without a subsequent internalization of ****why**** someone is able to hold frame. My goal for this post is to highlight why some develop impenetrable frames, whereas others build frames that crumble on impact. 

&amp;#x200B;

## Body:

So, why do people succeed or fail to hold frame?

&amp;#x200B;

Simply put: an individual is only able to ‘hold frame’ when they are able to derive validation from sources external to the person attempting to break their frame.

&amp;#x200B;

As I’ve reflected on my own journey on becoming less of a beta bitch, I hypothesize that **no matter how well you internalize what holding frame** ***looks like***, your results won’t align with your intentions until you have developed ***genuine*** **ways to reallocate your focus.**

&amp;#x200B;

I put the word genuine in italics because I am a stout believer that “working on Inner Game” is futile. What I mean by this postulation is that **no amount of books you read, posts you save, or infield videos you attempt to replicate are going to mask the insecurity you subtly reveal to the women you awkwardly attempt to seduce**. You could be a walking dictionary that spits out the perfect line that insinuates that you don’t give a fuck, but you would still come off as a fraud because your body language, tonality, and content of your speech are *incongruent*.

&amp;#x200B;

You will never believe that you are an inherently valuable person if you receive resounding feedback from the world telling you that you are dogshit. Half-assed affirmations that attempt to validate your existence are *worthless*.

&amp;#x200B;

**Everybody, regardless if they admit it or not, seeks validation. If you cannot derive it from areas of your life other than a single woman, you will fail to hold frame.** The only path to a congruent and successful attempt of holding frame, then, is to find other sources of validation. Abundance mentality comes from having **many sources of validation**, including, but very much not limited to, women. In my opinion, the three most tangible ways of developing a frame where you possess the ability to walk away are:

1. Overcoming stagnation in any/all *non-social* areas of your life
2. Developing a close male friend group
3. Spinning plates with *multiple* women

&amp;#x200B;

**Overcoming Stagnation:**

I can't give you the answers to overcoming plateaus in your life. But I can tell you that adding 100lbs to your Squat/Bench/Deadlift total will make you more confident in your abilities. Getting a promotion or a 20% pay raise will provide substantial insurance that you are a valuable human being. Mastering an excruciatingly difficult guitar solo that requires hours of dedication to get *just* right will give you a firm grounding that you are capable of overcoming plateaus. It doesn’t really matter whether you find improvement in a hobby, in your fitness life, or in your professional life, *measurable* improvement will always aid your belief that you are worth something valuable.

A large part of why lifting is so crucial to one’s development as a man is that it becomes an area where he can make consistent reliable *quantifiable* progress. The increase of testosterone doesn’t hurt either.

&amp;#x200B;

**Regarding Developing a Close Male Friend Group:**

A close male friend group makes you feel less alone in this world. And while it is imperative that you understand that in many ways you are essentially alone in this world, a close friend group will provide you with enough support to deal with this harsh reality. Though I do not recommend often relying on other people as a source of validation, men can occasionally provide you with emotional support. *You cannot do this with women*. Leaning on a woman leads to them looking down on you. Once this begins, hypergamous instincts kick in and she begins her pursuit of a man that will not become reliant on her for emotional stability.

You must, however, be willing to cut certain people if you feel that they are keeping you trapped in a cycle of mediocrity. While cutting friends sucks, learning that you’ll survive without shitty friends actually reinforces the belief that you will be fine in solitude.

&amp;#x200B;

**Regarding Plates:**

While women should not be used as the only form of validation, it is inevitable that they will bring some to you. If you have more than one at a time, you will soon come to realize that no woman is special, and you have the ability to move on from one without a fuss.

If this dwindles down to one woman, and unless you have the other areas of your life in check, you will begin to act needy. This is why LTRs and marriages fail — **you cannot use dread effectively if you truly do not have the ability to move on to other options**.

&amp;#x200B;

## Conclusion:

*Context*: About 3 weeks ago I went out to a frat party and failed to pull any girls after several cold approaches.

The next day we went out for food, and she came back to my place afterward for some netflix and chill. She's a temporary student so she'll be gone by the end of the semester, but at least I'm out of a dry spell for a solid few more months.

Women live in abject denial about their attractiveness every single day of their lives. Deep down, they know that their time is limited, and they spend incredible amounts of money on products that promise to stave off the worst effects of aging. They spend on programs, fitness routines, diet plans, anything and everything to give them that cutting-edge against their competition, other women. Hypergamy drives them to compete for the attention of the most coveted of men, the ones in the top 20%.

They work hard, because competition at that level is fierce, but time is ticking. Time that they'll never get back. And with every passing day, they grow just a little bit more undesirable. A trend that cannot ever be reversed. They see women older than they are, and they rationalize it away even though they know that, they too one day, will be them in short-order. They are powerless to stop it, even though they do anything and everything they can to do so.

That's the pressure that the wall places on women.

#The Wall Starts Now
TRP states that the Wall for women is around the age of 30. The truth is that the Wall starts from the moment they become even remotely capable of bearing offspring consistently and successfully. Data indicates that women are at their most desirable at the youthful age of 20. Twenty. Every day that passes after that point, they become less, and less, and less desirable to men- let alone the men that they really want to attract. The men with their shit in order, still vigorous,  and their lives built and secure.

Women are fairly attractive up until that point, some last longer, some decline years before, but that is the cusp, the ledge, the ill-defined line where women become so much less attractive, that they have no choice but to settle for the dregs of masculinity. The thing is, they've been hitting the wall for the last decade, and with every brush against it, they diminish.

#Biology Doesn't Wait
Society tells women they can have everything they ever wanted. The party life, the career, the family, the hot husband, and a white picket fence with perfect neighbors. They go on birth-control, fuck around frivolously spending their waning value, getting degrees, working hard, and getting everything they ever wanted. Or, at least, what they think they wanted. Though, the wall has been looming over them their entire adult life. And they walk into the wall sometimes on the daily, and like men who have given up and indulge themselves with pornography, drugs, video games, and wishful thinking, they indulge themselves with wanton sex, the party life, and mimicry of the thing their biology wants most: men.

They wait, because they think they can. But biology is not so kind. It doesn't wait like everything else in society does. They grow accustomed to having men froth at the mouth for the opportunity to taste their tight youthful pussy. They grow accustomed to being waited on, and treated like princesses, and they figure that if that's what they are worth now, they'll be even better a little bit farther down the road. But deep down, they still know that their telling themselves lies. Lies they eagerly believe in, because it's more palatable than the truth. But biology doesn't care.

#Leveraging the Wall
Women are eager to get laid by strong, powerful, commanding men. That's because the wall is ever-present, and if you work to make yourself desirable, women will practically spread their legs for you at every opportunity they get. Their biology knows that time is passing them by, and soon they won't have that opportunity ever again. Not that the women fucking you like the faithful and wonderful sluts that they are will ever admit such a thing.

Demonstrate your potential for growth over time. And even the most difficult of women will make themselves putty in your hands. The Wall commands it. And they must heed the commands of the Wall, lest they fail in their biological purpose. They prove themselves worthy of you, and they will do everything they can.

I live in the United States now, but I grew up somewhere else. When I was growing up my cousin was a frequent partyer and often picked-up girls at bars. Meanwhile, I generally avoided bars, only had one girlfriend in university, and wasted a lot of time being an orbiter.

My cousin met his wife came to our (first world) country as an international student from a third-world country. They got married somewhat hastily based on financial pressure from her father, although it's obviously worked out great for her. Interesting fact is she was 18 when they got married and they started dating when she was only 17 at a bar. The drinking age in our country is 19, but she was using a fake ID.

While I was visiting I went out with my cousin, his wife, and others to celebrate a relatives 19th birthday. In the car ride over he mentioned he would be my wing man and she says ""\[he\] can do whatever it takes to get you laid."" I realize now this was all sarcasm at my expense.

Show up at the bar, the group dissipates, and I dance briefly before getting a drink. Talk to a girl, not from our group, and share a drink with her before we start making out. She told me she was 21 and from another part of the country. Good looking girl. End up bringing her to the quieter part of the bar where others from my party are hanging-out. Continue making-out with her and start fondling her ass and vagina -- this is all consensual.

She leaves at bit later and at this time the birthday girl has passed-out drunk. I flirt with some of her friends, same age as her. When she wakes up, we head out of the bar. As I'm heading out, I run into the girl I was making out with before and passionately kiss for a few seconds before her friend drags her away.

We head over to a pizza shop, my cousin his wife and some of the birthday girl's friends. The birthday girl left is a separate vehicle. As we're outside the shop, I notice one of the girls and my cousin's wife starts screaming at me, ""don't look at her like that!""

End up taking a separate taxi home and when I contact my cousin the next day he wants me to apologize to his wife. He also mentions he ""sure as hell hope\[s\] that behavior and attitude towards women isn't something that you have normalized."" Apparently, 19-year-old girls are way too young. I pointed out that he'd made \_tons\_ of misogynist jokes at family gatherings before and tried to explain the complete hypocrisy that he'd displayed. He'd even joked about dumping one of his girlfriends on Valentine's Day and I remember him mentioning making-out with a 15-year-old who was using a fake ID in the context of turning down actual sex because she was underage. Not to mention the fact that he was living with his wife when she was 17, before they got married at 18 after meeting in a bar.

Was in 2.5 year LTR, 23M 19F, everything was going well. I mean absolutely amazing, she never exhibited signs of being crazy or a slut. She’s no unicorn because AWALT but I held it well. Would go on family trips with her, her parents would pay for everything, I’d drive her little brother to school etc etc everything was great! I stayed with her because her personality and she is academically inclined. Will be a Dr one day so this would be a woman I’d like a family with. Anyways, I did work quite a lot which put strain on the relationship. I worked 7 days a week for 6 months straight, at about 68-74 hours a week.

GF veered off in the relationship and sought emotional refuge in this fuckboy from her biology class, because of said Hours I worked. He’s muscular, I’ll give him that, but he looks like Lurch from the Adams Family. But chad enough looking because muscles and high test to where he could pull young vapid girls. I am objectively much much more handsome than him in the face, I’ve had great attention my whole life because of my face ha. Long story short, I had a mental breakdown one night from working so much and COMPLETELY went beta in front of GF. The breakdown began because I asked her to stop seeing this specific fuck boy, she eventually agreed but hung out with him with a group of friends anyways.  I broke up with her, she fell apart. I took her back, she pulled the switch a roo and picked her stuff up from my house to break up with me. While doing so, she secretly had her Mother on the phone...she started acting up and I started yelling. Que her crazy Mom who then called the fucking cops. Realizing this, I went full crazy and smashed a anniversary gift. Which was a complete anomaly in my behavior as I’ve never acted like that in my life, much less alone my relationship. Anyways, cops show up and break into my house. My Gf and I try to sort it out and she’s all up and down about everything. She ends up staying the night despite everything and I fuck her good at the end of the night.

Next following days she starts saying all sorts of crazy shit, I need a month to think, my boundaries are you can’t give me boundaries. Etc etc Typical I’m going to hold on to you while I fuck another guy shit.

Starts making excuses, her parents hate me, you broke my gift, my friends think your abusive blah blah etc etc. just excuses to break up with me without admitting fault.

Anyways, she finds a reason to leave... tho within a week after our break up I find a high paying job that will set me for life with a career. Just to give you an idea. I could afford my own place, get a house in a year, new car etc etc. I don’t drink I don’t smoke, I exercise regularly, I’m 6”2, Classically handsome and multi talented (skateboarder, music producer, graphic designer). With this job I’m about to get loads of extra time and female attention. Mind you I’m 23 with no college degree, highly ambitious and scored a 100k job, so I’m basically supreme Chad now in that regard.

Girlfriend gets wind of this, calls me and tells me while sobbing “ Everything sucks, Why’d you have to get this job after I break up with you? Why is everything going well for you while nothing is going good for me?”. “My life sucks, my emotions suck, I can’t focus in school. DEAR GOD STOP CONTACTING ME” All while sobbing. She sounds incredibly regretful but tells me she is done with me because I threw a collection of knick knacks we collected away after we broke up....She’s trying to justify her reasoning none the less.

Fast forward 2 weeks. Turns out, through the grape vine I figure out she is seeing this fuckboy now for a casually fling. When I found out, I called her and ripped into her soul for dragging me through everything with her friends, family, the police etc etc I had a god damn mental breakdown and she left me at my weakest! She still refused to admit to fault but did apologize while sobbing on the phone. It’s been no contact since as I told her I have nothing to prove.


Just to put into context of the fuckboy.

20 y/o
Weird face, but high testosterone looking. Tall but shorter than me.
Muscular. Everybody that has seen a picture of him says he looks weird as fuck.
High school athlete but now majoring in basic business major.
No personality, just a “bro”
Drives a shit car.
Lives at home with parents.
Fake rich douche style because he has no bills to pay and blows money on designer clothes.

The guy is a obvious temporary fuck. I’ve read their messages to each other and he just wants to fuck. (She left her twitter open on my phone). In every regard, I am much more viable long term than he would ever be at the moment.

Despite all this, I do want to be with her because of how amazing it all was until the end. I can overlook her mistakes because it’s obvious she has no idea wtf is going on. She just left a big boy for a fake alpha turd face. I’m not justifying her actions but I can conceptualize all this because AWALT.

What are the chances her AWALT instincts will see my long term viability and she’ll return? If she does...is it worth it? If it is worth it...how do I reinstate respect in the relationship?

Im going to make some points on why this admission pissed me off and still does. 

 1. She wants a ffm threesome and the fact that its a girl and not a man doesnt make me feel any better about it. Its weird how she acknowledges that if she asked for mfm threesome that be like fucked up like shes kind of saying im not enough and wants another dude but asking for another girl with us is fine? 

2. Its just a fantasy. Ok this im really tired of hearing this because a fantasy is a blanket term and is still an omission of something desired. It doesnt have to happen to offend someone the desire alone shows the persons intentions. If I told my gf I fantasize about smothering babies would she want to have kids with me? No. Now with my gf telling me she wants sex with another person but only if your cool with it should I trust her fidelity with just me in a marriage for many years? No. The Implication is still there and implications create doubt so your still inderectly creating doubt within a relationship. 

3. Its just sex. This is amazing because if sex was just sex people wouldnt get divorced over another partner banging a stranger. Do people get divorced if the husband or wife attends a co workers barbeque? No. Do people get divorced if the husband or wife performs oral sex on a co workers genitals? Yes. Sex isnt meaningless especially in a relationship. 

4. I make jokes about stacked women so that means im planning to cheat? She says she might want a ffm threesome and that means nothing? Oh wait its just a fantasy right? Shes also come to me in near tears about a dream where I cheated on her but is fine if its a theesome? 

5. ""I dont really want one I couldnt handle seeing you with another woman"". Than why bring it up? Is that supposed to make me feel better? I could say your mothers a worthless nagging bitch but I dont really feel that way I was just angry when I said that. Does that take it back? No. 

6. If sex in her eyes is meaningless so is marriage. The whole point of marriage is a union between two people its things shared between a couple like love and intimacy that isnt given to anyone else. But in her mind lets just cut out the sex between just us part because thats boring having sex with one person your whole life is boring. Well than what differentiates us between being married and not married? Is it because we love each other? I love my mom does that mean im married to my mom too?  You see what happend when you start cherry picking things? You start contorting traditional values like marriage until they become absolutely worthless.

We have been granted a stay of execution.

[Proof is Here](http://a.trp.red/files/StayOfExecution.jpg)

This is a very strange twist indeed but we are grateful to have more time on this platform. Since yesterday's closure seemed imminent to us, we let a few cats out of the bag- namely that we were finishing [**our redesign of Forums.Red and had originally aimed to have it ready by December 2019.**](http://a.trp.red/files/screenshot-2.jpg)

Our original plan was not to move /r/theredpill but to open ancillary forums on the new platform.

I can't say exactly how the next few months will play out, but here's what we do plan to do:

* According to the notice from the admin, we have some compliance issues. We want to find out what those issues are from the admin and rectify them.
* We will finish our Forums.Red Platform independent of what happens on Reddit.
* As soon as it is ready, a red pill forum will be opened on forums.red. 
* However **we will not be closing reddit.com/r/theredpill.**

Some people have suggested we made this up to push traffic to our other site. We didn't. Why would we push people to forums.red when it wasn't ready (and was slow as death because it wasn't ready?!) Take a look at https://www.forums.red and then look at our redesign we're working on: http://a.trp.red/files/screenshot-2.jpg.  It doesn't check out.

I'll ask /u/acuddlybabytapir to weight in and verify that we got these messages and have not altered them.

We live in a world where you can be fired at the drop of a hat. A single tweet from 10 years ago, a Facebook post about Donald Trump, or a slightly uncalibrated comment to a woman at work can destroy your financial livelihood.

**It is more important now, than ever, for you to start making money on your own.**

I noticed this trend when I was in college, and it's exactly why I started my own business. I got fired from a job at a tanning salon for some stupid reason I still don't even fully understand.

...and do you know what? That salon was about 90% women. There were 15 girls there, and only two dudes (including me). The other dude was a raging homosexual, so of course, he supported the feminine imperative.

After seeing how easily I could lose my job, I started a business... and I couldn't be more grateful. I'm untouchable now. I'm making a healthy income, enjoy what I do, and most importantly, can say whatever the fuck I want.

Half the shit I post on Instagram and Twitter would've gotten a person with a normal job fired. Having this freedom as a many is immensely motivating.

The truth is, you CANNOT be truly free unless you own your own income. If you rely on a corporation with a big HR department to sign your paycheck, you will never be free.

I've seen friends, family members, and acquaintances get FIRED over stupid bullshit that would never have been an issue just 10 or 15 years ago. The times are getting a bit worse, and we're in for a rocky ride now, boys.

TRP subreddit being banned is even more proof of this; more than you could ever need. As we enter into an time where feels come before facts, you can probably expect things to get worse before they get better.

It's been a great ride, boys. TRP changed my life after I discovered it when I was 15 years old. I count myself lucky to have discovered it, and am thankful for everything it's done.

**Before I end this post, I'd like to leave you with a warning. You may think that you're free, you may think that you're safe, but with our current climate... do you think things will get better, or worse?**

She laughed and said ""i am looking for menw who will be help me economically, not only fuck"".

I told her ""Economically?"" and she answered ""yes"".

Then I told ""I never paid for sex and i will never do it""

She went straight to the shaming tactic: she told me ""Why would I fuck with you?"". OMG I lol'd so much with this one. she felt so entitled, like you are a top model and you're fat, 40 years old woman who is begging online for cash. I told her I never cared, to be honest, and her next line was the shocker: ""ha, ha, you're so primitive"".

Primitive. Like if you were a superior being, way more intelligent and you think opening your legs will bring you automatically a new wave of cash and submit any man. Sorry butter golem, not today, not with me.

Art of manliness.

Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle - to get the ultimate low down on relationships and the consciousness behind them, and a powerful practice to deal with pain and past trauma or fear of the future. This was what got me out of the anger and depression phase, and allowed me to make peace with my past. I'd say everyone on earth needs to at least know what a ""pain body"" is.

And if you thought that all this is new - just read the story of Krishna, the Hindu god and the original romantic hero or the kinds of heroes and heroines in old Indian texts - centuries ago people found ways to look at attraction and personality archetypes in truly staggering depth, going deep into their thoughts and feelings in explicit detail. We just forgot what everyone knew all along.

I could sum up the entirety of relationships by saying that Attraction and standards are what it's all about - men, women and society have their own sexual strategies. All women and all men are like that. Sexual relationships are the sweetest form of psychopathy.

Society will refuse to acknowledge that the right cocktail of frame, thoughts and emotions is what matters and will keep fooling themselves believing that relationships are based on logic, discussions and choreplay - academia and the media are insidious, agenda driven and fucked up.

The media is just 50 shades of yellow journalism. Social media is fucked up with keyboard saints. Don't listen to anything what women or society or especially what social media says, look what they and the rest of society actually does. They are all mentally ill and the cognitive dissonance between intellect and body, between thought and emotion have never been greater. Speaking of mental illness, beware of BPD.

And WALK the path! Don't just study books, implement them, one step at a time. Knowing the path and WALKING the path opens up reality and teaches you far more than what can ever be captured in words. Do not ever let success make you cosy, and never let failure bog you down - the world is big and abundance is real...

A guy was having trouble, because he’d mastered the art of Tinder whores. It appeared he was fucking a new girl every few days, was plating new girls and having sex every night. However, he was unfulfilled. Yet, he didn’t seem to be able to stop doing it. 

It got me thinking how many guys don’t read between the lines, or the disclaimer at the bottom of the page that is Red Pill. So enamoured with ‘getting pussy’ and fucking bitches they miss one of the absolute key parts of swallowing the pill. 

Women, sex, female attention and validation will not fulfill you. So many Blue Pillers come here, indoctrined into the idea that female attention will suddenly solve whatever self-worth and self esteem issues they have. 

I’ve seen many guys who post talking of depression, lack of fulfillment and emptiness once they start plating and fucking on overdrive. They missed the disclaimer. 

Female validation, sex and approval will not solve what you need to from within. If you misread Red Pill and put women as the focal point of your life and start doing everything you need to do to be attractive as your priority, you’re going to wind up empty. 

Making your number one thing in life self-improvement, plating and fucking is another version of the Blue. The blue can teach that women are princesses on pedestals and the ultimate source of happiness and fulfillment for men. A lot of bloopers have spent years chasing oneitis’s, LTR’s. They have worked to get the perfect job, become the perfect supplicating nice guy, give over their agency to women. All in the blue pill vein hope of securing this female validation that will make life worth it. 

Cue Red Pill. Guys learn new behaviours, attitudes and tactics to get a LOT of sex. It becomes their focus. The thing that takes up most of their life. The Red Pill unaware blooper spends years pining for the female gift of validation. The Red Pill guy who doesn’t read the disclaimer spends his time trying to fuck his way to the fulfillment female validation was promised. Both end up depressed, empty and bordering crisis. 

The way I’ve always seen the pill, is a deeper and deeper rejection of the system. Part of that system is the belief that women hold the key to men’s self-esteem, and they should be a man’s mission. If you’re pining away in a basement trying to get your oneitis, or spending most of your time fucking and plating then either way women have become your mission. Telling, isn’t it, that both these guys end up depressed. 

I’ve always seen Red Pill as a wake up. A reminder that women’s, or anyone’s validation and approval is ultimately empty. If we don’t accept that, then we just keep trying harder. Fucking more, plating more, Tindering more. It can lead to addictive behaviours, and a lot of new Red Pillers don’t realise they’re actually harbouring a sex addiction. Empty, but not able to stop the behaviour that gives them a temporary feeling of relief. 

We all know that a man without sex gets a hole in the stomach. He’s hungry, and not satisfied. It takes up his mind and eventually has negative effects. 

Red Pill is about rejecting the system. Realising that women’s sexual validation does NOT fill a man’s void. It gives us truths, tactics, behaviours, game so we can get our sexual needs met and so have time and attention to give the OTHER things in our life that CAN lead to fulfillment. 

The 80/20 rule. 80% of your time goes towards whatever path you’re carving to bring you some happiness and fulfillment. The other 20% goes towards women. And that 20% is merely satisfying the distraction from sticking to the other 80%. The 20% is satisfying an itch, so you’re free for the 80%. Don’t fall into the trap of making the 80% all about getting the 20%. 

IF you don’t know what your 80% is and what your mission is, your goals, your priorities and what gives you fulfillment then cut back on the fucking until you do. 

I have some highly attractive plates. One in particular. I don’t care. They get 20% of my time, effort and attention. The other 80% I consciously CHOOSE to do more important things. Yes, nutting on a girl’s face is great. It isn’t fulfilling. It doesn’t give me meaning or purpose. Upsetting the balance and giving them more than the 20% will only give me more experiences that don’t lead to fulfillment. 

Where are you seeking fulfillment? Are women and sex your mission? Do you need to re-balance the scales?",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,"Read the Disclaimer, and a way I apply the 80/20 rule.",0,1570021402.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dbt2wa/read_the_disclaimer_and_a_way_i_apply_the_8020/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,dark,,,,,,0

I want to make a post addressing the stages that people go through after discovering the red pill. It's modeled after the [Kübler-Ross model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model), which is a psychological theory regarding stages of grief.

**The 5 stages are as follows:**

1. Denial
2. Anger
3. Bargaining
4. Depression
5. Acceptance

These five stages are typically undergone anytime someone loses somebody close to them, but I think it's very applicable to the red pill, as well. As you're reading this, ask yourself which stage you're in.

# Stage 1. Denial

This is what happens when a blue pilled AFC reads his first ROK article or TRP post. He's immediately met with a sense of denial, which is a protective mechanism to preserve his belief system.

The ""Denial Stage"" is also rife with ad hominems used to protect one's own belief system:

* ""TRP is so sexist!""
* ""TRP is so cynical!""
* ""TRP is so delusional!""

If somebody is in the denial phase, it doesn't matter how much evidence you show them that contract their belief systems... they will not budge. If you know people like this, it's best to move on and stop trying to convince them.

# Stage 2. Anger

This is often referred to as the ""Red Pill Rage"" stage in our community. Stage 2 is characterized by an intense sense of anger, at society, at women, and at life as a whole.

The ""Anger Stage"" is rife with comments such as:

* ""Women are such sluts!""
* ""Society is so full of sh\*t!""
* ""The media just LIES to everyone!""

The ""Anger Stage"" is one that's typically short and intense. If one is unable to let go of their victim complex however, this stage can continue on for years, and eventually create violent offenders.

# Stage 3. Bargaining

Once an individual begins to accept the ""red pill truths,"" they will try to bargain with the ideology laid out in this subreddit, and will often accept parts of it, but deny other parts.

The ""Bargaining Stage"" is typically represented by comments such as:

* ""Not all women are like that!""
* ""Hypergamy only affects some women!""
* ""Yeah, people care about looks, but personality matters too!""

The bargaining stage is the last stage where an individual still hangs on to their old blue pill ideology. Desperate not to let their old belief system crumble, they still hang onto any last remnants of it which they find plausible.

# Stage 4. Depression

This is the phase that typically lasts the longest. It is a severe sense of nihilism and cynicism regarding the world, after one realizes he has been lied to, duped, and tricked by society and others.

I would also like to point out, at my own risk, that this is the phase that many of the people here are stuck in. They don't believe they can improve their lives, and don't believe it's worth it to try.

This phase is marked by comments such as:

* ""What's the use? All the Chads will just get the girls anyways.""
* ""Make more money? Yeah, so the Chads can f\*ck my wife on the side.""
* ""All girls cheat. What's the point of even getting a girlfriend?""

This stage marks an inability to understand nuance, and is very depleting. Once an individual lets go of their emotions however, they can move onto the final stage: acceptance.

# Stage 5. Acceptance

This is the stage we're all trying to get to. It's marked by a calm serenity, and an acceptance that yes, the world simply is how it is, and no amount of thinking or emotion will change this.

The ""Acceptance"" stage is marked by the following comments:

* ""I'm going to improve my life and try to find a loyal woman.""
* ""Even though not all girls are loyal you can still screen hard and find a decent one.""
* ""Yes, cheating is a possibility, but if you guard your family and your life, you can drastically reduce its odds of happening.""

The acceptance stage is the holy grail, because it allows one to fully accept the red pill ideology, without being burdened by the often heavy emotions which come with it (anger, depression, etc.).

# Which Stage Are You In?

Now, the important part. Ask yourself which stage you're in, and then you will gain a greater understanding of what you need to do. I would guess that most people here are either in the ""anger"" stage or the ""depression"" stage.

Of course, even after accepting the red pill, you will still be met with these emotions. I occasionally get angry that society is so blue pilled, and feel cynical over the future. The key however, is that this is not my overarching state.

These stages represent an ""overarching stage"" that guide an individual's thoughts, actions, and behaviors. Thus, someone in the ""Anger Stage"" will still feel calm at times, and someone in the ""Depression Stage"" will still feel happy at times. It's about the general feeling however, and the general belief system.

Be as harsh as possible :)

**My background:**

This is the 1st girl i hooked up with after my LTR (probably can find some sad cry-baby posts about it from my account), and found TRP last year September/October, learning different things on the dynamics of women and their encounters with males and improving myself for the sake of improving myself (books/gym/work/etc).

&amp;#x200B;

**Story:**

Met this girl at a party, seemed nice so i told her i'll contact her for drinks later in the week (got her Instagram). She seemed kind of anxious/shy but was very receptive while we were speaking. She's 20, i'm 22.

Met her twice prior, very receptive, nothing more than making out and playing with her tits and ass in the car, didn't escalate further.

3rd time we went out, she asked me to stay over beforehand, didn't say yes, just plenty of amused mastery telling her she'd have to earn it. We went out for drinks, had fun, then went back to hers, ended up cooking, eating, talking, then proceeding to the couch.

Escalated plenty, she was pretty much naked except her g-string, grinded, fingered her for a bit, super wet, and freshly shaved. However, she refused to take her string off.   
I tried at first and she stopped me physically by closing her legs and moving them to the side. Thought to myself probably not yet, so i continued what i was doing prior, changing it up a bit, then told her to take it off, she said no.   
I was super confused and i asked why in the moment (*oops* \- failed that shit test), she replied ""Because i said so"". Didn't know how to react as i was caught off guard (didn't expect the LMR, *another mistake*), assumed there was a *logical* reason to it, kinda got bored and let the activity slowly die down. 

Fast forward a bit, we went to bed, and she slept on me. Woke up in the morning, made out a bit, got turned on and tried to take off her string again, she said no, and i just left it at that. She ended up giving me a handie, talked for a bit, then i passed out, and she went to cook me pancakes whilst sleeping. Ate and then left after about an hour. 

At some point during the morning i asked her if she was ok due to her not wanting to take off her string, she told me she wanted to ""torture me"", that's when i realized i fucked up, replied with ""aaaah, 2 can play at that game"" and proceeded with some amused mastery.

P.S: At some point during the next day she mentioned 3 things which caught my attention:

1. She told me 3 of her friends asked if we fucked, inclining me to believe it was on the table, and that she was covertly communicating it to me through that.
2. She was talking about one of her friend's bfs, and how he constantly wants a threesome, she spun it, saying she wouldn't be able to share me (i didn't respond to that comment, although i should have used it to break rapport, making me believe she wants an LTR, which probably explains the LMR?).
3. She has a country house approx 4-6 hours away, she asked me if i'd like to go and spend a long weekend there, told her we'll see if it's possible (i don't want to spend so much time with her if we're not fucking, can't imagine how annoying a cockblock would be if i were stuck there).

**My attempted breakdown on my mistakes:**

1. When we were on the couch, i feel i shouldn't have let the activity stop, and continued regardless of her denials to see if she would have obliged later.
2. Shouldn't have asked ""why"", and should have just told her she was boring and freeze the situation for a bit, see if that changed anything.
3. (if i didn't do #2, or if it didn't work) should have denied her sleeping on me.
4. In the morning, i think i should have been more assertive/dominant because she kind of gave me fuck me eyes when she said no, that was very confusing in the moment.

**Questions**:

1. At the time i thought she wanted to be warmed up more, but after the 2nd no i felt if i did anything it may have pushed a boundary of hers, and didn't want to feel like a rapist afterwards. Thoughts on this?
2. At some point i kind of called her out on the LMR (said it was disappointing in a teasing manner), if she decides to want to see me again (meaning if she texts me 1st), should i keep her accountable for it? i.e last time being a disappointment, and expecting more to happen or just nexting her 
3. Did asking her the next day do anything to diminish the attraction? 
4. This is probably the first LMR i failed (i have a low n-count), and not too sure what i should expect following its failure (future encounters with same girl), thoughts/stories on this?
5. I know a lot of girls are afraid of guys nexting them after sleeping with them which is why they would want to delay sex to find committed partners, but since it went down the way it did, I've actually lost a bit of interest already. I had a IDGAF attitude before since i'm not emotionally invested in her, but i feel i may be able to be downright cruel if i'm not careful, thoughts on how to manage it?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, the more details the more you guys can call me out on my mistakes and set me straight.

No matter how big your salary is, if you have a job that causes you more discomfort and stress than wellbeing and happiness, you'd better quit. If you feel like you'd rather kill yourself than going to work, then something's wrong with your life. Everyone will eventually notice that you are unhappy. And yeah, guess what: no matter how good looking you are, women don't want to be around a bitter dude who hates his job and complains about it.

Don't let others discourage you or dissuade you from choosing a career path just because ""it's a profession with low wages"" or ""there aren't many options if you choose that field"". Yes, money is important, but what's the point of having a well paid job if you hate it? Also, it doesn't matter if your field/industry of interest have a reputation of having low wages, because you will quickly go up the ladder and, sooner than later, you'll get good positions and salaries if you are really, really good at it.

If you have an extraordinary talent, and there is a profession that you know you would enjoy and excel at, don't hesitate to choose a career path related to your passion.

Look at me: I grew up in a poor household, so I chose my degree with the only idea in my mind of making lots of money. Got a job with a good salary in a powerful industry shortly after graduating, but soon I came to realize that I hate it and I'm 0% interested in it.

Hating my job has been the source of my recent pitfalls in life: feelings of emptiness, sadness and having no purpose, and realising that I am wasting the prime years of my youth; also, since I hate my daily life, I ended up developing oneitis and displaying beta behavior for my last plate because she was the main source of happiness and pleasure of my life, which is a recipe for disaster and inevitably led to her dumping me, as she sensed she was too important for me because my life sucks. There's no point in being rich if your job depresses you.

INSTEAD, if you love your job and your profession, you will display an evident aura of confidence like you own the place. You will be more magnetic to people because you'll always be in a good mood and you'll be fun to be around, as your job will be a source of happiness to you and your demeanor will convey that you love your life, so in all likelihood, you won't need any crutches to get by, and you won't seek comfort in bad habits or ""the love of a woman"". A woman should be a supplement to your already happy life, not a patch to your unhappy life (which will inevitably lead to you putting her on a pedestal and hence a broken plate or terribly failed relationship).

Money should never be the only reason why you choose a career path. Now I plan to abandon everything and study the degree that I should have chosen when I was 18. Thankfully, I am currently 25.

In my two year observation of this forum, I’ve noticed that the most frequently espoused advice on TRP is to “hold frame”. The concept’s importance has been drilled into our heads with such frequency that any member of this sub should be able to drop a twenty-page thesis paper on the subject with a girthy explanation of what frame is and how it looks to hold frame. And while this may seem like a great accomplishment on the surface, an understanding of this concept serves little benefit without a subsequent internalization of ****why**** someone is able to hold frame. My goal for this post is to show someone how to stop being a fraud. 

&amp;#x200B;

## Body:

So, why do people succeed or fail to hold frame?

&amp;#x200B;

Simply put: an individual is only able to ‘hold frame’ when they are able to derive validation from sources external to the person attempting to break their frame.

&amp;#x200B;

As I’ve reflected on my own journey on becoming less of a beta bitch, I hypothesize that **no matter how well you internalize what holding frame** ***looks like***, your results won’t align with your intentions until you have developed ***\*genuine\**** **ways to reallocate your focus.**

&amp;#x200B;

I put the word genuine in italics because I am a stout believer that “working on Inner Game” is futile. What I mean by this postulation is that **no amount of books you read, posts you save, or infield videos you attempt to replicate are going to mask the insecurity you subtly reveal to the women you awkwardly attempt to seduce**. You could be a walking dictionary that spits out the perfect line that insinuates that you don’t give a fuck, but you would still come off as a fraud because your body language, tonality, and content of your speech are *incongruent*.

&amp;#x200B;

You will never believe that you are an inherently valuable person if you receive resounding feedback from the world telling you that you are dogshit. Half-assed affirmations that attempt to validate your existence are *worthless*.

&amp;#x200B;

**Everybody, regardless if they admit it or not, seeks validation. If you cannot derive it from areas of your life other than a single woman, you will fail to hold frame.** The only path to a congruent and successful attempt of holding frame, then, is to find other sources of validation. Abundance mentality comes from having **many sources of validation**, including, but very much not limited to, women. In my opinion, the three most tangible ways of developing a frame where you possess the ability to walk away are:

1. Overcoming stagnation in any/all *non-social* areas of your life
2. Developing a close male friend group
3. Spinning plates with *\*multiple\** women

&amp;#x200B;

**Overcoming Stagnation:**

I can't give you the answers to overcoming plateaus in your life. But I can tell you that adding 100lbs to your Squat/Bench/Deadlift total will make you more confident in your abilities. Getting a promotion or a 20% pay raise will provide substantial insurance that you are a valuable human being. Mastering an excruciatingly difficult guitar solo that requires hours of dedication to get *\*just\** right will give you a firm grounding that you are capable of overcoming plateaus. It doesn’t really matter whether you find improvement in a hobby, in your fitness life, or in your professional life, *measurable* improvement will always aid your belief that you are worth something valuable.

A large part of why lifting is so crucial to one’s development as a man is that it becomes an area where he can make consistent reliable *quantifiable* progress (assuming one follows a linear progression and hasn’t maxed out their newb gains). The increase of testosterone doesn’t hurt either.

&amp;#x200B;

**Regarding Developing a Close Male Friend Group:**

A close male friend group makes you feel less alone in this world. And while it is imperative that you understand that in many ways you are essentially alone in this world, a close friend group will provide you with enough support to deal with this harsh reality. Though I do not recommend often relying on other people as a source of validation, men can occasionally provide you with emotional support. *You cannot do this with women*. Leaning on a woman leads to them looking down on you. Once this begins, hypergamous instincts kick in and she begins her pursuit of a man that will not become reliant on her for emotional stability.

You must, however, be willing to cut certain people if you feel that they are keeping you trapped in a cycle of mediocrity. While cutting friends sucks, learning that you’ll survive without shitty friends actually reinforces the belief that you will be fine in solitude.

&amp;#x200B;

**Regarding Plates:**

While women should not be used as the only form of validation, it is inevitable that they will bring some to you. If you have more than one at a time, you will soon come to realize that no woman is special, and you have the ability to move on from one without a fuss.

If this dwindles down to one woman, and unless you have the other areas of your life in check, you will begin to act needy. This is why LTRs and marriages fail — **you cannot use dread effectively if you truly do not have the ability to move on to other options**.

&amp;#x200B;

## Conclusion:

The “I am enough” and “I stand by my values” mentalities that are at the core of all forms of holding frame come from within, but these mantras are only internalized by setting and achieving goals, developing a sense you are a human being worthy of respect from participating in a close friend group, and by sleeping with enough women to realize that you’ll recover if one decides not to be with you anymore.

**TL;DR:** Everybody, regardless if they admit it or not, seeks validation. If you cannot derive it from areas of your life other than a single woman, you will fail to hold frame.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,On Holding Frame,0,1569903445.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/db6ayy/on_holding_frame/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

**Body:**

Started out in a loud nightclub where I felt stifled. Said ""hey how's it going"" to a girl beside me; she said ""I'm sober as fuck right now so don't bother""; I laughed sincerely, touched her arm to get her attention again, and said ""wait what the fuck? what's wrong with talking to sober people?""; her friend said ""she's not interested, she's not interested"" in an irritated way so I just left them alone and went back to my wings who gave me a fistbump for moral support.

Later we went on the street. I'm much more comfortable talking to strangers outdoors. I was still quite stifled and so forced myself to talk to a group of guys (I really didn't want to, due to the social anxiety, but accepted that it would be painful and beneficial to do so) and that helped. They were a little weirded out by the fact that I talked to them but it wasn't the most awkward conversation. Immediately afterwards I talked to a couple girls behind them with my wing; it was way easier after talking to the guys which warmed me up. The girls were much friendlier and we had a pleasant conversation; I wasn't into the girl I was talking to, though, so I kept the vibe platonic and we hugged goodbye after a few minutes when they wanted to go back into the nightclub they were in.

A few more interactions with strangers on the street. Bitched out of winging my wingman when he approached a couple group sets. Then approached a really cute girl standing on her own by a building; I said ""I like your style"" then I moved so I could lean on the wall beside her instead of staying in the needy ""approach position"". She was really bubbly and smiley, and very talkative, but I didn't sense any sort of sexual vibe; the whole conversation was 100% platonic. Made a mental note afterwards to make it more man-to-woman from the start. Also realized much later that her bubbliness might be a front, and that maybe I shouldn't be encouraging girls to stay that overly-friendly and innocent-seeming when really they usually have a wilder side that they're socially trained to repress.

Then a 2-set with my wing, two cute black girls; the one I talked to was giving me sex eyes the whole time but I wasn't into her so I played along a bit but didn't escalate and kept a slightly platonic vibe.

Finally a 2-set with my wing, two Japanese girls. He hooked them well by talking nonstop (I was quieter at first), and then when they got out their cigarettes to smoke, I put my arms around the cute one from the back and held her while she smoked. At some point I also tried and failed to sweep her off her feet (failed because she was too shy for that and kicked her leg up), but as soon as I failed and then laughed and reacted like it was normal, she put her arm around me. The [mental entitlement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2016/09/13/im-a-feminist-whos-attracted-to-manly-men/?utm_source=reddit.com) I had to her body made her much more into me. Usually I wait for IOIs but this time I just went for those moves after intuiting there was enough trust between us for her to not be scared of me (it had only been a few minutes, but I have a trustworthy vibe conveyed through eye contact and demeanour). We ended up hanging out with them all night, took them to the beach, stayed up till 5am with them. I held my girl's hand most of the time, arm around her sometimes, got her to kiss me on the cheek, all while self-amusing and enjoying the adventure and jokingly pretending we were in love (but without having a boyfriend-y vibe). She spoke &lt; 20 words of English so her friend had to translate a lot for us. It went nowhere sexually, and my wing and I knew that from the start (they were really shy girls, and the whole time my girl said ""kiss only boyfriend, sex only boyfriend, I leave soon for Japan, you me no kiss"") but we stuck in it for the adventure anyway and had fun getting to know them. At some point on the beach we were walking and holding hands and she was playing with my hand, and I popped a boner and stopped to hug her sensually again so she could feel my boner; she pulled away a little but the trust was still there and we kept walking like it was normal. Later on I did another sensual hug and then bit her neck which she didn't pull away at all for. But the whole time she had a massive logical resistance to kissing/sex outside of a relationship and I didn't want to push that (I'm in this for good mutual times, not to push girls to have sex with me). As we dropped them off to their friend's place at the end, she let go of my hand; I was like ""what are you embarrassed to hold my hand in front of your friend"" and she said ""yes"" hahaha. This told me that she was into me to some extent; otherwise she wouldn't have engaged in behaviours she thought weren't socially acceptable. As we hugged goodbye she groped my belly and said ""big"", which I took as a shit test and said ""yes, big belly"" positively.

**Conclusion:**

It's a long journey, and never ends. I'm early on this journey and that's okay. I woke up at noon today and hit the gym. Going to meditate for an hour tonight as usual. I have goals but I'm also enjoying the process.

While Forums.Red's official launch is still a few months out, we are proud to announce the redesign of TRP.RED is now live and our newest feature **TRIBES** is now here!

#[You can read more about what Tribes are and how there work right here.](https://tribes.trp.red)

But to give a brief overview- Tribes are groups dedicated to topics, friends, or brands that you can make for private or public discussion, chat rooms, or news feeds. Tribe owners have an immense level of control of who can post and see what's posted. Take a look how it works [here](https://tribes.trp.red) or [start your own tribe and try it out right now free!](https://www.trp.red/newtribe.php). 

#What can you do with a Tribe?

* Start a private meeting place for friends to chat / coordinate
* Start a meeting place for your Brand to broadcast to your followers
* Start an open discussion group on any topic you want
* Keep a private collection of links of interest for you and friends.

Tribes include:

* A Private or Public News Feed
* Dedicated Chatroom
* Easy to use User Access Controls
* (Soon: Dedicated Forums at Forums.Red)

Our new design of TRP.RED also includes a new chat interface, chatrooms, and a new look and feel for our site. Head on over now to take a look: https://www.trp.red

We've already got some new tribes for you to check out:

I know most of the people advocate against social media like Facebook and Instagram but it’s a valuable tool for social proof. 

With such a large active community I did a quick search and found there are no threads, at least none with decent upvotes, to share each other’s social media. 

If we worked as a community I think this could be an amazing tool to not only show massive social proof but also a great way to check to show off progress and gas each other up. 

Thoughts?

Is this allowed?

In fact, I'm constructing a post that will detail my troubles with this community's philosophy. Before you all get up in arms, keep in mind the only reason I'm doing this is I know this community is capable of self-aware and meaningful discussion and evolution. The same goes for me if I am found to be profoundly misunderstanding of certain aspects of The Red Pill. 

With all that being said, on a fundamental level this community preaches an emotionally effective way of handling conflict. A common characteristic of alphas is that they not only respond to the situation but understand the stakes of the situation. Let's say you're at a bar and a man comes up to you and is very clearly trying to gain social traction over you. Should you be with a couple of young ladies, your friends, or alone the proper way of handling a clear act of social shit-testing is not simply project that you don't care: it's actually don't care. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you only project lack of care, you may pacify the situation with your outward appearance, but on the inside you are burning. You're going over in your head what you should have said, what you should have done, how you could've humiliated this guy more. Wrong, wrong, wrong. You're getting stuck in your head. The Red Pill is not fundamentally a set of social behaviors, it's a mindset. A mindset that you can only mimic and never fully embrace unless you truly do not care about the outcome of a low stakes situation. Let's say he does win. Takes the girl you were with home. Big deal. Go home, jack off, the bars are open tomorrow. There's plenty of women who will want you if you have the right mindset. 

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you who have played poker to any meaningful extent,  you will know that short-term outcome does indicate long term winning. Why? Because luck and favor swing to-and-fro but a correct model of playing the game will give you the edge in the long run. So while all of your friends are listening to the new guy who just barged in and humiliated you. Take a deep breath and try to laugh a little. He's probably even a little funny. Alphas understand that true strength comes from being able to stand up to a truly unknown situation, not winning petty social fights at the bar. In fact, when you adopt this Don't Care mindset, you'll ironically start winning a lot more of them. You're a winner, you've got this, don't worry too much about all this bullshit.

It is pretty red pill, no?

I first heard the phrase when there was a lot of talk about Afghanistan in the air. Afghan warlords were known to have young male concubines, mainly because Islam can be strict about separating men and women. 

The phrase has also variously been attributed to the Turks and the Persians -- all cultures with an Islamic influence, which I've often heard praised as being red pill, or at least not blue pilled, or not letting hypergamy run wild. 

It's also been attributed to the Scots, and a third verse has sometimes been cited ""... a melon for pure ecstasy"" or even ""... a goat for pure ecstasy."" Kind of hilarious.

I was just wondering what y'all thought about this. Regardless of how you feel about homosexuality and pederasty, it seems that it does reflect some red pill thinking, that women are more trouble romantically than they're worth. 

Is such a perverse (to my viewpoint) attitude the ultimate result of too much red pill philosophy?

No one winds up in the ""manosphere"" because things are going well. That's a great thing, because we all become bonded by the pain of lost loves. Your favorite EC, vanguard, mod or pointed user all suffered similar to you. They were as weak as you are, and that fact is dangerous. 

When your realize the strongest men you know where once as weak as you, then the liberation of yourself has commenced. Everyone is right about the coming revolution, but what they fail to realize is that we're already fighting it now. It is no joke when I say love your brothers more than your sisters, for it is in the arms of your crying brothers and sons where one can find solace in death.

In other words, when you cry infront of a true male friend, he will embrace your sorrows as his own, and when the tears cease, he will raise you high above ever feeling that pain again. **But you must climb!** Every man here has been wounded on the battlefield, and there are only so many doctors. That means if you've suffered minor injuries then it is your duty to keep fighting. I can honestly say without a shadow of a doubt I love everyone. I extend honest human empathy to every man and woman I meet, and they can count on my brotherhood or friendship until they cross me. 

It's hard. The truth is the only way to live is to suffer. For all that is worth anything we must pay the price. Men are the true romantics. If you cannot cry among friends, you are not among friends. Women are intelligent, beautiful, simple creatures. Opportunists at heart, they only want what's best for them. So they look to the men around them to define who, how, why, and what is the best.

So they default to the behavior of the rest of the society. It's not suprising really, in the animal kingdom you're way more likely to die if you're different. The safe route is to be like everyone else.

It's a trade off though, that not too many people realize: you gain safety, but lose individuality.

See, authenticity makes you, you. So when you give it up, you become the same as everyone else, which means you're doing things you don't really want to do.  
It can mean that you're studying law, because your parents were laywers.  
Or maybe you're preparing to get married at the age of 21.  


You can't truly be an authentic individual if you don't know who you are. That's why it's important to get to know yourself by simply asking ""do I really want to do X?""

""Do I really want to study law?""  
""Do I really want to get married?""

These kind of questions can be scary and no wonder, answers to those questions can potentially turn our lives upside down. 

That's why I feel like it's better to start small, with things that can't make or break your life.

Next time you hear that ""happy wife - happy life"", or how ""adulting"" is hard, or that Mondays are shitty and you feel like you need to laugh, just to be polite and to conform - ask yourself:

The other night my FWB hit me with the ""I just can't do this anymore"" talk. An hour later, she was charley horsing on my dick and swallowing my babies.

*The cast*:

Myself: 23, 15+ n-count
A: FWB, 22, serial cheater, 15+ n-count

Both A and I have known each other for 5 years - strictly friends for about the first 3. It wasn't until after a couple threesomes last summer with my LTR at the time that A was promoted to FWB. Since then, we've been seeing each other and having sex on and off for about a year and a half.

*Body*: 

After spending the whole day fucking around zip-lining, we went back to her place to unwind with some drinks. 

A pint of bourbon and bottle of wine later, we're both laying atop one another on the couch. It's at this point that she always begins with her bombardment of both shit and comfort tests.

Her favorite one that she's been hitting me with lately is ""I love you but I just can't do this friends with benefits thing anymore"". 

Lo and behold, that's the exact card she pulls on me for like the 25th time. 

Typically, I'll pretend I don't hear her and force her to sit in silence. Doing this always ends with her changing the conversation, rambling on about whatever and us fucking like animals.

This time though, I decided to throw her hamster for a spin by responding with ""look, that's fine. You just won't be the girl I have sex with then"".  

It's at this moment the no-huddle, air raid offense of shit and comfort tests begin.

""I love you"", ""I'm just so confused"", ""I haven't seen anyone other than you for the past 6 months"", ""I'm not interested in anyone right now"", ""I know at this point in my life I should be okay with a friends with benefits"", ""I just don't have my shit together like you"", ""why do you still stick around for me"", ""thank you for never judging me despite my past"", ""I don't know what we are"", ""I can't keep having sex with you if we're just going to be friends with benefits""

Below are some of my responses - verbatim:

""I love you as a person and I enjoy all the experiences and time we spend together""

""Look, that's totally fine. I don't want you to feel like I'm entitled to sex with you. But, you're also not entitled to my commitment""

""If I'm not getting my physical needs met by you then someone else will do that for me. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy spending my time with you""

""We can be exclusive, but, you cannot fuck anyone else, suck anyone else's dick, hangout with someone you have fucked, sucked off, knows wants to fuck you or that you've ever wanted to fuck""

""I'm glad that you haven't been seeing other people, it means you might be worth it""

""If you don't want to follow my guidelines then someone else will""

""Look, A, there's nothing confusing about what I'm saying it's black and white. You're just not used to someone being so honest with you""

""I don't need to lie to get in your pants""

""I don't want to lose you in my life, but, if the situation demands it I'll disappear""

After our little debate, we watch some TV, she asks to ""take [her] pants off in the most nonsexual way possible"", we hook-up and I nail her from behind right in the living room.

*Conclusions*:

1. Proceed as normal

Disregard what she's saying and continue doing what you were doing or planning on doing anyway.

2. Emotion is fine, infact, it's needed.

I've been lurking this subreddit for the past 3 years and have seen a lot of shit regarding this. The bottom line is it's ok to show emotion/BP traits, **whatever you call it**, as long as you are strategic and have an iron grip on them.

&amp;#x200B;

TD:LR

**Monday:** Biceps, Triceps, Shoulders, Legs, each 5 sets, to FAILURE, adjust weight for 8-12 rep range, 3 min Pause between sets,

**Tuesday:** Chest, Lats, each 5 sets, to FAILURE, adjust weight for 8-12 rep range, 3 min Pause between sets,

**Wednesday:** see Monday

**Thursday:** see Tuesday

**Friday:** see Monday

**Saturday:** see Tuesday

**Sunday:** Rest

&amp;#x200B;

These days everybody wants to sell you their special training program, promising miraculous result. But you don’t have to have a fancy training routine that will cost you lots of money. All you really need is discipline and heavy weights.  

I will explain all the FAQ below.

**Why the two-day split?**

Doing your whole body each day is not only time consuming, but also doesn’t give your body enough rest. So, by doing each muscle every second day it gets around 48h of rest, which is enough. If you don’t feel good with a routine like that you a do for example a 3-day routine like this: Monday routine, Tuesday routine, Rest day, repeat. 

**Why can’t I do biceps and lats on the same day?**

I split up the muscle groups in this way because some muscles interfere with each other. For example, while a wide grip bench press is considered a chest exercise a close grip is for the triceps. Therefore, training biceps and Lat the same day is not good because, you make your muscle tired before even working it.

**What exercise should I do?**

Generally, take the exercise in which you can really feel the muscle and in which you can isolate it. Compound movements are important as well, so don’t only isolate muscles. My personal favorites:

Chest: Bench press

Lat: Lat pulldown

Shoulder: Lateral raises, mostly hitting the rear delts to make shoulder round and big

Biceps: Dumbbell Curl

Triceps: Triceps pushdown (with cable)

Legs: Squats

**How to warm up**

I warm up by doing the chosen exercise with relatively low weight for a lot of reps, to warm up the area I will be working. I do this for 2 sets, the second set being with a bit more weight and the third being then the first working set.

**Talking about weight how much should I take?**

This is something I can not tell you that you have to just try out. Start of with really low weight (like just the bar) to warm up, then start adding more and counting reps to FAILURE. If you hit 12 reps to failure, add more weight. 

**You talk about training to FAILURE, what does this mean?**

Training to FAILURE means that you rep so long that you die of agony and pain. And I literally mean agony and pain. If you just rep until you are tired, you will never make any gains. You have to understand that you only grow if you make your body go over its limits, and this only happens when you train to failure.

**Why 8-12 reps?**

That’s just science. You grow the most between 6 and 12, but 6 is getting sort of low, so doing 8-12 is being on the safer side.

**Sensei, what should I eat?**

There are basically two options for you: Low Carb or Low Fat, both have advantages, but both definitely focus on getting a lot of protein, so that’s what you should be number one priority. There is a Table on each food product with the amount of protein, sugar and fat. Always look at it and compare products, that way you will make out which are good to eat and which are not. Generally, meat is good, fish (THUNA!!!) and milk products (beware of the fatty ones tho). 

**How much should I eat?**

This depends on your Bodyfat level, but I suggest using this calculator to calculate it: https://www.custommealplanner.com

**I have more questions.**

Good, reply to the post, or pm me\*.

\*If the question is good I will make a post about it.

I once made a comment about my experience 

I won the lottery and was born with good facial structure, am 6'1 and was always smart and witty. But thing is, even despite all these factors, I was slouchy, tiny, eternally friendzoned, feminine looking, women respecting, white knighting, alpha hating idiot. I always wondered why the fuck even despite all the attention I was getting from woman, I never managed to get laid. See, back then I had no clue I was actually beta-orbiter of almost every girl I knew

Then I met her: tall, feminine girl. She was around 25 at the time (4 years older than me btw), was the big shit in the city and was just looking great. Long hair, tight black dress, sporty body and longest legs I've ever seen paired with some classy heels. I was fucking amazed. My beta brain went into overdrive and all I could think of whole next week was her. I found her on IG, but I thought I diDn'T dEsErVe HeR at the time. Yeah, I know.

I started lifting religiously, dressing better, and just spent every moment of my life bettering myself just to get a chance to drink water from her bathtub. As I got bigger and better looking, I started getting a lot of IOIs from girls, but I ignored the fuck out of them because I was simply so concentrated on her that I was literally blind about things around me. I distanced myself from my friends and family, from my hobbies and from anything that wasn't gym or job.

Around two years later, there I was. Shredded, stylish, and eager to meet her. I knew where she used to hang from her instagram profile and I was ready to tear shit up. Funny thing is that when I accidentally stumbled upon her on the street I was literally about to shit myself. My heartbeat went crazy, I got paralyzed and my whole self-confidence shattered into tiny little pieces. I still had balls to approach her and was amazed how she gave me her number considering how shitty the approach was.

Couple of days later, I was sitting in a restaurant with her. She was wearing another tight dress, some sexy heels and was just looking amazing. I felt like the fucking champion. I never felt something like this before. Two years of dedication, struggling and pain finally paid off, but here's the funniest thing. I had an epiphany: **I was finally on a date with my dream unicorn girl.** I even had the chance to have sex with her, after all those days of being a friendzoned incel. But all I could think of was that she wasn't anything special. At all. She was just like any other girl I've met. I didn't even know what made me feel the way I felt about her back in the day. I wasn't listening to her stories, because the voice in my head telling me that I was an idiot was so loud. The comedown I've felt was the most painful thing ever. I lost my friends, I abandoned my hobbies, spent less time with my family. And all this simply because of some girl who didn't even know about my existence. I was on a date with her, finally, but I had nothing in my life now, except for that shitty empty feeling in my stomach. And I felt stupidly empty and dumb, almost like I died inside because my whole fucking world flipped on it's head.

Now I'm kinda glad about that it happenned, for sure. Especially after I found red pill later and everything got clear. But the main point is take lessons from my mistakes, folks.

 After 1:30min waiting in a tail and 3 murderous look thrown by menopausal woman after my refusal to give them my place (no one love waiting for hours, man or woman).  My turn is finally coming. 
I give my stack of documents to the official, a woman about 30 years old.  Who verifies if the photocopies are conform to the originals and after that buffered my photocopies.  And ask me for some coins.  I did not have coins just paper money .  So I propose to go and make the coins in a traditional guitar shop near and come back and she agrees.  
I go there, make my change and come back to the  office, I pay and she give me  my legalized photocopies . 
 I wait for her to give me the rest of my documents, I wait 3s-5s-10s then she say to me dubiously, ""it's good sir it's over"" .  Except that she did not give me the originals just the photocopies.  I report it to her and after a quick shuffling of her desk with her eyes, tell me that  she had already handed me all the documents, photocopies and originals.The Hell.  I kept my calm and told her not by showing her the documents she gave me that I still had in hand, but she cut me off curtly, raising her voice and reaffirming me that she had me beautiful and  Well delivered all the documents, the original when I was going to get some change and photocopies at the moment, so it was up to me to remember where I put them because she  had done well her work .  The Old B *tch.  I made the silence for two seconds while maintaining visual contact with her (not to seem threatening or otherwise it's just a mechanism that I put in place to keep my cool and control what I say facing certain events)  then slide my hand into the slit in the glass that separates us, at this moment she make a movement of retreat towards the back as to avoid an attack.  I lift the big binder on her desk, the binder down which she slipped my original documents before I went to find the change.  And smiling, say ""they are here, can you give them to me please"". 
 The rest of the story is quite easy to guess, she apologizes, accuses the fatigue of work, etc.  I retrieve my documents and put them in my bag, while nodding at her apologies .  Then I salute and take my way. 
 If I had not bothered to notify where she had left my documents before I went to get some money I might have lost my original birth certificate and many of my diblomes today.

With this post, I will expose a point of view I have developed for some times, and which I think will help us to be more precise, more in-dept in our definition of the world and of the male / female dynamic. This post is a work in progress, but I could use some peer review.

TLDR: A dimension is lacking in TRP view of the male/female dynamic, leading to limit the possibilities for men to grow and understanding of the world.

# CORE CONCEPT

In our literature, we often use alpha and beta as two opposing concepts in every situation. This leads to confusion and sometimes even to poor understanding of the situation because we are mixing two concepts:

Alpha and beta as a hierarchy.

And

Alpha and beta as sexuality.

**Alpha and beta as a hierarchy.**

\&gt; The social alpha is a reliable, strong man. Well-balanced, he is a leader of man. He has a mission, he has values, he knows what he wants and takes the actions to get it. He is happy about his life and who he is. Men and women are attracted to this man for those qualities.

\&gt; The social beta is a weak-minded man. He is adaptable, because he prefers to please than to be pleased, but still get a lot of frustration out of it. He is influenceable, and accept to be walked over. He is unhappy and feels like a victim. Men and women ignore him for those reasons.

**Alpha and beta as a sexuality**

\&gt; The sexual alpha is a masculine man. At ease with his masculinity and sexuality, he wants women for their femininity and sexuality. He approaches women in a sexual manner.

\&gt; The sexual beta is a feminine man. He is uneasy with his masculinity and his sexuality, and buys in the “men and women have the same desires/needs” bullshit. He approaches women in an asexual manner, often pretending his interest are not sexual.

Alpha and beta are the 2 opposites of a spectrum. A man’s position in this spectrum varies during his life, due to his experiences and knowledge of himself and the world. No one is always alpha, and no one is always beta.

Those concepts are used without discernment in today’s manosphere literature, which leads to sometimes poor advices like:

\&gt; “Alphas have a status, they get rich”. But the wife still bangs the pool boy.

\&gt; “Alphas do not provide, paying for sex is beta”. But the girl still leaves when she understands she can’t build her future with you.

It is in the hope of a better understanding for everyone (including myself) that I wrote this, and want to discuss it with the community.

# FOUR ARCHETYPES

If we accept that alpha and beta are not a one-dimension concept (you are either alpha or beta), but a two-dimensions concept as described earlier, we obtain a table with 4 archetypes.

**Hierarchical alpha / sexual alpha : the Alpha**

The Alpha is exciting. He is at ease in social event, talk confidently, flirt openly. He does not feel the need to brag or to put his life on display. Women don’t know a lot about him, and are attracted to him. The Alpha has a lot of success and he enjoys it, entertaining multiple plates. But if the door of his bedroom is open, the Alpha’s life has not place for commitment. He likes doing his own things, going his own way. Women are a side-dish to his life. After having sex with the Alpha for sometimes, women leave, knowing they won’t be able to obtain the support they need to create and raise a family. The Alpha can be a contributing member of the society, but it is rarely his focus.

Example: Alpha as described by TRP.

**Hierarchical beta / sexual alpha : the Omega**

The Omega is a social and sexual reject, but he is mostly okay with it (or so he says). He has accepted that his life will be one of a lonely follower, and he does not wish to take the steps to change that, convinced it would not lead to success anyway. When he gets lucky with a girl, he does not wish to commit.

Example: Incel, MGTOW.

**Hierarchical alpha / sexual beta : the Father**

The Father is the cornerstone of society, and the defender of his owns. He is a leader of men, respects himself and people who he thinks deserve it. His approval means a lot to his social circle, and his friendship is made to last. He wants a family, and looks for women who will deserve his commitment. He does not tolerate bad behaviour, and punishes it with retrieval of his commitment. Thus his friends / women / children treat him respect. Securing a Father is women most grandiose success in life. 

Example: 

**Hierarchical beta / sexual beta : the Beta**

The Beta is a Father wannabe. He wants sexuality and commitment so much he is ready to sacrifice everything, even what he is, to that purpose. People does not respect him for his lack of value and frame. As do women. Women who were not capable of securing a father will often fall back on a beta, without feeling love or respect for him. They will fault, cheat, behave poorly, and the Beta will excuse it all. Women will still try to have sex with an Alpha or a Father on the side.

Example: Beta as described by TRP.

The four archetypes are exactly that: archetypes. No one is exactly on of them. The archetypes are the four corners of a box inside which we all evolve. Poorly drawn representation here: [https://imgur.com/7b1Xosx](https://imgur.com/7b1Xosx)

# BODY

Today’s TRP is reaching the limit of how much it can science the fuck out of the relationship, and my opinion is because it is confusing hierarchical and sexual concepts. This leads to the following:

\&gt; A lot of men following TRP rapidly understand that spinning plates is not a long term fulfilling solution, and are then alone to figure out how to grow out of it.

\&gt; On one side, TRP says AWALT and hypergamy, and on the other side to vet women. If committing is beta, you can’t be alpha in a relationship.

\&gt; Previous generations, where feminine imperative was less powerful, a lot of men were capable of having families and life-long relationship. However, they were committed to their family and wives (example in islam: as much wives as you can provide for). It is my hypothesis that those men were closer to the Father than the Alpha.

# CONCLUSION

The Father and the Omega are not overtly recognised today by TRP, which is a lack in my opinion.

#### Don’t spill your emotions
Spilling your emotional issues about your dad/mom/work whoever is bad advice, this is TRP 101. If you need to vent, talk to a trusted male friend. Make sure when you’re done, that you ask yourself “Ok, how do I solve this”. Nothing wrong with talking to your buddy to get shit off your chest and coming up with a solution. There’s a difference between expressing a real frustration/concern/problem then finding a solution, and just pure bitching about the randomness of the world that you don’t like, aka wine parties for women.

#### A womans world revolves around emotions, nothing else
Assuming you’ve shut your mouth and read the whole sidebar, three times, you will already know that women are ruled by their emotions, again TRP 101. That’s the reason they put on six different shirts that look the same, spend hours on their hair just for the wind to fuck it up, or gossip about stuff that have absolutely nothing to do with them. It makes them **FEEL** good. Their emotions rule literally everything. The core advice of giving her a dose of random emotions on your first date or some dread in an LTR takes advantage of this fact. When they feel so many emotions, especially in short bursts like a date, it drives them wild with attraction because in their mind you are one of those chill guys that just “get it”.

Think of their emotional state as a volume knob(eh) from 1 to 10. We’ll call it the **FEELZ-VOLUME-KNOB(eh), or FVK**. As you progress during your date that knob gets turned to 9 (laugh her ass off), to maybe a 3 (sad story about your dog that died) back to an 8 (picking her up, spinning her and kissing her) all through the night. This emotional roller coaster builds her attraction for you which leads to fucking later. 

#### Don't fuck up her FVK with incongruent behaviour
Advice about mitigating the risk of a false accusation by sending the morning after text, going for a coffee or breakfast where you’re seen in public having a good time, is all standard here.  

The common theme from the false accusation stories we read about is that the girl either regretted the sex the morning after or someone found out and she **FEELS** shame, then bailing by saying she was raped to look like a victim ruining a guy’s life. That would never have happened in the majority of cases in my opinion if the guy 1) shut his mouth about who he’s fucking and 2) the girl’s **FEELINGS** were still turned up high and the impression of the guy was still “overall he’s good and chill” in her mind. It can’t be stressed enough that the key to you enjoying your sex life with girls who are consenting and willing is you making sure you don’t fuck up your impression she has of you by making her **FEEL** like a slut with incongruent behaviour.

Let’s use the example of the short period after you fucked. You spent hours (maybe minutes if you’re mr thundersmoothtalker you beast) being charming, funny, cocky, playful and making her comfortable with you while building rapport for her to follow your lead to sex. If you have this idea in your mind that you need to be “alphadogthundercock” by immediately getting up and bolting, or kicking her out, then you’re risking fucking up all the good **FEELZ** you built up with her and your incongruent behaviour will trigger her to regret what she did because you’re breaking the impression she has of you.  

There’s nothing wrong with laying down, sweaty, her head on your chest, and talking for a few minutes. Like u/amphix339 said, don’t spill your emotional baggage. Lead the conversation, leave hook points and ask open ended questions to let her spill her guts. All you have to do is lay there, nod, say huh-uh a few times and share a meaningless fact before leading her into talking again. You won’t die, and go to Valhalla, for spending 15min relaxing and chatting with her no matter how much you want to get out of there.  

Your behaviour needs to be congruent. You still have to be be the same funny, cocky, charming guy that gave her all those **FEELZ**. Her **FVK** is still turned up, she thinks you’re a cool chill guy, and she will be left with a good impression about fucking you. That’s why it’s emphasized that you develop your true self and not fake everything for the sake of pussy. To be a grounded, stable, funny, charming and cocky man should be who you really are and not a facade.  

#### One tool to use after you drilled for oil
This is not a hard rule but I’ve found that leaving her to decide if she’s leaving/you leaving or staying over is better than you rolling the dice and telling her to leave, or making up some excuse that will clearly be obvious that you just came for the fucking. You risk fucking up her **FEELZ** about what she just did and she’ll feel like a slut. Regret will set in and your risk of an accusation just shot up into the air. You will survive if this ONS sleeps over and you get a coffee in the morning, or you crashing and leaving in the morning after you guys chatted some more (your behaviour stays congruent) over breakfast at some cafe.  

If you leave her **FEELZ-VOLUME-KNOB(eh)** turned up a bit and the impression she has of you is positive, then you just mitigated unnecessary risk that could potentially work against you.

I thought about some of my employees where I work. I started to divide them up, and understand what I liked about the ones I do like. Notice, every one of these people are very subtle in their actions, except for one...

There is Mike. I like Mike. He is a hard worker. He is honest (for the most part, but even when he lies, it is in this very innocent way), and has pretty great intentions. If I give a problem to Mike, he will get it done and usually won’t try to sneak out of the problem. I like Mike because he gets shit done and lessens my stress level. I can dump work on Mike (that I know he can handle), and consider it done. Mike is probably my favorite person because I see myself in him. Meaning, he is as anal retentive as I am. If I give something to Mike, I don’t have to ask another question about it, it’s covered.


There is Ryan. I like Ryan. Ryan makes me feel good about myself. When we walk out of a meeting, he will usually look at me and say, “You killed it!” Ryan boosts my ego, and I really don’t mind. Ryan is one of those guys who always knows what to say. I ask if I losing muscle, he laughs and says, “No, you look great!” I say I am going to do something ballsy like steal customers from the competitor, Ryan asks me how. Then, Ryan asks how he can help.


There is Michelle. Michelle watches my child whenever I have an outing or something to do on the weekend. She will take her without any notice (I mean 5 minutes beforehand) at all and has on about 10 occasions. 


There is John. John is my unofficial deputy and gets treated as such. What this means, is that I gave John the same power I have. In return, John picks up the slack. For example, if I am on vacation, John will act as me, and the world keeps on moving. If I can’t make it to a meeting, John shows. Which means I showed up, only not as handsome that day. I introduce everyone to John as my deputy. John feels good about this.


Then, there is me. What value did I provide them that makes them so desperately want to provide value to me? I gave all of these people jobs. I gave them the job title they wanted, and the salary they desired. Ironically, I had known them all from different walks of life or other settings, prior to them being hired by me where I work.


But, there is one last person I want to tell you about, it’s Chris. I don’t like Chris, personally. He makes everything very difficult. When we have a project, Chris is the guy yapping away about how it’s not done and why. Chris talks the longest during meetings. Most of the time, I cut him off and ask questions that will shut him up. He is a giant time waster. Chris always seems to have a problem. Chris is really smart, but can’t get out of his own way. He doesn’t have things in common with anyone else. Most of all, Chris is insecure. He has to 1 up every single person he talks to. If I show Chris something, he feels obligated to show me something even better. If I tell Chris something, he has to tell me something even better.

Our society has been indoctrinated and that female imperative conditioning runs deep. I was considering getting a vasectomy due to my recent success spinning multiple plates and approaching peak SMV. 

I still would want a kid some day so of course I could put some on ice in sperm bank. Then an errant though crossed my mind. Suppose they mixed up my sample with someone else's. Well of course I'd stay and raise the kid with her.... wait what the fuck.

 Immediately after the thought crossed my mind I had a moment of insight and self reflection. I recognized it for it was, a socially indoctrinated moral intending to serve the female imperative. Even if I had designated this as someone I would raise a child with why do I owe her anything, that is what the settlement money is for, they are the ones who wronged her. Nonetheless I would be shamed by society.

How to be a neckbeard incel 101:

**1.** **Stop taking care of yourself**

Don't shave your neck. Don't pluck your eyebrows, and don't cut your ""stray hair"" from birthmarks. Never, under any circumstance, wash your face. Forget about having a job. Who needs that anyway? Forget taxes, you don't have any income so you shouldn't bother. Showers of any kind are prohibited, unless it's like once a week. Eat junk food, snack around all day, and put on these extra pounds, or if you're skinny, ignore any signs of hunger you still have. Ask your mom(better yet, grandma) to buy your clothes, and don't bother with matching them. You can shave your face, but never shave your neck. That's the only good thing you can do for yourself. You're a neckbeard, you're supposed to be like that.

**2. Stop taking care of your environment**

Don't do any chores at all. Screw laundry. Have your mom do it. Don't bother. When you have nothing clean to wear, go with dirty clothes. When someone asks you to do something(except your oneitis), say ""f\*ck off"" or ""i don't have time for that"". Don't listen to your parents.

**3. LARP on the Internet**

come to The Red Pill forum and LARP here. Say you're rich Batman like entrepneur knight warrior slayer. Lie that you passively earn 6 figures and work as a computer engineer as part time job. Everybody likes that! Brag, be narcissistic, without any way or form to back yourself up. Hell, you've slain a dragon. Don't forget that you lift(see below) twice a month and you're ""stronger than ever"". Congratulations dude. 

**4. Hobbies and activities**

Don't bother with going out. You have no chance anyway, so why bother? Watching anime, video games and maybe maybe maybe some netflix is alright. Also you can LARP on the Internet and tell everyone how tough you are. Also, in multiplayer games and this sub you absolutely must act all toxic, call everyone a noob/nerd/incel/scrawny. Don't lift, except maybe twice a month, and use these 2 days as a ""proof"" you can LARP in this sub with. Also, sleep. But during the day, because you'll be gaming during the night.

**5. Act all out autistic**

Be dumb. Never think, just do how you feel. Always ask people to repeat themselves. Don't pay attention, because paying attention is bothersome anyway. Don't be interested in other people. Forget having friends. Also, forget what people said. Bomb your group chats of the people you know in the internet with stupid questions and even more stupid memes. If you're introverted, just don't talk to people, and if you're an extrovert, get obnoxious and annoy people with stupid questions and statements. And under any circumstance only tell the truth, because your parents told you lying is bad, no matter how badly you messed up somewhere. Be nervous, anxious and depressed around people. And sometimes be hyperexcited, laughing like Joker. Make sure everyone knows something is wrong with you. Freeze up your body language, too. And don't forget to be Captain Obvious.

**6. Develop oneitis**

Develop oneitis for some good looking hoe who is only looking good now, and after a year her mouth will be swole from the 10 cocks she got at the same time from the Chad's gang bang. Bonus points if she's a feminist SJW, pro-LGBT SJW, a liberal or obnoxious vegan activist. More bonus points if she had her hair dyed in colors like purple, blue or green. Message her everyday with the low effort ""hi beautiful xoxo"" or ""how r u?"" messages. Confess love immediately. If you follow steps 1, 4 and 5, you probably won't even be in the friend zone, but rather in acquaintance zone. Bonus points if you just open it up with a dick pic. Also send a daily ""you're beautiful"" reminder. And ask her out and get rejected(well, in most cases). You can also complain to her to your problems at your imaginary ""job"" at mcdonalds and about feeling lonely all the time. Also if she asks you some favor do it. She's your queen remember? Oh, if you end up not being rejected, always get her flowers, chocolate and pay for the dinner.

**7. Be negative.**

Complain about how lonely you are. Complain about low paychecks. Complain about weather. Complain about being rejected, complain about having no friends. Just be negative all the time. Put people down and destroy the vibe. Since you're not responsibe for anything now, you can forget all the tasks you've been given. Act like asshole in general(step 5)

Before I came across this sub, I was under the impression that if you showed a woman that you would love her and provide for her that she would value you more than someone who didn’t love her and wouldn’t care. This is wrong. The opposite is true. Here’s why:

**Body:** 

Women want to optimize their chances of having successful offspring. In order to do this, they select a mate (or mates) who has the best chance of producing successful offspring. The best way of choosing this mate is to find someone they perceive to be better than them in every way. They cannot be attracted to someone they believe is below them. 

However, women cannot trust what men say because men lie.  If all it took to sleep with a woman was to tell her that you were the shit, then this sub wouldn’t exist. 

As a result, women are constantly assessing a man’s actions and the way he carries himself. They are constantly checking for *Honest Signals* that a man is what he claims to be. Honest Signals are the qualities a man *unintentionally* reveals about himself to a woman about himself. They are qualities that are not easily faked, and thus she can use them to determine whether or not she should associate with a man. (Note: This concept is not mine, it is Todd V’s) 

A few Honest Signals include:
* How he looks 
* How he speaks and what he chooses to say
* How he handles resistance (shit tests) 
* How he takes care of himself (grooming + fitness)
* How other men and other women interact with him (do they respect him?) 
* Most importantly: How he spends his time (what does he value?) 

The most important (and most honest) of these bullet points is: how we spend our time. Our time is the only finite resource we have.  We can fake our looks, we can read pickup lines, but we cannot fake how we spend our time. As a result, by showing how we spend our time, we reveal what we value and thus who we truly are. 

What we learn from this is that if you immediately respond to a girls’ texts, text multiple times, pick up every call, double checking to make sure that she’s arriving at a certain time, you’re revealing to her that you care more about her than she cares about you. 

The Principle of Least interest states that those who care the least have the most power. If you care more about someone than they care about you, you’re the bitch in the relationship. The key to being perceived as better than them is to: 

Limit Your Attention by focusing on shit that isn’t them. 

Lift, Read, Build something, talk to other women - it doesn’t matter. If you spend too much time on them, you’ll prove to them that they are more valuable than the other things in your life. 

As the great Patrice O’Neal once said “A bitch don’t want to be your #1 priority.” Operate accordingly. 

**TL;DR:** You subtly reveal who you are based on your behavior. Show her that she isn't the best thing in your life.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Honest Signals: Why Caring Kills Attraction,0,1570639514.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/df2m79/honest_signals_why_caring_kills_attraction/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

He always used to get chicks back then and I assumed he still does today. We start talking and he tells me he has been married twice, not never again!

Me being the buddy I am decided to feel him about and see if he was familiar with the ideas we discuss here. Right away he tells me that he loves to fuck 40 year old women. I thought that was odd and quickly realized he is still a blue pilled cuck. No worries I sent him a link and told him to check it out when he gets a chance. I honestly just wanted to give him some food for thought. 

A few weeks later I reach out and ask if he had a chance to read. He tells me that ""it's cool but when politics get involved he has to check out."" Then I knew he did not even bother to check the link I gave him. 

Fast forward another week and it comes up again. This time however, he is a bit more hostile and tells me that he is not an incel and does not need to read it. He then goes on to defend his love of 40 year old women. 

I told him I can respect whatever he chooses but that fucking 40 year old women does not make him some sort of ladies man. His anger began to rise and he starts to tell me how he uses these old ladies to give him money and make him feel good. 

Wow. Using old women for their money? What a guy. I simply tried to explain to him that a 40 year old woman is not as desired as a 25 year old women and not surprisingly, he took it offensively. He took it as me attacking his way of life when my intentions were to just provide him with some information and maybe give him some perspective. 

Now I get it, if you like old ladies then hey, knock yourself out. 

He said the red pill was for incels. I tried to explain to him that I am not, and have never been an incel and that the red pill is more about understanding how a woman's mind is wired. He simply did not want to hear it or even consider it just because it went against everything he knows and believes. 

The worst part is, my intentions were only to open his mind and say hey, fuck who you want, but know tht reaching for the low hanging fruit is not going to be as rewarding as getting the cream of the crop. To each his own, but know that exposing the truth to a blue pilled friend will result in a bruised ego and a very defensive attitude. 

He actually told me I sounded stupid and to never say this again. I took a long shot thinking this guy would be open minded to some new ideas.

This shit is raw, straight from my journal, and exactly what went through my head. 

&amp;#x200B;

Intro:

&amp;#x200B;

Since exploring many things I struggled with years ago, I have actually made them come to fruition years later. As a result, and now that I have made it through quitting these bad habits (some as long as 24 months ago) and starting new great ones, I decided to break out my journal and share with you what I learned, and discard the things that did not work for me. At the time of quitting, I didn’t find something so inclusive. There wasn’t some step by step guide for me to understand how I could quit these terrible things. Instead, there was just a shit load of people telling me that I should quit.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background... when I say I struggled with these bad habits, I mean I really struggled. I wanted so bad for these things to be gone from my life when I first started after them, but I couldn’t quite get it. I had the best intentions, but tried and failed for so long. Again and again and again. It wasn’t until time had passed, my strength had increased, and I tried so many things that I was able to easily quit all of these things and transform myself. This series will pinpoint exactly how I made this transformation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Body: 

&amp;#x200B;

A quick note: I am not telling anyone here what to do or that this is the way you have to do it, you all know yourselves best. Instead, I am sharing my experience with you so that you can take with it what you please. 

&amp;#x200B;

Quitting these things we call ‘bad’:

&amp;#x200B;

You have to realize, it is much more important what you should NOT do, then it is what you do. What this means in a nutshell is that if you’re spending your time playing video games, it isn’t necessary to replace this habit with the healthiest thing a person can think of. What it means is that you just need to quit video games. Part of this is that you will become bored once you do quit. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I quit watching TV near bedtime, there was a couple weeks where bedtime came around, and I was sitting on my couch. I sat there thinking to myself, “What the fuck do I do?” I didn’t want to read a book or anything at this point because I was fighting off this urge to not watch TV. I actually just sat there staring into space each for for a couple of weeks, feeling sad there wasn’t TV. Then, after some time had passed, I wanted to read a book out of pure boredom. My point is that it is much more important for you not to do these terrible things, than it is to worry about what you will do… that will come. Once you get rid of the bad, it is ironic to see what it forces you into. For now, keep your mind on quitting the thing, don’t worry about what you will do instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about Monk Mode almost always. Not about doing it, but about the theory behind it. This time of isolation. What I came to realize is that Monk Mode is not the best solution for me because it takes you away from your natural habitat. It can be a helpful route for some. However, an even better solution is to ultimately create a life for yourself and set it in stone. In other words, to stop indulging altogether and give these things up that are bad. To do so while keeping yourself in your natural environment. Now you are fighting temptation head on and transforming yourself into something different. 

&amp;#x200B;

There came a point where I asked myself, “Why do I waste energy flopping between quitting something and indulging in it?” it was a nowhere road that ultimately stopped me from really progressing forward. I realized it was time to change things altogether. I wanted to become SUSTAINABLE in my natural environment. Instead of removing myself, just to get pushed back into the world and start the cycle all over again several months later.

&amp;#x200B;

Bottom line, anything you’re not in control of needs to go. What does this mean? Can you go out and have one or two drinks, then not drink again for a whole month and not even notice it? Cool. But, why are you drinking at all is an even better question? Mostly, what I saw in myself was a bunch of excuses. But I saw this in shit tons of other people also. I saw people who would drink their booze, tell me how they didn’t really need it and they “could quit right now”. Then, the next day, drink again. It was bullshit. It was how they justified it to themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I didn’t realize yet, is that I should quit these ‘bad things’ forever. The truth is, I was never really in control if I kept going back. Why did I need these things in my life at all if they weren’t productive? I was also worried I wouldn’t always be as strong as I am now, and in this particular mindset. What I mean is, I was worried I would justify it to a means of no end, where I just accepted these ‘bad things’ as part of my life. But, knowing how habits work, if I quit permanently, even later on when I may become weak, going back would be very unlikely. That is because habits don’t like to go, they like to stay. So, creating habits that were healthy for life, would ultimately be the most sustainable thing I could do.

&amp;#x200B;

Some other things I realized: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. When I did give in or cheat a little, it always made going back to harder. If I drank a little tonight, it made drinking a little in a few days much easier. It felt kind of like I was starting the game over from a save point over and over again, rather than just finishing the game through to the end.

&amp;#x200B;

2. I don’t really know what it was that gave me the ability to ultimately quit everything. I honestly cannot pinpoint it. I read a book called “Habits” by Charles Duhigg. When I did, I remember him mentioning a woman at the start who completely changed her whole life, this sort of chain reaction began to happen. So where it was really hard for me to quit originally, it became very easy some time down the road and all the bad habits at once begun to compound.

&amp;#x200B;

3. There was a stage where I finally decided to quit these things and never go back. I came to realize it was the only way… I hadn’t really quit anything by this time, but once I thought on it for a while, I knew what I needed to do. There was probably a yearlong period where I knew it had to be lights out for all of this shit.

&amp;#x200B;

4. After coming to accept that it would be forever, I did quit them one at a time. Whereas back when I tried to do everything at once, it was almost out of fear or desperation. I wanted to get rid of the bad, and I was worried that I would not stay on track to quit all of the things I wanted, so I thought to myself there was no other way to do it. I thought I had to do it all at once. 

&amp;#x200B;

5. However, the second I started to take each of these habits one at a time, they began to all be quit easily. I didn’t give it a predetermined amount of time, they naturally fell off one at a time. However, after looking back at my journal, there was about 6 weeks of gap between each.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Very important: The things that were most difficult to quit began to easily be quit once I changed a couple of things. Changing my sleep schedule to ensure I was well rested made quitting everything else easy. Changing my diet, was the other one. If I had to give advice to anyone, it would be to start by changing my sleep schedule first.

&amp;#x200B;

7. You should lump your habits into groups. I think writing them all down is crucial. 

&amp;#x200B;

8. You have to get over that speedbump first, then it gets really easy. You begin to gain confidence and momentum. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the order in which you should quit things:

&amp;#x200B;

Note: If at any time you revert back and fuck up on a step, you need to go back to that step and fix it. Do not press forward or move up a step until you have it down. Enough time needs to pass (this will be different for each person, it could be a month, it could be 6, but you will know for sure in your gut when you get there) that you are confident in yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other important note: If you are already kinda doing some of these things, that is great. But, don’t go and change any part of those things. If you do half ass lifts or aren’t pushing yourself, that is fine. When you get to step III you address that. Don’t go intermingling the steps. If you are watching porn, keep going until it becomes that things turn to be quit.

&amp;#x200B;

0. Create a spreadsheet. On this spreadsheet, list out everything you hate about yourself. First, you’re going to create two separate groups. One is about you, and the other is about what you do. The “You” group is your mental state, how you treat yourself, how you treat other people, and how you communicate with others. The “What you do” is about the habits you have related to most actionable behaviors. What this means is the things you do, such as smoking drinking, biting your nails, picking your face, touching your face while talking, drinking coffee, not sleeping at the same time each night, doing drugs, not brushing or flossing your teeth, not reading books, watching porn, jerking off, you name it the list goes on. A third and fourth column should be created regarding the things you want to be, and the things you want to do. Don’t fill this in yet, but remind yourself to after some time has passed and you thought about it. For example, getting your pilot's license, learning to SCUBA dive, these things can be on here. But, give it some time and fill one in a week.

&amp;#x200B;

1. For step one pick one simple thing from your list that you do every single day and quit it. That first thing could be something as simple as chewing gum or deleting your social media. The point is, it should NOT be something you’re in love with. It should be something that you can detach yourself from and not be feigning for it every second of the day. The point of this first exercise is to get you to prove to yourself how easy it is to quit a habit.

&amp;#x200B;

2. After you have completed this and some time has gone by. You must know in your mind you will never go back to this thing you have quit. It is gone forever. Once you are convinced the next stage is to change a few things about yourself, in order to become stronger. These are two important things, sleep and diet. The rest will come. For now, this is your only focus. See post I, on sleep to fix this. The one on diet will becoming soon.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Once some time has gone by and you are successful with these two things, you will notice a change in yourself. You will feel incredibly strong. The next things to throw in is your exercise regimen. Ensure that you beef this up if you were already there. Throw in some heavy-duty lifts, or more if you already were, put cardio in the mix. Workout 5 or 6 days a week.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Now that much time has passed, you will notice strength has become paramount. Now is the time to use this list of bad habits. Start with one hard thing. Not the hardest on your list, but closer to it. Now tackle this. Quit FOREVER.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Once time has passed, go to one easy thing. Quit FOREVER.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Once time has passed, do 2 easy things.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Now one or two hard things. 

&amp;#x200B;

8. And so on.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now you can begin to move yourself to the things you should be doing. Those include meditation, reading, and many more things. What you will fill your time with now is very easy to see.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Stop. Talking. After. Sex.

You Mr. Thundercock has slayed Miss Karen after weeks of passing frame and holding shit tests. You've been going into your local gym without swiping your membership because you're alfa AF and been meditating in Tibet to channel your inner Chad. 

But the moment you bust your nut and your women lays next to you, you start spouting all your life stories. Now don't get me wrong, good pussy might get you delirious. Feel free to say whatever the fuck you want. But don't start talking about your emotional bitch shit; she doesn't care your daddy spanked you till you were 15.

I apologise if I come across a little feisty, it's just that I had an 8 hour shift with the town thot and she had the nerve to talk shit about this dude who poured out his heart to her. Now here she is the next day telling me how much of a bitch he is and sharing his business with me, shit that he shared with her in confidence and in the confines of his bedroom. But ofcourse this slut doesn't give a fuck because she just thinks her doormat of a pussy was made by God's right hand. 

Anyway, this is all to reinforce the importance of frame. Use your ""post nut clarity"" to plan and execute something productive with your life, not to give validation to some excuse of a female. If you were a rock of a man before the lay but then turn into Kenny the Parrot after, she's going to feed her ego thinking her pussy was so good that she broke you. This is a guarantee that her pussy will remain drier than an Arab's nutsack on Ramadan.

Here it goes :I'm using throwaway, cause reasons.

My english is not very good, since I'm from southeastern Europe and didn't really do my homeworks during tutorings.

&amp;#x200B;

I(now 30F) divorced my husband (now 31M) 17 months ago. We were married for two years, 3 years together, no kids. This may seem like a very short term, but in reality, we both assumed we wanted this.

After first year of marriage, I got very bored of our lifestyle. My ex-husband was handsome, nice, overly clever (no irony intended),  cared for me and made quite a sum through his own business, we went along very well and we considered ourselves life partners, not just people who are married. Yet, he clearly didn't like people in general - maybe he was even antisocial. And that was the ignition of fighting. He told me he has only two friends and it is good enough for him. He wasn't interested into meeting new people, and definitely wasn't interested in stuff like clubbing. 

He never spoke badly about mine friends group, but I could definitely feel he considered most of them low and stupid. Tbh, my friends group didn't really like him either - for many reasons, but mostly they were clearly envious of his money - we live in small town in an underdeveloped country, and they even hinted it (""how's Rothschild?"").   Cause I know for sure he never did anything wrong to them or something, he just wasn't interested in befriending them more.

Second year of our marriage, I got overwhelmed by routine - since I didn't work full hours - I was an artist - you know how that goes (I use my real reddit account for commissions, that's why throwaway). Every day was the same. For breakfast - we can go to have breakfast somewhere. Noon - let's get into car, drive somewhere, buy some stuff. Evening, get home, watch some tv series, or chill at our jacuzzi. Like hell, we even flew to some European metropole at least once per month, yet, it became so annoying, cause he wouldn't wanna try nightlife there. Some nice bar with few people inside - yes. Some club where we could have fun and meet some people - no way.

For example - we flew to Greece for a vacation once - of course he would book a luxurious villa on Santorini - there were like 20 people, mostly old rich couples, in the resort altogether. I asked him why would he do that - we will certainly have no fun around these folks. I told him I would love to go somewhere different next time, with young people around. He told me that this is the reason why he bothers making money - ability to avoid crowd of young people (vulgar and stupid - he didn't say that but he definitely meant it).

Don't get me wrong, I was really happy my husband could provide all that, I come from a rather poor family, and I would never experience rich man's world without him, I guess - I just wanted a normal life, also, like going out hiking with friends, clubbing and so on.

I tend to think I was a good wife to him. I really loved him. I tried to make him happy - and made me sure he is a happy person with me. Since his business could be very exhausting, I tried my best to make him stay calm - he could get extremely nervous instantly. I even let him do sexual stuff to me I wouldn't allow anyone else (anal sex was pretty softcore). My personal life went to zero, though. I missed clubbing and nightlife. Getting wasted was history for me, already, but still, I didn't want to spend my evenings watching TV or eating in restaurants. He wasn't fond of me clubbing. He was not really controlling type, but in such cases, he was like ""you're my wife, not my hypothetical 13yo daughter to argue about going or not going to dance club, you have no place there among those children there - if you think it is appropriate for a married woman of your age to go clubbing, that is some serious issue of yours, not mine.""

I started to feel resentment towards him, I felt like he doesn't care for my opinions, cause he's the clever one. I couldn't do this anymore, so I left his house, moved into my apartment and filed for a divorce. He made no protests at all, he was like ""Hopefully somebody else will make you happy, then."" There were no kids involved nor money to divide, our law isn't like in America - you cannot really get rich just by divorcing a wealthy man, he left me car he bought for me (along clothing, jewels) and sent his men to renovate my apartment, which I inherited after my grandma. He was very calm (cold as fuck, though) during the process and wished me best luck after. I told him I hope we stay on good terms, he was ok with that. We managed to solve all necessities in few days after divorce.

I started enjoying freedom from very beginning. It felt like a breath of fresh air. Started dating very soon after, spent whole nights with my friends in clubs during weekends, got a job as a waitress which I enjoyed, taking part in many community things. I didn't think of my ex any bit, I eventually saw him taking a ride in his car or having a lunch in some restaurant, but didn't care for him.

Months after, reality started to hit me hard. I started to realize many things were different than I saw them before. What hit me hard was one of my girl friend, who was very eager to support me to divorce ""this controlling freak"" actually started hitting on him once I left his house. I felt really betrayed and foolish. I started to struggle financially, so I had to sell my X6 and bought an old Peugeot. None of the guys I hooked up with was really a material for a relationship. I got fed up with going out drinking. Yet, I considered my ex a history. 

Everything changed half a year ago, when we met by coincidence in a Tobacco shop - when he saw me there, he turned around and tried to leave to buy his cigarettes somewhere else, but I called for him, like ""nice to see you, how are you... heh""

It seemed easier to invite him for a cup of coffee immediately than stay any more second in this weird conversation, so we went for one. After a couple of minutes, we started to be very comfortable around each other and had our portion of fun, he told me he's single, which put me in dangerous expectations, but I didn't care for that the minute, I enjoyed his dark pretty eyebrows jolly jumping while laughing.  It was like the old times, before we were married. After we've finished our coffees, I told him I had fun and hope we could go for a coffee some day again. His face went from happy to sad and told me ""Sure. Some day. See you then."" Anxiety started to flow through my body, so I proposed, with squeaking, half-strangled voice ""Maybe we could meet next week...?"" Situation was clearly uncomfortable for him, he told me: ""Well I have a lot of work going on lately, how about I call you once I have some free time?""

I knew immediately what was going on - there will be not another meeting over cup of coffee. He isn't interested in seeing me nor talking to me - I am clearly nobody to him, he moved on. Struck me really hard. I had my legitimate reasons to divorce him, but I definitely didn't want this. I cried my whole ride home and got ticket for speeding.

After this, my life went downhill. I cannot stop thinking about him - and I really regret divorcing him, even if for legitimate reasons. He was happy to make me happy and I was happy to make him happy. Everything is so different now. Any difficult issue I have drives me crazy, cause there is no one to tell me ""Stop it immediately woman, what did you get your husband for, I'm here to take care of everything you need.""

Recently, my father started to be emotionally abusive towards me again, and I have no husband to have my back. I cannot sleep per night, cause either I'm dreaming that we are together, and when I wake up during night into reality, I cry myself into sleep again. Otherwise, I have nightmares where he does sex stuff he did to me to another woman and I have to watch it, while he tells me she is much better than I ever was, or nightmares where he tells me that he hates me. I have to overdose on Clonazepam lately to get some sleep, otherwise I am unable to work next day.

Seeing him somewhere in town center I go immediately out, cause it causes me anxiety. Even seeing his car somewhere makes me feel nauseous. I don't know what to do. I cannot get some therapy, cause I cannot afford a private one, and therapy on Uni Healthcare is shit - they just give me Clonazepam.

I have strong urges to try to contact him, and I don't even know what for. Minute later, I get overwhelmed by anxiety while thinking about contacting him. I don't know what to do anymore. Nobody really helps me. I told my mother about feelings of mine - and she told me that is just an outcome of my own actions, and anyway, time will heal it. Everyone tells me time will heal it, but I want to know what to do now.

Here it goes:
I'm using throwaway, cause reasons.

My english is not very good, since I'm from southeastern Europe and didn't really do my homeworks during tutorings.

&amp;#x200B;

I(now 30F) divorced my husband (now 31M) 17 months ago. We were married for two years, 3 years together, no kids. This may seem like a very short term, but in reality, we both assumed we wanted this.

After first year of marriage, I got very bored of our lifestyle. My ex-husband was handsome, nice, overly clever (no irony intended),  cared for me and made quite a sum through his own business, we went along very well and we considered ourselves life partners, not just people who are married. Yet, he clearly didn't like people in general - maybe he was even antisocial. And that was the ignition of fighting. He told me he has only two friends and it is good enough for him. He wasn't interested into meeting new people, and definitely wasn't interested in stuff like clubbing. 

He never spoke badly about mine friends group, but I could definitely feel he considered most of them low and stupid. Tbh, my friends group didn't really like him either - for many reasons, but mostly they were clearly envious of his money - we live in small town in an underdeveloped country, and they even hinted it (""how's Rothschild?"").   Cause I know for sure he never did anything wrong to them or something, he just wasn't interested in befriending them more.

Second year of our marriage, I got overwhelmed by routine - since I didn't work full hours - I was an artist - you know how that goes (I use my real reddit account for commissions, that's why throwaway).

This shit is raw, straight from my journal, and exactly what I ended up using as a successful path to transform myself. I’m here to hopefully help those people who need it most. Those who really want to transform but keep fucking it up.


Intro:


Since exploring many things I struggled with years ago, I have actually made them come to fruition years later. As a result, and now that I have made it through quitting these bad habits (some as long as 18 months ago) and starting new great ones, I decided to break out my journal and share with you what I learned, and discard the things that did not work for me. At the time of quitting, I didn’t find something so inclusive. There wasn’t some step by step guide for me to understand how I could quit these terrible things. Instead, there was just a shit load of people telling me that I should quit.


A little background... when I say I struggled with these bad habits, I mean I really struggled. I wanted so bad for these things to be gone from my life when I first started after them, but I couldn’t quite get it. I had the best intentions, but tried and failed for so long. Again and again and again. It wasn’t until time had passed, my strength had increased, and I tried so many things that I was able to easily quit all of these things and transform myself. This series will pinpoint exactly how I made this transformation. 


So, if you haven’t read part one of this series, check it out here.



Body:

Using visualization to see yourself where you want to be:

I will never forget there was this one point during my cut diet where I put my jeans on and realized they fit me properly. They fit me like they should. I had this reassurance from it... but only for about 10 seconds. This isn’t very intuitive, but afterwards, I quickly realized that they should NOT fit me like “they should”. They should not fit me, because I am supposed to be transforming into something different.


I then sat down and wrote this down. I realized I didn’t even know what I was supposed to look like, or who I was supposed to become. I have seen my future self many times in my thoughts, or at least so I thought. It wasn’t until after deeply reflecting that I realized I never did. The crazy part was, I realized I only ever saw the people around me and the tangible goods I had with me. I only ever thought of the feelings i would have to be the future me. 


After reflecting further, I realized that my body and the way my face was going to look is what I should focus on. I visualized myself at a lower body fat. I visualized myself smiling. I made sure when I did, it wasn’t some object or feeling that I was focusing on, rather just the person I wanted to be, naked. It was about whether or not I was happy, and my body and face would show that in the future me, and so I began to try and see myself. However, when I first tried, it wasn’t easy. It was blurry. I couldn’t really picture a more lean or cut me, or a more happy me, it took time. It took relaxation.


Here are the steps of what I would do (TL/DR: I break down the fundamentals of mindfulness meditation and explain the visualization technique I used once in a calm state):


1. I would spend an arbitrary amount of time (will further explain this below) getting relaxed. Typically, it would work much better at the end of the day rather than in the middle. Or, directly after a run or intense lifting session. 


2. I would lie on my back and get very comfortable and I insured my limbs were not crossing, and were placed by my sides.


3. I began breathing, and focused only on my breathe. I would say to myself, “rising, falling” etc and follow my stomach moving. I made my mind with the stomach, so to say. 


4. Then, when thoughts came in, I would focus on the thoughts. If I was tired, I would say, “tired”. If a thought distracted me, I would say “distracted”.


5. The point of focusing on these thoughts was to become aware of them, NOT to judge them. I let these thoughts be what they were, temporary states that come and go.


6. I slowed my breathing down more and more. My breathing became deeper, my inhalation longer, and exhalation slower.


7. Once I was relaxed, I began the visualization. 


8. The cue for me, and when I was relaxed enough, was I heard my thoughts slow way, way down. I can explain the feeling as floating in deep space. Many times, when I first got this calm, I would almost panic. I could barely feel myself breathing. I definitely could not feel my limbs, or any other body parts, I had zero proprioception (basically, a cool word for spatial orientation). After running some tests, I would typically reach this state about 35 - 40 minutes into this state. I set a stop watch, and came out of the state to check the time and report it to myself.


9. The visualization was easy for me. At this point, there was almost no chatter, and nothing but quiet. I would begin visualization of myself. I pictured my naked self, floating in the space. I pictured what I would look like, my facial features. I painted a picture of a hoppy me, that looked how I wanted to look. There was nothing material to this, and I made sure I eliminated this from my future self-picture, as it gets in the way of what matters most. 


Of course, as you can see, this is a very powerful and impactful way of reaching a future visualization for all tenants of your life. 


Since, as most from this community know, consumerism and other people as a part of your life are not the root of your happiness, be wise as to how you see the future you. Be wise as to how you picture your future self, what is around you, and what it is that you’re doing.


Part III on how I fixed the rest of my bad habits (other than my sleep schedule), coming soon.

Deep down inside, they know about the 80/20 rule, consciously or not. They are just too fucking lazy to make themselves better so they supplicate and pussy beg instead of bettering themselves. 

That hurts nobody but them. But when a man who has been awakened by redpill knowledge starts down the path to self-improvement, there is NOTHING that beta Billy won't do to try to stop you. It's like they intentionally put stumbling blocks in your way when you try to improve your life. This is how I know that they know women only really want top men- the fact that they try to stop you from getting there. 

When you want to better yourself, don't listen to haters. Bluepill men want you to stay fat, weak, and/or lazy like them. They don;t want you to get strong/educated/successful so you can get snatch.

Beware these men. They will try to sabotage your career, sabotage  your gym routine, and stop you from gainign more redpill knowledge. To make my point, I have a story:

I (24 YO) recently got back into strength training after a few years of alcoholism made me into a doughy skinnyfat slob. I've now quit the booze and I'm lifting and working my muscles. I want my 6 pack back. I want my guns back. I want women to stand in awe of my physique like they did when I was strong a few years ago.

I'm doing everything right. Proper form, protein, creatine, etc. But at every turn, people try to sabotage me. Friends  and acquaintances whom I rarely heard from or saw suddenly want me to do things with them rather then get my workout in. They try to get me to skip the gym. 

Other betas at work tell me all sorts of stupid shit because they want to scare me away from building lots of mass. Lots of guys do thgis, but one guy in particular thinks he knows everything because he used to participate in a crossfit program and certain non-intensive school sports (I.E not football ro wrestling) that he knows everything. I have heard each of the following obvious falsehoods at least once:

1- Machines are better than or equal to free weights, with regards to putting on mass.

2- You can train the same muscle every day (if you're working the muscle real hard- like you should- you'll need to rest it at 36 hours, with the exception of the abs)

3- Cardio and other fitness should be your main focus (only if you don't actually care about building muscle)

4- You are likely to injure yourself lifting (not if you have proper form)

It's quite sad that people actually believe this bullshit.



TL:DR When you try to better yourself Billy Betas will try to stop or sabotage you any way they can. Beware their negative vibes. Don't listen to them. Do your research so you know how to achieve your goals properly and efficently, write your goals down, and learn from people who have achieved the goal you want to achieve.

Don't ever flaunt TRP or use RP terms like Alpha/Beta etc in normal conversation with the boys. But drop little Red Pill bombs when they will be absorbed by the listener. 

For example, I was talking to some of my friends and one of them mentioned a girl not replying on Tinder and another pointed out that they double messaged. I took the opportunity to insert some adapted teachings on mystery and abundance mindset, finalizing with the simple message about men being the gatekeepers of commitment and women being the gatekeepers of sex. In those words.

Little things like these are ways we can shape and guide the minds and thoughts of blue pill men. Just because the Red Pill in it's blatant form is immediately shunned by society, doesn't mean we can't try to subtly guide those around us. Basic things like reminding men that they are the prize will help.

Personally, I fully understand why we can't shout our truths to the world. They are earth-shattering to those that haven't already started to discover these things on their own. But I feel like it on us to help the men around us find this path, especially with society's constant push toward gyno-centrism and female empowerment.

The concept of a wall is intriguing. It describes the inevitable drop in a woman’s sexual and relationship values compared to her younger years and younger competition. The reason for that drop is that men view attraction towards women from a reproductive standpoint (as does any other animal really); they look for fertility, which is found in women in their youth, health and fitness.

The data on that, provided by matching sites and different university institutions, is pretty solid. With age, a woman’s ovaries shrink, and with it her attraction value. Nothing a 55 year old woman can do is going to refresh her reproductive capabilities. This is a doing of mother nature that no amount of social engineering can change. Women are human beings.

&amp;nbsp;

**Man’s fertility**

A man’s fertility isn’t nearly as affected by his age as a woman’s. You could have a 55 year old man who smokes, drinks and engages in other risque behaviours that affects his balls. Once he drops the habits of smoke and drink and else, coupled with regular cardio and lifting, he will likely find not only the sperm quality and quantity increasing, but also his animalistic nature of wanting poontang coming back in full swing.

You could argue that mother nature was kinder towards us when it came to reproductive capabilities not waning off, though man’s constant horniness has to be taken into consideration as well.

&amp;nbsp;

**A wall for man?**

I would argue that men do indeed have a wall, though not inevitable, and not a scoring of mother nature. When it comes to women’s attraction towards men, the most unattractive of men can be summarized in one word: a bum. Whether he is not taking care of his health and fitness, or sits around all day doing nothing, or has no passions to engage in besides hours of video games and netflix a day, or whatever; a bum is not attractive in the eyes of a woman. Men are human doings.

&amp;nbsp;

This leaves us in the knowledge that the wall for us men is of our own creation. If *you* seize the day to the fullest, then no wall is being constructed. If *you* waste the hours of the day doing nothing of value, then *you* have added a brick to that wall yourself.",False,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Men face no wall (or do we?),0,1570427892.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ddzbxr/men_face_no_wall_or_do_we/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Thought you guys would appreciate this.

&gt; A fast food addict who was rejected by girls throughout his teenage years for being obese has undergone a fat-to-fit transformation - and now has the same women asking him out on dates.

&gt; I really liked this girl at my school. She was very popular, and all the guys thought she was the hottest girl in our grade.

&gt; I thought she was really pretty, and I must have been crazy, but I decided I'd ask her to the school dance.

&gt; It was my final year of school, and I just thought ""why not?"". I was anticipating for her to reject me straight away and just laugh in my face.

&gt; But amazingly, she said yes, I couldn't believe it. I was so excited for the dance that I bought a new suit, got a haircut and hired a limo.

&gt; I wanted to impress her. I nervously drove to her house, walked up and rang the bell. She opened it and just said 'sorry, you're too fat to fit through the door' and slammed the door in my face.

&gt; I was heartbroken. I went back to the limo and cried my eyes out. But then I gathered myself, and thought well, you have a suit on so you might as well go to the dance.

&gt; But I had a terrible time, and everyone laughed and bullied me when they found out what happened. It was horrible.

&gt; I sank into a major depression after that, which lasted years after high school ended. I never thought anyone could love me and that I'd be alone forever.

&gt; I never thought about my health until my doctor said I was about to get diabetes. I broke down in tears and realized I needed to change my life.

&gt; I stopped eating fast food and began cooking for myself. I also stepped foot into a gym for the first time back in 2014 and haven't looked back.

&gt; When I was fat, I hated myself and never thought anyone could love me. All I wanted was to have a partner and family, so that really motivated me to lose weight.

&gt; I was always rejected and would get laughed at when I approached girls. But now women are asking me on dates all the time.

&gt; I went from having three matches on Tinder when I was fat, to now having over 1,000 matches with girls. It's crazy.

&gt; Then about a year ago, that same girl who was so cruel to me before our school formal, somehow got my number through my Instagram page and sent me a text apologizing for being a bully and asked if we could go on a date.

&gt; I couldn't believe it and didn't even reply. I'll forgive, but I would never forget.

&gt; I've gone through a lot, but my experiences have made me the man I am today. My message to is just never give up, even when everything seems hopeless.

&gt; My goal now is to help others who have been through the same things I have. If I can do it, anyone can do it.

&gt; I feel so much happier about life and I'm looking forward to the future.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Fast food addict who was only ever asked out on a date as a prank decides to become fit - and now HE'S being wooed by the women who used to reject him,0,1570400290.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ddu8d7/fast_food_addict_who_was_only_ever_asked_out_on_a/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

I am currently in Monk Mode, and during this time I focus on my fitness and my career, as well as school. I've taken a break from approaching and when I get the ""itch"" as I like to call it, to fuck a woman I use dating apps since it's low effort. 

So I struck up a conversation with a well-to-do girl. She's a homely looking Plain Jane type, though she does have a nice pair of tits on her. 

We hit it off pretty well, and she mentioned to me that she was dating someone and was looking for ""friends"". 

Now here's the kicker, I'm on the other side of the US from her. And obviously she's not talking to me to just be pen pals. 

Whenever a potential lay talks about dating another guy, I always like to play it up. 

""Oh really? I'm sure he's a great guy!"" 

No need to throw salt on someone. I knew that she was attracted to me and liked my vibe. 

Fast forward a month of on and off communication, a little ""Hey, how's your day?"" here and a little ""So is school?"" and she says something interesting. 

""I wish we could hang out, you seem cool. Too bad you live so far :("" 

Now, personally, I love Nice Guy Game. It's effortless and it's sappy but also humorous at the same time. 

""I'd walk a thousand miles if I could just see you tonight :)"" 

""Hahaha really? When?"" 

Boom. Now all I have to do is set a time and date. 

Speaking of date...

Part of me wanted to ask ""What happened to your boyfriend?"" 

But that's not my business nor my problem. 

I was due for a vacation anyways. 

So I flew out to her place, she paid for our hotel room and after catching a movie we fuck until the morning. 

She lays her head on my chest and said, ""I told my boyfriend that I was hanging out with a friend tonight."" 

I smile and say ""Aww I'm only a friend?"" 

Poor guy. His girlfriend was a manager at a fast food restaurant that works double shifts to pay for school which he attends full time and she volunteers at her Church three days a week on top of it. 

And his special snowflake has admitted to me that she has jungle fever and always wanted to be with a black guy like me, and she paid for a hotel room and part of my round trip flight. 

Afterward she sent me a long message on my flight back home which was a nice ego boost detailing how it was the best sex she ever had and she couldn't wait to see me again.

&amp;nbsp;

When you’re talking to a girl that you’re attracted to, determine what the ideal outcome for that specific interaction is. 

For instance, if a girl has a job interview in 30 minutes, then you probably don’t have time to pull her. 

In this case, your ideal outcome for the interaction would be to set up for a date with her.

You must find out if pulling a girl home is a realistic possibility, otherwise, you could easily spend over an hour with her only to get a pat on the back and a hearty, “It was nice meeting you!”

In the men’s dating advice community, this is referred to as screening for logistics. Basically, you’re determining whether or not a particular girl will be able to go home with you later.

Make a habit of asking a few logistical questions whenever you have a solid interaction with a woman.

Logistical questions include:

- What are you doing later?
- Who are you here with?
- How did you get here (Driving/Uber/etc.)?
- What area of town do you live in?
- What are you doing tomorrow?

The above questions will give you useful information. 

If, for instance, you learn that a girl drove her five friends to the club, she lives an hour away, and she’s flying across the country tomorrow morning, chances are, you’re not going to pull her.

Conversely, if she lives across the street, she came to the club alone, and she says she’s not doing anything later, the likelihood that she’ll go home with you is much higher.

Of course, asking too many logistical questions would quickly become obnoxious. 

To avoid making your questions come across as inquisitional, sprinkle them throughout the interaction rather than asking them back-to-back.

Below, you’ll find general guidelines for the best and worst answers you can get to logistical questions:

What are you doing later?

- Good logistics: Nothing, what are you doing later?
- Bad logistics: I’m going back to my parent’s house.

Who are you here with?

Good logistics: I came here by myself.
Bad logistics: I’m here with my mom.

- Did you drive here?

Good logistics: Yeah.
Bad logistics: No, my friend Dave drove me.

What area of town do you live in?

- Good logistics: 5 minutes away from here.
- Bad logistics: About an hour away.

What are you doing tomorrow?

- Good logistics: Not sure yet.
- Bad logistics: I have to wake up at 4 a.m. to go to work.

To be clear, if a girl really wants to hook up with you, you may be able to find a way to overcome a bad logistical situation.

Once, in Vegas, my wingman and I pulled two girls from a club. My girl was excited to hang out more and get a drink back at our hotel.
 The other girl, however, wasn’t so enthusiastic: she complained that she just wanted to go home and sleep during the entire car ride. 

Fortunately, her protests didn’t matter because the girl I was with really wanted to spend more time with me. 

My girl told her friend that she could sleep in the car while we had shots in my hotel room.

Ultimately, it’s useful to know logistics, but if you think a girl really wants to go home with you, there’s a good chance you can make something happen regardless of her situation.

Memorizing all these logistical questions can seem overwhelming, fortunately, there’s one simple question you can ask to get an idea of whether a girl might be interested in going home with you later that night. Say either,

- “What are you doing later?”
- Or, “There’s an after-party later tonight, you should come.”

More often than not, women will respond to this question based on how they feel about you. So, if they want to keep hanging out with you, they will make themselves available:

- “I’m not doing much, how about you?”
- Or, “A party sounds fun, I might go”

Conversely, if a girl knows she isn’t going home with you later, she might say something like,

-“I’m going back home with my roommates to sleep.”

- Or, “I can’t go to a party tonight, I have other plans.”

To be clear, a girl might make herself unavailable when you ask this question only to change her mind later. But more often than not, her response to, “What are you doing later?” will give you a good idea as to whether she is open to the idea of going home with you.

If you don’t have much experience meeting women and a girl replies to the above statements negatively, your best option is to exchange numbers with her and to start approaching other women.

Maybe the girl likes you, maybe she doesn’t, but either way, she’s probably not going home with you that night. 

Your most valuable resource when you go out is time. Besides, you have her number, so if she is interested in you, she will likely agree to go on a date with you. 

As you gain experience meeting women, you will develop an intuitive ability to sense whether you’ll be able to pull a girl later.
 And in many cases, even if a girl initially seems uninterested in going home with you, you’ll be able to change her mind. But when you’re new to this, taking this kind of risk isn’t likely to pay off.

&amp;nbsp;

##When She Has Good Logistics

&amp;nbsp;

If you get the sense that you might be able to pull a girl (I.E. she seems interested in you/she says she’s not busy later), then you should find out if she will leave her friends to hang out with you in a different area.

Make a suggestion like:

- “Hey, let’s go to the outside area where we can actually hear each other.”

- “Let’s go to the dance floor for a minute.”

- During the day you might say, “There’s a Starbucks right down the street, let’s get a quick cup of coffee.”

&amp;nbsp;

##If She Won’t Go With You

&amp;nbsp;

If a girl is unwilling to move to a nearby area with you, it’s unlikely she’ll be willing to leave the club to go to your place.

However, you may still be able to go home with her at the end of the night. 

You will have to decide whether you think the girl won’t move to another area because she isn’t interested in you or because she has a tight-knit group of friends that don’t want to separate.

If it’s the latter, you may be able to go home with her at the end of the night. Instead of pulling her, you can let her pull you (see the section, “Go With Her.”)

If, however, you think she might not be interested in you, it’s best to exchange numbers with her before going back to approaching other women.

Again, as a rule-of-thumb, it’s better to play it safe (get the number and move on to another girl) when you’re new to approaching women, and better to take risks as you get more experienced.
 
When you’re first learning this, you will get the best results by setting up as many dates as possible (on a date, the logistics are very much in your favor), and by finding girls who have a good logistical situation in clubs. 

Basically, find the “yes” girls who are actively interested in going home with a guy that night and exchange numbers with the “maybe” girls who are less enthusiastic and less available. 

Then, as you accumulate experience, you will develop a fine-tuned sense of how interested a particular girl is and whether you will be able to overcome her less-than-ideal logistical situation.

&amp;nbsp;

##If She Agrees To Go With You

&amp;nbsp;

If the girl says yes to your request to go to another area with you, then you can dance with her or hang out with her in the area you suggested.

This is a very good sign that you may be able to pull. Women will rarely say they want to go home with you, instead, they show their interest through their actions--and going to another area with you is one of the biggest green lights that a girl is open to the idea of leaving the club with you later.

It’s a good idea to repeat this process several times. Don’t just lead a girl from one area to another, lead her from area to area throughout your interaction. 

Bring her to the dance floor, then bring her outside, then take her to another club, etc. As a girl follows you, she will increasingly trust you and see you as a confident leader.

&amp;nbsp;

##Taking Her Home

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, a girl is following your lead from one area to another. After you’ve been talking with her for roughly 45 minutes to an hour and a half(1), the next step is to bring her home with you.

Fortunately, pulling isn’t rocket science. So long as the emotions are right, many women will want to go home with you, and oftentimes all you have to do is ask. More than a few times, I’ve pulled girls simply by saying something to the effect of, “Want to get out of here?”

However, having an excuse to take a girl home can make things smoother. 

If you mentioned the idea of going to an after-party earlier, you can pull by saying, “Hey, let’s go to that after-party I mentioned.” 

Now, inviting a girl to an ‘after-party’ when it’s really just you and her might sound creepy. Here’s the truth, if you use lines like the above when there’s no mutual sexual attraction, then yeah, it will be a little awkward.

I once brought two girls back to my place to go to an ‘after-party.’ When we arrived, they realized there was no real after-party, and they immediately said they had to get an Uber. 

But this has only happened once in my entire life, and it was my own fault—I was focusing on the pull without considering whether there was enough sexual attraction and trust.

Ultimately, if a girl is interested in you and she agrees to go home with you, it’s unlikely she’ll be disappointed when it turns out the after-party is really just you and her.

If you’re unsure whether a girl is attracted to you, you can make a point to physically escalate before bringing her home. When a girl is willing to grind with you or make out with you, you can be fairly confident she’s interested. 

Afterward, you can make the pull happen without worrying about whether she’s attracted to you or not.

You don’t need a great reason to bring a girl to your place, you just need an excuse that isn’t “let’s fuck” (saying that puts way too much pressure on the girl). If a girl is interested in hooking up with you, she will agree to go to your place for whatever silly reason you come up with. 

A friend of mine once pulled by saying, “I have an amazing book collection at my place, you have to see it.”

Here are a few more examples of simple excuses you can use to bring a girl home with you:

- “It’s way too loud here, let’s go somewhere quiet where we can have a real conversation.”

- “Let’s get a drink back at my place.”

- “I’m hungry, we should get some food.” (If she agrees, you can suggest cooking something back at your place—if nothing else, you can make a frozen pizza.)

Or you can pull by inviting a girl to watch a show or movie with you:

&gt; You: Have you seen the show, Californication?

&gt; Her: No.

&gt; You: You’ll love it, you have to see an episode with me later.

Then, you can bring the show back up again when you’re ready to pull by saying, “Hey, let’s go watch that episode of Californication.”

To be clear, sometimes a girl will refuse to go home with you even if she likes you. 

Maybe the girl has a boyfriend she didn’t mention. Maybe she just doesn’t do one-night stands. Sometimes, a girl can’t go home with you because she has to sleep in the same room as her friends.

Sometimes, even when a girl can’t go home with you, you can still go home with her. 

Understand: pulling a girl back to her own place is a bit messier than bringing her back to your place, but sometimes it’s the best option. 

If a girl is unwilling to leave her group of friends, you may be able to follow her and her friends to wherever they’re going at the end of the night.

You’re going to have to decide whether going back to a girl’s place is likely to lead to something. It’s often best to simply get her number and to go meet other people.

However, it’s important to not only know how to pull a girl to your place, but also how to let a girl pull you to her place.

&amp;nbsp;

##Go With Her

&amp;nbsp;

You’ve found out that the girl you’re talking to can’t go home with you. But you’ve decided you’re interested in this girl and you want to see if you can make something happen. 

First, you should find out what she’s doing at the end of the night. If she says she’s going to her friend’s place to get some sleep, it’s unlikely she’s interested in bringing you back to her place. 

Conversely, if she makes herself available, you may be able to make something happen (I.E.“My friends and I are just going to hang out.” Or, “I’m not sure yet, just going home.”)

Before deciding to go back to a girl’s place, ask yourself, “What would happen if she and I were alone in a room together?”

If the answer is, “We’d tear each other’s clothes off,” then going with her has a good chance of leading to sex.

If the answer is, “We’d awkwardly talk about surface-level topics for a while, but nothing else would happen,” then going home with her is probably a waste of time.

Once you’ve decided that you’re going to stick with a girl and go with her at the end of the night, just keep the conversation going and let her invest in you more.

There’s a good chance the girl will be carpooling back home with her friends at the end of the night. If this is the case, it’s important that they like you. 

So, make a point to spend some time with her friends, be positive, joke around with them, and ask them some getting to know you questions. 

If the friend-group doesn’t like you, it’s going to be exceedingly difficult to go back with them at the end of the night.

At the end of the night, you can go with the girl to her place. To go with her, ask, “What area of town are you headed to?”

Reply to whatever her answer is with, “Oh, I’m near there, we should split an Uber.” 

If she’s unenthusiastic about the idea, then she’s probably not that interested in going with you, but if she says something along the lines of, “Yeah, that sounds good,” or, “I’m actually driving, I’ll take you."" Then you can leave with her at the end of the night.

When you’re in the Uber with the girl, you need to create an excuse to enter her house. 

The easiest way to do this is to simply ask if you can use her restroom while you wait for another Uber to your place.

When you’re in the girl's house, one thing should lead to another. You’ll both forget that you were “waiting for your Uber”.

Now, if you’re thinking, “This sounds creepy,” well, it is creepy if she’s not into you. However, if she’s really attracted to you, you’re simply creating a logical excuse to do what you both want to do.

You can’t tell a girl, “Oh, you have to go home with your friends? Can I come along so we can fuck when you get home?” That wouldn’t be relatable.

If you want to go home with her, you have to create a situation where it makes sense for you to end up in her house. Again, you should only do this if you’re confident that it’s on between the two of you.

&amp;nbsp;

##What if you can’t pull to your place?

&amp;nbsp;

Let’s say you live an hour away from the clubs in your town or you still live with your parents and you can’t bring girls back to your place. 

Is it still possible to pull girls? 

Yes, of course, the only difference is that you must pull the girl back to her own house.

To do this, the strategy is the same as bringing a girl back to your place with one difference-make a point to suggest that you go back to her place.

or instance, if you mention the idea of getting drinks with a girl and she agrees, follow up by saying something to the effect of, “Okay, how far is your place from here?”
 ﻿
﻿Whether she replies with, “I’m 5 minutes away.” Or, “I’m 20 minutes away,” you can say, Okay, cool, that’s much closer than my place, let’s go.”

Sometimes, a girl will not be able to bring you back to her place (I.E. she lives with her parents), in this case, you can either get a hotel, move on to the next girl, or use a car. However, many of the women you meet will have a place you can go back to.

I’ve pulled girls back to their own place many times, it doesn’t need to be much more complicated or difficult than pulling to your place.

Then when I get home  I feel bad about being alone and having not approached these girls. 

I would say I have approach anxiety and this is is because I live in a foreign country. I kind of feel scared of being rejected for not speaking the language as fluent as the natives or for being different. Nevertheless, I don't have any intentions of being a beta male again ( just like my approval seekers and beta motherfuckers friends :)).

Additionally, once you’re in bed, some ideas on how to fall asleep faster.



How to stop fighting yourself:

If you have a problem with getting into bed, you start off by first “killing the idea” of staying up late. In your mind, you must “give up” to the idea of going to sleep early. This is where mindfulness comes in. I remember a painful feeling would come over me when I got into bed at 8pm. I didn’t want to go to bed, there were so many better things to do. This made falling asleep and fighting these habits very difficult. However, over time, I gave in to this feeling, and let it happen to myself. This may take much time for some, but this process needs to occur so that you’re not fighting yourself tooth and nail to get into bed at the same time each night. You cannot have this feeling of anxiety, or fear of missing out on something, constantly haunting you. Here is my message to you, there is nothing to do, big guy, trust me, just go to sleep. Give in, and let it happen.


THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART: get rid of what is keeping you up, stimulus. Screens, drugs, alcohol, stress, coffee, pre-workout, get rid of it. You will be okay. I haven’t had coffee in 1 year, I never thought I would be able to quit. The first 2 weeks I quit, I wanted to die. My head hurt so badly, I had a headache for 2 weeks straight, and slept around 11 hours a night. I drank coffee since 18 and quit at 30. I probably drank around 5 cups a day, or 2 larges a day. Once I quit fixing my sleep schedule was easy. And, the pain faded after a couple of weeks.

You can further do so by realizing the following logic:

1. Your hormones are positively affected by going to bed and waking up at the same time for the entirety of your life. Additionally, the same hormones are affected by sleeping a set number of hours. These hormones affect your weight, emotions, attitude, and energy. 

2. “Nothing good happens after 9:00PM”. This is so fucking true. You are so burnt by this point, nothing you do after these hours is really going to help you in anyway. The speed at which you do things is so much more efficient when you first wake up. 

3. There is no need to get up SUPER early, and any guy that tells you otherwise is trying to toot his own horn. Who gives a fuck if you get up at 4AM, I don’t, knock yourself out tough guy. Get up at 3:45AM for all I give a fuck. For people who are trying to get out of a bad way, you need to get up early, but pick a good time that works well for you until you’re on track. 7:00AM could be good, 6:00AM can be good, who gives a fuck. Just get yourself on track first, then worry about the rest. You don’t need to start getting up at 5:00AM all of a sudden if you have been sleeping until 10:00AM most days, that won’t help you. The only thing that matters is that you have a decent amount of time (at least 90 minutes) before you really have to start to get ready for your day, whatever that may be.



4. Realize that when you do get up early, there is nothing to bother you. It’s just you, and this alone time is great. You can think, write things down, and you have time before you leave to do so. I love getting up early and it’s still dark out, it’s a great feeling. It’s just me and my thoughts... and they are almost all positive thoughts in the morning. I can plan, journal, and execute things that are very important to me.




Okay, now for some tricks:



1. No caffeine (or if you really want to go down this road, no caffeine after noon).

2. No screens 90 minutes before bed (read a book, or lay there, you’ll be fine)


3. No mentally stimulating activities at all 90 minutes before bed, except maybe sex.

4. 1mg of melatonin if you feel you need it. Benadryl or similar if you really feel the need. Benadryl actually really helped to get my sleep in order, I quit taking it about 3 weeks in.

5. Give yourself an 8.5 to 9 hour window to sleep.

6. High glycemic carbs about 1.5 hours before bed. Why? It keeps your blood sugar high, and keeps you asleep. I usually have 1.5 tablespoons of chocolate almond butter and a banana. Even on my cut diet, and I account for the calories. I sleep all the way through the night when I do this.


7. Cold room, big blankets.


8. Ear plugs if you live with people. And put them things in right. You gotta twist the ends, shove it all the way in, and let it expand in the canal.


9. Calm your head. Here is the trick. Lie down, then slightly sit up. Push your shoulder blades together, then lie back down. Scoot your tail bone down. Now your chest is poking out, and the bed is helping you keep it this way. Put your two hands, palm side down, on your stomach. As you inhale, say “one inhale”, then take a deep breathe. As you exhale, say “one exhale”.  Now count to 100. Go slower and slower, it’s okay if your breathe is shaky for the first ones, it’ll get smoother. 



I hope this helps you all get deep sleep. Do realize, sleep changes everything and makes you stronger. Without it, you will burn out.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,"Sleep is important, here are some great tips on getting sleep",0,1570274803.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dd61xo/sleep_is_important_here_are_some_great_tips_on/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Yes, I subscribe to Medium newsletter. Yes, I am left leaning ideologically and I peruse what the feminists, liberals and democrats have to say because I find some substance in their matter - with my own personal filter, of course - the same way I consume TRP material, and for the same reason. Suddenly I saw this in the weekly mailer and I knew I had hit gold the moment I read the title.

The author is actually much more intellectually balanced than you and I would expect, at the start at least. Obviously she then starts colouring all things RP as if it was emotional abuse and psychological manipulation and calls it soulless. The title photo shows an apparently abused woman forced to show a smile - subtle like a sledgehammer! In her zeal to paint anything that doesn't say ""men and women are absolute equals"" as evil incarnate, she forgets that TRP/MRP are just self-help subs, which are not sugarcoated and lay the ideas as they are. If anything else, I find MRP to be much more mature than TRP because there dudes are much less focussed on the next lay and more on the relationship.  Also, no two RP followers are the same. Everyone is different - which is one of the most attractive features of RP to me. While all social media has become an echo-chamber, RP shows me something every once in a while stuff that makes me go, ""huh, that's a valid point, I hadn't thought of that."" Obviously, that's of no value to people who have already decided what their immutable world view is - which is why facebook/insta are such giant echo chambers and hold billions glued to them.

Are some RP followers manipulators? Yes. Definitely. But so are hundreds of millions of men who are not RP followers! And yes, some part of RP is borderline manipulation. Is it evil or out of malice? Absolutely not. Public speaking and debating too is a form of social manipulation. All followers of any ideology are subjects of some kind of manipulation, from religion to history. I see RP as just another interpersonal skill which is focussed on relationships. So I take from it what I feel will work for me - i.e., possible for me, acceptable to me, would be acceptable to my wife, would not cross a line for me or for her, and so on.

Caving in to DEER has ruined 2 LTRs for me, with girls who would do whatever I said - who respected me, adored me and doted on me. They flaunted themselves around the uni campus as a proud girlfriend - they would do anything short of wearing a neon sign around their neck saying ""I'm with him"" - you get the picture. My stupidity and social ineptitude caused me to get unceremoniously dumped by both of them. I made myself unwanted because I kept rationalising when she was PMSing and consequently losing my shit because, oh what a surprise, I wasn't able to logically conclude the argument. Please note that for a full 6 years of my life, from the end of first LTR to 3 years ago, I harboured for both of these women pure vile hatred, because of ""what they had done to me."" RP made me own up, that it was my fault. I was responding when I should have been absorbing. I was explaining myself when I should have just gone along whatever she said until she finds herself at the end of the rope of logic, and comfort her emotionally exhausted self. RP made me realise that I was the one who behaved wrongly, and thus I should not harbour any hatred for them, and move the fuck on. They behaved the way they always have, and I knew what I was signing up for when I started. That I forced my logical viewpoint on her when she wanted none of it was my fault. Isn't this healthy? How is this soulless? And when RP tells this, there is no judgement or condescension, it's just plainly a fact. It's the same way with men and anger/rage as it with women and emotional turbulence. You can't logically ""placate"" that shit, you have to use tact and not be a fucking simpleton about it.

When I realised what I was doing wrong, and did not repeat the mistake of going down the DEER road, I found myself in a very smooth LTR with my now wife. If some argument is silly, I also implement DARE to some extent and the results are in front of me - a wife who's forgotten the argument and in general accepted it was not worth the effort of bickering over. We joke about something unrelated and the negativity has vanished into thin air. How is that a bad thing? I do not attempt this for serious issues, because she's not a toddler that I can wave candy at her and everything will be solved. DARE is a behaviour tactic, not a magic wand. For the serious issues, we have a serious discussion. And since they are so rare, I have her full attention and she has mine. Had I been having serious discussions with her about the minor bumps on the marital road, we would both be emotionally and mentally exhausted when it came to pondering as husband and wife upon the stuff that really matters. She is alert and receptive and 100% invested, and I don't get pissed off feeling ""she's not taking it seriously."" I would like to ask the author - what exactly is the negative here? I still respect her as a partner - equal in many things, superior to me in a few things, and myself as superior to her in some others. What is toxic in this?

Are there bad apples? Sure. Is there an extremist sect of RP? Yep. But what ideology is above extremism and misinterpretation? It is not PC to be RP, that is for sure. And it is cool to demonise it. But that's about it. Women fixating on being equal to men in all things at all micro and macro levels is a fucking travesty of movement that set out out to eliminate discrimination against women. At the end of the day, women remain the biggest enemies of women.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,"""Married Red Pill: The Soulless Subreddit For Men Who Game Their Wives"" - Sensationalist drivel from a pseudo-intellectual interpretation of RP/MRP",0,1570259296.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dd3wjm/married_red_pill_the_soulless_subreddit_for_men/,no_ads,0.0,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'qTJ83ZmefYpQEaKSfNCABxjzN_I0Ix4Oy-ag3__DaU4', 'resolutions': [{'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2dcCuug2hjGrBE4nMimWZY-KHSN4OkWM_wUqJBCw5aE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e230cf828c892d51eaefa4fefcec11390028d7af', 'width': 108}, {'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2dcCuug2hjGrBE4nMimWZY-KHSN4OkWM_wUqJBCw5aE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e01cd4c5b6e77aff5539fce0d531b625d63994c1', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2dcCuug2hjGrBE4nMimWZY-KHSN4OkWM_wUqJBCw5aE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef3f5faa35d0a3c5ca7e85013af322ad97acc37b', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2dcCuug2hjGrBE4nMimWZY-KHSN4OkWM_wUqJBCw5aE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4f7e3bdbae8f9dac77bebaa799a494daa4fb9c3', 'width': 640}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2dcCuug2hjGrBE4nMimWZY-KHSN4OkWM_wUqJBCw5aE.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3642ca46bc009ff45532db59023844e8b6daf3f', 'width': 960}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2dcCuug2hjGrBE4nMimWZY-KHSN4OkWM_wUqJBCw5aE.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0481ab88bdcebb0552bc94e0103e281b76fbb05', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 800, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/2dcCuug2hjGrBE4nMimWZY-KHSN4OkWM_wUqJBCw5aE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=fcf9938bc40aa0824c0541951555c0cd38099b6f', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,0

https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/meaww.com/amp/playboy-thai-king-annoints-mistress-official-concubine-ceremony-in-front-of-wife

Of course the majority of the western press played it from a gynocentric angle. Most of the headlines included patronising insults towards the Thai king noting that he performed the ceremony in front of one of his new wives and that the concubine had to lay at his feet. I think it is time that we look at this from a red pill man’s point of view. Obviously if this was a story about a middle aged woman who was in a relationship with several younger men the narrative would be how brave and wonderful this woman is and how society needs to accept her choices. 

Why does western society feel that the moral relativism pedalled by far left feminists and their cuck allies is the only acceptable narrative? Why does society seek to denigrate and criminalise healthy male sexuality? Why does anyone care what sort of relationship that consenting adults choose to live in? The degenerate and cowardly rhetoric from the left is a revisionist, gynocentric and childish view of human sexuality. You will of course notice that your average leftard is falling over themselves to preach about the rights of transgender persons who only make up a tiny fraction of society. Why do they hate male sexuality so much? The answer is really quite obvious, it is the loud and ugly girl at the back of the class who hates men because they don’t want to date them. They then develop a toxic legacy of penis envy and seek to demonise and castrate the males that rejected them.

I don’t plan on writing a whole screed here, we all know the score. I just want to say that King Rama X is a shining example of masculinity in a world which lacks a positive identity for men. In choosing to implement his will he shows us all the way forward. Hugh Hefner did the same thing with his public displays of his polyamory. The simple fact is that from an emotional, biological and sexual viewpoint men love to be with lots of women. Men who have sex with a lot of women are the winners in the genetic lottery that is nature. Hypergamy is the scales by which men are judged worthy. This is a two way street, women want to be with the best men and if that means sharing then many women are going to be OK with that. Sure the vast majority of men will never be in this league, an open harem is really only for the uber powerful in society. 

As a red pilled man I look up the the Thai king. I think, there is a man who I could follow and look up to. Incidentally I think that a proper red pill morality on sexual relations should be extremely inclusive. My morality should not be forced onto anyone else but I should not be subjected to judgment by those who hold that their morality is superior to others. I think the healthiest moral position for a red pill man should be each to their own. If a woman wants multiple partners then I have no issue with that.

To the point where if you are single, you have lost. Even if you are in a relationship with someone you've lost. The rates of STDs are sky high on the coastal cities, most of the women here are sterile because no one told them that catching STDs, plan B, nipple piercings, or abortions would make them sterile. 

The problem is compounded due to these ""dead"" women trying to convert others to be whores. So when large tech companies, which moved to the West coast for the nice weather try to employee high wage employees who look for wives they basically end up saving all their money and not spending it on the local economy. 

I hate to say that almost all older women are like this (which really pushes the whole go marry an 18 year old, even through she still isn't a virgin). Having children is basically not an option for anyone in the their 20's on the west coast because of this problem. Your best bet is to make no money, and knock up someone on ""accident"". 

Most of this comes from the large amount of debt these women are in because of the pressure for women in colleges. Then when these women graduate they have sex with their bosses and request promotions otherwise they claim rape. This lowers men's wages because they are competing in an unfair environment and their is a larger workforce. 

Now these women (glorified whores), some say they are trying to be ""queens"" or royalty, but royalty means they can give birth and raise children which most of them can't. You can always turn a house wife into a whore but not the other way around. These women are tricked into doing this because people tell them they are attractive so someone will marry them, but in reality no one marries these people and they resort to dirty tricks in order to fool men into marriage. They drain their time, cash, and try to give them STDs so they won't have the opportunity to marry someone that is actually worth marrying. 

Most of this comes from weak men, who instead of building a band of brothers try to compete by lowering the bar (i.e. allowing their partner to sleep with others (usually starts with swinging)) or by bringing other men down in order to try to be competitive. You want the real red pill? the game is over, women are forming unions and men should do the same. There are basically pimps that go around and trick these women into being whores and once they hit 26-30 they realize oh fuck I want to get married and have kids. No one marries a slag. 

If you are a women in college and you want to actually live a happy life, go find someone that makes you feel in love and stay with them. Help each other out, because once you have kids you both need to help each other not hurt each other which is what slags do.

(you can skip this part if you do not care)

First of all I like to thank each and everyone of you, from our endorsed contributors to those that simply upvote quality posts. You changed my life and only for the best, for that you have my eternal gratitude.

So, what was I like 6 months ago ? Well, I used to be a true incel, for the 19 first years of my life (I'm almost 20 now), I was a kissless virgin. I did not win the genetic lottery (but I'm not ugly either, I have a pretty decent face, my downsides are that I am not tall (5'7), have acne and no facial hair) so the bluepill had devastating effects on me that I still struggle to remove. Like many of you did, I used to put women on a pedestral, a high one, to the point that I felt uncomfortable making eye contact with random women on the street. Needless to say until I swallowed TRP I had little to no experience with women. 


The bluepill told me that it was all okay though, that I had time, that I'll find a woman who'll like me for who I am, that I did not need to improve, to lift, to be a better person etc. BULLSHIT.
My social life wasn't any better, I only had a few friends and almost no close friends, I was just that very nice guy people did not really care about.


So what happened ? I actually only discovered this sub 6 months ago but had been familiar with some of the terminology and teachings.
Reading the posts made me realize how wrong my path was and that I needed to change, quickly. 
So I thought to myself *dude you need to get shit done asap, life won't magically get any better.*
So I progressively started to change, I improved little by little. I picked up my true passion : fishkeeping, learned to be more disciplined, started reading about intrusting things, started lifting, bought nicer clothes and tried to get out of my comfort.


And then I started to improve socially, all the changes I'm about list here were made in less than 2 months, when I became disciplined enough  :
I started to make eye contact with people and progressively learned how to control my emotions (for me holding frame is the most important aspect of TRP), I stopped being insecure about not being accepted into the tribe I finally spoked what was onto my mind at the moment, I learned the basic tricks to keep a conversation going, but most importantly, I stopped staying at home all the time and started partying with my friends.


I became more confident than ever, more attractive than ever and higher social status than ever. A few ago I did was I never thought I was capable to : I approached a random girl (I only did it because I had a good excuse to make conversation) and you guys were right, it's pretty fucking easy, approach anxiety is such an irrational fear. Anyways I got this girl's snapchat but it didn't worked, still, achieving this was already a big victory for me.


###Field Report :
So 2 days ago we had a haloween party organised by the school, it started pretty late so before I went to a friend's appartment to celebrate his birthday, I had a great time and spoke to so many people. Then I started drinking, not big quantities, but I kept drinking, way more than I should and before I knew it, I was drunk.
We went to the haloween party at 0:30 and for the next two hours of the party I barely have any memories.


However was I clearly remember is that things were started between me and a girl slightly taller than me, when I got too close to her, she told me I was too short for her (she's 5'8 and I'm 5'7) but I simply told her that it really did not matter and apparently that was enough to pass the shit test because the next minute we were kissing. We made out a few times over the course of several minutes then we parted ways.
A few minutes later, I find myself dancing very closely with another girl, after a moment I went for the kiss and it worked, once again, we made out a few times and then she told that she didn't want things to go any further than this so I told her it was fine and left.


This, gentlemen, is what happens we you aren't hold back by your anxious mind, that you enter the IDGAF mode. Being drunk released my true potential, simply by making me daring. The only limits you have are the ones you set yourself, don't forget about that. Still, even drunk  I didn't escalate things with the girls but honestly that wasn't my goal at that time, actually succeeding with girls was already satisfying enough to me.


Anyways now I know my real worth, that I have the potential to do what must be done, I will finally be able to lose my virginity !


The morals of the story are that TRP is life, that the bluepill sucks, that you need to stop holding yourself back.


To all my fellow beginners : you may feel hopeless, or that it's not worth it but the truth is there is hope for each and everyone of you. Just give it time and never fucking give up because the results are always worth the suffering. As for myself, I still have so so so much to learn but I'm glad I made it this far.

She starts show high interest, asking me question about what I do, giving me fuck me eyes, it felt like I entered the club on easy mode. 

She asks me to dance, fuck it why not. So she starts grinding into me and i'm feeling her up escalating kino. After that we head to the smoke pit just to get outside because the club music ois pretty loud.

Now this is where the shit test start happening. She brings up politics and says shes a liberal. She looks at me and I say ""oh yeah?"" She changes the conversation pretty quick. Next shit test she says ""you know i'm not going home with you right?"" Which I reply by laughing in her face and saying ""I wasnt planning on it"" when I passed that shit test i'm telling you her facial reaction looked like she got shot she was so suprised. 

I tell her I am meeting up with friends down a block at the strip club in 15 minutes. She ditches her friends and comes with me. Now we are at the stripclub I meet up with the boys and we go up to this nice 2nd floor patio it has. Im having a good time with my other friends. Anyway mid way through the girl gets up and starts talking to some other guys. I stay with my group of friends. Even my buddys said ""hey man looks like your girl is hitting up some other guys"" I learn in and say ""i'm not that worried about it"" to which my friend starts laughing out loud.

The girl notices us having a good time and comes back to the group. I then ask my buddy if he can get me ride home if I buy him a beer. Hes down and the girl looks at me right away and says she'll come too. What a shocker. I played it off.

I'm a 40 year old in a LTR (not married). Not very handsome, not very tall, however I have normal height for my country. I lift 2 o 3 times per week and I'm quite fit. Last week I went to a night club with a friend, felt weird doing it at my age but I said fuck it, lets do it.

So we arrived at this place and it was filled with girls, more than half were women. And then they started talking to me, immediately. I did't have any interest in any of them, I was there with my friends, but the girls would talk to my friend about me, and invite me to the conversation. Then some would straight touch my face. A girl started talking to me like a psycho and wont leave me alone while rubbing her tits on me. It was crazy, It felt genuinely uncomfortable. Not all girls were this way but many were, and it never had happened to me before I was about 40 and started lifting. 

So this is the difference between being outside and being inside the 20%. It's like another world, and I never had felted so uncomfortable with so much attention.

End result : That night I fucked a thin 20 year old girl with huge tits but that's not the message. The message is, get into the 20% and then forget about game or anything else. I could have fucked any girl in there, just by asking. I don't really care at my age, being 40 I no longer want to fuck anything that moves, maybe girls can see this lack of interest and is part of their positive reaction.

I'd link to it but I can't figure out how to do that with the new sub rules.

The main impetus for posting was that it involved an internet-savvy woman who had already been *told* what TRP is. By a lurker here. Somebody tried telling her all about fight club while simultaneously trying to fuck her. Get *that* shit through your head.

It was halfway a call-out thread, halfway me pleading with those of you who can't reconcile yourselves with reality to get a grip.

I hardly ever log into this account because, obviously, why would I post here using my main? I come back and I see another message asking if the slut from that story was *his* slut! ""Tell me bro, did her name start with a 'V'?"" I also got a few from users claiming to be women saying ""hot story.""

Now more than ever, red is changing. Even with the quarantine, people run their fucking mouths too much. People get butthurt about Amy dumping them and wander in here hoping to find a fast track plan to their unicorn. Peacocking and negging because they aren't ready to live outside of a club-night costume.

I myself have been monk for a while, enjoying what pussy comes my way but dedicating my focus to equally important pursuits. All the while I'm quiet. Women casually come and I never bother to stop them from going. I'm happy and things are low-stress. That's what real RP is. Quiet, calculated. Tranquil on the surface.

My girl hits me up after she gets her nails done and asks to meet, well since I'm out already I meet up at some spot and chat a bit, send her off to do her house work and then I decide to relax. Since it was her last day of period, I was like fine, she felt uncomfortable to have sex about it since there was still some blood so I said fuck it, I go on grabbing some booze with my mates and decide to take my dose of prescribed benzo medication at the specific hour..

Now since benzos do decrease libido and make your dick half-limp, knowing that fact I was fine until I got a call from the girl, saying that her period is fully over and she's just had a bath, and wanted to meet up. God I was not in the mood, so I tell her that it's fine, we meet up in 3 hours, go for a beer, and then get her to my place. During the whole date I was flirting and gaming like a superstar, I just let myself get the best of my confidence and enjoy it literally, chill and suave.

Now, here's the good part, I set up a low lighting on my room, got some massage oil and slowly started undressing each other, bringing chemistry on it's peak. As we're both fully naked, I push her down to the bed and suddenly decide to wear my tie shirtless, yes I was kind of high and it came. Then I said "" Tonight, we're trying something new.. "" My way. I always do what I want and lust in bed with women so this time being anxious about my erection I decided to drop it all and give my best shot at it without **giving a fuck**. 

I started slowly spreading some oil over her back and immediately down her ass, my girl usually doesn't like it when I try to finger her this way as she feels tickling, per her say, this time it fucking worked miracle though. I believe because I set up a strong and DGAF frame about what's next, and kept it mysterious, I kept doing and doing stuff this way and then said "" You will do as I say, no complaints. "" She says yes.. I start going down on her while she's lying on her back, this had never happened to me before. I got horny as fuck and proceeded doing the same while she turned the other way and, I just, put, my cock in her pussy for like 30 seconds and she ran off to the fucking toilet to squirt (Yeah she's shy squirting in front of me, I only managed to do this 2 times after pushing for it but in general I don't like being a cunt and needy for shit like this) 

This hadn't happened after a long time guys, all I want to say is us men should get creative and stimulate women by **mystery**, mystery is indeed very important in bed too. I usually play roles like I'm the ambassador in a hotel and she's the room service or my assistant and we fuck like crazy but tonight was something new and exciting to me and her both, I found out things about sex I didn't even fucking know worked miracles. Hell I started the massage and mystery play just to get down on her because I thought I wouldn't get horny because of the benzos. Fuck, to my luck it turned around.

Yhen it comes to dating, you CANNOT generalize an entire population because of a bad experience you had with that person in your past. By letting this drive the flow of your future relationships you are NOT getting “back” at that past offense, and you are NOT moving on from it, either. Being single and bouncing from one encounter to the next is your choice, as it is a that person of your interest’s choice to do the same, but do not be surprised if you find a sense of “completeness” to be missing. It is not a sign that you’ve “moved on” by sleeping with other people, it’s your ability to make new experiences and to build a better, brighter, and more prosperous relationship than your last that signifies that.

You’re not “liberated” from the confines of your “former self” by breaking off a perfectly healthy relationship with another person, or even aspect of yourself, in this rat-race for the perfect mate in the search for the fabled “greener pastures”. This is a lie and there are always plenty of people out there, many of whom frequent this subreddit, who will make that promise to you.

TheRedPill should be about helping others perform tasks or get involved in healthy hobbies that will build their characters and, as a side effect of this change in behavior or dedication to a new hobby, allows the person to discover things about themselves and better shape their views of the world around them. Prioritizing yourself is admirable, but make sure you aren’t trying to change the person you are by climbing over the hearts of others. That’s how you make asshole men and bitch women.

Be honest with what you want from women.

Your aware and clear that there are no unicorns. So give up that search for one. You looking for some strange to fuck. That is what it boils down to. If you enjoy her cooking and company, that is another matter for you to decide if you want to have her around and continue giving your time to her. But at the end of the day your looking for chicks to fuck.

You need to be out there getting phone numbers, approaching and building recruits to your team. I don't care if your lifting or not. If you think you need to stop drinking and doin drugs or not. Get more money or not. Talk to women and be clear with your intentions quickly and elegantly. Do not over think your approaches or what you think you need to say. Use your logic to convince her emotional bullshit, that she would be better off having sex with you. Know that you are better than her because of reasons x, y, and z. If you do not have reasons xyz of why your better than her, then your next task is already known.

I feel this sub is starting to get off course with this and that. And the main point to everyone coming here is to get more ass. You felt in your gut something was wrong and that you wanted and needed more booty. Game is a way to get ass by bypassing her emotional smokescreens and deflections and just getting down to the point. Tell the girl you took on a date or two who didnt give it up, that the reason your spending your valuable time with her is because you wanted to fuck.

Why is it fair for her to waste your time and not give you pussy? Why is it ok for her to give you nothing and you give her everything? That is because you let it happen. There is no shortage of girls, women, bitches, slut or hoes. Get to a yes or no faster. Call out her illogical crap when you identify it.

Its going to be damn hard to find your purpose or direction or focus in your life when you got all your brain power consumed with needing some strange.

A tactic that has been hugely helpful for me, that i got from listening to Patrice Oneal on the Black Philip show, is that he sees some chick he wants as just having finished fuckin 4 dudes right before he saw her. Or that when his girl goes to take a pee, he assumes that she blew some rando on the way to the bathroom. He sees that all women are capable of being a whore at anytime for whatever reason she feels and that essentially there is not a thing he can do about it, if he is not physically there with her. This always keeps his paradigm or viewpoint in a place that will not allow him to feel that she is special and at the same time knowing she is down to fuck.

Adopt this mentality friends. Don't fall in love with women but rather just like them for what they are. Once you climb through the frustration of not having your sexual needs met, Life gets more clear. Learn the manipulations and selfish arrogant egotism of women. Feel nothing of rejection. Feel nothing of whatever their number count is. Feel nothing for what they think they want. Just get what you need or stop giving her your time.

I believe just being yourself is good advice but most dont know who they are. When you start to uncover who you are and what women are, it will become much easier to try and connect with the girls you want to be with, from a righteous place. A place where you won't feel bad or shame or guilt at all for expressing your need to women. Be completely damn honest with yourself. When you see a hot girl walk by, whats the first thought that pops in your head? I guarantee its not ""gosh, i would love to learn about her personality and take her to a movie and dinner 5 times before I would feel comfortable inserting my penis in her.""

Before I describe things of note that I learnt... a quick summary of my circumstances in life.  


I'm 33, divorced, I have a 2.5 yo son with primary custody of 4 days/4 nights per week, I'm very successful (so far anyway) at my career (Software engineer and tech stock trader),  I've managed to buy my own new luxury 2 bedroom apartment (In Sydney Australia) (Despite divorce) and I own/drive my childhood dream car with the money I make.... I NEVER want to marry again and I'm unlikely to commit to a long term relationship again... but those statements are stories for another time.  


I'm a good looking guy, most women I fuck tell me this... the older I get the better looking I've become...weirdly... I'm lucky... I'm not trying to boast and I know how it sounds...  I never got told I was good looking until I started lifting and eating clean... I used to be skinny, pimply and pathetic... it is what it is...... anyway......... After my divorce I fucked at least 30 women in the space of 12 months on tinder,   


And of those women, I briefly properly dated 2 of them, both were extremely beautiful but the problem was both (at some point) wanted to have their own families, one was 29 (Eurasian filipino/Australia) and one was 26 Turkish. The Turkish girl was the type of women a man should/could marry, she was extremely protective of her man, and extremely conservative with her man, caring about my wellbeing ... shit she'd wake up early to do my house chores and fold my clothes... I remained skeptical of her long term, but she was clearly an amazing women to have in your life as an ally and to have a family, she was very friendly and accepting of my son... but she wanted to have her own family and she wanted marriage.... as our fuckfest relationship matured this became more and more apparent... her friend inviting her back to turkey for a wedding celebration was the final straw....as she wanted me to come... as much as I knew she was beautiful and loyal and relatively untainted by western feminism... I had to cut it off sharp. I told her If I hadn't already had a son and hadn't already been married I know for a fact that I would have made a much wiser choice to be with her... anyway I can't be in a proper relationship again, the risks are simply more than I can afford to lose.  


Now if you've ever been married or married/divorced... and you're a man... you will know that marriage is a stressful risky thing... to put it politely... fraught with serious life threatening risks statistically speaking... I wont go into the details but after the Turkish girl I realised I only wanted NSA with women til the day I die, so I updated my tinder profile to: ""Only looking for fun, and swapped out one of my face picks for a gym abs pic at a peak abs moment."" ... I reduced the maximum age from 31 to 25.... which reduced my tinder hits considerably so I rewrote it to allow for plausible deniability to: ""Looking for a CoD Zombies co-op partner"" which improved my ability to get the under 25 demographic around for a drink and playstation before seducing them into becoming my fuck toy for the remainder of the night.  


But still I would only really be able to get 5's, 6's and 7's around on demand... I simply didn't have the genes and/or photos to attract the truly beautiful women around reliably on demand... one evening once my son was put to bed I started browsing ""Seeking Arrangements""......   


Suddenly a smorgasbord of 8's/9's/10's in an seemingly endless supply around Sydney was presented to me like a catalogue... almost every profile reading descriptions like ""Only in it for non sexual mentorship/arrangements aka nice dinners/holidays/events""...   


Could these profiles be fake? I had to understand it all entirely....  


My SA profile simple said ""Seeking NSA"", and I messaged a handful of these women, some women messaged me... some as young as 18, but the average age around 22 years old... I told them my situation honestly... and that I wanted NSA... every single one of them was completely fine to fuck for money... or PPM . (Pay per meet) as they called it...  


The epiphany moment had hit... they all have profiles that say they don't want a sexual relationship but that was to both hide their true intentions in case someone they knew found them but also to politely decline men they didnt want to fuck... I realised maybe 33% of our young women were available as whores for the right 'arrangement'.  


Some women would straight off the bat say their price, I would offer half. Sometimes they wouldnt reply for a day, but they were always happy to take half price if it was a week night... on demand. They would haggle I would remain firm they would happily oblige...  


For the first time in my life I was able to fuck 9's and 10's for almost no effort for 2 hours worth of after tax work... no effort at all... like watching porn but far more pleasurable.  


I fucked an ex olympic russian gymnast, an 8 but her photos were a 9 and a 21yo mother of a 1yo who doesnt know who the father is... a solid 9 who had signed up 24 hours after I signed up... who charged me maybe 1/4 of the amount someone of her beauty could be charging... to this day the hottest women I've ever fucked... and may have completely destroyed my minds inclination for pair bonding forever.  


It's been 2 weeks since I signed up, I'm doing a 5 day weights training regime atm, so my balls are constantly needing to be drained... so both occasions have been out of the planet amazing... each time ordering her over once my Son has gone to sleep... sharing a couple of glasses of wine and going well over time to fuck and chat and listen to music... listening to their view of the world unfiltered by any expectations...   


Pure honest sex.  


The one thing that I learnt scrolling through the endless sea of our next generation of girls selling themselves covertly... was how transactional their minds were about the whole process... and how indifferent their minds were to the transaction... sex was a bit of frivilous fun to them calculated not just on money but on the quality and success of the man fucking them... it wasnt just that I was paying them but that my body was that of a body builder and that my perception of success was that of at least above the average man. Women are transactional with sex... it is men who are the 'romantics'.  


The transaction wasn't as simple as money for sex of course even if it was a major factor... these women still needed a certain type of seduction to open their legs (or mouth) and become my slutty cum dumpster for an evening... whereas a traditional whore would have charged 4x the amount... women on sugar daddy websites needed certain assurances if they were going to fuck, no-questions-asked, and they were prepared to take 25% the market rate if the guy was clearly trustworthy free of the more darker and questionable BDSM kinks that old school whores must generally cater to... at market rates no less....  


It struck me however as I scrolled the infinite sea of women, that these women were just cute/innocent friendly looking college or traveller girls looking to make some extra cash and extra connections with some fun somewhere in between that. These were women who will certainly go on to marry our young lads of today... and be mothers and naturally divorcees expecting their child support money...  it occurred to me that my ex wife was one of this type of women... another story for another time.  


I've fucked 2 of them so far, but I'll fuck a lot more with my fun money before I'm done as I learn to seduce them with the whole  ""50 shades of grey 'just-this-once-plausible-deniability'"" that they need to become whores without anyone knowing including themselves.  


I've decided I'm going to fuck one 8/9/10 a week for the rest of the year as a weekly reward for my serious diet and training... as the relaxation of doing so is so superior that it lifts my mood so considerably that the risks and concerns around it are far outweighed by benefits.  


What a time to be alive.

I'm not sure if this is the place to put this, but if anyone can help me, you guys can. Like the title says, I'm on a downward spiral. Three months ago things were going great, I was working an internship during my summer break, I had multiple plates spinning, and hooked up several times, but now everything's stagnating.

Body:
I'm in my junior year of undergrad, and I'm totally disillusioned by the way my course is going. I'm studying a creative field, and let's just say I don't believe in my school's philosophy. They insist on teaching us meaningless garbage that's so vague and general, while I have a goal and a specialization I want to learn about. The internship I worked was at a small company and it taught me a lot about the stuff I needed. I slept with a co-worker, had an active social life with my work friends, and rented an apartment in a pretty great neighborhood, so I was around bars and nightclubs. I loved working.

Now that I'm back in school I'm back to studying the same banal horseshit spouted by pretentious cunts who call themselves professors. I know I should just grind through it and get my ass out of here as soon as possible. I've been hired for another internship next summer at a top tech firm, it's a huge deal, but I do need to grind the rest of the year out.

It's just so hard to keep motivated. My social life has plummeted. Now that I'm not working anymore I'm broke, and can't afford(the time or the money) to go to clubs much. I haven't had sex since the summer and I've been jerking it like a man possessed, sometimes 4-5 times a day. It always feels like shit afterwards.

I've lost my gym schedule and finding it really hard to get back. I can't get back on my diet without a fridge, so I'm living on shitty hostel food. Although I haven't bounced back to my pre-TRP weight (200lbs), I can feel that I'm slowly putting on weight.

In conclusion, I need to do the following:
1) Get some form of diet back.
2) get a gym routine.
3) grind out the next 1.5 years of college, and then get a job. 
4) work my ass off at the next internship so they hire me when I graduate.

Women love men with long eyelashes
2. They love it when a man is being flamboyant for fun, because most men are afraid of doing that when they are seen as masculine
3. They love the soft side of men
4. They melt when a man makes them a very gentle compliment about yheir own softness
5. Giving them a soft touch or hug as if they were your daughter/son, who you deeply love

From my own experience with gaming around 500 women, I need no game at all when I just do one of those 4 things above and that’s it.

I just chat to them normal, build some mild, no try hard rapport, very mild kino, maybe a soft touch and they listen to me for hours, crave another touch, another compliment, but I don’y give it. Maybe once every hour I give it. 

The rest I just talk about life with them, education, business, personal growth, but not too deep, just drop a few deep wisdoms here and there.

Women crave the softness of another human, especially from a man is very addictive to them, because then they can connect it with their own softness. It is a very cathartic experience to them.

They won’t leave you for another dude in the club/bar. Instead they will ask you for your number, ask you if you come with them to the next bar and be there for them and make them feel good.

However, only being feminine won’t close the deal. You need to have lots of masculinity within you if you want to attract women with your feminine qualities.

Your hug can be very soft, but if you’re muscular it will directly give her tingles. If you have a good perfume it will give her tingles. If your voice has a good and low tonality, it will give her tingles.

Finally, you should be 70% normal, neutral, 20% feminine and 10% somewhat masculine and relaxed for this strategy.

You can sprinkle in a few emotional spikes, but keep it at ease and not too much.

At last, after around one hour to can increase the masculinity a bit once your femininity has her eating out of your hands. Then, she will submit to yourself and you can do with her whatever you want to do sometimes.

For context I have been reading about the red pill as a skeptic.  Even while first accepting some things as true as I have been able to verify it with my own experience, I was still hesitant to jump to the idea that, well... AWALT.  I’ve read some comments that have helped soften the blow that a hard truth might have.  Such as we say AWALT, not because literally every girl is like that, but because if you knew 9/10 a gun is loaded, you would approach it as if it were loaded.  I am still searching for what is the wisest way to approach women, even if I want to hold out hope for a long shot blue pill fantasy, I know to protect myself first.  It also helps that showing boundaries is attractive.  Ironically the less attracted I am to women, the more I just want to better myself because I recognize their immature nature, I want better for myself, I love myself, both caring-ly and tough love as best as I recognize when and how.  It’s becoming disgusting, I offered love before, it wasn’t wanted.  I don’t offer myself, and now I’m supposedly hot... yeah, ok.

I grew up believing in traditional values, I still believe in traditional values.  I just believe they are under attack now more than ever before in my life.  Three of the movies of my childhood were the Sam Raimi trilogy of the spider man movies.  I know they can be campy, cheesy but they had a lot of love poured into them.  I loved that I heard uncle Ben tell about great power comes great responsibility, that Peter knew what he had to fight for and his willingness to protect and be there for Mary Jane when he could, although he had a more pressing responsibility and couldn’t always be there.  I wanted to be spider man, not literally dawning a mask and powers, but to be my equivalent.  As good natured as you can get, and always fighting for what matters.

These memories are fuzzy, but one thing stood out to me.  I had someone take me to these movies or talk to me after having watched them.  I feel like it was the former.  The person who I’m not remembering said something that I felt very negative at the time, I made a face and shook my head to get it out of me that instant.  It was simply, “A boy becomes a man when he realizes there is nothing special about Mary Jane.”  I hated that.  I knew there had to be something special about, even if she wasn’t special to me, she was special to Peter.  He saw something in her, they loved each other, and they needed each other.  That’s what I believed.

Several years had passed and I found someone who I believed to be my Mary Jane.  Someone who shared my values.  She said she wanted a husband, and after getting married, to not really have any guy friends.  She wanted to be a full time mother.  We had some of the same weaknesses, quirks, and similarities others couldn’t help but notice.  We were asked if we were related.  I knew she liked me, she let me know she broke up with her boyfriend out of the blue.  I didn’t get the hint at first, but when I did, something made me paranoid.  She left him, because she wanted me to ask her out.  I don’t know what her reasoning was, but I knew she was acting on feelings.  I wasn’t willing to date her at first because I didn’t want to date someone who thinks I’ll date this person until someone better comes along.  Something told me to hold off.  I thought if she didn’t date anyone for a while, it would be ok for me to date her because it really is love for me.  She couldn’t wait, she dated every mutual friend, none of them worked.  Was breaking the guys heart that was her boyfriend.  One day she said she met this guy at a knife shop, he was into raves and did some drugs.  Said he was great in many ways.  My gut felt the writing on the wall.  I made myself scarce.  It saved me a lot of heart ache, but it was not avoidable.  Her ex told me the story.  She was caught with this stranger in her parents house, eating her out.  I was a wreck for a while.  I found out she threw up she was so upset because her ex wouldn’t take her back and that she had permanently changed the course of her life.  She showed interest in talking to me again when I just wanted to patch things up as friends, but I felt an unwillingness.  I wanted to apologize for not being there, but I couldn’t do it with this feeling she was interested in me.  At some point in our sparse conversations I found out she was going through a new break up.  She was acting indifferent to the guy who couldn’t accept her for having an affair.  Her reasoning was that the guy made multiple passes at her.  I offered to tell her why that might bother some guys, she went on talking about something that showed she wouldn’t listen.  Next time I met her, she wasn’t interested to see me, she had a boyfriend.  At this point, I was mad, but I knew that I dodged a bullet, and needed to let things pass.

Recently I have been watching some new marvel movies that I missed out on.  This included the latest spider man movies.  I liked them, but I wanted to listen to some of my favorite critics.  I don’t mind sharing them in the comments, but not here.  This post’s purpose isn’t for their promotion.  One criticism was that he just seemed to be in it as a kid wanting to have fun.  He didn’t seem to have a sense of responsibility.  Even if everyone is sick of uncle Ben dying, he is still intrinsic to the emotional growth of that character.  I felt that, and I went back and watched some of the old movies.

I still love them, but that quote came back to haunt me.  There is no doubt to me, the one who said it must have been red pilled before I even knew it was a thing.  I realized there is nothing special about Mary Jane.  The first movie, I thought she just doesn’t know what he has to do, if she did, she would be loyal.  Second movie showed, yes now she knows, now she knows she needs to support him.  The third movie, no loyalty stayed.  She was messing around with his best friend.  Some could say it was done for drama, the thing is though, it feels all too realistic.

All this made me consider where my life was going.  We haven’t talked in a long time.  I still had her on social media till recently.  Since I knew that I was becoming more attractive, and she may come to see me as some some beta for her at some point when her current relationship goes south if she has one, I am not going to pick up the pieces of her heart that she so recklessly gave away.  I’ve removed her from my socials.  I’m willing to be a friend on my terms if she’s willing, but nothing more.  It’s been years since she caused us all so much heartache.  Now though I feel it’s finally consolidated into something that is making me really look forward in my life, forward to good times and bad.  I still need guidance and wisdom.  Right now though,  I feel I can’t help but say to myself “A boy becomes a man when he realizes there is nothing special about Mary Jane.”",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,“A boy becomes a man when he realizes there is nothing special about Mary Jane.”,0,1572153223.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dke39m/a_boy_becomes_a_man_when_he_realizes_there_is/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

What value to you have to offer? what value do you have to offer your struggling brothers and the parasitic women that want to steal/use your genetic code to create copies of themselves?

A man without value is the lowest level of being a person. A women without value doesnt exist until she becomes ugly. She is born with value through the idea of you wanting to have sex with her imagined juicy vagina. This is the core of how she operates.

Thus the only purpose for men is to create value. Whether that be through money or skills or persona or even being a court jester. Value is what is needed. This is the reason why being an attractive man, based solely on looks, is not enough. Women will constantly be looking for more to pull from you. Constantly looking for ways to lower your value, because at the end of the day, she wants to win. Women want to win, they live to compete but they only want to compete in theaters they know they can win in. They do not have the intellectual ability nor the drive or curiosity to keep going into the unknown. Yet they still burn with wanting to win. This is why you dont see girls who are competing in high level activities such as chess or poker or to put it even more regular for you normies, why she wont play video games against you or even with you. She can not ever allow herself to be seen as weak. She can never allow herself to be exposed to the weakness of herself. She will use every tactic possible, fueled by her ego to deflect the true reasoning of her flaws and shortcomings. She is timid. She is egotistical and arrogant. She has created a life free of faults, rejections, and self reflection. Tell me if this sounds familiar to how you live your own life?

To fall prey to a womens bullshit, will signal to the woman that you are beneath her. Your are not worth genetically replicating with. But at the same time, it does not mean that she will not be at your side because you provide her stability and love. Women dont give a fuck about love. Love only exists in the mind of men, and they know this exists in you and will use this against you at any/every opportunity. They are only looking out for what is stronger than them, to produce higher level children. This is how this physical plane of existence works. Your feelings do not men shit.

All men are born with a sickness that can not be alleviated, unless one fucks chicks. Sure snuggling is nice. Sure having her do shit for you is nice. But the only way to satisfy the urge is through fucking her. Fucking her with such utter recklessness that it borders on gross, is the highest form of alleviating this urge for the longest period of time. Men are searching for this post nut clarity. Searching for that feeling that will keep them from being obsessed with pussy, so that they may satisfy there next need of curiosity. Women know deep down inside that they are essentially without use or purpose, that all there gains in life have been given to them through there vagina and manipulation of the men around them. This makes them feel upset, hollow inside. This is why if you submit to a women she will lash out and continue to feed off your loss of manhood, fore you never deserved it in the first place. 

Ask yourself a simple question, why do men give their power to women? Its obviously not a conscious decision but by precise tactical manipulation, by her. No man would just take all his money and start giving it away to random chicks for no reason. He is expecting something in return because men operate in reciprocity. He is a fool, fore he still believes that women are his equal and operate on similar, seemingly fair, principles. 

Get your value up men. Learn more skills. Be more unattached to life and especially above all women. Your purpose and true happiness and potential is at stake.

Some girls realize their dogs don't like it when they pet other dogs, they get angry at the whiff of another dog's scent. They don't like other dog hair around. Respectfully, she will clean herself up properly, and now her dog doesn't have a clue. No matter how much she loves her dog, there will always be other cute dogs out there to pet. Some girls will form a strong bond with their dog, they will know not to pet other dogs, so they won't, except, every now and again, she'll have strong urges to do so. She can only contain herself for so long before she slips up. Very few never slip up, but they'll get close. *Dangerously* close. This is ""the one"". This is the best you can hope for in a LTR woman in this world. Someone that will almost cheat on you, who will seriously consider it, but will resist the temptation. This is what you should set your expectations to. She's human, and so are you. You're not any more a perfect unicorn than she is.

With my first gf, I went through her phone one day after we were fighting, found out she met her ex-bf at a bar for drinks. Confronted her. Her excuse was she wanted ""closure"". Most likely they banged, or at least made out, but it's hard to say. Either way that was a hard line for me. I dumped her, and started my red pill journey. I think that first month was the most painful month of my life. I blocked her on everything. *Everything*. She created new email accounts and would send me long emails telling me how much she loves me. I sometimes mistakenly sent back angry emails. Pretty stupid of me. It just prolonged the pain. Went radio silent for a couple of months. Started dating a new girl. Virgin. Kind. Super into me. I was damaged from my last relationship. Went through her facebook messages one night. Poor guy from another country she's been talking to for the last few years, who was planning to move to be with her. Their messages were like a Disney fairy tale, except, the messages got colder since she met me. She was aloof, short, and distant with him in her messages. He noticed it. He asked her why she's willing to throw everything away, everything they've been planning for years. She couldn't tell him the truth. I confronted her. Demoted to plate. Banged her a few months, she started putting on some weight, I lost my attraction, dumped her. This was 6 years ago. She's still with him now.

Went on to plate my first gf after this experience. First gf was trying to win me back hard, I tried to ignore it. She was seeing another guy during the time I was plating her. Beta me was trying to rationalize getting back with her. Look at all this effort she's putting in. Driving hours to see me, giving me long blowjobs, wild sex, dressing up for me, etc. It was a slippery slope. One night I saw her other guy message her, and reality hit me like a truck... What the hell was I doing. I had to get out. I snapped at her and told her she messed with me the first time and there's no point in giving this another shot. Ghosted her for my own sanity. She freaked out. A couple of weeks later I started dating a cute nerdy Italian girl I've been casually chatting with over the last few months. She had a boyfriend the entire time I was chatting with her. I never thought much of it, I didn't think she liked me, I just enjoyed the conversations we had. When she and her bf broke up, she asked me to hang out. She came over with some friends, they brought drinks. She walked into my apartment looking adorably cute and put together. I asked her what's up how's life? She sat right next to me, looked at me with her big cute eyes, and told me she broke up with her BF. This was the first thing she said to me. I fucked her 8 times that night. Raw. She never had sex without a condom, thought she should try it out. She was on birth control (the ring) so I knew she wasn't lying. Wasn't a fan of condoms at that time myself. Came on her, in her, around her, everywhere. My ex gf found out I started seeing a new girl from one of my roommates that had a crush on her. She sent me long emails again. I read them, didn't respond, but was considering her words. Luckily I decided to move on for good, and became completely indifferent to her.

Dated the Italian girl for about 2 years. She had a couple of red flags at the beginning, I confronted right away, she took every step to fix everything. Eviscerated her beta orbiters. No going to parties without me or without checking in with me on her plans. If a guy messaged her anything dubious she would show me right away. No secrets. Met her family. Big family. They loved me. All of them. Nothing but nice things to say about me. She was on her best behaviour 24/7 with me. Not a single red flag, not a single bad gut feeling, completely polar opposite of my last girlfriend. This is the girl that guys dream about but never find. She was everything I thought I wanted. I got bored. Cheated on her. Opened the relationship up against her wishes, started fucking hotter smarter girls. I outgrew her. She was dying inside, I could tell, but she wanted to continue to work it out with me even though she had no interest in other men. I couldn't do it to her. Had to break up with her. She understood. We had breakup sex. She cried. She told me after that her family was disappointed in her, for not being able to make things work out with me. I'm an asshole, but it's what this world made me. I'm working on it, one day at a time.

Since then I've dated, I've plated, I've had ONS, I've broken hearts, I've even had my heart broken (sort of). I dated two amazing women, for a year, at the same time. Never let it get serious, but they were the highest quality women I've ever been with in my life. Still wasn't interested in settling down. It hurt that I had to leave them, but I can't stray from my mission. I caught the oneitis bug a couple of times too, when I let my guard down. But I never overly invested and always kept the girls at a distance. I have the weapons at my disposal to quickly get rid of my oneitis bug. It gets easier each time.

My first gf opened my eyes to women's nature. I ended up ghosting my first gf for like 5 years because I genuinely could not give a fuck about her anymore, because I definitely outgrew her. Last year she randomly popped back into my life  through instagram. She had a bf, a house, a dog. She was getting married. 1 month before her wedding she was blowing up my instagram with DMs pouring her heart out to me. She hasn't been able to forget about me. Every single day she thinks about me. She's living a lie. She loves her fiancee but she loves me too. How could this be happening? I was her best she said. Best boyfriend she's ever had. She still watches videos from when we were together. She thinks I'm way hotter now. Wants to meet up. I amused it for a bit and teased her a bit, but then I put a hard stop to it. Reminded her she's getting married and to start acting right. Told her I have zero feelings for her, I've moved on. Nothing she can do. I'm fucking hotter, smarter, better women than her. I told her that I am happy for her, and I want what's best for her. I told her I need to block her, this isn't healthy. I will not fuck around with someone getting married. After a while of calming her down, she agreed that I needed to block her. I completely understand the term Alpha Widow now. She has a kid now with this guy.

I've been in crazy situations with women my whole life. Each one, a new story. Each one, totally crazy. Still growing, still learning, still improving. Nowhere near my peak. About to hit 30, plan on being single a long time. Long rant but I hope it helps some of you guys. I've had the bad girlfriend and I've had the perfect wifey girlfriend. Both didn't work out. At the end of the day, what you're left with is yourself.

Context: Reading my textbook on Ancient Greek History for a college course.

Ch 2 and the textbook is already demonizing a patriarchal society for migrating to Greece from Anatolia (basically modern day Turkey, a Muslim (patriarchal) state) and conquering the indigenous people there. The book then goes on to describe the indegenous people as ""generally egalitarian, peaceful, and matrifocal (centered on women as mothers)"". My first thought, so strong I even said it out loud to myself without meaning to, ""Yeah, that's why they got conquered. Now I have to wonder who it's going to be to repeat history and conquer America.""

Tying this into game as best I can with my limited experience, I'd say this is strong, if unintentional, evidence by the woke authors of my textbook why men should lead in their relationships with women. I believe the reason we don't read about successful matriarchal civilizations is because any that ever existed were wiped out like this example. The best that historians can do is hypothesize what they were like, while societies ruled by strong men are all we have evidence of.

There's a strong chance you already know enough here to thrive, and basic principles will get you laid in the process.

I've been here for years, I've read all the books in the megafile, the top 1000 posts, and every blog on the Manosphere. I'm a sophomore in college. The vast majority of this was mental masturbation and wasted time, turns out just being a friendly dude and getting bitches near alcohol is enough to get laid at our age.

The truth is, if you're a young man, you are supposed to experience this shit naturally. You are ahead of the curve because you're unplugged but too much reading here can make you bitter and prolong your anger phase. So it's certainly good that you have found this place, but maybe you shouldn't be on here to the point where you're thinking about this consciously all the time. If you are, every action is an attack on your masculinity and it can make you jaded in the long run.

Crushing puss at our age is supposed to be fun; be aware of this place, but if you can recite the Iron Laws and the Commandments of Poon from memory, chances are you're putting way too much effort into this.

If you haven't got laid after college after trying, then perhaps you need to take a second look at what you're doing wrong. But after you detach your ego by focusing on having fun you develop an IDGAF mentality and as a result you are closer to the natural alpha than you ever will be otherwise.

I feel like a separate sub with a less serious tone should be in order for the lads like myself, it's certainly not to the point where you should be ""sad"" about yourself for being a ""beta cuck"" lmao.

It is a sound advice because in the eyes of a woman, a man who cannot control his own head is not a mate material – what is the likelihood of him being tough during hard times? Probably not very high. This does not however change the fact that we are all human, even the most alpha of us. We experience emotions, negative, positive, doesn’t matter. We need to express them (unless you’re one of those lucky sociopaths or dead-inside-spergs who can’t) in one way or another to remain sane.

Recently, I have been swaying away from my path. Negative emotions started creeping in, life has been throwing stones at me and the general balance between chaos and order in my existence started to tilt towards the chaos. I generally deal pretty well with stress, tell myself that its means to an end, all part of a journey etc. It works… most of the time. Not recently.

It started impacting everyday activities, the ways I interacted with my recently LTR-promoted plate and family. Enough is enough! I’ve contacted my buddy, a guy I know since we were 13 and never really stopped talking to each other, even though we live on the opposite sides of the country and haven’t seen each other for few years now. 

We are different people. I’m a STEM person with a mind suited for solving scientific problems, whilst he is the guy who could sell you a bag of shit and you’d still thank him for it. I’m an introvert who likes solitude, hiking, lone motorcycle rides, whilst he thrives in-between people, business-building, arguing his point etc. Seemingly there is very little that we have in common, maybe apart from the lack of tolerance for bullshit. However, I really know this guy, how he thinks, why he thinks x,y,z and what drives him. He knows the same about me. Over the years we learned pretty much everything about each other, somehow having little-to-no problems sharing our fears, plans, regrets, not really knowing why.

The typical conversation between us consists of roasting each other, jokingly criticising achievements. I.e. “Hey, I had 95% successful sales this month motherfucker!” to which I reply: “Mediocre, come back when you’re on 100%”. However, when I really need to talk, he’s there. He shuts the fuck up and listens. Once I’m done explaining why I’ve been feeling shit, he drops a few lines, which change my viewpoint, make me realise that life ain’t so bad and that I’m acting like an idiot for dwelling on shit. 

This shit works because I trust him. He trusts me and knows he can open up too. 

Dare to try this with your woman: She’ll dry up quicker than you can finish your 3rd sentence.

Dare to try this with your “friends”: You’ll be out of the social circle proportionally quickly to the amount of stuff you share.

Use your logic to convince her emotional bullshit, that she would be better off having sex with you. Know that you are better than her because of reasons x, y, and z. If you do not have reasons xyz of why your better than her, then your next task is already known. 

I feel this sub is starting to get off course with this and that. And the main point to everyone coming here is to get more ass. You felt in your gut something was wrong and that you wanted and needed more booty. Game is a way to get ass by bypassing her emotional smokescreens and deflections and just getting down to the point. Tell the girl you took on a date or two who didnt give it up, that the reason your spending your valuable time with her is because you wanted to fuck.

Why is it fair for her to waste your time and not give you pussy? Why is it ok for her to give you nothing and you give her everything? That is because you let it happen. There is no shortage of girls, women, bitches, slut or hoes. Get to a yes or no faster. Call out her illogical crap when you identify it. 

Its going to be damn hard to find your purpose or direction or focus in your life when you got all your brain power consumed with needing some strange. 

A tactic that has been hugely helpful for me, that i got from listening to Patrice Oneal on the Black Philip show, is that he sees some chick he wants as just having finished fuckin 4 dudes right before he saw her. Or that when his girl goes to take a pee, he assumes that she blew some rando on the way to the bathroom. He sees that all women are capable of being a whore at anytime for whatever reason she feels and that essentially there is not a thing he can do about it, if he is not physically there with her. This always keep his paradigm or viewpoint in a place that will not allow him to feel that she is special and at the same time knowing she is down to fuck.

Adopt this mentality friends. Don't fall in love with women but rather just like them for what they are. Once you climb through the frustration of not having your sexual needs met, Life gets more clear. Learn the manipulations and selfish arrogant egotism of women. Feel nothing of rejection. Feel nothing of whatever their number count is. Feel nothing for what they think they want. Just get what you need or stop giving her your time.

I believe just being yourself is good advice but most dont know who they are. When you start to uncover who you are and what women are, it will become much easier to try and connect with the girls you want to be with, from a righteous place. A place where you won't feel bad or shame or guilt at all for expressing your need to women. Be completely damn honest with yourself. When you see a hot girl walk by, whats the first thought that pops in your head? I guarantee its not ""gosh, i would love to learn about her personality and take her to a movie and dinner 5 times before I would feel comfortable inserting my penis in her.""

A post about a survey by GQ on how both men and women view masculinity recently came up on ASKTRP. The words used by most women to define masculinity were “macho”, “dominant” and “muscular”. Interestingly, the women characterised a masculine man as a much more “traditionally” masculine man than the men did. Classic womanese: say they want the thing that they don’t to filter out the real men from the boys. 

Everyone knows a woman wants a masculine man, so it follows that she wants a “macho”, “dominant” and “muscular” man – how she defines a masculine man. TRP knows this already but it was good to get it from the horse’s mouth without bluepill two-speak. 

There are some traits that are, and have been, universally accepted as normatively masculine all over the world throughout the ages. These traits are obviously attractive to women and are also good bases to form masculine male relationships on. If you have these traits, your life will be better and you will be a dominant, masculine man. My goal is to have a list of these traits as a quick reference if you are feeling stuck in your self-development and need direction.

IMPORTANTLY: YOU CAN IMPROVE ALL THESE TRAITS WITH PRACTICE.

Here they are in no particular order:

ATHLETICISM/MUSCULARITY/PHYSICAL STRENGTH – lift and eat well. Throw in some cardio and flexibility. Nuff said. Could also be improved by any number of physical hobbies. 

VIRILITY – being physically and sexually energetic. Similar to above. Exercise, diet, adequate rest.

COURAGE – the ability to confront fear and go after your desires and goals despite the risk or danger. It also includes the acts of following your own sense of what is right despite the judgement of others or the consequences. This is an age-old masculine trait typical of the archetypal hero. You can display courage in many areas in today’s world, it doesn’t have to be slaying a dragon.

LEADERSHIP – having a vision and being able to charismatically convince others to follow you and/or your vision. Social dominance. Forming your own judgements on topics and not following group think is also a form of leadership. Leading conversations is also a subtle for of leadership.

INDEPENDENCE – having your ducks in a row and not having to rely on others to get your needs met. Particularly financially and practically. Learning practical skills (eg mechanics, carpentry etc) really helps with this and this area is very easy to improve on. The internet is your friend if want to learn any skill.

EMOTIONAL STRENGTH – being able to control your emotions and fears. A woman wants something solid to hold on to. Trials, hardships and experience may be the only way to build this strength up. Mental training techniques may offer some secondary assistance.

WISDOM – knowing more than the average man and being able to implement that knowledge. Making the right judgements, problem solving and understanding a lot. In a word, being smart. Having insight into many areas is incredibly valuable. Reading books obviously will educate you probably better than anything on the widest range of topics, but practical wisdom can come into this as well.

ASSERTIVENESS – Being bold in your communication with others, not being afraid to step on some toes in going after your needs. If someone crosses your boundary, you let them know. Not being manipulated by others, particularly women, and not being pushed around by others. Standing your ground and holding your self-respect. Don’t say sorry just to keep the peace. 

MASCULINE SPEECH - Your word is your bond. Saying what you mean and meaning what you say. Don’t talk nonsense or be a clown too much. Verbal diarrhoea is feminine. A masculine man uses few words and means them; hence they have more power. I could go into tonality etc. but that’s a bit technical for the reach of this post and if you are doing all the others things the small things should follow.

SEXUAL ASSERTIVENESS – it’s ok to show aggression in expressing your sexuality. Always lean towards aggression rather than timidity. Women are turned on by men who express their sexuality boldly and shamelessly. If your desires are wild, it’s good to express them to the world and your woman. Paraphrasing the words of Rihanna, “what (she) wants is what you want”.

POWER – personal power sometimes does not always equal social power. And power can be elusive. However, power is very related to status. And considering power to be *position in a social group*, a powerful man is one of high status, therefore is attractive to women due to at least social reasons. The other listed traits should make you a truly powerful man in some way or another. Lastly, power can also come from position in society which may or may not be earned. 

DISREGARD FOR CONSEQUENCES AND AVOIDANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY – this may be seen as a “dark” masculine trait. Examples are fighting, drinking too much, driving too fast, general risk taking, and other “bad boy” behaviours that are obviously inherently masculine. These behaviours are good in moderation but you want to avoid becoming a total degenerate, for your own sake. Most women are attracted to these behaviours despite saying that they disapprove of them as they show masculinity, “dark” or not. Truthfully, women also have a “dark” side, it’s just much more subtle and feeds on a bit of drama. This attraction is a woman’s dirty secret because these behaviours usually cause personal or social damage in one way or another, so to admit being attracted to them would make the woman look like a degenerate herself.

There you have it, fellas. The list of traits that are considered universally to be manly. Attractive to women and respected by men.

I was (am?) a cuck.  Very long story short, not tall enough, violent enough, or stupid enough to attract females in high school or college.  Got my compsci degree.  Started making 6 figures pretty soon after graduating.  Began my dating life.  

&amp;#x200B;

I made some early mistakes.  I dated women for their looks and they dated me for my money.  I was making 6 figures but I was spending so much on dinners, concerts, gifts, etc., that I wasn't really putting much into savings.  

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I met a girl, we'll call her Catherine.  Beautiful, vain, and lazy.  Amazing tits.  I married her.  I paid for her to go to college.  After I paid 2 years of her tuition she dropped out.  

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't know it then, but she was hooking up with guys at parties on campus despite living at my house and being supported by me.  It started almost immediately after our marriage, too.  She would tell me she had to stay late at the library to study, but she'd be at parties meeting younger guys and hooking up.  I couldn't understand why she would be failing with all the time she spent studying.  But like I said, she was never a very smart girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I think honestly I was suspicious but I didn't want to believe it. 

&amp;#x200B;

After college her lies got a lot less believable too.  She'd tell me she had to visit her mom.  At 9pm on a Friday night.  Wearing a dress, hair done, and makeup.  She'd come home disheveled around 4am and slip quietly into bed.  I'd act like I was still sleeping.  

&amp;#x200B;

During this time we had no sex.  None.

&amp;#x200B;

After a while she didn't even make an excuse.  Friday night she would dress up and leave.  She'd come home whenever.  I kept working and focused on my job.  I couldn't think about what was happening.  

&amp;#x200B;

she started getting calls and texts at all hours.   I saw some of her texts and they were extremely graphic.  Somehow I blocked that.  I just wouldn't think about it, because to me to acknowledge her cheating would death.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be hoenst.  I wish I could say I divorced her cleanly and moved on.  We are still technically married.  She doesn't live with me any more.  She stays with another man now.  I don't see her very often.  But she is still part of my life.  She still has a key to my home.  ANd sometiems she does come over and we will have dinner and we act like nothing out of the ordinary is happening.

&amp;#x200B;

But she is living with another man, having sex with him, and she's still using credit cards that I pay for.  It's not really a secret any more.  My friends and family strongly suspect what's happening even though I haven't outright admitted it to them.  They know.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this it?  Am I just a pathetic beta bitch?  Is there any way to  come back from this?  Is it over?

Note that these viewpoints come from my own personal perspective and experiences in life.

Having been through some difficult times and struggling with social activities from a kid, not being toughened up by my parents and people in my social circle, I would come off as submissive and beta and in social groups I wasn't that capable. 

1. FRAME 
Building a frame, or let's better say remolding your frame from scratch since frame is a natural instinct which was manipulated and formed by society conditioning for purposes, is very difficult until you realize that NOBODY gives a fuck about you or how you see the world anyway. What works inside your head is either helping you get through or make you submissive and complacent. Reshaping your frame means take a deep look at your values and what you truly want in life. Do you want to be a beta bitch that gets used for the rest of your life or are you actually willing to go through the process of working mentally through introspection/meditation and realize your true potential? Read books, read the sidebar, go LIFT and get a grip on the slow progress. Check a few of the older posts on frame here and you're set. Read and repeat. 

2. LIFTING 
Go lift motherfucker. Get off that couch and start a gym membership, develop discipline and a plan and eat healthy. Lifting is a solid one on frame and physical, but also mental toughening. When I feel soft and lazy I go lift till I'm swollen. Fuck, every time I leave the gym I feel super confident and dare do look even the toughest dude in the eye, I won't hesitate walking straight my way without making room for them to pass, because they will make enough space for me to go on. Don't get me wrong and get into fights with it though. I'm not saying that you need to act like an angry idiot walking around bragging. Just lift and thank yourself later for the reward. 

3.DRESS LIKE A SERIOUS MAN WOULD. 
Here, you can go and find the best fitting clothes near your taste, but I suggest you always have a pair of black and khaki muscle fit t-shirts to match with some black slim fit jeans with cuts. I combine this look with a pair of leather Chelsea boots and a classic watch. Simple, stylish and tough look. Black colors make you look tough. I also have a few Italian dress shirts and other jeans and trousers, for formal occasions. It is a true saying that whatever you wear makes you feel a certain way, wear clothes that make you feel confident and powerful. Also stand out.

I haven't masturbated for almost 2 years, beating that addiction was easy for me, because I could still coom using women. 

What is a coomer?  To me, a coomer is simply a man that cooms, he is a slave to his natural desires and impulses and lets his primal urges dominate his free time, if there is a chance for a coomer to coom, then he will coom. 

I first coomed when I was 12, I fapped without knowing what it was, it was a great feeling, but it felt wrong. I first coomed in a woman at age 13, it was a great feeling, and it felt right. Natural. From then on I devoted my free time to finding women to coom in all throughout my teens. To me, women offered nothing but a hole to coom in, something I can use to fulfil my insatiable lust for a high quality coom. When I couldn't find girls who would let me coom them, I would fap to get a quick fix, but it was never enough. 30 mins later I had cooming on my mind. I used to manipulate women into thinking I am looking for a relationship, but really I was always just taking the quickest path to cooming her, then I'd move on to the next one. Sometimes I would get lucky, I would meet a woman who also just wanted coom from me, it was a mutual agreement for us both to relieve our lust. And luckily that carousel of revolving women kept my coomlust from getting out of control, because I tried to coom in almost every girl at the school, and when I would get desperate, oh boy my standards would slip. 

Whenever I tried to give up being a coomer, it ended disasterously. Before I first became a coomer, the girl I was dating was my first love, after I gave her my first ever coom she went on to cheat on me with a Chad who was much older, had a car and just used what I saw as my princess as his coomrag. This similar moment happened twice in my life. It made me realise something, there are two types of men in this word, the virgin ""treat women with respect"" and ""find the right one"" types, and there are the Chad coomers. Plain and simple, she will never be yours, since I realized this I have been on the giving end of using girls in year long+ relationships as a means of cooming. A woman is only yours for the time you are with her, even then she is probably on the phone texting Chad to get her next filling of coom. 

Do you want to be the cuck? taking her out for dates, paying for her shit, letting her control your emotions, or do you want to be the man? in control, the man who sees women for who they are, the man who steps out of the matrix and sees that the whole game is rigged against you from the start. 

Since I became a full time (no fap) coomer my life has changed drastically, I no longer waste unnecessary time with women, I have excellent frame when communicating, I have increased confidence, and most importantly I do what I want when I want, I have travelled the world, coomed in all types of women, the kind of women that masturbating coomers only fantasize over on computer screens. But there is hope for this kind of coomer, it just takes willpower. 

Your lusts aren't your weaknesses, your primal drives aren't there to hinder you, you want to really fuck the hot girl like you see on your screen 4 times a day? Then get out there and use that energy to change yourself, change your mind set, and be the man you want to be. We are MEN, and men coom in women, it's the simplest rule of nature that society has tricked us into ignoring for some fairytale Disney blue pilled cuck fantasy. You want to coom? That's fine, that's good. But coom responsibly, sitting in front of a screen covered in dorito dust and a Metallica t shirt filled with layers of encrusted coom isn't getting you anywhere. But the energy that led you to that dark and gloomy place can take you places you thought you would never go. All it takes is some respect and acceptance of YOURSELF. You aren't a freak for wanting to coom. Just do it the right way, and everything you want in life will be yours.

This guy describes himself as an effeminate man with a ""tough guy"" background in the special forces. Goes on to say he has thin wrists, and will routinely sit on male friends laps and blow them kisses.

So this self described effeminate former tough guy then tells a story about him and a friend buying shawls that they just had to have. Says it makes him look like a star wars character (ffs). They then decide to wear them to a bar. One of the guys girlfriends comes into the bar with a friend and they are both turned off by the shawl. They both acted weird and made comments. So the original guy goes home to his gf shortly after. She's equally as disgusted with his choice of fashion. The next morning, she asks if he's gay, listing the evidence (such as owning a shawl lol). She then takes off and sends him texts saying she needs to think about what kind of man she wants to be with.

Of course, she breaks up with him. And the kicker? The other guys girl broke it off with him as well. 

And of course the comments are filled with support. Comments of ""fuck macho masculitnity!""   
""Sounds like your gf has some pretty questionable beliefs about masculinity"" ""her loss!"" ""Good for you for being comfortable with yourself!""

Now I have no problem with anyone being who they wanna be and dress and act how they like. But if you're sitting on guys laps, blowing kisses, and buying shawls with your best bud, people are going to think you're gay. And if you're gay, that's totally fine and you probably have no problem sending that message out. But for a straight guy? Is he honestly surprised at the outcome? Not one, but three separate women were put off enough to make comments and both girls involved with the guys left them almost immediately. 

I share this mostly because it's pretty funny, but the point is no matter how much society tells you that it's ok to act effeminate and that being a ""mahco tough guy"" isn't cool anymore, it's still very much what turns women on. So you can go ahead and pretend like being masculine is a way of the past, but you'll be left making love to your palm.

I am Indian. Hindi is my native language. There are two ways people address you in Hindi. One is when you are addressing someone who is your equal or younger than you, for example ""tum"" meaning ""you"". Whereas when you address someone who is your elder, your teacher or anyone who you would want to address with some respect, you'd not use ""tum"" here but ""aap"". Both of these words mean the same thing, that is, ""you"" but their usage is different. This goes for a lot of stuff. Even verbs. ""Tum ye karo"" and ""Aap ye kariye"", both mean ""You do this"" but you'd say the latter to someone who you want to show a little respect (Which we should to strangers!)

I hope that's clear so let me give my anecdote. I joined the gym roughly 4 months ago. I am 28 and have some fat I need to get rid of. There is a guy there who is not actually a trainer, I guess you could say he's a ""busboy"" of sorts, rearranging weights, putting them back on the rack, helping someone with his bench press etc, you get the gist. When I joined the gym, as is my nature, I treated him with respect as well. I'd use ""aap"" instead of ""tum""  and shook his hands when I met him. Slowly I started to notice that he became \*too\* friendly with me, like, talking to me as if I am his pupil or something. Doing gym for the first time in my life, I had trouble with the barbell curls and he'd say ""Dum lagao..kya khaate ho"" (Push it, do it, what do you even eat) and general berating stuff making me feel I am too weak. Point to note here is that he used the ""tum"" version of words instead of ""aap"". Whereas others were treating him with a lot of rough words, basically, treating him as a busboy. And guess what? He always addressed them with deference and respect. So I am the one who is being nice to him and he chooses to be nice to those who treat him like his inferior. 

So, I changed my behaviour like a switch. Overnight.  I started being dry and straightforward, not ""deigning"" to acknowledge his presence until I needed something like a dumbell. When he'd then stay stuff like ""Try harder etc"", I would look straight into his eyes but say nothing. Guess what? Now he has stopped addressing me as he did and has become much more soft spoken and does not pass any comments to me about my abilities.

I know it's not a huge eye-opening example of the generalized red pill principles, but for me, it was. 

Do nice things for people but don't ""be"" unnecessarily nice to people. They should feel that they need to earn your respect and it's not something you'd give out to everyone.

And there was a strange thing - whatever I brought home, the pussy was always dry. I literally had to buy a lube, we made a schedule, and so on. Overall, it was quite strange to me - I'm providing my whole family with money and they treat me more or less like shit. Certainly, something was not right. And I bet I could certainly get things going by a typical scenario later, but suddenly a big change happened.

With a help of special clinic, I raised my testosterone level from 360 ng/dl to 1800 ng/dl. That change by itself rewired me a bit, I started to notice people have certain feelings, emotions, there are certain rules how you can uplift other people and so on. And then I've read TheRedPill, suddenly, I get your idea. Partnership is a full bullshit in a marriage! Only domination  / subjugation can work as a happy family!

1) Woman should completely depend on a man, on his income. Any attempts for her ""But I want to make my own fund for, say, something goes wrong...."" - no way.

2) Woman should stay at home. Sure, some rules and exceptions apply here, but overall, if she is working, she tries to deal with both career and family, and that sucks, she gets old faster because of overworking, and she will have a temptation to fuck with colleagues, it is inevitable.

3) Man should have a good shape, to keep being attractive, not to be a lazy pig, spend some time with his woman, keep her in a great shape too, no doubts. Daily fucking, and not once, is  a great way to reduce the chances of infidelity, although, we can only hope.

4) And what is more important, man should always lead. Like ""we go here"" or ""you go there, I'm gonna fuck you"". All the rules which a woman has should not mean anything to a man. He leads, and nothing more.

As a result of evolution, a woman, you know, the ones with the xx chromosomes, can be expected to evince hypergamy, to seek out the best available  alpha, to vet alphas and to recognize their weaknesses. She can be expected to long for, and search out, higher status males. She can be expected to leave if she finds a bigger bank account or even a bigger cock. Hell, she might even do ass to mouth in the club restroom if the right guy gives her the right tingles in the right places at the right time.  AWALT is a GREAT map.



However, the map is not always the territory.  Korzybski's assertion is that we create functional mental models written in neural patterns, but that objective reality exists outside our mind. These models allow us to make relatively accurate generalizations. Yes, all women are capable of hypergamy, but some are surely more easily swayed, and penetrated, than others. I suspect that the majority of the 400k men on this sub will eventually end up in an LTR, and, despite the incessant posturing, a fairly high percentage will be married.

 
For those condemned fellows, you should employ the AWALT model as your vaginal operators manual, but also recognize that not all women are EXACTLY the same and endeavor to award women with trust only after they prove that their undeniable tendencies are, temporarily, under control.

I'm a 22 year old college student living in Germany. I'm no pick-up artist or anything, just another regular dude. Over the span of 3 years this is what I discovered about the nature of women...

&amp;#x200B;

\- The abundance of choice is what makes women act so cold 

\- Only super succesful men (&lt;1%) make their pussy tingle 

\- The lack of choice is what makes men act so weak

\- Most average looking women (&lt;60%) make us horny

Let that sink in.

&amp;#x200B;

We meet a cute girl by chance. Instantly we get nervous and try not fuck it up. We think about her a lot and what we could text her. Overall we put so much more effort into these females than they put in us. It feels wrong and we know it. 

The only time it works out for both sides is when the guy is 1&lt;% This is when girls suddenly put effort and thought into it. They start to feel nervous and vulnerable.. Feminine energy. On the other hand the &lt;1% guy has just as many options as she does, which makes him act confident and unafraid -Masculine energy This is how it´s supposed to be

&amp;#x200B;

I really can´t provide a good solution for this sad state of affairs. Most of us do not find ourselves &lt;1% and will not receive the same amount of love we give out. Terrible really. You can try to work hard and push into the &lt;1%, but keep in mind... this might take years, decades or maybe you won´t achieve it at all. Also women are important, but obsessing over it like that doesn´t feel very healthy.

A lot of the time, we refer to rituals that involved pain or toughness (I got this from high school wrestling), but not as many about masculinity rituals that showed us our place in the universe. This was crucial to young men. It changed my perspective which gave me strength, courage, peace of mind, stability, ‘frame’, confidence, and security.

This is the feeling that I am not separate from the world but a part of the world. In native masculinity rituals sometimes this came from psychedelics, sometimes from sending newly initiated men into the forrest or solitude for an extended period of time, or other times long journeys.

We are something that comes and is part of the entire universe like a ray of light is part of sun. Without sounding overly spiritual, this is seems obviously true. Even if we don’t feel natural, we are obviously the most natural, because we come from nature. The feeling of being a completely independent soul from another dimension is just another Judeo-Christian religious hangover.

This means in a way that you don’t have to apologize for yourself. Your sex drive is natural, your desire for female companionship is natural, your nervousness (starting out) is natural, your desire to be dominant is natural, every feeling is coming from a completely natural being. In my opinion this gives you true frame, because even if you’re nervous you don’t have to sit there apologizing for it. You can just own it. You don’t fight your nature, you don’t fight women’s nature, you don’t try as much to change the world into your fixed conceptions. You didn’t design the software, you didn’t chose that men and women fit together, or the causal sex culture, you’re just playing it out. You especially can accept that as a man you want to have sex with attractive girls. This isn’t an instinctual endowing on physical body inhabited by a spirit. It’s completely and entirely part of you. It isn't something that has to be driven away.

My advice is to safely experiment with psychedelics with someone who knows a lot about it. I cleared a lot of the cobwebs and negative emotions out with microdosing LSD and then tripped a few months later while reading ""Be Here Now' by Ram Dass in the safety of a close friend's house. When I truly felt this feeling I'm describing, I was ecstatic. It was like I heard the best news in my life. Ever since I have better way more comfortable with myself, which definitely contributed to way more alpha behaviors. I have been able to do the things taught in red pill 101 (IDGAF mentality) with honesty and sincerity, because I removed a lot of worry, self doubt and things that we communicate unconsciously through posture, tonality, etc.

When I think myself as a part of the whole world, I'm not as worried about my individual decisions, so I take more risks. I accept dying, so I do more things with my time so I can have more experiences. I accept that I'm going to feel negative emotions, so I don't relying on coping mechanism like falling back into my blue pill habits. I'm more calm, collected, and relaxed. I have a deeper sense that things will be okay. I feel free to let people, as part of the same world, have different experiences than mine even if that experience is thinking I'm an asshole or not liking me.

You weren’t dropped here by an alien space craft. You are a natural being born into a particular time and culture. Like anything natural, remove barriers from it and it will grow.

**TL;DR:** Don’t fool about with stress, do yourself a major favour: Sense, when you are struggling and take care of that problem before taking damage. 

I am a certified neurologist but my main field of work is more in psychiatry and psychodevelopmental research as well as teaching in these fields. I work in a high-achiever environment and most of the time not less than 60h per week. With my scientific work I am never not competing with other researchers who are after my fundings and my academic position. I am in my forties, yet unmarried and fathered three children (and before anyone says anything: all of them were planned). In the little free time that is left I am a father for my children, meet my affairs (or plates if you want), work out and the rest is consumed mostly with reading and eating and sleeping properly. 

I am telling all this to demonstrate the amount of stress I and people who work as hard can be under - even though I do not feel stressed and chose this lifestyle myself. At the same time I want to emphasise that nowhere near as much work is necessary to put someone under stress. Stress is a modern society phenomenon and is accountable for a whole palette of diseases, many of which are psychological, many of which can have severe impacts on our lives. 

I am glad for bulletproof individuals with indestructible coping mechanisms and rock hard determination but for everybody else I have to say that stress and its consequences should, frankly put, not ever be trifled with. As these syndromes almost exclusively develop not because of the stress itself but of the individual coping capability, our own experiences with stress are naturally very distinct from each other. Some people have no problems with murdering an 80h working week and still feel like they’ve got excess energy and some might already have a hard time doing 40h a week. 

Now I know from my personal experience, from my patients and from reading this sub, that especially men often have a hard time dealing with stress because they have nobody they can sincerely and openly talk to. That is very understandable considering the fact that opening up to somebody makes us extremely vulnerable. 

Vulnerability is something that many of us can’t afford: It makes us dependent on the grace of the women we sleep with and it gives our rivals valuable assets, which they can hold against us. So these men are stuck between a rock and a hard place: They cannot afford to make themselves vulnerable and at the same time still somehow have to deal with large amounts of stress and other stress-reaction-triggering events like personal trauma etc. Because these issues will not go away, they will not solve themselves.

“Having someone to talk to” in my field of work is often referred to as an “external resource” when talking about individual coping mechanisms and strategies. It is also something that we always assess when somebody e.g. has a mental breakdown from stress or trauma aka. burnout aka. acute stress reaction. External resources are an important and valuable asset because they can dramatically enhance our capability to cope with all of life’s demands. Without external resources we are dependent solely on our own coping mechanisms, the loading capacity of which is highly variable among individuals. 

So this is my suggestion: choose an ally, a supporter who you can talk freely to. It is probably be due to my profession, that I highly recommend trained personell for this purpose. Apart from knowing all the proven-to-be-successful strategies and techniques they are *required by law* to keep your secrets. If you’re feeling insecure or ashamed about having to attend a “shrink” (this is highly common in many cultures, which is understandable to an extent, as people don’t like to think of themselves as “sick in the head”), maybe think of it as visiting a hooker but instead of handling your dick, they handle your mind. That perspective helped me, when I first had to visit a psychiatrist due to acute stress reaction in my early twenties. If that is still nothing for you or you can’t afford professional aid, choose a friend or relative to be your confidant. Again from personal and very much from work experience I know that literally being able to just talk openly about something to somebody is an enormous help. 

This post is meant to help everybody whose coping resources are crumbling under the stress they have to deal with and those who feel insecure about admitting that they are struggling.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,An approach on mental health - about external resources,0,1572303871.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dnsejh/an_approach_on_mental_health_about_external/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

An  attempt of rational males to dissect the clownworld and make some viable  discernable rules they can live by. Some basic guidelines at least as a  starter mindset till it happens to you ""naturally"". So the main things i  keep from it are:

1)**Men are like planets.**  You need to become your own entity, love your own self, have your own  life, carreer, hobbies, and values. And that will make others, women  included, to orbit in your powerful gravity. A man is the center of  gravity, the leader of the community or at the very least of his very  own life and mindset.

2)**Don't be reactive be proactive**.  Both in people's shit tests but in pretty much most facets of life.  High neuroticism is the main antiaphrodisiac and business opportunity  killer. Don't get paralysis by overanalysis.

3)**Manipulate the Frame**  in a positive manner. You are not chasing women, you are gaming with  them. You don't need them, they need a man like you in their life. They  are the ones getting teased and ""interviewed"", and maybe will get a pass  if they  prove themselves. The sea has plenty of fish, if my karmic  cycle with that girl closes, my gravity will welcome its next orbiter.  There is no ""one"", there is my current one. You don't time your  compliments, people earn them from you. You arent limited in your head  but can get in your heart, you have a fun time, you self entertain and  you give value abundantly cause you feel like it, not because its a  specific gender or status of people across you.

4)Detect  manipulation, when others try to use you, gaslight you etc. Don't feed  the borderlines and sneaky bastards that might lurk around. **Put effin boundaries** be it to colleagues, girlfriends, parents, friends or whomever it may be needed. Also the thug mantra **whoever screws you over will likely do it again**.  You can be a deeply forgiving person, don't have to be deeply stupid  though. Be like a dove and like a snake at the same time as bible says.

5)**There is no stability in progress**.  Only ascending or descending. Either you measure each day's improvement  with the previous day as a measure of comparison, or you aren't.

6)**Set your priorities straight**.  Noone will cry over your own spilled milk, than your own self. Make  your life front heavy and use your best years to your benefit whatever  your values are, materialistic, health related, philosophical,  spiritual,etc.

7)**Know thy self.** Your abilities your strengths, weaknesses, your limitations etc. Within that realm applies also the **You can't turn a hoe into a housewife,** assuming you are looking for one.  Or fixing a broken one. There is no healing the chad widow. Like all the ""I am not sexually attracted to my (current) boyfriend"" female posts prove. 

8)**Know thy cycle.** The people you surround yourself with, and the people you attract with what you become are your life strategy.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Main things i took from the red pill.,0,1572301565.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dnqmen/main_things_i_took_from_the_red_pill/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

In this time I've collected around a dozen notches and I want to reflect on some things I've learned over the past 7 months.




On Rejection




I've ruminated on this before but here's the thing. You can be the sun, moon and the stars to a girl with either comparable or even higher SMV than your own. Let's say you're a 6.5 and she is a 7 or an 8. Objectively she should be a tough nut to crack, but you have the flavor that she likes. She digs your race, hair, height, physique, personality, whatever. She is buying what you are selling. So now you think you are the shit, but then you'll be the same motherfucker and spit the same game with the same face, style, clothing, masculinity, etc to a girl far beneath you and your other chick, and get rejected. So what does that mean?




It only means that SHE isn't interested in what YOU are selling. No matter what. It's not that your game was off (obviously you have game enough to bat above your league and get home runs), but maybe she just doesn't like Mexican guys and you happen to be Mexican as fuck. Maybe you aren't tall enough for her. Maybe she is super into nerdy SJW type of dudes and you are the opposite of that.




Whatever the case is, a rejection is not always a case of you sucking at game, or doing something wrong. 
It needs to be ironed into your soul that not everyone is going to like you and that is fine. 




While being the best version of you and increasing your SMV to it's max should always be encouraged, you need to understand that your best results in the short and long term will come from locating, meeting and dating the girls who are super into YOU for exactly who YOU are. 




Again, this doesn't mean you can be a cheeto-eating basement dweller 100lbs overweight and expect success. But even among the top 10% of men, guys with great incomes, great physiques, cars, houses, whatever, you STILL will strike out with girls far below you in SMV. 




As much as it may sting if you consider yourself a 7/10 and get rejected by a 5/10 girl, that doesn't mean shit about YOU. It's a reflection of HER wants, needs and current station in life.
That last part is important. You may strike out with a girl on Tuesday because she was in a bad mood, didn't want to talk to a stranger, was on her period, slept like shit, whatever, but if you had approached her 3 days later you could have succeeded. Which again is NOT a reflection of you, your value or your positive or negative attributes. Least of all your game. Some girls are just NOT in a state to be approached or seduced by anybody at a certain point in time.
--------




Going after what YOU want




If you're over 30 and still want to date young (legal!) girls, you should not let any sense of inadequacy, shame or anything else stop you from pursuing the girls that you like.




Most girls in general won't want to fuck or date you. Let's accept that first.




Now, if you narrow it down even further to girls that you REALLY are interested in, let's say 21 year old girls, then the percentage of those girls who won't want to fuck or date you is even higher.
HOWEVER, there will STILL BE some percentage of girls in the category that you are targeting that WILL want to fuck, date and/or fall in love with you.




They're buying what you're selling. They like older dudes, or maybe specifically they like older Latino dudes. Or older white/black/Asian/whatever you happen to be. You fit that bill.
Your job then, if you want to succeed in that demographic, is simply to find those fucking girls that are interested in your ""product"" (YOU!). 
----




Tinder and Swipe Apps




You can and will get laid from swipe apps. Likely it will take some $$$ to get the Gold or premium versions of the apps and then a shit ton of swiping and time/effort. But it can and will work, provided you have good pics, good text game etc. I have banged truly very attractive younger girls from swipe apps that I probably never would have met in real life.




HOWEVER, there is a huge major problem with relying on these apps.




And that is simply the fact that you have a massive barrier to entry to even communicate with the girls that YOU want!
First she needs to even SEE your stupid profile. Then she needs to actually match with you and be open to chatting. You are at a HUGE handicap when it comes to displaying your personality and all the things that make you, YOU. Unless your profile/pics are super tight, along with great aesthetics in your looks, it's going to always be an uphill battle to even get into a conversation with a girl that you like.




This is why day game, in my opinion, will always be superior to swipe apps. You have ZERO (!!!) barrier to entry when it comes to talking to ANY girl that you want to meet. If you see a 9/10 girl on Tinder, what are the odds that you will even be able to engage in a conversation with her? Maybe 1%?




But if you see that same girl at the mall, there is a 100% chance of meeting her face to face, displaying your personality, game, vocal tone, eye contact, jokes, vibe, etc. You completely circumnavigate the stupid barrier that swipe apps present and are able to meet ANY GIRL YOU WANT.




This is how I've banged and dated the most beautiful girls in my notch list: old fashioned cold approaching. At the gym, the bar, the mall, the book store, wherever. 




For a girl, ANY girl, to be a possible notch on your belt, plate or girlfriend in your life, you need to be able to engage/talk with her. Thus, swipe apps eliminate a HUGE portion of the female population from even being a candidate for a ""job"" in your ""corporation"".




Once you see an attractive girl in real life, she suddenly becomes a POSSIBILITY. Maybe the odds of getting her are 1%, or 5%, but they EXIST. Versus swiping right on a 9/10 girl on Tinder and HOPING that A) she swipes right on you and B) responds to your first message. Even then you are still competing with hundreds of other dudes.




But if you cold approach her while she is at the mall, you have her undivided attention for 1-15 minutes and the probability of fucking her goes from 0% to ____% (greater than zero).

Conclusion





These were some of the things I've learned or RE-learned over the past few months. Every so often you should sit back and dwell upon the things you've learned and use that knowledge to proceed in a more efficient way. We are all going to be failing a lot in the learning process for anything.

Logical point #2: Women don't actively fuck men. They passively fuck men. MEN are the ones doing the ""slaying."" Women would have a LOT less sex if men weren't assertive because they themselves are not assertive.  


Logical point #3: Red Pill teaches men how to fuck lots of women successfully.  


Logical point #4: Red Pill is responsible for turning women into creatures who cannot pairbond through ""ruining"" them by fucking as many of them as possible.  


Conclusion: Red Pill philosophy will turn women into creatures who cannot commit faster than any other philosophy I've seen on the web. **Our philosophy turns women into creatures incapable of pair-bonding. We are to blame unless we're all about to agree that women are as responsible and as ethical as men.**

This is a report, and partially I'm honestly really not sure why this is so I'd like some insight (I grew up in a traditional family which I mention this dynamic later on, so perhaps that in itself is why I can't seem to figure this out).

Typically men who grow up with lots of women (tons of sisters or single mothers) either tend to be EXTREMELY red-pilled to the core (perhaps the most of all, these men tend to be the intellectuals) or they are other extreme of being simply incapable of understanding or discussing female nature, gynocentrism, and are the most blue-pilled of pretty much all men in the world. They simply cannot be reasoned with at all.

People with traditional family units, or a good share of siblings of both sexes, tend to more often spout truths about women and more open to red-pilled ideas (perhaps even women). But the most interesting and in-depth insights tend to be from men who come from single mother houses. But other men in this same environment are also the least open to acknowledging realities about women and society.

Men I've known who become fathers with daughters (daddy's girl) seem to be also incapable and suddenly turn massively blue pill, even if they were red-pilled before. I'd actually go as far to say having daughters seem to blue-pill men faster and red pill repellent than having wives, girlfriends, or mothers.

I'd love to hear some insight into this.

Here is the story of one such regular man, /u/VasiliyZaitzev.

###During the Blue Pill Days
---

**Before you had your awakening, what were your aspirations in life and in love?**

To be the master of my own white picket-fenced kingdom, with a dimepiece SAHM wife who cooked like Julia Child and fucked like Xaviera Hollander, and who produced for me two to four perfect, blonde, blue-eyed, preternaturally well-behaved children. IOW, the usual Deep Blue Haze. At night, after everyone was asleep, I would slip out and become a crime-fighting superhero. Oh, and there would be a dog. A golden retriever. Maybe a black lab. I also came of age in the 1980s when some of that was still possible.

**What was your biggest Blue Pill illusion/delusion?**

That true love existed. I watched my parents, who had Crazy, Storybook Love, mostly because my mother was 100% committed to being married, and thought, *""I’m going to be GREAT at this.""*

Spoiler Alert: I was not great at this.

I was exactly what the women I wanted would want…once they hit the Epiphany Phase, which was profoundly not-useful at 18 and 20. I had regular girlfriends at uni, ofc, but I was in a house and on a sports team, so that wasn’t all that difficult to make happen. I did make a fuck ton of bluepill mistakes, though. 

---
###Transitioning
---

**What was a significant life event that contributed to or led to your Red Pill awakening?**

You have two choices in life as a man: Either complain that women go for assholes or be the asshole that women go for. So once results were not as expected, instead of being a “Nice Guy” and blaming women for their nature, I went Back to the Lab to see what worked and what didn’t, and observed what worked for other guys and what didn’t. I wasn’t ever going to be a pure “Chad”, so I learned game, and basically became a Game Jedi.

---
###Red Pill Life
---

**When was a moment where you realized you were on the other side?**

Back in the early 90s when “coffee culture” was becoming a thing, I had a rotation of about 5 girls and there was one late night coffee/dessert place to go to finish an evening, and the guy who owned the place would see me come in with various women and, god bless him, he never said a word to me in front of them, but then I went in with a buddy once during the day, and he said: “DUDE! I have been DYING to ask you this….what is UP with you and all those girls?” So yeah, that was it. I was just being me, doing what I did, and didn’t particularly realize.

In my post-Awakening, when I embarked on a three-way relationship with a woman who went on to be a Playboy Playmate and her hottie roommate - which I accomplished by refusing to choose between them when they asked me to, and telling them I wanted them both - and realizing that I was kind of blasé about it. Sure it was nice, but I knew it was going to have a beginning, a middle and an end. That was the Other Side of the Next Mountain. Now I just levitate above mountains. I realize I sound like the guy who complains about how gigantic his cock is, so I’ll stop here, but any wisdom I have is the product of long and difficult experience, but to my TRPer brothers, it’s FREE. 

**How do you derive meaning and purpose for your own life?**

I write, record and perform original music. You have to find something you really like, whether that “art” is music or painting or woodworking or gardening or French cooking and you do it. You move toward what glows for you, and then you define it and name it and show it to other people, and they see it in a way they hadn’t before. And then they teach you about their “art”.

Oh, and I help the Lost Boys of Reddit who wash up on our shores, after having survived a shipwreck in their lives. When I was young, there were older men who gave me guidance, so I pay it forward.

**What are your aspirations in life and in love now that you have awoken?**

I am currently living the life that I want, so I will keep doing it. I have geographic freedom within North America, when I want to go to Europe (my preferred vacation destination) I go. When I’m working from home, which a friend of mine refers to as ""Stately Wayne Manor"", if I want to chillax by my pool and have OLTR1 or some other girl come over and gargle my nutsack after the Monday Sales Call, I do it. If I want to grill up some meat before the Thursday Compliance Call, I do it. I have readily available sex with young, attractive, nubile women whose company I enjoy. Life is sweet.

As that relates to the general readership, my point is not *“My life ROCKS and yours sucks”* my point it *“My life is awesome, because I made it that way, and yours can be, too.”* Maybe guys can’t do exactly what I do, but they can do their own version of it, and *“get over”* in their own way. *“If you can see it, you can be it,”* etc.

**What still challenges you?**

I used to date a forensic psychologist – sort of like an FBI profiler; she actually did consulting work with the FBI – anyway, she would tell me about people we knew – that guy was cheating, that woman was a kleptomaniac – and every prediction she make came true, over time. So I was like “Do me!” and she basically said, “You are the most sane, grounded person I have ever met.” So my big failing is that I expect people to behave rationally. Really, advice I would give to young guys is get as much practical experience in psychology as you can. Not the bullshit they teach you, but real-world stuff. Most of what I do in business is really psychology.

**Without being too specific, what industry do you work in? In what ways is Red Pill knowledge advantageous for you and your career?**

I work in a hybrid legal/business position in a commodity trading shop. How is Red Pill knowledge advantageous to me in my career? I wrote the [CorporateLand](http://archive.is/gnL4H) series about it. It can be found on the sidebar in askTRP.

**What's an article, theory post, video, or other resource in the RP community/manosphere that really shifted your way of thinking?**

I was basically a finished product when I got here. I did like the “[Casino Metaphor](https://archive.is/5cAL9)”. Sort of the TRP version of the “Husband Store” joke.

I read a lot of Roissy/Heartiste early one - I like his writing style - and Rollo, Dalrock, WSP, and a couple of others. Even some Tucker Max, because back in the 00s there wasn't much around and he and I had some parallels.

**What advice do you wish you'd had, or would you want to pass along to a man who is still waking up?**

All the Good Stuff is in the ""After Hours"" and ""Advice for Young Men"" sections of [CorporateLand](http://archive.is/gnL4H). If I had a time machine, I would hop in it and go find my 15 year old self, explain to him that I was “future him” and hand him a print out of everything I ever posted on TRP. Oh, and also one of those “Back to the Future”-type sports almanacs. I’d also tell young me to get to NYC faster and also that a particular Suzie Sugartits wasn’t “just being friendly” she was 100% DTF, and to get on that shit.",False,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Meet The Endorsed Contributors: VasiliyZaitzev,0,1572285205.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dn8miv/meet_the_endorsed_contributors_vasiliyzaitzev/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,dark,,,,,,0

&amp;#x200B;

**Male Dating Solipsism**

I won't go into female solipsism (cause sidebar) but our equivalent is this:

&amp;#x200B;

*A woman who does not display a base level of interest/enthusiasm in her interactions (F2F, over text or online) with you, or who displays flaky behavior, or who dodges any attempts at setting up a clear and defined date to hang out, ceases to exist upon verified demonstration of such behavior*

&amp;#x200B;

**Some Lack-of-interest behaviors:**

Running bore game (more on that below)

Not paying attention to you on the date

Claims that she is busy/tired blah blah WITHOUT offering an alternative when asked

&amp;#x200B;

Since you can't call, spam text, Facebook stalk something non existent, find something that does or go do something else, like lifting. Deleting/unfollowing is up to the individual, some guys able to apply this rule then do spring cleaning at regular intervals, while others need a heavier hand.

&amp;#x200B;

If a woman blinks back into existence through reaching out to you, apply game as if she were a fresh match, then repeat cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bore Game**

Sometimes you just want to get rid of someone without drama, The easiest and safest way I found (through experience) is not to ghost, not to have any variant of a ""I don't want to continue dating you"" talk but to run bore game on her.

&amp;#x200B;

For comparison, female bore game is simply her giving you junk replies like ""haha"". ""lol"", ""cool"" or any kind of smiley  that does not accompany any content whatsoever

&amp;#x200B;

Male Bore Game is similar but different, reply short sentences, do not attempt to move the convo forward, dodge every attempt to set a date/invite

&amp;#x200B;

F: Hey

M: Hey

F: Whatcha doing?

M: Working

F: Hard at work huh?

M: Yeah

F: Hey Sarah and I are going to a show later, wanna come?

M: Naw busy

F: Aww, how about next week? It runs till then

M: Not sure if I have time next week

&amp;#x200B;

By this point she's likely gone

&amp;#x200B;

Why it works is because simply women are used to men being dancing monkeys trying to win her affection that she'll lose interest in you quick. Also you are being so PC and boring that there is little to no chance of triggering her

&amp;#x200B;

when it comes to shitty behavior by an ltr or wife, i have found this works best for me.

let me preface this by saying, if an ltr cheats, she is gone before she can even say the first syllable of ""I...""

as we all have learned here though, there are many gray areas and women often like to try to push the limit to fitness test you. this can happen in the beginning of an ltr (or a plate even) and can reoccur many times through out the course of the relationship. sometimes it's your fault--you got soft, you broke frame too often... and other times, it can be through no fault of your own--your time was running out, other guys caught her attention and she got ready to branch swing.

my old ways, would have possibly been to talk to her and tell her what is and isn't acceptable for me. oh, what an blue pilled, moron i was... ultimatums--coming from a point of weakness. logic--chicks and logic, now that shit is funny!

what i have come to realize is very easy actually. i don't get mad any more. i try to stay completely calm and non reactive--easier said than done at times when hearing complete bullshit woman speak. if it's a plate. next. maybe soft next, maybe hard next, but that's easy either way. 

if it's more serious ltr, it's a bit more tricky, but some dialog is usually needed. bad behavior on her part--maybe not the first time--regardless it's behavior that i will not accept. i become colder and distant. somewhat like a soft next. problem is, if you have been in an ltr for a longer period of time, you know you will be approached and need to address the issue.

i don't have relationships with women that act like/think like/do .... whatever it was.

it makes things very easy. i don't need to listen to bullshit, and deflection, and twists of the story, and who is wrong and who is right. we are both right. you have your boundaries and limits, and i have mine, and this doesn't work for me.

the end. 

i found out that this attitude, along with holding frame, and not getting sucked into the drama to work rather well.

would be happy to hear your take on it.

Start being more self aware and realise that we need to tailor advice in TRP and our lives to our own personality. 

Not everything is 100% the right way. There is only the right way for you. 

All advice should be used in a way that is right for YOU.

People speak of aspects of TRP as being absolute truths and to stray from them would be “wrong”. 

Example: The advice given by TRP on where to take girls when you first meet (which is: a bar, a coffee shop, mini golf etc.) How about the advice that is neglected the most: where are you most comfortable talking to girls? As long as she’s comfortable meeting at that place. That is better advice. That is a better location. That is more conducive to success. 

Being a quiet person who doesn’t like a lot of stimuli. I love nature. That’s my personality. Wish it was different but the friction needed to change that aspect of my personality is so great that it would hinder other more valuable personal pursuits. Therefore: I meet women in parks or beautiful gardens in the city. It works. No advice in TRP really guides people to work with their strengths. That is where self awareness is so important as an individual using this powerful material.

If you get bored with meeting women then start to challenge your comfort zone, by meeting in an uncomfortable place.

The direction that TRP is instructing and cultivating through the culture is that there are certain hard truths that we all must work with. I agree with most of them. Some I don’t. I still love TRP but not every aspect. 

Challenge what you idolise. Your human idol or hero shouldn’t be 100% correct about everything. My favourite things all have aspects that I disagree with.

The most important and valuable assets are health, personality and happiness and strengths. Don’t ignore them in pursuit of something greater. Use them as tools for your pursuit and live a better life without friction. Bet on your strengths. Work on weaknesses as necessary but make things easier on yourself by using what is already at your disposal. 

TRP is powerful life changing advice. Just don’t follow everything blindly. Question it. How can it be improved.

Took me a while to really step back and view this from a birds eye view but now I really notice this pattern in our relationship.

The easiest part is reading all of this shit and learning WHAT to do. 

This may be a semi long post so I will try to keep it as short as possible.

Been seeing a chick for about four months now. It was the beginning of summer and I had just come back from Europe from a nine month employment opportunity so I was ready to get some American ass again. 

Everything was working fine because we both had an understanding that I would be leaving three months down the road. So she was almost able to block the way her brain naturally told her to try and settle down with this male prospect, and just have a summer fling. 

Now I am naturally kind of a dick. I don’t mean to be at times it’s just the way my life has shaped me to be with the things I have been through. Used to be fat and was treated like shit and then got fit and now most people would refer to me as an attractive male. Now that I am getting older and I am still fit, my market value has only risen. (My job requires me to remain fit). She is a pretty attractive chick who probably hasn’t been used to being treated the way she was being treated by me. I would ignore her text three or four times during the night, allow her to throw hissy fits and walk off expecting me to follow her out the club or bar, only to see me no where in sight and eventually get into an Uber. But as TRP has taught us if you look good enough and you treat them like dirt, they stick to you like mud. This went on for three months. After each one of these outbursts she would call and text me “I can’t believe you would let me leave” and “you choose our friend group over me”, and then follow up w/ “come get me please babe”.

Eventually, circumstances had it to where I would not be returning to Europe any longer. So she naturally began to fixate on the idea that maybe we could have an exclusive relationship. She no longer wanted to be “just having sex” and “only coming over to watch a movie”. Now she began to ask for dates and to be courted. Which was naturally understandable. Given the circumstances. And I would always brush it off or find a way not to answer the question. Let me not act hard or cool, I liked the chick. We cuddled we fucked we had fun, it was a good time. 

Long story short, this weekend her best friend from her hometown came to visit. Naturally, her best friend wants to meet this “awesome” guy that she’s been dating. I didn’t mean for it to work out this way, but I caused an argument in front of her friend. I can admit when I’m wrong, sure. her friend in turn took up for the chick I was seeing (which she is supposed to), and that started a whole down spiral to the weekend. The chick I was seeing began to act very out of character and do things that she would normally not do. She slammed my door. She caused many scenes. Wouldn’t text me. And put on a show in front of the best friend.

Now I did nothing that I would normally not do in front of her. However, she was able to give her friend an insight into how she was being treated. This allowed for her to come to the realization in the end that maybe I AM being treated like shit, but she only needed someone to be a witness and tell her about it in order for her to actually tell herself it’s true. She even told me that she would make excuses to herself to be treated like this. 

The whole weekend goes by without a word from her and I finally see her at our usual spot on Saturday. We have an exchange of words before it’s apparent that you can’t talk to a drunk chicks and try to find a happy medium. Especially in front of their best friends. She caused a scene, her best friend is a bitch, and we go our separate ways only to have her text me at 2:30 in the morning like everything was normal. But just an hour ago you were causing a scene and making a ruckus like you didn’t want me?? Did what I usually do and didn’t respond a few times and she would text me two or three times in a row. Finally left her on read at four in the morning. During these text one of the things that stuck out to me the most was the fact that she said she didn’t know how I felt about her. She said she never did and it was apparent that she grew frustrated with not knowing.

I won’t lie, I am not the type of person who can close off my emotions after hanging with someone for an extended period of time. As science has revealed, it only takes three months for the person to hang out with someone to activate the same receptors that give you the feeling of love. Which is basically just the infatuation phase if you will. Not saying that I love her or anything but just that it is bound to happen when you hang out with someone so much and you start to become accustom to their presence.. No matter how much you disrespect them even if it isn’t intentional disrespect, it is disrespect nonetheless. (Not texting back or calling back, hanging out on your terms, etc)

I felt bad/missed fucking her and hanging out, and so after not speaking or writing her back, I went and got a card and just let her know that I care about her. Radio silence the next day. Sign of disrespect? Maybe. sign that maybe she needed some time to think. possibly.

So I text her and asked if she read the card. No reply. The next day I’m chilling w/ another chick asking her thoughts on the situation (35 year old blonde who’s party days are way behind her, but has an insight into how women think) and she tells me if I wanna possibly see where it could go w/ this chick, that I need to text her and let her know that I like her and that I would like to take her on a date to explain our situation. (Mistake). At this point with the card and the text message, I give her the power. In her mind she thinks that the last four months she has been feeling insecure and that now she is finally secure in knowing that I have given her what she has wanted and that now I see how SHE feels about the uncertainty she’s dealt w/ for four months.

She finally reaches out and calls me and basically says that she didn’t know that I liked her and that over the past four months it has been very hard for her to put herself in a position to be seeing someone without dating them. She said she only has seven bodies but we all know that women can or cannot lie. I believe her but maybe that is the immaturity in my part and not taking the red pill as I should. She’s says that I embarrassed her in front of her best friend. (Women want to be treated like shit and they are fine w/ it up until people notice that they are treated like shit or you do it in public) Call me a blue pill but I don’t like to see the worst in everyone.

Long story short she says that she wants to take some time away to decompress because she feels drained by my lack of respect and allowing herself to put up with such behavior. She says that she needs one or two weeks to get back on track and be herself again and maybe we can “start fresh and see where this goes” but that she wouldn’t be going “back to just hooking up w/ no commitment”

This field report just goes to show how women are. When you give them what they want it only makes them want more. Or maybe not?. Or maybe I am just not analyzing the situation correctly. She wanted a relationship, initially I couldn’t provide that, and now that there’s a possibility for one, she needs to think because I’ve done her so wrong in the past . Was I a dick yes. But I treated her better than the other chicks I fuck and kick out afterwards.

I think the main takeaways from this is just to show that TRP only teach you how to use the information. But a big part of it is also knowing when and how much to use. Never meet the friends until you are ready. Never meet them unless you actually like them and could possibly see them with you down the road even if you don’t explicitly state that to them. Being in my mid-20s, women are less likely to want to put up w/ games and just hook up, sure. But for that certain person (Chad), they are willing to disrespect themselves in order to hopefully have a chance. But even when they realize how they have been treated, one of two things will happen. Either she will allow herself to be disrespected again and again, or she will begin to lay ground rules and tell you that she will not go back to just being your fuck toy. And then it is on you to decide whether or not you want to pursue a relationship. Maybe she comes back around? Maybe she doesn’t. But as a man, you have to be upfront and honest w/ yourself AND w/ her. 

Will I try to take things further? Maybe hit her up in the next few weeks and check on her and see if it’s somethin there. But as history has shown, breaks hardly ever do both parties any good. But will I will take from this is There comes a certain point in life where the games ends up fucking us all in the end. Maybe in the beginning it is a good way to cause intrigue, but after a while, the games eventually cause more good than bad depending on the intended outcome. (Relationship or not) 

Takeaways:

Women act different around their friends

Women want what they can’t have

When they get what they want, you still have to play the game but not as much

Never break or fold but also let your intentions be known

If you like a chick tell her

The older women get the less games they play. Know when to play them and for how long

Been seeing a chick for about four months now. It was the beginning of summer and I had just come back from Europe from a nine month employment opportunity so I was ready to get some American ass again. 

Everything was working fine because we both had an understanding that I would be leaving three months down the road. So she was almost able to block the way her brain naturally told her to try and settle down with this male prospect, and just have a summer fling. 

Now I am naturally kind of a dick. I don’t mean to be at times it’s just the way my life has shaped me to be with the things I have been through. Used to be fat and was treated like shit and then got fit and now most people would refer to me as an attractive male. Now that I am getting older and I am still fit my market value has only risen. (My job requires me to remain fit). She is a pretty attractive chick who probably hasn’t been used to being treated the way she was being treated by me. I would ignore her text three or four times during the night, allow her to throw hissy fits and walk off expecting me to follow her out the club or bar, only to see me no where in sight and eventually get into an Uber.

Pretty much, if you want to consider yourself a “Red Pill Man”, these three categories summarize our “ideology”, for lack of a better word.

1.	Sexual strategy (e.g., have casual sex)
2.	Understanding women (e.g., don’t trust women)
3.	Understanding society (e.g., don’t get married)

**Sexual strategy** is a simple concept. Basically, this boils down to learning how to maximize the quantity and quality of sex you can have. To maximize your sexual opportunity.

Back in your pre-Red Pill days, you probably thought that the best way to do this was to make friends with a woman, grow to like each other, start dating, get serious and start having sex, get married, and live happily ever after in a sex-filled marriage. But it turns out that today, in 2019, most women are pretty darn slutty and will have sex with the right kind of men outside of relationships. There’s an entire casual sex culture operating behind the scenes.

The casual sex culture has two big effects on a man’s sexual strategy. First, if you can become a part of the casual sex culture, that is a far better way to maximize your sexual opportunity than the dating – girlfriend – wife route.

Second, because women are having their sexual needs met easily outside of relationships, they don’t want or need to date regular guys like you. When they do date a guy like you, the sex isn’t why they’re dating you – they have sex regardless of their relationship status. When they enter into a relationship with you, it’s everything about the relationship except the sex that they’re trying to add to their lives. They’ve already got sex.

This means that the best sexual strategy for a man will include casual sex. Casual sex is the best way to maximize your opportunities. While you can have some sex with a wife or girlfriend, and at some points in your life depending on other things that are going on, it may be a decent choice to have a girlfriend for awhile, the best sexual strategy is going to incorporate casual sex into your life.

If you are not good-looking or if your social skills currently suck, your sexual strategy today, right now, should include the right diet, the right gym routine, getting nice clothes and a nice haircut, and learning game. If you are not having casual sex right now, your sexual strategy should include improvements that will put you on the path to having casual sex.

If you are one of those guys who has decided to declare that casual sex is an empty pursuit and that you’re only interested in good women and an eventual family, or in no women at all because women just aren’t worth it, odds are that you’re a loser. If you are one of those rare guys who has had lots of casual sex and have the opportunity to have casual sex right now – you are good-looking, successful, your game is great, and you frequently have offers and opportunities for casual sex – but you have chosen to pursue other things, that’s fine. You do you. But if you are a guy who can’t get laid and have “decided” not to pursue the best possible sexual strategy for men, casual sex, you haven’t “decided” anything. This was decided for you by women, who have power over you. You don’t know what you’re missing or what you’re passing up. You never tasted it. You just figured that since you don’t have the opportunity anyway, you’re going to accept the decision women have made for you and call it your own decision.

The Red Pill way of **Understanding Women** is the main reason The Red Pill receives so much derision from people on the outside. Women are human beings, flawed like any other, and when you recognize how flawed they are and say it out loud, it sounds mean, judgmental, and bigoted.

Once you really know and understand what women are like and how they operate, it’s hard to respect them. Most Red Pill Men don’t like or trust women. Don’t get me wrong – they can be fun to hang out with and interesting human beings, in addition to fun sexual partners. But it’s tough to really and truly like a woman.

There is no such thing as a “good woman”. There is just a woman who is being good right now. Given the right incentives, a good woman becomes an okay woman or a bad woman. There is no magical checklist of traits you can vet a woman for in order to find a woman who is always a good one. They’re all a little different, but they’re still all women, and under the right conditions, all women become bad.

And like all humans, women behave in the way that they are incentivized to behave. If you are not currently a woman’s best opportunity for sex or a relationship, a woman is not obligated to stay with you eternally just because you happened to come along first. If you are not a woman’s best opportunity, the woman is going to cheat on you, dump you, or treat you badly. Different women may do different combinations of these things, but no woman is going to happily stay with a man and eagerly jump into bed with him night after night when she feels like she’s not getting her best opportunity.

And no different from any of us, for a woman, time and familiarity leads to boredom and contempt. The longer you’re with the same woman, the harder it is to remain the best opportunity in her eyes, and the more exciting a new guy seems.

On top of that, a lack of consequences is often as good as any incentive. In a world where Tinder exists, a woman can literally meet somebody from outside of her social and work circles, that she will never see again, who is more hot and more fun than the usual guys she can attract for something more serious, and have a good time. She can even do sex things she’d never do with a boyfriend. And nobody will ever know.

If a woman really wants to have sex tonight, she can have a fuck-date set up with about 15 minutes and a cell phone. Sex and attention from men is extremely abundant for any woman who’s not completely hideous. Which makes your sex and your attention fairly boring and value-less, unless there’s something special about you that makes you her best opportunity.

These conditions make the act of having sex and relationships with women something you have to qualify for. You have the burden of being good enough. Hot enough, successful enough, fun enough, interesting enough, with good enough game. A woman can simply exist and accept applicants, then go home with the best one. You have to outshine other applicants.

And when you have been the guy a woman goes home with for one night and seen how women behave when they’re not trying to impress anybody and don’t care if they see you again – what sex really means to women - it makes it hard to consider the sex you have with your girlfriend six months later as something special. 

When it comes to **Understanding Society**, most Red Pill Men simply say to “enjoy the decline”. We live in a liberal, feminist world where we have freed women from expectations and consequences, and now that they have this freedom, they use it to drink too much and have lots of casual sex. Yet none of them are happy and over a third of them are on anti-depressants. Meanwhile, the world has declared that conventional masculinity is outdated and disgusting, while secretly rewarding masculine men with sex and other opportunities behind the scenes.

If you’re hot, fun, and interesting enough, you don’t have to commit to women to have sex with them, and the women don’t care. They’re having fun. They’ve been taught their entire lives that doing anything for the express purpose of pleasing a man is evil and oppressive and that they don’t need men, so they convince themselves that they’re using men for sex then end up feeling used.

Wives are celebrated as heroes and practically paid off to divorce their husbands and take the kids, while unmarried hags screech about how the disgusting act of loving your husband is unpaid emotional labor.

The one thing that turns women off more than anything is having power over a man, yet the modern system gives wives complete power over their husbands then wonders why the wives don’t want to have sex any more and why half of them are filing for divorce. Not to escape cheating or abusive men, but to escape the oppression of having to fuck the average hard-working husband who loves and supports her. Having power over a man makes him seem like a child in her eyes.

We started out at a young age fantasizing about a future with a happy wife and children, a happy marriage filled with love, sex, and respect, and a successful family, only to learn that marrying, having kids, or even just cohabiting, is a risky venture, with a high cost and bad odds. And letting that fantasy go and actually accepting that there are no “good women” out there we can search and vet for to marry, and there is no special way we can behave that will make our wives behave and our families be happy, and the best route really is to avoid marriage, kids, and cohabitation? That’s hard.

In conclusion, The Red Pill is a hard pill to swallow.

Becoming a man who can employ the best sexual strategy – casual sex? That’s hard.

Keeping our emotional distance from women when, deep down inside, we want nothing more than to love and be loved? Recognizing that a current woman is not special or any more trustworthy than any other woman? That’s hard.

Giving up on our old fantasy of a marriage and a happy family? That’s really hard.

In fact, The Red Pill is so hard to swallow that many men try to half-ass The Red Pill. They decide they’re going to read bullshit on the internet all day but not actually work out, eat right, or game women because it’s “not worth it” to employ the best sexual strategy possible – casual sex.

Many men cling to the idea that if they search long enough and vet for the right characteristics, they can find a good woman who is not like other women, doesn’t behave the same way, and can give them that future they want. That not all women are like that, only a select few bad ones.

Many men can’t let go of the idea that their purpose in life is marriage and children and without that, their life is empty.

So they half-ass The Red Pill by conveniently ignoring certain truths because those truths don’t support their preferred fantasies.

Thing is, nobody is going to give up on something they’ve invested so much emotion into just because they read something like this on the internet. They need to get burned first. They need to fail at the fantasy.

LTR: says always how much she loves me, says she loved any guy as much as me, says always I am best, I don’t deserve you and all that kind of stuff... she always shows me her dms, messages that she never giver her snapchat in instagram and says she has boyfriend..

Me: I never say I love her, only when if she asked ”do you love me” then I say ”you know how much I love you” and use 1-2/3 thing she says 3 words and I answer 1-2 and I almost never validate her, I am focusing on selfimprovement, lifting, waking up 4:45 every day, meditation, reading a lot etc... I am 6”3 tall and 188 pounds, 11-14% bodyfat... ~ my smv is 8

So I want to see what happens if youtuber asks her to go out with him.

So now he asked for her snapchat in instagram dm’s, she ofcourse gave him and now he is talking to her in snapchat and trying to setup date.

I know that she will go out with him, because of his social status, but only thing what he has better in him is his status and social proof but pros are that he is black (not against at all), 5”5, not lifting, bluepill, average.

Our plan is to see if she will go out and then if she goes youtuber will flake so badly, he says time and place and she goes there but he will not go there and ghost her.

Seb was a smart guy, good looking, but like most intelligent men he didn't know his value.

He was dating Jane, a woman past the wall, somewhat remarkable but nothing spectacular. They lived together for only five months.

They had a messy breakup, she calls the police and suggests he's been violent and abusive. 

We speak daily, I advise him to part ways, don't fight over the toaster, focus on his life mission, she's replaceable.

We go out for a drink and he's getting through it; taking his time.

A day later I'm informed he passed from a medical complication.

His brother confesses that after alcohol and an endone he simply never woke up.

One of the toughest days of my life was speaking at his funeral, I feel like I failed a brother.

I don't know how he died, but I know how he lived, he was a good man, a dear friend.

It's been almost 6 months and I think of him often. His mother invites me for coffee. She informs me Jane is now fighting for his estate, stating they did not breakup, statuary declaration and all.

He listed her as a spouse on his employment records, and she's now claiming his entire estate, his life insurance and Roth 401k. 

His mother wants to reinvest his money back into his research, his life legacy. I've issued a statement and urged his mother to fight this.

We all speak of Briffaults law, but seeing this in action, even after you die is remarkable.

I advise all men here to sort our their trust and will with an estate lawyer and to never live with a woman who is not the mother of your children.

[Lowry et al. (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4106110/) found that:

&gt;... among sexually active female students, obese females were more likely than normal weight females to have had 4 or more sex partners (odds ratio, OR = 1.59), not used a condom at last sexual intercourse (OR = 1.30), and injected illegal drugs (OR = 1.98).

A similar effect with respect to sexual partners was *not* found in male students (as if male students are having *more* sex than their thin counterparts ammirite?). Whilst the conclusion was regarding sexually active students and that obese students might see a 'protective effect' of their BMI (as no one wants to fuck them), Lowry et al. says:

&gt;though BMI may be a protective factor for decreased likelihood of sexual experience and current sexual activity, such “protection” may reflect social stigma related to perceived weight and attractiveness.

This seems to refute the notion published by [Bajos, Welling and Laborde (2010)](https://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c2573) that *""obese women were less likely than normal weight women to report having a sexual partner in the past 12 months"".* What I mean to say is that when obese women *are* sexually active, they are more likely to be promiscuous than their normal weight counterparts.

Lowry et al.'s findings were corroborated in this more recent paper by [Lima et al (2019).](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1679-45082019000300212)

I cbfed finding the full-text, but the abstract of a paper published by [Boughton (2010)](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/722673) for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists corroborates the above with the following:

&gt;When researchers analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Study, they found that obese and overweight adolescent girls were more likely to have sex before the age of 13 years and to have more than 3 lifetime partners, and were less likely to use condoms or contraception.

Now, I am open to varying hypotheses as to cause of this behaviour.

My whole teenage years i was a lazy piece of shit who only played vidya, smoked weed, procrastinated pretty much everything and hated everone who wanted me to get out of this bubble. I'm the youngest of three with two sisters, my mum indulged me and my father wasn't home very often, when he was we just yelled at eachother and we never had a good old father son talk.

I moved out of my parents home at the age of 17\~ because the disputes between me and my father, which became very intense. At the same time i was moving out i got a girlfriend, that means i never had time to really live alone and get to know myself. But i didn't realize how important that is, I just focused on the shit i alrdy did ( being a lazy pos and such ).

I was the biggest asshole, i pretty much used most of my girlfriends only for sex but at the same time i was the fucked one who's been love sick after the break ups ..everytime.. i didn't understand myself at all.

I'm 28 now and in the last 5 years i was in a relationship in which i wasn't using my gf only for sex because (atleast) i learned a lil bit from the previous ones. I really started to love her in the 1st year but i was still a lazy pos.

After 3 years in that relationship she broke up with me but this time it was different.. i wasn't as much devestated  as in the previous 2 ( sit in my room smoke pot and hate everything about life ). I accepted her decision and started to work out, live healthier, got new hobbies and a apprenticeship for a profession which is way better than the one i alrdy got. 

2 weeks after the breakup she contacted me ( fucked a guy inbetween which i didn't knew back then ) and of course i took her back and told/showed her on what path i'm now. We continued with some doubt on her side ..rightly so.. i wouldn't believe a guy who says he wants to change for the relationship either. For 9 months i was completely clean, still worked out, ate way healthier and didn't procrastinated anything of importance.

  
She started to say that she loves me again... i don't know why but this kinda took my motivational ""fire"" because something in me felt ""safe"" again. She started visiting me more often and she said she doesn't want to stop with her bad habits ( she had her own problems with addiction and herself, she told me that it's not that bad if we smoke one or two and if i play vidya because she likes playing em aswell ).

I got thrown back into my old habits... not that much but still... if i look at it now it was a huge setback for me. We continued for almost another year.

2 months ago she broke up again for the same reasons .. almost .. at the time of the break up she told me that she heard that her ex is available again and she wants to try to get back together with him. I just said ""ok, i can't do anthing against that"" she was shocked at my response but inside me i was torn apart at the moment. Tbh it wasn't that bad and i don't know why, i think if she had said she just ""needs time"" or had some other random guy, it would've hurt me way more.

Nevertheless i got my ""fire"" back but this time it's 10 fold intensity. My whole life (except for the 9 months last year) i was chaotic, unorganized, lived from day to day and everything was indifferent .. but for the last two month I'm the complete opposite.

 I wake up every day at 5am do 10-20min of yoga ( ha.. gayy! ), eat a healthy breakfast, write shit down i got to do in my journal and try to live my day as concious as possible. I visit the gym 3 times a week and nearly every weekend I'm with friends or go out. Additionally i've cut off any ""energy vampires"" in my life, found out who my real friends are, reached out to old friends that i treated like shit and made friends with em again, my appartment is pretty much always clean af and i didn't take the first chance to get a new gf because i want to give myself time to fully heal/get to know myself/love myself.

I'm scared if i fall in love with a new girl that i lose this ""fire"" again ( if someday i can finally love myself 100% maybe it doesn't happen again? ). And something in my mind always wants to tell me that i need to make some kids which always drags me down a lil bit.

The Manosphere exists out of a synergistic relationship between PUA hucksters who misrepresent their sex lives and clueless beta males who uncritically believe the bullshit. If everyone is so interested in helping you navigate the sexual marketplace, where is the guide on tricking a club bitch into washing her nasty club pussy after she turned up at your bropartment? You're not going to find that guide. Why? Because the grittiness of fucking whores is a turnoff to the beta males who fantasize about them. The Alpha Black Wolf Seduction guide is a much better sell than the Ay Yo Bitch Wash That Pussy So That I Can Stay Hard While We Fuck guide.

Now ask yourself how is believing in another man's delusional fairy tale going to personally help you get sex? Isn't that just treating blue pill with more blue pills? If a person's entire identity and business model is built on reinforcing beta male delusions by uncritically regurgitating sex scenes from Hollywood action films, how is that going to help you put your real penis inside a real vagina?

Fantasies and anti-fantasies distort men's perspectives and make it more difficult for them to achieve their goals. If you’re traversing a desert see the desert for what it is so that you can navigate it correctly. Fantasizing about meeting unicorn Cinderella is counter-productive, likewise having paranoid incel anti-fantasies is also not beneficial. Today we are going to take a hard realist view, on the 2019 sexual marketplace, a place where ⅔ of women are overweight or obese and ⅕ are on antidepressants. The American Sexual marketplace is the absolute worst. However, it's the one that the majority of the Red Pill operates in so that's what we're going to discuss.

The American family is the most fucked that is has ever been which means that American women who are the product of the American family are the most fucked they've ever been. Keep in mind, I'm not taking a tradcuck moralist position. The men here are the product of exactly the same process and aren't any better. In other words, this is a guide for sewer-men to fuck sewer sluts in the sewer. We're not in the 1950's where three dates and a bouquet of flowers gets you a kiss. This isn't the 70's where you could barter cocaine for anal at the disco. Nor is this the PUA 2000s where you can dress like a steampunk pirate and cocky and funny your way into a taxi blowjob. We're three months away from 2020. Twenty-year-old women are autistic phone-tards who experience the world through technology and malfunction the minute reality doesn't conform to the virtual. Your sexual strategy needs to reflect that.

Just as twenty-year-old men of AskTRP are incapable of authentic unscripted human interaction, so are women. What remains of conversation, if you can even call it that, is people taking turns emoting in response to rigid set of memes, exactly like a Tik-Tok video. If you don't believe me treat yourself to a fancy Sunday brunch and observe these robo-Rachels in their natural habitat. Unlike previous generations, these people grew up immersed in smartphone and zero tolerance public education safe zones, so they are incapable of handling any uncertainty. If you say anything that deviates too much from NPC script, they'll freeze awkwardly like a deer about to get plowed by redneck in a Ford F-150.

Speaking of plowing into maladjusted half-retarded animals, here's the key thing you need to understand if you want to vag-plow this generation of 20 year olds. More so than any prior generation this generation of women lacks continuity of experience and is unable to conceptualize the world into a big picture. One minute they have a boyfriend the next minute they have a strange dick in their vagina. It just happened. They experience reality as a quasi-schizophrenic series of unrelated events because that's how reality is felt on the internet. Since most of their waking day is spent immersed in smartphones, they understand physical reality as if it's virtual reality. When a woman ghosts a man in her mind she is simply navigating to the next webpage.

The younger the woman and the greater and the percentage of her life that was spent immersed in her smartphone, the lower her attention span and continuity of experience. What this means in practical terms is that unless you're interested in dried up cougar or technologically isolated Afghan girl, you are going to have to ditch the slow PUA style of the VHS 90s and DVD 2000s and move to a fast high energy 2020 meme style.

What this means in practice is that you need to make everything a joke and not a joke at the same time. Tell her that she should come up for coffee but only if she promises not to use you for your huge muscles and gigantic penis. Be so ironic you don't have to take responsibility for banging her. Make her reveal her ""slutty side"" and act surprised that she sucked your penis instead of appreciating your high thread count bed sheets. After you nut down her piehole, cuddle and talk like a romcom beta so the event isn't misclassified as grape. Tell her how proud you are of her for showing her full sexual side and living her truth, without being inhibited by the patriarchy that was dissolved 200 years ago. That's how you get her to blow you again by disguising your refractory period as a heart to heart. That's how you fuck in 2020 instead of masturbating to how James Bond fucks in the movies or how some dude allegedly fucked in his ultimate seduction DVDs.

Don’t get me wrong, when it comes to certain topics, there isn’t much of an answer... it’s ether right or wrong. Like, for example, if you want to do keto or fast, and I say that it is stupid... you might be like, “fuck you, you’re stupid. Fasting is the best thing ever because autophagy. I will live forever! Boom, in your face.”

Well, the truth is, we can both actually be right. And, what we are left with is a bunch of idiots arguing about I don’t even know what. For example, if both of our goals are to get lean, and we both make it there, then we were both right in our approaches. 


Why? Because I am good at eating 5 meals a day, I feel good and I am not too lazy to prep all of my meals. You, on the other hand, might have a hard time meal prepping. 


Ultimately, the thing that matters is we both had a caloric deficiency. For me, because I prepped my meals accordingly, and for you, because you aren't eating for like 16 hours or whatever you freaks do so you obviously are going to be eating less anyway.


However, for example, if one of my secondary goals is to preserve muscle, then my plan will be better for me because 5 meals a day with protein and carbs is going to retain muscle more than fasting ever could. Now hold on before you fasting people start commenting. Sure, fasting releases growth hormone and shit, I get it. But, let’s be real here, that isn’t going to help retain more muscle than eating actual protein will. Protein is a fucking building block of muscle. If I am releasing building blocks all day into my body (and the right amount), I am much less likely to lose muscle than not. 


The point isn’t that I am here to argue about what is the best way... the point is that I am here to argue that you should choose the BEST POSSIBLE WAY, FOR YOU. What works for you is what I am after. And not just in diet, but in your whole entire life. 


One other note, sometimes, something has to give. If you fight against the best way too hard, you will fail. For example, if you want to fast, cool. But even with all that fasting, you’re still going to need to eat at a deficiency or else you will fail at your goal of getting lean. So, my point is, you always need to look for the baseline rule in something. For example, you need to burn more calories than you eat if you plan to lose fat. That is a rule. Everything else is there to be tailored for you to help you meet your goals.


The process looks like this:

1. Find out your goal

2. Find out the rule(s) you must follow for success. There should not be many...

3. Use those rules to create a plan that works for you


4. Analyze the results and adjust one thing at a time.

BODY:



Anyway, this post came to me as an idea after someone pointed out to me that one muscle group of mine had shrank, while another had grown. I had changed my routine around 2 months before this comment was made to me... it got me thinking. 


We sometime become so incredibly hyper focused on our goals, and chasing so fast after them, that we get lost and sometimes cannot see ourselves accomplishing this thing. This is especially true when we consider our goal to be difficult. 

Most things that are worth anything take time to complete. Packing muscle on your frame, getting ripped, learning a foreign language, learning to program, saving up that first $10, reading a a difficult book... all of these things take time. Some take a lot more time than others. 

Here at TRP so we learn cutting edge tricks from bro-scientists that have been dead-lifting hard in the lab all hours of the day. These jacked freaks bring you key insight, including but not limited to how you can bury your dick inside of strange women, and increase your productivity while doing so. 

For those of you that have made your life a priority and decided to undergo change, you can sometimes feel lost in a maze of discomfort. You want your result, and you want it now. You may freak out, and remember that beta Albert Einstein’s saying that doing the same thing and expecting a different result is “crazy”. So, of course, you come and ask for advice from the dick burying mongrels at TRP, because they’re sure to be your light in the dark.


But, imagine. Imagine that when you do make a change, that you are sure to track what changes you’ve made. Imagine if you used yourself as a science experiment. Imagine if you had controls, and only changed one thing about yourself at a time. And, when you did, you wrote down those changes and the results. When you did make it to your goal, you wrote down what worked and what path you took to truly get there. You kept it in a super scientific red notebook that no one can ever find.


You looked not only at the process it took to get you there and what it was that happened along the way. You found out what steps could of been cut out of the process altogether, and what had the biggest effect. 

If, for example, it were a workout plan, you wrote down what happened to your chest and your bi’s on that plan. Did the Bi’s get bigger than the other muscles? Because, it is true that different workout plans will affect your body differently. But, how do they affect YOU? 


Or, maybe you realized a chain reaction of sorts. Like, watching TV at bedtime caused you to sleep less throughout the night, which caused you to ultimately loss strength. 


And, when you get a little older and 2 or 4 years pass by, this information can come in handy. Well, maybe it’s time to do a cut diet again, and knowing exactly how you made it to your goal is helpful. When you go through a dry spell, knowing exactly what to do since this last happened is helpful. When you start acting passive-aggressive and you notice because you have no friends, and people treat you like a beta, knowing exactly what you need to do is helpful. 



You don’t need to journal. But, you should at least WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU DID TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL. Write down what didn’t work, and what did. Eliminate the garbage that was unnecessary in reaching your goal.


Stop listening to everyone else’s advice and start experimenting on yourself and taking your own from your past experiences.


_______________________________________________________

LESSONS LEARNED:

1. Know your goal.
2. Know what will help you get to your goal. This is where research comes in. Find out, to the best of your knowledge, what those one or two rules are that will ultimately make you successful in your goal.
3. Use those one or two rules to make a plan that works for you and your life.
4. Follow the plan, making one change at a time.
5. Record the results and evaluate what got you there.

I moved back to civilization, East Coast, after years travelling the world and living/working up north.

I surrounded myself with mentors and travellers over the years, and most of my friends are red-pilled 40, 50+ years old men, just cause that's what I met along the road or work with. Some of you might have followed me on my blog, so you know a bit more where I come from.

And so I'm *almost* shocked at how low confidence your average man is in society? What happened? 

I met many young professional male – it's obvious something went very wrong.

I guess I was living in a bubble. I had no clue it got so bad. Where are all the warriors and fighters and men with dignity walking with their shoulder straight back?

Rent is over.

Just something I noticed: You cannot buy confidence. You cannot buy character. You have to go to the crucible of life *yourself* and that comes at a cost that is far greater than any finite mean (such as money) could ever cover. 

Character is what's lacking – yes, I am getting closer to what I've observed.

Character is everything.

Character is what provides the beat to the melody of your life. Work hard on it. I don't want to preach – I know, I'm doing it – but gee, it's no joke to come up at 30 years old and be...boring. 

Life's short, make the most of it, live an exciting life.

The vid is a must watch for newbies and vets alike. The guy making the video is Todd Valentine, a PUA who has spent many years in the game and has been considered one of the best- if not the best- right now. The video's premise is the fact that ""Alpha Male"" advice (aka edgy TRP field reports) is flawed and will only hold you back in the long run. 

I won't say much since the video mostly speaks for itself, but I will say this for the noobs. 

When I started my RP journey, I was frustrated and very, very angry. In a way, being so angry was good because it gave me motivation to start and actually do something to make my life better. But that shit can only take you so far. 

There's an old saying that goes, ""Holding a grudge is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die."" It's paraphrased, but that can't be me more true. Being angry at my ex for boning some other dude or whatever and holding it in does shiiit for your life. It only makes it worse and it drags you down. Let that shit go and make your life better. The best revenge is making your life so good that you don't even THINK about an old broken heart. 

This is for all the noobs: This subreddit is full of posts filled with ""slut"", ""hos"", ""pump and dump"" and any other myriad of stuff thrown at the broads.  Don't get me wrong, btw, I actually find that shit funny and it's awesome for annoying the SJWs. However, I know that when I first got into this subreddit, these types of posts would only fuel my vitriol and make me even worse. Not just in terms of women, but life in general. You can choose what to focus on, including negativity. Choose whichever, that's on you, but  just know that your selective focus will color your life. Remember that.

Anyways, keep pumping and dumping or whatever.

To be honest, I cannot be sure that this is not another cry for money scam, but it is as sincere as I can see and hear. 

It is about a young guy telling his recent story of his own family all broken up and totally destroyed due to AWALT. His father is currently in the process of divorce initiated by the mother and the whole family is being fucked over trying to rebuild whatever is left of the family (A dad, a son, and a daughter).

The money for this Kickstarter project is promised to both help the son and father rebuilding their broken family and raise awareness for men's battered mental health. They create coffee tables and chairs out of tree roots to show the weight a man of a family has to carry, which in my opinion very beautiful.

Please watch the video which is 13 minutes long where the dude tells the story. The project looks like any ordinary hippy project but I assure you it will resonate with all the men especially those who has experienced and understood AWALT.

1- text you that she misses you only to weeks later(after you giver her what she wants) stop talking to you like it's nothing.

Note:even if she says ''I miss you'' that is only until she feeds off  of your attention and validation.

2- even if you date her for years she will next you (again) like you are nothing.

3-The ''2'' happens not just because of hypergamy but because she lacks a sense of self image or identity. 

Ex: She'll trade friends on a season of 1 to 2 years, being fan of Kurt Cobain when she's 18, pain her hair and doing rastas and changing friends at 19 or 20.


4- after this, when she has no one to give her attention, she will try to branch you. (will text you on your  birthdays, and one day tell you again that she misses you). 

5- If you Inprint a bi-polar woman, when she's bored, she will try keep texting over the years trying to catch you when you're down so that you giver her what she wants, when she wants, and you be her beta-orbiter. 



Note: Do not care for woman who plays you. It's easy for a man without options to give in for the attention of a woman that's bi-polar (they really know what a man wants) but will only mess with your head. 

And if you have self-esteem issues I advise you to get out as soon as possible,other wise, too much emotional attachment will drown you.

6- the emotional toll, it's huge, because the roller coaster that a Bi-polar  woman brings can hook a man and make him addicted. Your mind will crave for her, especially if she's attractive. 

7-if you don't leave her soon, your body will get side affects like an addiction or disease. 

Expect: anxiety over the top and mental gymnastics if you got one-itis.




 Your mind and body should stay away from such woman, or you will suffer the consequences. 


Bi-polar as BPD or any women are creatures that go beyond crazyness.


DO NOT TRY TO SAVE THEM! 





CREATURES WITH Bi-polar or BPD:

-self harm
-self pitty
-depression
-on meds
-drug addiction
-suicidal
-some will creep all over you like a momma on the first monts if they're really  insecure
-false lack of memory
-will say you never loved her
-they say(again) they forget things(this is their hamster) 
-Will try to fuck your friend
-will try to reconnect with you
-will make you a beta orbiter
-will say you are special and they regret breaking up and in 4 weeks you will be nothing again
-will always text you
-you will be non-existent in a matter of days or even seconds


Aka: Manipulation at its best


Destroy and kill such possible attachment.



For guys with one-itis for toxic women beyond reason:

My cousin once said--''you only want what she gives you not who she is''.




 A quick note for those thinking in engaging with or saying ''what if you don't have ''one-itis'':

-I'm guessing most of yout don't know how emotionally prepared or matured you are to deal with such roller coaster. 

Even If you're mature enough, let me tell you that you better have plates other wise it's most likely  you'll get attached and suffer really bad.

It's better not to invest any time because they will treat you equally but most times worse than the average one.

If you had or still have beta tendencies, your mind will do mental gymnastics(happens more on guys with attachment issues, one-itis, low self esteem) making excuses for her behavior.
You'll probably get addicted to her. 


Always remember she's a woman and she has a disorder=chaos. 



Warning: 

-your body will probably store the experience and the emotional baggage, and if your emotionally  bellow the average guy this will take you time and work, prepare for over the top anxiety.

Here is one slightly edited comment:

“It’s sadly ironic that “feminism” has such disdain for femininity. Our society now heaps the most praise on women when they exhibit traditionally male traits such as strength, independence and excellence in STEM occupations. The woman who wants to marry and devote herself to being a good wife and mother, making home a safe and happy place to be, is ignored or disdained by the media. 

“It’s okay for a woman to be gorgeous and have lots of sex appeal as it’s another form of power, but to devote herself to her family and sacrifice for her children, is now considered embarrassingly old-fashioned. It is universally understood that a happy childhood is the main key to creating happy, productive adults, but motherhood is being delegitimised.

“Could this be because our overlords want to create a loveless society where every man and woman are looking out only for #1? 

“Mothers most of all LOVE, and good mothers (and fathers) raise children who are also capable of forming strong, lasting bonds with other people, and creating their own happy families some day. Love strengthens us, and the bigger our network of loved ones, the safer we are. We thrive when our lives are filled with laughter, intimacy, companionship, knowing that we matter, and that we will always matter, even when we can no longer care for ourselves.

“On a material level, when one falls, the others can raise him up, so no crisis need ever be permanent. For a person on their own, the loss of a job or a serious illness can drag them down so low that they may never recover. This is, of course, what our satanic rulers want: for us to be isolated, scared and vulnerable.

“Another disturbing trend is the state intervening between parents and child and superseding the parents in determining what is right for the child. For example, a woman who had just given birth refused the Vitamin K shot for her baby, and the nurse then left the room with the just-born infant, rather than letting the parents immediately hold her. It was 12 awful hours before they got their newborn back. It’s part of a trend. Parental rights are being trampled. The state, we are told, knows better than parents what is best for their child. 

“I believe the ultimate goal of driving women towards careers and unattached sex is to destroy the family and eventually have children being born (possibly from test tubes) who have no parents and belong only to the state. Children outsourced to preschool, nannies and daycare, are not encultrated into family life.”

The family is under attack from more sources than feminism. Economic pressures have forced wives and mothers into the work force. Formerly the rule was that corporations had equal responsibilities to the workforce, customers, communities and shareholders. This rule gave way to the argument that corporations only have responsibility to shareholders. This new rule was enforced by Wall Street’s threat to finance takeovers of any company that did not do everything to maximize profits. Consequenty, today the only beneficiaries of corporations are shareholders. Wages are suppressed by jobs offshoring and work visas, benefits are cut, and a person’s job can disappear without a moment’s notice. Economic insecurity forces wives and mothers out of their role of providing household services into the male role of providing money.

Child Protective Services, a gestapo state organization created by wicked “child advocates,” has undermined parental authority over children. So many things now qualify as “child abuse” that children can retaliate against parental authority by calling CPS. The consequence for the child and the parents can be draconian, and this realization by parents shifts power to the child.

Recently I linked to a Russian’s view of why the modern family breaks up. He said that feminism has turned marriage into a power struggle. The woman seizes power by making the child an idol and herself his priestess, leaving the man as an economic appendage. “As a result, the entire family structure is destroyed, and the man leaves the family to find a place where he feels more comfortable. Thus the family falls apart.”  https://russia-insider.com/en/culture/patriarchy-preserves-families-feminism-destroys-them/ri27459 I have seen many cases of this. It is probably the main reason that middle class wives are becoming single mothers.


Stefan Molyneux on What Feminism Has Done to Women
http://www.unz.com/video/stefanmolyneux_sugar-baby-feminism/
Molyneux makes some good points about the damage feminism has done to women. Unfortunately, to illustrate the damage he uses the feminist propagandistic portrayal of men whose interest in women is alleged to be limited to their vagina. Perhaps this is the case with promiscuous men, known in my day as “womanizers” and to the English as “rakes,” but most men want a loving, mutually supportive relationship. Men are really happy if their woman occasionally takes the sexual initiative so that they don’t always feel like supplicants and if she is passionate in their love-making.

Feminism has made such a relationship harder and harder for men to find. Indoctrinated by feminism, a woman regards her vagina as the source of her power, and expects to be paid for access whether she is a wife or one of the millions of young college girls serving as concubines to financially successful men in exchange for educational and living expenses. 

The college girls are selling sexual services, but the wife is also being paid. For example, her pay is her husband’s acquiescence to her having the family decision making authority. She decides where they go on vacation. What house they live in, the schools the children go to, when the kitchen and bathrooms are renovated, who their friends are. The price of resistance is a cold wife.

I don’t know how marriage is understood today. Once it was understood as a sexual contract for life that fostered faithfulness and legitimate children. Today it is no longer a sexual contract. The wife can refuse sexual access, and if the husband proceeds in the act, he can be sentenced to prison for “wife rape.” In former times, wife rape would have been an unimaginable crime. It is a new crime invented by feminism. All it takes for an angry woman to turn consensual sex into rape is an accusation. In these socially destructive ways, feminism empowers women.

Feminists have so damaged the relationship between men and women that the institution of marriage seems to be faltering. Marriage is one of the essential glues of social cohesion. There is no gain to either gender from a breakdown in social cohesion.

Feminism, large scale third world immigration, and identity politics are destroying social cohesion throughout the Western world. The civilization is really falling apart at the seams. People have some awareness of this. They have the numbers but are without leaders to organize the numbers into a mass resistance to feminists and identity politics, which have taken over the educational system and are enculturating the young with socially destructive attitudes.

I remember being 15 years old blue as they come, I was innocently browsing 9gag one day (I know I know) when on some random post I came across a funny looking word, “manlet”. I had never seen or heard of this word before so naturally I decided to google it, the day I hit that search button was the day I ruined my mental health forever. 

I don’t know about you guys, but being an insecure, inexperienced 5’6 (at the time)15 year old and then being bombarded with a shit ton of 4chan memes, bodybuilding.com threads and incel subs all in hit a bit too close to home for me. I took a nosedive into that rabbit hole, as much as reading this stuff was already killing my self esteem, I was HOOKED, it was fascinating, learning all these things about how looks and height affect your life. During this descent I actually came across this very subreddit, but I couldn’t quite understand anything and was too impatient to learn all the acronyms, read the sidebar and all that jazz. 

The incel stuff on the other hand was incredibly easy to understand: “If you’re not a natural born Chad, you are either doomed to a life of inceldom or being a beta provider, nothing inbetween this is set in stone from birth, deal with it”. 
This of course led me to feeling like shit about my place in the world, I wasn’t a Chad, not even close, why bother doing anything, my fate was set. 

I became withdrawn, didn’t bother to make any good effort to socialise with friends, my social skills stagnated, I became more socially anxious and started hating myself, but I just couldn’t stop visiting these online communities. 

Come summer 2017, I just turned 16 and went to some local festival in my city with friends and friends of friends, met some cute mixed race girl who was quite similar to myself, she took a liking to me, even gave me my first kiss, me, being blackpilled as fuck couldn’t understand this one bit, I made a bunch of rationalisations in my head 

“I-It was just her being nice, she doesn’t really like you, you’re an ugly subhuman manlet, how could any girl possibly like YOU?” 

These were the thoughts that went through my head, looking back she was absolutely into me, always initiating conversations, I of course didn’t escalate and naturally she lost interest. I could have had my first bluepilled teenage relationship and lost my virginity and blah blah, I could have gained some experience and confidence like any normal kid would, but nope, my mind belonged to the blackpill now. 

I started sixth form autumn 2017 (for Americans, this is the final two years of high school here in the UK). On Christmas break I went to a gig of a band with my friends and a group of girls, one of which my then best friend was orbiting at the time. I met a hot redhead who appeared to show me interest, my friends seemed to think so aswell, this however was not the case and I had my first experience of being an orbiter. My self esteem hit an all time low. 

Early 2018, I found the red pill again, actually read it this time, it was tricky to understand but one thing stuck with me, and that was to lift like a motherfucker, so I did, people started noticing. 

I got cold approached when working one night shift by some girl who somehow remembered me from primary school and her friend, both like HB5/6’s. We exchanged social medias and I hung out with them one night, the one who approached me invited us both back to her house, we had drinks played truth or dare and I made out with both of them, two girls on the same night, slept in bed with the girl, (her friend ended up leaving), we were making out all night but I didn’t escalate, I was scared tbh, how anyone could leave such a situation still a virgin is beyond me. I never heard from either of them after that night blamed it on my looks, of course, I was an unfuckable subhuman incel after all. 

Throughout 2018 I was reading both incel subs aswell as trp, two opposing ideologies telling me two different things, the incels were still winning me over, I carried on anyway, getting more makeouts at parties, fooling around, fingering, handjobs, but still no sex, or relationships, I started believing the blackpill more and more,”if I was chad, i’d be having sex all the time”, the possibility of my poor social skills being the issue didn’t occur to me at all. I became more jaded and bitter. Time went on, 2019 comes, I’m borderline obsessed with my physical appearance, unable to accept any imperfections, believing my face and height were the be all and end all of my social life, fragile ego, unable to accept myself and improve in other areas and forge good long standing friendships, unable to live a little and be a normal fucking teenager. 

By now I have failed high school, luckily they’re letting me retake my final year due to mental health issues. I’ve lost contact with all but two of my friends, drifted apart from most of them. I only recently lost my virginity at 18 to a chick I didn’t even find attractive, slightly overweight, but it was easy, I was tired of being a virgin and needed some intimacy. 

Upon reflection though, I realised that I am probably not even unattractive anyway. I had many friends who were shorter than me, not as goodlooking, in worse shape, who were able to get sex and relationships just fine because they developed social skills and decent banter/game. 
I realised that I spent so much time fixating on what I could not change, wanting perfection and being unsatisfied when I couldn’t find it, I didn’t bother to work on my social skills, being funny, cultivating and attractive personality, hobbies, a strong frame, because of this i’m at the lowest point i’ve ever been in at my life. 

I’ve grown to around 5’9/10, which is perfectly average and acceptable amongst my age range in my area, i’m not a 1/10 unfuckable incel, and I have a something of a nice physique for my age, I got attention from several attractive girls my age, but I was completely delusional I wanted them to do all the work, “they would for Chad”, well sorry to disappoint, but most of us will never be Chad, if you are, good for you, lucky fucker. 

The point i’m making is, do not fall for the lies of the blackpill like I did, I could have a much happier, more fulfilling social life, with great fun people and hot girls, had I not believed that bullshit. To be honest, as i’m typing this post up I’m getting rather emotional thinking about what could have been, what could have went differently.

Unfortunately, feminism and future is an oxymoron (or fortunately, depending on your point-of-view), as it seems to be unsustainable on the long run.

Based on past history, it appears that a civilization that embraces feminist values will cease to exist in just a few centuries. This is why we have never seen a feminist civilization aside from very short spans at the end of the Roman empire and possibly a few other more ancient civilizations.

Reading the history of the Roman Empire brings such glaring similarities with our own civilization, it is as if human social dynamics are literally stuck in a cycle that repeats every couple thousand years (there were two matriarchical, extremely advanced civilizations: one at the end of the Roman empire, 2000 years ago, one possibly at the end of Babylon, 4000 years ago).

For those who enjoy history, here is a short recap of social changes in Rome, 2 millenia ago (most historians focus on military and political facts, but I find the social aspects just as fascinating):

~5 century BC: Roman civilization is a a strong patriarchy, fathers are liable for the actions of their wife and children, and have absolute authority over the family (including the power of life and death)

~1 century BC: Roman civilization blossoms into the most powerful and advanced civilization in the world. Material wealth is astounding, citizens (i.e.: non slaves) do not need to work. They have running water, baths and import spices from thousands of miles away. The Romans enjoy the arts and philosophy; they know and appreciate democracy, commerce, science, human rights, animal rights, children rights and women become emancipated. No-fault divorce is enacted, and quickly becomes popular by the end of the century.

~1-2 century AD: The family unit is destroyed. Men refuse to marry and the government tries to revive marriage with a “bachelor tax”, to no avail. Children are growing up without fathers, Roman women show little interest in raising their own children and frequently use nannies. The wealth and power of women grows very fast, while men become increasingly demotivated and engage in prostitution and vice. Prostitution and homosexuality become widespread.

~3-4 century AD: A moral and demographic collapse takes place, Roman population declines due to below-replacement birth-rate. Vice and massive corruption are rampant, while the new-born Catholic Religion is gaining power (it becomes the religion of the Empire in 380 AD). There is extreme economic, political and military instability: there are 25 successive emperors in half a century (many end up assassinated), the Empire is ungovernable and on the brink of civil war.

~5 century AD: The Empire is ruled by an elite of military men that use the Emperor as a puppet; due to massive debts and financial problems, the Empire cannot afford to hire foreign mercenaries to defend itself (Roman citizens have long ago being replaced by mercenaries in the army), and starts “selling” parts of the Empire in exchange for protection. Eventually, the mercenaries figure out that the “Emperor has no clothes”, and overrun and pillage the Empire. 

Humanity falls back into the Bronze Age (think: eating squirrel meat and living in a cave); 12 centuries of religious zilotry (The Great Inquisition, Crusades) and intellectual darkness follow: science, commerce, philosophy, human rights become unknown concepts until they are rediscovered again during the Age of Enlightenment in 17th century AD.

Regarding the Babylonian civilization (~2,000 BC), we have relatively few records, but we do know that they had a very advanced civilization because we found their legislative code written down on stone tablets (yes, they had laws and tribunals, and some of today’s commercial code can even be traced back to Babylonian law). They had child support laws (which seems to indicate that there was a family breakdown), and they collapsed presumably due to a “moral breakdown” figuratively represented in the Bible as the “Tower of Babel” (which was inspired by a real tower). 

Interesting and controversial anecdote: some claim that the Roman Catholic Religion is nothing more than a rewriting and adaptation of an ancient Babylonian religion!
You might say Roman cultural elites experienced Robin Hanson’s switch from a farmer to a forager society. How’d that turn out for everyone?

Let’s examine the parallels more closely.

~5 century BC Rome = ~1700 – 1920 America. The family unit is essentially “father knows best”, and slutting around by women is considered the height of shameful behavior, (as is cadding about by men). Monogamy is held up as the ideal arrangement without exception. (The “Wild West” might be an exception to the general rule of the day, as whoring and hell-raising were widespread in the frontier.) Lessers look up to their betters as exemplars of moral rectitude.

~1 century BC Rome = ~1920 – 1970 America. America is rising to the height of her power, a hyperpower being born. An economic and military power heretofore unseen in all recorded history. While the world digs out from under the rubble of consecutive wars and Communist pogroms, we have a battalion of aircraft carriers, a largely homogeneous population, and cheap housing for everyone willing to put in an honest day’s work. But the poison pill has been swallowed; the suffrage movement achieves its main goal, and the dark shroud of the equalist era is about to descend. In academic halls and classrooms, lessers are pedestalized, while betters are denigrated.

~1-2 century AD Rome = 1970-2000 America. The scourge of single momhood, free and easy divorce, child support laws, majority female colleges, DADT repealed, gay marriage, game, etc etc ad infinitum. In short, the ultimate expression of anti-discrimination, anti-received wisdom, individualist ideology, (ironically buttressed by the groupthink of diversity mongers.) Lessers ignore their betters, who in turn renege on their traditional responsibility to act as examples for the lessers.

~3-4 century AD Rome = 2000-2010 America. (You’ll notice America’s progression through the stages of empire is much faster than was Rome’s. This is the blessing — or curse — of high tech mass communication.) The native stock of America, (specifically, the betters of that stock), have stopped having kids. Vice and corruption are on the rise. (See: Chicago, CRA, Goldman Sachs, neocon lies, Enron, Madoff… I could go on.) Economic and political instability are the order of the day. While America’s presidents aren’t being assassinated, our elections have been nailbiters since 2000, and partisanship is at a fevered pitch. A reborn religion called Islam threatens to co-opt the sympathies of Western societies’ rootless rejects and masculinized women. Except for the thinnest upper class slice, betters now ape the habits of their lessers.

~5 century Rome = present day America. America is ruled by an elite of cognitive jackpot winners who use the President as a puppet. Massive debt and financial chicanery is practically enshrined in law. The army is less and less filled with the demographic slice of American citizens that used to make up its ranks. Mercenaries (UN peacekeepers, bribed warlords, arm-twisted allies, recent unassimilated immigrants, and the desperate, poor and out of shape) now make up a larger part of the tip of the spear that projects American power. America is in the process of slow-motion selling off of the Southwest to appease the millions of peasant illegals it cavalierly allowed to invade and settle in the country.

The Fall of Rome = ? America.

America is having her Tower of Babel moment, and the elites applaud it when they aren’t dithering over tax code arcana or the cultural impact of snarky late night TV hosts. These parallels with Rome’s fall should make you feel queasy about the future of this nation. But you’ll quickly push aside those depressing thoughts and switch on for another lightning round of Call of Duty, figuring it’s not your problem. Until it is.

I recently had my first experience dating a girl and got my heart ripped into pieces.

It started off with her contacting me on facebook. She said she had a crush on me when we both went to the same school and decided to contact me when she saw me in the city hanging out with some friends. We met to walk a dog from the shelter and eat some ice cream. She complimented my looks a few times which felt great as an average looking guy. 

Second date went great too and at the end i could tell she wanted a kiss (but i didnt go for it). She sent me many cute messages. On the third date we kissed and on the fourth we had sex. On our last date after cuddling naked in my bed she told me i make her so happy and content and that she dreams of me. I obviously fell in love HARD with her. 

I remember the next day I was thinking to my self that I probably have my first girlfriend now. She wanted to meet again that day but I was already meeting up with friends so I told her I would like to meet on another day. That was the day she decided to ghost me. After a few days I wrote her if something is wrong and a week later she replies she has no feelings for me so it couldnt work out with us. I was crushed.

Two weeks later I saw her at a party. She pretended like I didnt even exist when i went to say hello. Later in the night I saw her dance with and kiss another guy on the dance floor - at least like 6 years older than me, much taller, muscular build. I felt like such a worthless piece of shit. On a different occasion I saw her with a girl friend of hers. The friend was staring at me while she was giggling about something.

Now it is 4 months later and im still hurting over this. The girl never contacted me again. I liked her way too damn much.

This is my first longer experience with a girl, because before i didnt really give a shit about them and focused on my career. That got me into probably like the top 2% of earners in my age group. (Making 6 figures in my early 20s in europe)

I started going to the gym 3 months ago and im starting to see some nice results (I looked really skinny at the time). I went to socialize a lot and got myself a bunch of new friends. Replaced my clothes (didnt really care for style at all before) and got my own place (lived with my parents before) and got a new better paying job. 

Still, I cant shake off the feeling of being totally worthless. Being abruptly abandoned like this makes me feel like my utter soul is being rejected. Girls pretty much didnt give a shit at all about me all my life so I had high hopes for this one. I miss her all the time.

I’ve worked hard, but God had my back at the beginning. I have a decent job that I’m happy doing, have been smart with my money due to my parents being a banker and accountant. When I was about 15 I got seriously into the gym and I’m 25 now. I’m 6’2 with a decent face, sat at around 11% bf at 100kg and have been learning more about the red pill over the past few years. My point is that I’ve never been someone who really struggled with girls, sex hasn’t been accessible but it’s not been too far away if that makes sense. I’ve used and abused AAS and SARMs (RAD140 sucks dick) in my time and right now I’m natural, luckily my LH and FSH recovered although it sent me bald I couldn’t be happier. 

I was messaging a girl and everything was a bit meh, I’m over just sex at this point and have been seriously looking for an LTR. I know it’s early but if I get into one and don’t like it 5 years down the line I’ve still got a bit of my youth right? Anyway, me and this girl clearly just didn’t get along, we butted heads a lot and as we got into an argument both over text and in person she would always make excuses, relating to mental health mainly. This isn’t to take away from people who truly do suffer from mental health issues, but I just don’t have the time/want to be depressing. I’m all about positivity. I brought this up and she was just droning on about how sad she was, I said she needs to get herself sorted before she tries to initiate a relationship. Don’t get me wrong, she’s very good looking (8/9) but I just couldn’t deal with it. I went out with a few friends to a pub next to my house and I swear by luck she was there, unless I was stalked which is also a possibility. She came over and acted like a whore. She was grinding, trying to kiss my neck and groping me. Before this I still saw the girl objectively attractive but something just flipped, she was no longer the good looking girl who isn’t in the right headspace. She’s now a whore who showed me how easily someone can get into her pants. It was like she’s put a mask on and I no longer found her attractive.

###WHAT IS (A) FRAME?

A frame is an interpretation of things in a specific context. 

Let's have a deeper look at that sentence:

- **interpretation** of things: it is specific to a person. A person interprets things according to his knowledge, experience, beliefs, ..

- things **in a specific context**: there is no 'one' frame. There are an infinite amount of frames per person.


##Example 1

You're playing soccer with a kid. Accidentally, you hit the kid with the ball. As the kid has no experience nor knowledge on life (i.e. no/weak frame), he looks at you to see how you react to the accident. **He is ready to enter your frame because his frame is non-existent/weak.** What is your interpretation of what just happened, what is your frame? If you show compassion and feel sorry for the kid, the kid will start to cry. If you laugh it off and act as if nothing happened, the kid will toughen up, laugh, and keep playing soccer. The next time he is hit with a ball, he has a frame and will interpret accordingly. If however, his mother is present who acts all dramatic, compassionate, protective and pampering, **and** her frame (something bad happened) is stronger than your frame (all good), the kid will enter the frame of the mother and start crying. The stronger your frame and your expression of your interpretation, the easier the kid will enter/remain in your frame. 

**Context: kid was hit with ball**

Kid frame: unexisting frame

Your frame: all good frame

Mother frame: drama frame

##Example 2

 A man who is extremely blue pilled teaches math at a university. His (simplified) frame on math is: 1+1=2. His frame **on math** is extremely strong, as it's based on years of experience, knowledge, studying, books, .. Chad Thundercock and Billy Beta enter his class. Chad proclaims: 1+1=3! Even though the professor is a blue pilled beta, he will never enter this (math) frame of Chad. He will then show/prove that his frame is stronger in order for Chad and Billy to willingly enter his math frame.

**Context 1: math**

Blue pilled, loser professor frame: strong logical frame

Chad frame: strong illogical frame

Billy Beta: weak frame


**Context 2: social dynamics**

Professor frame: weak, beta

Chad frame: strong, alpha

Billy beta: weak, beta

#Takeaway
A strong frame in one context doesn't mean you're 'alpha'. It does however make you an authority **in that context**, it grants you power (whether you use it or not).

---

###THE MOST IMPORTANT FRAME *IN A RELATIONSHIP*

When we talk about frame on TRP, we're not talking about math. We're mostly talking about **relationship dynamics**. As you know, there are 2 common frames:

**Alpha frame**: The man (AMOG) is the leader of the relationship, decides what happens, is the authority. He choose the direction the pack is going, generally his way of looking at things (in relationship context) is better than anyone else's. He understands the nature of men and women (AFBB, hypergamy, SMV, The Wall, AMOG, ..), he knows what to do and stays firmly in his frame. No matter how hot she is, he holds frame.

**Beta frame**: The woman is the leader of the relationship, the man (BMOG) refers to his wife (or AMOG) for all decisions, women are the authority. Happy wife happy life, he thinks she knows what she wants and how the world should be, he supplicates to her and enters her frame.

Having a strong relationship frame (alpha) does not mean you have a stronger frame in every context. E.g. sewing, if your plate knows better how to sew, then respect her frame on sewing and follow her lead on that subject. 

Likewise, having a weak relationship frame (beta) does not mean you have a weaker frame in every context. E.g. mechanics, math, ...

---

###WHAT MAKES A STRONG FRAME?

A strong frame is a personal conviction that the way YOU look at things is the right way. The more confidence you have that your interpretation is the right one, the stronger your frame. What creates confidence?

- knowledge (TRP theory)

- experience (TRP action)

- social proof

- having money

- having high SMV 

- collection of **other** strong frames on other subjects: the more things you know everything about / are an authority at, the more confident you are in all your frames

You need a strong frame to make others want to enter your frame. It needs to be better, more accurate and stronger than theirs in order for them to change their interpretation to yours.

---

###WHAT IS HOLDING FRAME?

Sometimes 2 frames collide. Holding frame is sticking with your interpretation in spite of another. Holding frame in TRP context is often, but not only about the relationship frame. 

##Example 1

One of your plates wants your commitment. 

**Her frame**: exclusive relationship is better than plating

**Your frame**: plating (or dropping the plate) is better than an exclusive relationship

Holding frame is sticking to plating (or dropping the plate) instead of getting into the exclusive relationship because you need the sex.

##Example 2
You're an expert at eating healthy and a plate tells you to eat loads of sugar because it tastes so good.. Stick to your frame.

##Note 1
You should not always hold frame: if you believe that 1+1=3, and a professor proves that 1+1=2, then adjust your frame / enter his. The professor has authority on that subject. Don't be a sperg / narcissist who 'is always right' and always has the strongest frame.

##Note 2
IDGAF is you not caring which frame someone else has, or whether or not they enter your frame. If your frame is that everyone has to enter your frame, then your frame is wrong, needy and weak.

Do not try to force others into entering your frame.

---

###STRONG FRAME AND LEADERSHIP

A good leader is someone who has a strong relationship frame. He doesn't need to make all decisions, sometimes he delegates or defers to someone with a frame he doesn't control himself. He however does **approve** all decisions made.

E.g.: a military squad is on a dropping. The squad leader will ask the navigator of the group on instructions for what way to go. 

---

###IN CONCLUSION

- For increased sexual success, adopt the alpha relationship frame

- Build strong frames by gaining knowledge and experience. Stick to your frames, but also keep an open mind for ways to improve them and make them even stronger

- Don't enter someone else's frame if you don't agree with it

- The higher your SMV, the stronger your perceived frames. If you're rich, successful, have social proof, .. people will enter your frame way faster.

I  don't know if any of you have seen this guys vlog (link at bottom of  page), he's posted on reddit and it's on youtube, but his life is  falling apart because his wife left him for another dude.

He's tried to be the sensitive guy women say they want, but clearly it isn't what they want at all.

Please  remember this guy is in an emotional state and he needs support, not   knocking down even more, so if you haven't got anything constructive to  say you're probably better off saying nothing.

If you have some wise pearls of wisdom for him I'm sure they will help him.

The  video I've included is part 7 since this shows the real life effects of  AWALT. Again don't knock the dude, he doesn't need it, and if you've  ever had your life turned upside down like he has - you don't need  internet trolls making it worse.

It's worth mentioning that I am in university.*

At the beginning of my TRP journey, I did what was most natural to me: I read the posts on the sidebar, I devoured the daily content, and I went into monk mode. Upon discovering that society was running a worldwide scheme of feminist agendas &amp; lies, I went full into the anger phase and buried myself into a deep pit that I called at the time ""self-improvement &amp; working on myself"".

Except it wasn't. Monk mode is probably one of the most ill-informed decisions I've taken in my life.

Because during this phase, sure, I've become better looking &amp; more introspective, but I did it at the expense of my social skills. At the supposed peak of my social life (university), I became socially retarded. I threaded close to MGTOW. It got so bad, I couldn't even talk to women without a goal. Asking for their program, asking for directions, asking for fucking napkins. It got ridiculous. And truth is, I never went into monk mode with a sense of purpose. I did it to conceal my anger, to better myself, expecting that once I emerge from this good dose of mental masturbation, I'd be back on my two feet, ready to take life by its horns and women by the back of their heads. Obviously, things didn't turn out this way. I was confused. I thought monk mode was supposed to be my ticket to success.

Realistically, besides meditation, reading, lifting, and doing a competitive sport, which I all took on after starting monk mode, I was no different from the average joe. And that's where it hurt. Monk mode is worth it if it can boost your SMV significantly. In my case, I may have boosted it by +10, but by neglecting my social skills that results in a -12, I actually netted -2 during this period. That ROI is terrible, especially when being TRP aware should be giving you an upper hand.

As a result, I unconsciously started to become a crab in a bucket. I fucking HATED when my friends were pulling better than me. I didn't get it. I deserved better. I WORKED FOR IT. Breaking point was when one time, one of my bros simply brought a gorgeous-looking girl to an event I hosted. My frame shattered for the rest of the night, and I had no idea why. I was probably in denial. It was the night of my birthday, and despite that, I felt fucking horrible.

I thank whatever god exists that I was able to reflect on my behavior, because after doing a deeper analysis, I pinpointed the problem. I was fucking scarce. But I'm not talking about the type to cling on a girl under the fear of losing her. I was SO SCARCE that I wished I could be like them. I was fucking envious of them. And it fucking hurt. And ll kinds of questions come rushing through your mind. Just like some guy who asked in askTRP today, are: **Why the fuck do I pull so weak, despite working so much on myself? Shit doesn't add up.**

From where I stand today, and from this experience, I cannot measure all factors. Though, what I've concluded, with certainty, is the following: **Do not compensate game with looks.** Whether the opposite is true is none of my business. Tbf, today, I look great. My game is still worth jackshit. Maybe I've always known it was shit. And with a bit of selective distortion, I took TRP's ""lift"" advice like it were the Holy Grail, and abode to it at its expense. I unconsciously attempted to mask my shitty game with better looks. For those who read Goggins' book, you know what I'm talking about. I thought that, as long as I looked good, I didn't need to do shit. And if some situations, maybe. But those type of ROIs are small, and usually not worth the effort put into it. Girls may list me high in their ""looks"" list, but after talking to me for 1 min, they've probably already dozed off and imagined themselves gobbling up some Chad's dick after they ""go home to study"".

**The best way to pull girls is to internalize the assumption that game and looks, although complements in real life, should be considered mutually exclusive from each other.** At least, that's what I think now. Similar to how in theory AWALT, but in practice, NAWALT.

Monk mode is similar. After my little journey, I do not encourage it. Especially if, like me, you're in school. Social skills matter so much in such contexts. And they're not worth sacrificing, because they are as important as any other SMV booster proposed here. I've spent the entirety of my RP-awareness time under this belief, and now, I must yet again re-position my way of thinking.

I have yet to formulate a balanced way to maintain game, gym, and studies, but perhaps that can be a post for another time.

I was 20, drinking my face off at a summer party with a bunch of my friends, when a girl who I had a sexual history with and trusted very much at the time decided that I needed a bit more to drink even when things were winding down. Fed me liquor until I was really too fucked up to do anything, then she ""helped me into the bathroom"" because I wasnt feeling so good where she proceeded to cover my entire face and neck with lipstick marks. Earlier in the night she had been making jokes about trying to get with me, but I'd brushed them off and said ""sorry, no, not gonna happen, I've got a girlfriend now,"" that kind of thing to try and keep her at arms length. I made the mistake of drinking too much, and as soon as she'd gotten me alone in the bathroom I was pretty well done for. Woke up around 5am next to her, both of us naked, in a mutual friend of our's bed. Got dressed, ran home and immediately blocked out anything and everything I could about the event. Lived in blissful ignorance of what actually happened to me until 4 or 5 days later when one of my friends brought up that I was most definitely sexually assaulted. Shocked me and hurt me to my core, but I genuinely dont remember anything about what happened after she took me into the bathroom, and a few days later she started saying shit to her friends and people she knew that I'd taken advantage of her while she was drunk that night.

As an example I was seeing this chick at work like 6 months ago, long story short I invited her over and tried to escalate once or twice, my mom went into my room every time and put a stop to it, lucky break my mom leaves for 20 minutes to go to work and I still try we make out and some hand holding type shit but the girl isn’t feeling it, whatever (later on I found the girl was psycho and I was a dumbass).

My moms ended up giving this other chick strategies to get the edge on me, coming from the girl herself.

This phrase is used as an illustration and reminder of female hypergamy, and the fact that you can only stall the mechanisms of how women operate, but never defeat them. For that reason, you should never be surprised when a woman branch swings or decides to leave you for whatever reason happens to catch her fancy. It's not your duty to try and win her back or obsess over why and how she left you beyond the point where it improves you. She left, and that's okay. After all, it was just your turn.

I'm offering you a corollary to that saying today. You're not hers, it's just her turn is a reminder to you that you're the prize. It's a fortifier for your abundance mentality. A woman's turn with you can end for any number of reasons, and much like with the original axiom, yours is not to pine over why it ended. Your purpose is to remember that in this game, you're the prize, and for a time, she got to play with the trophy that is you. And when it ends, you simply move onto the next player.

I try to tailor my posts here to the lowest common denominator, because let's face it,the 19-year old who is just entering the anger phase needs this many magnitudes more than /u/vasiliyzaitzev or anyone who already has abundance etched into their dating frame. I've always been sexually successful, and female attention is easy to come by, so for those of you who might not be able to automatically switch over to living with the abundance mindset, here are a few companions to this saying, that you can remind yourself of until you fully embody them:

* Always be willing to walk away

* Always engage the woman on your terms (frame) at all times.

* Spin plates.

* Never be the one looking for a relationship. If a relationship develops, great, but it is hr onus to initiate the transition from casual to serious.

* Keep your options open, even in a relationship. No eggs in one basket. Boil them suckers and store them in multiple fridges, ready for consumption at a moment's notice.

Above all, remember that aligning your sexual value to one woman permanently in any sense is a losing endeavour. Always be cognisant of the fact that she's replaceable at any moment in time.

It's very simple, but a lot of guys (including myself) go wrong with it.

I used to have great sex with a FWB in the past. I really didn’t want to lose that. So I would keep on texting her all day and ask her beta shit like “how do you feel about me?”, “do you think we could be together?” and other dumb shit like that. While I wanted to keep having sex with her, my actions didn’t align with that goal. I could have prevented a mistake like that by just asking myself a very simple question: ""how do I act in my best interest?"", but I didn’t. I kept blowing up her phone with needy beta shit. And then she left.

You could prevent the mistake that I made with literally two steps. Ask yourself the next two questions:

1) What is my best interest?
2) How do I act in my own best interest?

If for example your answer to the first question is ""blowing my load in this girl"", then ask the second question if you are going to make a next move: ""Is texting her all day like a needy beta acting in my own best interest to keep on blowing my load in her?"". The answer is most likely going to be no. So you don’t do that. You try to be light-hearted and fun. You set up a meeting. Kino, plausible deniability, logistics, smash. That’s acting in your best interest. Nothing more. And this could apply to anything, not just women or sex.

No one else is going to look out for you. No one else gives a shit about what you want. You are the only one who cares about your own interest, except maybe your mother (if you are that lucky). The least you could do is not shooting yourself in the foot by taking steps that don’t align with your own interest.

About 3 years I was talking to some chick on Bumble. She was decent looking but this is before I found the red pill and was not as informed as I am now. She was in her mid to late 30s and the proud owner of a child that she was raising on her own as a single mother. This did not stop me as we continued to talk a bit online. As I remember it, we ended up bumping into eachother at a local bar. I followed up with her after and she let me know that she now had a boyfriend and that she was not interested, etc. I remember thinking it was odd that she went from chatting with me to being this tied up with a boyfriend so quickly but whatever, I wished her luck and possibly said something along the lines of hit me up if it does not work out. 

A while later, somehow I reached out to her, maybe a drunk text, or seeing a random number in my phone in the old texts and she let me know she was still with her boyfriend and how amazing it was. Terrific! 

I deleted the number and forget that she existed. Fast forward about 3 years to present day and I see I matched with some chick who is listed as 41 years old. Holy shit! 41 years old? What an old ancient relic of a woman she is but still surprisingly decent looking in her pics. 

I thought she looked somewhat familiar but could not figure out where I knew her from. Suddenly I get a message with her saying my name emphatically with several exclamation points. 

I responded, do I know you? She says ""we used to chat before I got a boyfriend, but we broke up now""

hmm. I thought. So I asked her what happened. She told me that he ex boyfriend owned a gym and was cheating on her with a ""much younger girl from his gym""

Ya dont say! is what I thought. So a single mom in her late 30s who was still chasing after Chad got cheated on with a younger woman? Now I dont mean to be a dick but I must admit I had a heck of a laugh to myself when she told me that. 

She goes on to tell me about how it has been a learning experience and get this: she is writing a book! Wow! What a unique and special story you have here! I am sure this book will be flying off of the shelves as certainly now late 30s single mom has ever been cheated on by Chad!

So at this moment I realized that she was thinking to herself that she probably needs to lower her expectations and here is the guy from a few years ago who was interested in me, she is surely interested in me now, right? WRONG.

I am good. I am not interested in a 41 year old single mom coming off a rebound who was cheated on by Chad. As she continued to message me I put my phone down and went to sleep without replying to whatever nonsense she was saying. 

I am very happy that I have the understanding to see what is going on here instead thinking she was some prize that I would have a chance with. 

Dont get me wrong, I Would let her blow me and maybe even fuck her but I will not make any effort and part of me does not even want to give her the satisfaction of me trying to see, contact, or interact with her at all. 

If she says anything else to me I may just go out of my way to let her know that I am only interested in being her friend (I dont really want to be her friend) just to drive her crazy and establish that I am not her bounce back beta fag.

I have attractive looks but have always been overweight. I've had several girlfriends during highschool but only slept with the last one. 

Eventually I got RPed and started developing alpha traits to the point where I became very attractive. I dated a girl for year and it was great but she wasn't it. I could finally get the girl I had oneitis on by de-friendzoning. I ended up giving up on a lot of casual sex because I assigned sex too much value to be casual. 

Eventually, I ended up spending 5 years with said oneitis (I should have cut off earlier) and crawled back into beta, to which she responded with continually increasing resentment until it exploded 2 years too late IMO. I should have killed it when the bedroom became a place to sleep after around 3-4 years. 

I had a very bad year with her and we broke up. I followed up with re-alpha-ing myself - beard, piercing, confidence, gym, weight loss. I became ME again to the point people at work asked what the hell happened. 

I am well established with a good career, income, vehicle, rented flat, etc. I ended up having a couple of very surprisingly easy to get one night stands, some escalated to sex and some ended beforehand. In common was the fact they all made me feel shitty, I needed a relationship. Getting sex was easy, but was not interesting. I like crazy ladies, and I needed to find one. 

The last one night stand was a girl who was a solid 10/10, gamer, midnight chats about the meaning of life, the whole thing. She's also loyal, a pleaser, and someone who I can see myself spending the rest of my life with. 

Then, I found out she mainly had ONS before me, and a large number (not insane, just that mine was low due to being stuck in committed relationships). There is a good reason for that and her attitude to sex is part of what I love about her. It's a fun act, it's not everything in a relationship but it's a big part, it's healthy to engage in it often, and she has (FINALLY) a libido that matches mine. 

One thing disturbs me - because I was in committed relationships most of the time I didn't have a lot of casual sex. I've been with 5 women at 28 and around 10 if you count non-intercourse activities. As for less than that, I've had dozens (making out, handjobs, etc). And yet, I can't help but feel outnumbered by a girl much younger than me. I feel like I haven't spread my seed before settling. I brought this up with her (GENTLY) and it's been messing with our relationship for the past few days. She said it's the past and I shouldn't care, and commented on the excellent sex life we have as a way to make me feel more secure. I know for a fact she was not faking that for me, and that I am good in bed (I've heard it a lot before). And yet, I can't over the fact I've only been with 5 women at 28. My penis has been in 5 vaginas. It feels like not enough, you can do better, etc. I realize had I cut off the 5 year relationship earlier I would have a lot of time to fuck around before meeting this girl, and I also realize that the fact I didn't and things happening the way they did led to us being together. However, my subconscious is screaming ""you need to up your number"" at least 7 times a day which is driving me insane. I talked to her about it and she said go fuck whoever you want and come back home after, but I don't think that would do any of us good. We discussed threesomes but it's pretty hard to make it happen. I have no idea how to get rid of this warning and it's eating me up inside, so I thought I'd ask here. Also, I noticed if I thought she had less previous encounters than me I would not feel outnumbered, so it's definitely a she-had-more-than-me issue.

Start being more self aware and realise that we need to tailor advice in TRP and our lives to our own personality.

Not everything is 100% the right way. There is only the right way for you.

All advice should be used in a way that is right for YOU.

People speak of aspects of TRP as being absolute truths and to stray from them would be “wrong”.

Example: The advice given by TRP on where to take girls when you first meet (which is: a bar, a coffee shop, mini golf etc.) How about the advice that is neglected the most: where are you most comfortable talking to girls? As long as she’s comfortable meeting at that place. That is better advice. That is a better location. That is more conducive to success.

Being a quiet person who doesn’t like a lot of stimuli. I love nature. That’s my personality. Wish it was different but the friction needed to change that aspect of my personality is so great that it would hinder other more valuable personal pursuits. Therefore: I meet women in parks or beautiful gardens in the city. It works. No advice in TRP really guides people to work with their strengths. That is where self awareness is so important as an individual using this powerful material.

If you get bored with meeting women then start to challenge your comfort zone, by meeting in an uncomfortable place.

The direction that TRP is instructing and cultivating through the culture is that there are certain hard truths that we all must work with. I agree with most of them. Some I don’t. I still love TRP but not every aspect.

Challenge what you idolise. Your human idol or hero shouldn’t be 100% correct about everything. My favourite things all have aspects that I disagree with.

The most important and valuable assets are health, personality, happiness and strengths. Don’t ignore them in pursuit of something greater. Use them as tools for your pursuit and live a better life without friction. Bet on your strengths. Work on weaknesses as necessary but make things easier on yourself by using what is already at your disposal.

TRP is powerful life changing advice. Just don’t follow everything blindly. Question it. How can it be improved. What changes need to be made to make certain advice more suitable or profitable or relatable or engaging to YOU.",False,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Self awareness and TRP.,0,1572339800.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/do69sr/self_awareness_and_trp/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

A little while ago she came around the office looking to pick up weekend shifts which give us a full day of comp time for less than a half days work.  She said her grandma was sick and she wanted to go home to visit her.  

Being red pilled I shut her down right away.  I don’t give a fuck about female validation.  I want my comp time so I can take longer vacations.  But my co-worker considered the offer and even went to his wife to talk it over before saying no.  I thought it was funny watching him labor over the decision because he wanted to help out the attractive late twenties Eastern European chick but he also wanted his comp day and didn’t want to irritate his wife.  

So this happens and all of a sudden one of our co-workers starts texting us vacation pictures of the kinda hot Eastern European chick.  First she’s on a jet ski.  Then she’s in a gown at some party at a resort in the mountains.  And there are absolutely no pictures of grandma.  When those pictures started coming through I couldn’t stop grinning.  I knew what my co-worker’s reaction was going to be too.  

But it gets even better—we are seeing these pictures of her at parties and on jet skis in Europe and we walk up front and see she has called in sick.  So this broad didn’t just try to scam people out of their comp days with a sob story she is also just straight up trying to play management.  Who calls in sick from a European vacation?  

Long story short I enjoyed witnessing these machinations of an entitled female.  She didn’t get off Scott free though—she ended up getting demoted to a different assignment (I think for abusing sick time) at the same pay.  Meanwhile my coworker was quite offended she tried to guilt him into giving up his comp time.

Is it moral to give up on thousands of years of role &amp; expectation from both genders because we've technologically and politically advanced? 

For women: Yes but you don't have to! Go get that high education, work hard in your career, fuck around with men, live in liberation, live in solitude! You are a woman, you deserve this, after all you are a *woman*!


But if you want, you can also go stay a housewife, faithful or unfaithful to your man and not work a day in your life, both works fine. Though second one is rarely talked about (but never discouraged) and the ideal woman is being pushed as the prior.

For men: No! Under no circumstances. If you opt out of your masculinity you are pretty much fucked and seen as a failure in society. You will be looked down upon consciously and subconsciously (being inferior to everyone). Your comfort equates to laziness that only disgusts people. Even though you feel somewhat fine playing video games, chilling on the sofa, living a simple (but kind of unhealthy) life, the thought of that dries not only every pussy within miles radius but also by the society. There is no one rescuing you in this world, your social expectations are still that of a traditional masculine male, even though our bluepill society doesn't want to admit to admit that to you.

And while taking up a feminine housewife role no one will bat an eye, support it (and highly support leaving it by taking 50% of the man's share) and pretend these women don't exist until then. The same doesn't go for men. Even when you take a traditional masculine role, you are only rewarded in secret with pussy, competition anxiety, abundance and all that. Never will you be praised for living up to your untold (but common sense) role as a male. If anything you will still get attacked by women and society, but it's much easier to cope with it since you are being on your purpose and getting women along the way. But not only that, if you manage to reach your goal of what was expected, you could just as easily fall back into the trap and becoming a provider or lose half of your living and no one is going to be there for you. As a man, your life can only go up or down, you can never stay in the same spot, if you do you will be sinking and go lower, that's why redpill always encourages you to be uncomfortable. 

When women prioritize their well-being, happiness, and forging their own path rather than following the role and expectations that society expects of them, it's called ""Women's liberation"".

When men do it, it's considered pathetic.

Not only is there irony in this that the masculine way has always been better, by default, there's a reason why it was women who decided to get involved with the roles of men, not the other way around. But sadly many men are unconsciously falling for it and taking the feminine roles and our world is becoming more beta than ever. Imagine in the future when your country is forced into war and you're stuck in the military with a whole lot of non-masculine beta males who would shit their pants and panic, and to afraid to even shoot in the field because of the level of femininity and social incompetence they've grown up with from a young age with a single-mother, female teachers all the way to high-school, no fatherly role model besides maybe the step-dad they hate, and years upon years of isolation in room playing video games and watching porn.


Being a man is like going against an extremely long escalator stairs, you have to be moving forward at a constant speed but you will stay in the same spot. If you stop, you will go back to the bottom. You have to be walking up faster than the escalator is rolling, which is annoying and hard as fuck, but you have to, that's the life we're given. For women (unexpectedly) it's a lot easier, the stairs go up at a constant speed (to a certain age), you can freely walk out, rest, get some support on the way, even go over to the men's escalator to compete, but you are doing it as a *woman*. We men still see women as women, even if they're tomboyish we know damn well that thing between her legs is no different than that of Kylie Jenner's. But as a man, if you decide to move to the women's, you become a woman, none of them will see you as a male, you are a girl.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Society is being constructed to eradicate male masculinity with women,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dtpeqs/society_is_being_constructed_to_eradicate_male/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

It's not the first time it happens, and certainly I have nothing against vandalism, I am a fan of chaos myself and would gladly join in to riot. Here's the catch: women still think they can solve our own issues. By this I mean: rapists  aren't like that because women don't give up pussy. Rapists are what you get when you don't RedPill a natural, when a bluepill can't just accept reality and acts in the worst way possible,etc. It's an issue that has many causes, yes, but I firmly believe RedPill philosophy can stop rape culture at least a little bit (since it's pretty clear we don't hate no women, unlike rapists. 

I understand women have their own problems , but (and it is a dumb question, I am pretty mad about this shit, whatever) how fucking hard it is to understand they aren't solving anything with this kind of stuff?

They all have daddy issues, they are low level sluts, and they still think screaming and destroying shit will repair their life. Like, it's so stupid it starts being funny in a grim way, now that I live by RedPill theories, it's fun to see people trying to repair his life by doing these stupid things. 

As a matter of fact, I'm more concerned about the image they'll give to other girls. Out of the last 10 girls I have been on a date with, I had to gtfo with 7 because they truly believe in this fenimism shit. Like, I respect your opinion but one of the first things rp made me learn is to never stick your dick in crazy. And it just looks like a virus, where every girl is going to autosabotage his own love life.

In some of them, the harassment claims only came after they rejected a woman, or was too rude towards her, or had a bad relationship in the past.

This led me to think that perhaps auto-rejection can lead to harassment accusations?

In the PUA world, auto-rejection is when you’re too unattainable to a woman who fancies you (for example if you act like an asshole towards her, or you’re too rude, or you tease them too hard or you come across as a fuckboy etc...) which causes her to reject you before you reject her, in order so that her ego remains intact and her status is preserved.

She starts to convince herself that you wasn’t good enough for her in the first place, so your quality in her mind declines.

There’s a few articles on GirlsChase about this: [https://www.girlschase.com/content/secrets-getting-girls-staying-out-auto-rejection](https://www.girlschase.com/content/secrets-getting-girls-staying-out-auto-rejection)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I’m a good looking guy and I’ve been with many girls before.

In many of my relationships I’ve been asked out by the girl, so I know my value.

&amp;#x200B;

But this one time, I was unintentionally really rude to a girl who was into me, and she got angry and insulted me.

(Usually she was really warm and kind towards me.)

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I tried to make things better, but I came across as an idiot and lowered my value in her mind.

&amp;#x200B;

The insults she gave were worse than regular insults because I was friends with a guy that was desperate for her a year before (to the point he followed her to the bus stop to talk).

&amp;#x200B;

So she called me what she called him a year ago (“creepy”), told me she would “report” me (which is what she told me a few weeks before that she would do to my friend, because he called her out for embarrassing him. Long story.) and she also said I was acting like my friend now (to which I agreed and amplified that I’m even worse than him, later clarifying that it was a joke. Stupid I know.).

&amp;#x200B;

When I read the article on GirlsChase about how to turn around (fix things with) a girl who’s in auto-reject mode, I applied it with this girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her it wasn’t my intention to make her feel bad, I apologised and offered to buy her some ice cream to make things up to her.

I also asked her to come to this event on the next day with me.

She accepted the apology with a big smile on her face and took me up on both of my offers.

&amp;#x200B;

Then later on the same day, two of her friends followed me during lunch time and tried to test me.

They tried to see if I would speak against her behind her back by prodding me hard, or if I was beta.

They were shit-testing me constantly and trying to beta-shame me.

Even though they knew that I was joking about being “even worse” than my friend, one of them brought this up.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn’t break frame and so they realised my apology towards her was genuine and that I’m not low value (I didn’t sell out my friend by saying I’m not like him), so they thanked me (which confirmed in my mind that they were testing me) and told me to be careful with what I say to her before leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

Long-story short, I didn’t get with this girl because of my stupidity.

I knew for sure she was still into me because she passed my compliance test with ease, among other things.

&amp;#x200B;

She gave me many chances and when I didn’t act upon them, she started ignoring me.

&amp;#x200B;

So I ignored her back for several months, during which, in the last few months, she started giving me signals again (willingly sitting next to me even though I wasn't speaking to her, staring at me etc).

But I still ignored her.

&amp;#x200B;

Then during a final exam, when I walked to my seat, I accidentally caught her eye. She had her back turned and was staring at me in the eye.

&amp;#x200B;

Because I wanted to focus on my exams I kept my eye in the same place and pretended I didn’t see her, walking to my seat that was near her.

&amp;#x200B;

As I did so, she turned her head back to the front to stare at me walking to my seat (she must’ve been wondering why I ignored her)

&amp;#x200B;

This must’ve hurt her ego because on the rest of the exam days, she completely ignored my presence, even when we walked past each other.

&amp;#x200B;

After the final exam, I sent her a request on Snapchat through the ‘recommended’ list.

She didn’t accept it for a whole week, but on the final, ‘return school books’ day, I asked for her snapchat in person and she accepted my request.

&amp;#x200B;

Later over Snap, I asked her if she wanted to hang out with me during the holidays and she gave me a typical ASD “I don’t know you well enough to hang out with you”.

&amp;#x200B;

I was inexperienced so I didn’t deal with the ASD (didn’t know it was one), instead telling her it’s a shame and that she’s missing out, to which she replied that “it’s ok”.

I told her I would speak to her later on, but because I thought it was a value problem, I didn’t and I did stupid things instead.

&amp;#x200B;

A) I posted a video of me and this girl I used to date in order to build social proof, which she saw and she must’ve thought I was a fuckboy

&amp;#x200B;

B) I saw the thumbnail of her snapchat story, but I didn’t open it till the next day despite posting on my snapchat story later on (which she viewed).

&amp;#x200B;

When I finally opened her story, it was only a video of her at home in her prom outfit smiling

&amp;#x200B;

A few minutes after I opened it, she blocked me. I know this because I checked and her messages were no longer on my snapchat.

&amp;#x200B;

I think she thought I was playing her and she thought I didn’t value her enough to open her snap straight away, so she blocked me and went into auto-rejection.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I didn't go to prom either, so perhaps she wanted to move on since we wouldn’t see each other again.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn’t realise it was auto-rejection until 3 months later.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I kept asking our mutual connections to ask her why she blocked me.

Apparently she “didn’t want to speak to me anymore” and “doesn’t want me on her snapchat”.

&amp;#x200B;

Two months later, I told our mutual friend to send her a very long message from me, which explained how I wanted to get her number but then I got cockblocked by my friend at the start of the year and why I was acting stupid etc... 

&amp;#x200B;

She finally added me back on snapchat and asked me “what is it you want from me?” and other similar questions.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a shit test (it’s a special one where you can’t ignore it. You have to answer it in a humour “amplified” way) but I didn’t realise so I evaded the question and she got angry.

&amp;#x200B;

She called me a “gimp boy” for being unable to take her out.

&amp;#x200B;

That was when she denied ever liking me in the first place and accused me of harassing her before and now.

&amp;#x200B;

She also said the stupid things I did were “retarded and fucking stupid”

&amp;#x200B;

I maintained frame throughout the conversation. I didn’t realise it was auto-rejection, I thought she was being bitchy.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I knew she wasn’t being honest, but this made me think that perhaps this is how some false accusations are born.

&amp;#x200B;

A guy acts like an idiot and is unnecessarily rude to a girl, displays “fuckboy” traits, or ends a relationship on a bad note, which causes the girl to resent him and go as far as accusing him of harassment.

&amp;#x200B;

 \&gt;Stream of consciousness rant after a break-up. The only wisdom I can impart from between the time I wrote this to today this: allow yourself to be surprised. Keep your expectations low when it comes to females, because almost always your preconceived notions will be correct. However, if you completely shut yourself off to the positive aspect of women then you are guaranteed to create your own destiny.

\&gt;Women can be molded into a positive force. Women can be the third (You, Goals, Her) most important aspect of your life. The right woman to fit this bill is few and far between but she does exist. As long as you maintain frame the majority of the time, and understand that all responsibility of your life rests on your shoulders, she can enhance your life.

\&gt;The biggest takeaway that you need to comprehend is this: Women are not men. Men are not women. We are different animals who react differently to the same situations. Handle your business and find a woman who will handle hers in a way that is satisfactory to you, and understand that even if she is completely opposite - she can complement you.

-Am told that I’m a 8-9/10 by females and also by males (I am bisexual if that makes a difference) . But idk if they’re lying or not, most of the females that tell me this also usually add “you look like a girl” so i don’t really know what to make of any of it. 
 
However, I think I’m only a 5. I do suffer from very low self esteem from being bullied and sexually abused in elementary school and knowing that most of my life has been spent being a drug addict and a thief. I’m only 23 years old now and I still have the same low self esteem I always had. 

-I get approached by women(and sometimes men) pretty consistently, but decline every time because I feel like they can score someone better than me. I tend to cut people out of my life for no reason sometimes. 

- have mostly only female friends(the same group of friends since childhood), and although they are good looking, I have only seen them as friends and nothing more. They’re the only ones I get along with and can relate to...but I do wish I could relate to guys but I literally have no “manly” interests or hobbies. 

- I think the red pill is the 100% truth but it makes me sad and makes me not want to be involved in “the game” at all and would rather die alone, and not get involved in any kind of casual or long term relationship with anyone. 

- I don’t think I can ever be “alpha”, and I’d rather not try to be alpha and make a fool of myself. 

-I can’t gain weight no matter how much I eat, most likely due to a thyroid illness or something

- have only been in one LTR for 3 years and was cheated on by her continuously on the year before our breakup. I have never cheated and have always done everything she asked of me. I didn’t understand what the harm could be if I let her go to parties and bars and clubs by herself. I was indifferent to that, and trusted her completely that she wouldn’t do me wrong. Sometimes I wouldn’t even bother to find out where she was because I had that much trust in her. But after my friends showed my pictures of her kissing other guys at these bars, and one time finding another mans boxer briefs on her floor...I knew she was cheating on me, but I never brought it up because I thought it was my duty to just deal with it because all women cheat anyways. Then one night I realized how alone I actually am and I left her house while she was sleeping and intentionally overdosed on her pharmaceutical pills in my car on the side street. A passerby(who happened to be my neighbor and now a good friend of mine) noticed and took me to the hospital, my ex didn’t come to see me...I didn’t expect her to. When they released me from suicide watch, I came to her house to pick up my stuff and leave.... she opened the door and immediately told me she found someone else. She said it so casually and heartlessly. I just responded “okay” and took my stuff and left and never came back, I didn’t even look her in the face.  3 months later, I overdosed on heroin(and honestly I don’t remember whether I did this intentionally or not this time)My brothers friends gave me Narcan and had to take me to the hospital. I was admitted into rehab afterwords but I ran away from rehab on day 4 and got through my withdrawals on my own. 

- my ex texted me a bunch of long paragraphs while I was going through withdrawals, asking me to come back and saying that her new boyfriend had been beating her and that she didn’t realize what she had until she lost it. I didn’t know how to respond and I felt bad for her, but I also felt like if I responded I might catch feelings for her again so I just blocked her number. (I also moved from my old house 1 month after breaking up with her so she also no longer knows where I live and no way of finding out since only my closest friends know my address). Even though she cheated on me and hurt me to the point of suicide, I can’t help but hope that she’s doing alright. 

-ever since then, I just did my own thing, hung out with my friends, worked 40 hours a week, started having intimate relations with men, etc.  and continuously rejected all possible female intimacy. I stopped having intimate relations with men as well however because I was jumped and beaten to a pulp for “being gay” by the local gang members in my neighborhood. I was sent to the hospital again for the injuries. The weirdest thing is that when I came back, they apologized to me for jumping me and now the whole neighborhood is “cool with me being bisexual”. Still, I wouldn’t take the chance to act on my bisexual desires becuz I’m sure the guys here still have lowkey prejudice against anyone that’s lgbt. 

As for my sex life after that...
It’s gotten to a point where for the last 2 years, I have had no sexual thoughts or desires for either gender, and no erections, nothing. I don’t think I even feel “love” or lust for anyone or anything and have lost all passion for anything in life. I feel like I’m being forced to stay alive because of family, otherwise I would just overdose again. I just feel like a zombie working 40 hours a week, partying on the weekends and repeating. The only positive outcome is that I’m no longer a drug addict and not a thief anymore. I’m still continuously refusing dates with people though. I truly don’t think I have anything to offer, not even sex at this point since I don’t even have a libido any longer. Albeit, the lack of libido could just be from my depression but idk. 

And I recognize that the world is survival of the fittest and clearly I’m weak as hell so I know I’m not gonna survive and I know I have absolutely nothing to offer. Reading the red pill theory only makes me realize that I should have just died on my last OD, especially since I have seen and know for a fact that everything from the red pill theory is true.

I have had a discussion with numerous women about the subject of ""cuffing the woman"".  What is cuffing? It's when a man locks down one female, usually as a committed relationship. This typically is only an issue with LTRs or women who want to be promoted.  She will ask the man if he is currently locking her down.  She wants to know how committed he is.  What it REALLY means however, is that she may be open to cheating or moving on. 

I'll give an example: girlfriend wants to go to a party with some guy friends. She asks ""hey are you ok with me going to this party with my male friends?"" A: He says ""no"" She then goes on to explain how insecure he is for not trusting her. B: He says ""yes"" Now she asks ""oh so you're not cuffing me?""

Whenever a woman asks this she is covertly placing responsibility for fidelity squarely on the man. I am firmly in the camp of ""Watch what she does rather than listen to what she says"". If she is determined to ""make a mistake"" she will. After she cheats she can then come back and hamster that you failed to lock her down.

Understand that the responsibility of the health of the relationship is on both parties not just the man. Do not allow a woman to use ""cuff me"" as a reason to play the field. Instead, use it to evaluate her commitment towards YOU.  Hopefully you never hear her say this, but if you do be wary and suspicious but watch. Or if you know her well enough, next her.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Cuff Me!,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dt3u3z/cuff_me/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The PUA called Mystery used to encourage his subjects that there should be no limit on the outrageousness, dress like someone straight out of an Elton John music video if you want to. This ended up in the top-hat, black nail, snake suit [caricatures](http://www.thepickupdiary.com/simple-yet-effective-technique-to-get-her-attention/mystery-and-style-peacocking/) of PUAs that became much maligned in the mid 2000s.

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing this reaction to peacocking can lead someone to believe that it doesn't really work. There is also a natural reaction to not want to try too hard in the clothing department for fear of looking desperate. Well I'm here to tell you peacocking still works in 2019. The method expressed in ""The Game"" was simply version one. With some refinement, you can do it even with today's sky high pickiness in women.

&amp;#x200B;

Successful peacocking today has to be creative, yet believable. Rollo Tomassi gives good advice on this. He says, ""you need to look like somebody important in society to encourage the fantasy."" This is a good foundation for creativity in peacocking. For the believability part, this is dictated largely by your location and ethnic group. For example, I am a black man. What works for me is looking like an athlete (matching tracks/sweats from head to toe), a rapper (fitted cap+wife beater+bling+jeans), a militia man (fitted shirt, dog tag, cargo pants, shades, beret and boots) or an African chief (Nigerian native outfit+coral beads+sandals). These are peacocking examples that fire up popular images of black alphas which in turn makes me a fantasy come to life for a lot of women. Since I tried this, I've finally started getting strong IOIs from women that I'm very attracted to, whereas when I was using the typical male fashion advice of ""just be neat and wear fitting clothes,"" I was only getting IOIs from women who were undeniably below me in SMV and unattractive to me.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Peacocking still works,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dt3dz3/peacocking_still_works/,no_ads,0.0,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'wnLMDsygU62bfPrUpHwQuUH_58ZQUyPdRHauQsA9PYw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 106, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/c8IIPScbzLT7jCJBuyuYGVI9aq3jEDyT5oshJB5jA_Y.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49f4ec0bcc6483cba605cf52d197c768b51e1745', 'width': 108}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/c8IIPScbzLT7jCJBuyuYGVI9aq3jEDyT5oshJB5jA_Y.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5153a5fa307c39daf68c14010bf52c1aa31341db', 'width': 216}, {'height': 316, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/c8IIPScbzLT7jCJBuyuYGVI9aq3jEDyT5oshJB5jA_Y.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdfc4f993b39c8bb7074c64b15c2820e25f68a6a', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 485, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/c8IIPScbzLT7jCJBuyuYGVI9aq3jEDyT5oshJB5jA_Y.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=89902691b48f734acab3ccd699fc06c8253b1e7b', 'width': 490}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,1

I have an appointment coming up at the Psychiatrists to assess my ADHD symptoms, though symptoms of Asperger's/ASD might also be a topic of discussion.

Ideally, we like to think that everyone on more controversial boards like TRP are experts in the field of game, with women throwing themselves at the feet for even a sniffle of the d. 

The truth is that this really isn't the case. The overwhelming majority of TRP are here to try to improve, carrying that vital awareness that unless we do so then we'll continue to live in mediocrity. 

Being proactive with your diet is a great way to start. You don't have to go full carnivore like Jordan Peterson, unless your autoimmune problems are that bad of course. But every little change helps. For gym-goers it's probably the most difficult. You gotta understand that those carbs that you're eating to bulk will eventually fuck you up. Deadlifting in Nikes before eating pizza is a sure way to fuck up your joints by 35.

I strongly believe it is important to also disclose that [Autism is deeply linked with inflammation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2018.00405/full) from which many people unknowingly suffer (arthritis, IBS, and psoriasis being examples of more common symptoms). 

I myself suffer from deep-rooted autoimmune problems, with more severe problems coming from my mothers side with more behavioral issues stemming from my father's. My mother has Hashimoto's disease, Celiac's disease, IBS, and suffered alopecia at a young age. 

Her mother has Osteoperosis, while her brother's son became the national karate champ of his age group. He had severe alopecia and had no hair or finger nails by the time won. Inspirational little shit. 

The majority of people are affected by some form of chronic inflammation; some in debilitating pain while others appear to be symptomless, though this is rare due to many common symptoms being unrecognised as inflammatory issues. Go and speak to as many 60+ year olds and you can and you'll be shocked by how many of them suffer from some sort of arthritic pain. 

For me, a strict diet &amp; exercise regime are absolutely necessary to avoid inflammatory symptoms. Higher levels of inflammation have shown to be linked to mental health conditions from depression &amp; ADHD to schizophrenia &amp; autism, and is a huge contributing factor to emotional stability.

One thing I've monitored in myself is that a lot of my inflammatory symptoms are linked in with histamine levels. Histamine is one of the primary molecules involved with the immune system and an inflammatory response. The simplest way to put it is higher histamine = more inflammatory symptoms. 
One day you could feel like an absolute alpha god while the next, an anxious mess limping in pain. 
I confirmed these symptoms were histamine-related after doing an experiment with modafinil, that seems to fire up almost all of my symptoms at once. It's the reason I'd rather get prescribed concerta over giving myself extreme Asperger's just to get something done. 

Tendinitis, joint pain, brain fog, fatigue, and social retardedness. I also get the same problems from taking protein powders with L-histidine.

Now here's where things get tricky. One of my symptoms of high histamine is what I can only describe as being in a constant state of sensory overload. Everything seems bright &amp; flashy while maintaining a conversation becomes nearly impossible; pretty nightmarish actually, especially when speaking to girls.

I've always suffered with social withdrawal with my mother recalling as how I've been since 3. I'm now more than convinced that high levels of inflammation were behind my struggle to have conversations, leading to withdrawal. Nobody likes awkwardness, which gave me the perfect reason to withdraw completely.

Even if I do get an ASD/Asperger's diagnosis alongside the ADHD next week, being aware that symptoms are related to a systemic inflammation  is a responsibility, regardless of what your symptoms are. You

Luckily for us we're living at the exact point in time where inflammation is being linked to these conditions, [autism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6027314/) being just another example. Have you ever wondered why behavior and emotion-regulating problems were almost non existent hundreds of years ago? And when they were, those afflicted were either ""hysterical"" or possessed by demons? 

Only in the past two centuries has the food degenerated more than ever before in history, while a substance shown to be 8x more addictive than cocaine, in mice, is added to almost everything?

Unless you're running a strict diet like Paleo then it's more than likely that you're ingesting sugar on a daily basis. This is a huge reason why fad diets like Veganism aren't actually helping as much as we're led to believe, with some people actually triggering more autoimmune problems leading to higher levels of inflammation. How often do you meet an emotionally stable vegan? 

A weak diet is one of the most blue-pilled ways you can live your life. Not only does it show lack of self-control but also it will come back and bite you in the ass. Autoimmune diseases are something you develop. Genetics only increase your likelihood to develop problems, as with type 2 diabetes. 

Foods like gluten expand your gut lining, allowing particles inside. Your immune system doesn't like this. In fact you can develop an allergy/intolerance to almost any food because your body will start to recognise it as an invader, kickstarting an inflammatory response every time you eat it. 

I actually trialed this out using a site called Intolerance Lab. I picked a food to eat daily in which I knew I had no issues with, Biltong. A few months later I ran the test. Not only said I had developed an intolerance to specifically dried beef, but actually most things I had been eating in my diet. 

From rice, eggs, turkey, to even green fucking tea - a supplement I had been taking in pill-form. In fact I specifically recall at that time that eggs used to block up my sinuses, making it hard to breathe through my nose. After abstaining from them for a few months, they no longer cause an issue. 

So what is healthy? 
The reason I suggest Paleo is that it's most in line with what we are supposed to eat which coincidentally happens to be anti-inflammatory in its entirety. You will be more confident, perform better at the gym (you really don't need to load up on carbs), and be able to think much more clearly.

 Meat with veggies should be the core of your diet. Thrown in a few carbs on your training days and you're good to go. No processed shit. If you're just starting out, going gluten-free is probably the easiest way to begin. Not only does gluten shred your gut and spike your insulin levels, but it also screws up your microbiome. 

If you want to step up your game, try experimenting with one-meal-a-day and Fasting. Fasting encourages the process autophagy, in which the body recycles unnecessary cells from fat cells to viruses. 

The fact that I even discovered how much diet affects you is a god-send. I had been transitioning from my cut-diet during what felt like the best time in my life, to bulking. Within two weeks, all of my inflammatory symptoms returned. The only changes I had made at the time were adding gluten and milk back into my diet. 

Most importantly, do not throw away a healthy diet for women. Women often make it clear that they like to be wined and dined before 69'd.

We first met at a Halloween party which was great because I had other girls to game if she was a catfish or whatever. That night was pretty fun she noticed how much attention I was getting from other women and she quickly starting getting touchy. I had to go to work early next morning so I K closed and left the party. 

After this she was at another party during the weekend and I stayed home studying and shit. Although she was at another party she spent almost all night texting me and asking me if she can suck my dick lol. Obviously she knew it was not possible until she came back so I sent her one picture of my dick just to get her mind raising.

Fast forward to 2 days ago, and she was telling me ""in need of a cute ass boy kissing me"" synonym for ""In need of a good fuck"" it was late so I told her that she should have said so earlier and I might have been able to drop by. Next day she asks me to come over, and so I did. After a lot of push and pull she finally gave me in and it got hot pretty fast. I made her squirt 3 times and we even took a shower together. I stayed the night and everything felt amazing (I admit Im a little shooked by how attracted I am to her). The day after that she asks me to come over again but this time the vibe was so much different. She wasn't as receptive this time, and she wouldn't give me a tounge kiss or anything. We were watching Netflix cuddling in bed. We didn't make out and I got a little impatient with her half ass kisses so I grabbed her face and told her to kiss me the right way. She responds with a whiny voice ""watch this show please"". At this point I gave up and pulled a book on my phone and just started reading because I was not into the show, and I just wanted to fuck. She then lays her head on my crotch and I paid no mind to it, just caressed her hair as if she was a pet at this point lol. She kept looking at her instagram and Snapchat but she wouldn't pay me any attention. She wouldn't kiss me unless I reached for it and I just got tired of the bullshit and I turned my back to her and just went to sleep.

All night I kept wondering wtf I did wrong and how I could make her want me again. I just wanted to leave her place already cause I didn't feel she was as a receptive as last time and I felt like an inconvenience at this point. Im not sure how to turn this shit around, but I played it cool I didnt really get mad and my rationalization to this was ""Im sure she doesnt want to get the bet all soaked again, and she doesn't want to make a mess today"". Im curious to hear on how you guys handle this shit cuz I am always in the mood to fuck but I HATE BEING PUSHY about it.

You see, I just turned 18 last month and I was gonna go there by myself. 

One of the biggest reasons that I hadn’t been able to lose my virginity is that I live with my parents and I can’t go out all day everyday gaming hoes/take them to my house. 

Now that I was gonna have 8 days to fuck around and a whole house to myself, I knew I had to get laid. The first couple of days though I didn’t do any approaches, as I was intimidated by the 6’5 black dudes most girls would be with. 

Around the 5th day, I was at a park at 10 sitting on a bench when a HB6 approached me and started talking to me. She was older than me (25) so at first I was like “wtf, I can’t game her” but then she started talking about weed and alcohol and I knew it was my time to shine. Now, a few days prior, a guy I met told me to beware of cuban women because they are out to get your money and shit. So I was chary throughout the whole night, nothing happened. 

She asked me if I wanted to buy some and I was like yeah so we talked to a friend of hers, who then talked to another guy and I paid $5 for a joint thinner than dental floss halfway full with bunk. That didn’t matter though because I bought a bottle of rum and me, her and the guy drank some then I told him to not block me and that I was gonna take her to my apartment and he wished me luck. 

I was feeling a little nervous when we got to my AirBnB, but I told myself I was excited and I knew I couldn’t pussy out. I remembered a post here (or on the other sub, am not sure) of a guy who said he had taken a girl to his room but he was too pussy to make a move so he didn’t get the lay, and that motivated me to not do the same. Then, I did the hair test and when she was receptive to this I went for the kiss. She backed a little, but she gave in. At that moment I knew I had this shit on lock. We kissed a little then I smacked and after like 7 minutes I nutted and we headed back to the park to meet with her friend who at this point was my nigga now. I gave them 2 tabs I smuggled and I took one too and I had a great night.

Am at the airport right now, heading home. First thing im doing tomorrow is hitting the gym (started in August, loving it) Life is good bros. Enjoy it. 

Anyways, I wanna thank you guys for all the advice you post here.

Let's look at a more simple approach. Thomas is a 15 year old kid who's doing his homework, its 7pm and he hears his name and comes down for dinner. Food on the plate. Great, right?

Thomas had to give up his liberty of those two actions in order to get food on the plate without him having to pay in financially or labour-wise.

They cant wait to get out of the private renting sector and get into council houses.

Filled with idealism, I had clasped my dad's hand and confidently stated that I'd be there for him no matter what. ""I'll **never** give up on you, dad!"" He flashed a sad smile, but his eyes were bright.

Fast forward a year later. My dad is completely bed bound. Tube feed, breathing machine, dialysis, we live in a trailer in the armpit of town, we're running out of money, and he's having diarrhea. I am holding the diaper in my shit gloved, shit stained, hands.

I slumped to the ground, defeated, i muttered through tears: ""I'm sorry dad, i just cant do this anymore! I just cant! I'm too weak! This isnt going to work! Youre not getting better!"" And on and on and on...

He quietly looked on and said ""just let me go son, you've done enough. More than enough. You have nothing to prove. Live your life.""

It was at this time I remembered the redpill. The single most important lesson ive learned here is that ""I cant!"" Really just means ""I won't.""

It wasn't that i couldn't do it, it was that i **didn't want to do it.**

My life flashed before my eyes. A life of chasing women. I life of seeking their validation. A life of my mother calling me an idiot. A life of hedonism and nihilism. A life where i wouldve sold my own father up the river just to be with a girl. A life where I've abandoned friends in their time of need, just for a chance to be with the newest oneitis in my life.

*This is the man that my dad will leave behind.* The sum total of his memories will be of having a miserable, pathetic wretch of a son who was so desperate for the validation of a women that he destroyed his own life to get just a taste. The last thing my dad will see is his son sobbing like a child in the corner at the age of 28, covered in sweat and feces.

""Anger is the poison you drink to kill your enemies, son.""

""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, son.""

""Anger isn't evil, son. Even God got angry. It is only when you lose control that you will drown in it.""

""Anger is a tool. A resource to be utilized. Right now, you're like a out pf control fire, burning everything you touch and yourself. All i want you to do is learn to channel it. I want you to go from a fire to a laser. If you must break, break into a weapon, not into pieces. Don't become a slave to your anger. Become the master of it. Your anger isn't evil. Its letting you know that something in your life and needs correction. Anger and the pain that comes with it are your best friends, they're the only thing that will be honest with you.""

All the sayings my dad had said over the years, that didn't register at the time, finally came crashing back into my mind.

Then, the inner voice we all possess within ourselves asked me this:

**Are you ok with this!?**

**are you happy with this!?**

**aren't you a man!?**

**what happened to all that big talk from before!?**

**are you really going to leave things like this!?**

**did you forget your promise!?**

**the promise you made to yourself!?**

**the promise that you'd stand and fight!?**

**the promise to destroy your weakness!?**

**this is your chance!**

**prove to everyone that they were wrong about you!**

**but most importantly, prove yourself wrong. Get the fuck up and prove YOURSELF WRONG!**

i could feel the adrenaline rushing through my veins. Despair turned into anger. A righteous fury. For the first time in my life, anger became a friend rather than an enemy. For the first time, i wasn't burning myself up in a fiery rage.

I grit my teeth, clenched my fists and stood up with my back straight and my head held high.

""Youre wrong, dad! **Im not done. Im not even close to done. This is nothing to me. Im just getting started. Dont count me out. I'm a man, damnit. Im going to show you that, you fucking idiot! Im not going to have your last memories of me be the pathetic display you just witnessed.** Now just you watch! Im going to show the world it was wrong to count me out! I'm going to show everyone that they dont get the privilege of defining who i am or dictating when im at my limit!""**

**""only i define myself. Only i decide when im done. Only i get to say when ive reached my limit.""**

Then I dried my tears and get my ass back to work.

Whenever you tell yourself you cannot do something, all it really means is that you wont. Just like when you says ""things should be"" when what you really mean ""i want things to be this way.""

Life isn't fair. But it is in its unfairness. Thus life is fair in its unfairness.

If life isnt fair for you, *dont sit around and cry.* **make it fair, damnit.**

You cannot save anyone if you cannot save yourself first.

You want to be a hero? Become your own hero. Become your own best friend. Look out for future you. Confide in yourself. Love yourself. Trust yourself. Be happy with yourself. You have everything you need tp succeed within yourself. Mother nature gives all of her children the tools they need to secure their own existence in this cruel world. Show yourself that you were wrong. Show yourself that the old you is dead and gone. Be brave and conquer your fear. Dont become a slave to your anger. **Use it! Do not waste it! Make all the pain and suffering you've gone through mean something! Make all the sacrifices you've made stand for something! Dont leave this world with a legacy of your weakness.**

**Don't give the world the satisfaction.**

I wouldn't even talk to a woman that I thought was below a 7/10 in my eyes because I figured I would get nothing out of it. As a result, I almost never had sex.

Since joining TRP, I've realized that game is something you learn, and takes experience. A knife that never gets sharpened will stay dull forever. I've started ""lowering my standards"" so to speak, and although it hasn't gotten me exactly to the place I want to be yet, I've learned a lot about women in general just from interacting with more of them, and I believe it will help me have better chances with the more attractive type that I was going for initially.

IMO, as long as the notion of fucking the person isn't utterly repulsive in your mind, then they're hot enough for you to approach. Better to be getting some pussy than be getting no pussy.

Let's review this ""study"" and show how it is used to spread bluepilled bullshit, let's note that the article actually got shared 50k times.

&gt;Researchers at Florida State University reviewed the relationships of 223 *newlyweds*, aged 20 to 29.

They took newlyweds, i.e people that are still lovey-dovey. Most of the couples will divorce within a few years anyways. My point is this study isn't about lasting couples and could only be applied to relatively short long-term relationships

&gt;the couples were asked to answer various questions about dieting and getting fit. 

They mostly rated people's happiness based on their diet and fitness choices while completely ignoring the other factors. Hmmmm

&gt;The results revealed women who had attractive husbands are obsessed with losing weight in order to look better, which, they say, makes them insecure and sad

""trying to make sure chad does not leave me for another girl because I know I'm replaceable makes me sad and unhappy :(((""

And then an accidental redpill

&gt;On the other hand, those who had less attractive husbands didn't feel any pressure to diet and get fit, which makes a woman happier in the relationship.

Again, same mistake, they totally overshadow the other factors that may influence happiness. Anyways this shows that women wants you to feel acquired to them so that they can whatever the fuck without you having your word to say.

&gt;If you feel that your handsomeness makes your other half unhappy, the researcher advises: ""One way to help these women is for partners to be very reaffirming, reminding them, 'You're beautiful. I love you at any weight or body type'"" 

Top tier bluepilled bullshit right here. It clearly shows that women want the cake and eat it too, they want somebody with the body of Chad and the mind of a beta cuck.

####Conclusion 

While this article could have been a cope for the average ugly dude, it actually only reinforce their betaness and make they even less valuable on the long term so more incline to betabuxxing. We also have a good example on how the mainstream media is trying to betafy high SMV men. The only good thing about this article then, is that it reveals pretty well the true female nature.

This isn't my own original post, but a repost from a user on an Aaron Clarey video. The author of the below is a female nurse who describes a medical workplace environment dominated by women.

**The Story**

I am not the best of storytellers when it is a funny story but I will give you some examples for sure. In a hospital I worked in a few years back we had two groups form between the female nurses and the female doctors: those who had worked together before and those who were young nurses.

Most days would bring a pointed moment when some people were invited out planned to meet for lunch or a coffee break - and some weren't. The more expensive the place the better for the female doctors. Nothing explicit was ever said; the cutting rejection was obvious enough to some of the girls.

Fashion was a great divider, though in this battlefield everyone was on their own. Sly remarks about people looking over-dressed to the merits of their fake tan application.

I always felt sorry for anyone who naively showed off a new boyfriend or item (these women viewed men and items as just utilities remember), because everyone would coo appreciatively to that persons face - then harshly criticise them as soon as they were out of earshot. This happened always without exception.

One of the female doctors first showed how much the pecking order among these women mattered when the department advertised for a new radiographer and refused to hire the best-qualified person, a man, because he was too tall. Management didn't challenge the decision not to hire him because they had a policy of siding with the female doctors.

The department was like Marks and Spencers, but with the competitiveness of the super bowl - and the low cunning of the game of thrones.

When female doctors brought matching bags in the office, it was like pistols at dawn. They forced a few compliments, but relations never recovered, to the expense staffing relationships.

Another time, when two members of staff bought the same shoes, one proclaimed: 'They'll look better on me, because I'm a size six and she has clown feet.'

It didn't take long for the department to become divided between the women who wore make-up and those who didn't. Comments from the former were typically ”she has more spots then a teenager” or ”Someone is having a bad hair day”, while the no-make-up side were equally scathing, with remarks - behind their backs, naturally - such as ”she looks like a prostitute”; or ”She looks like a slapper”.

The obsession with appearance and looking youthful meant nearly all the staff were on diets. The older female doctors despised the younger nurses openly and covertly disliked the junior female doctors.

Two of the skinny junior female doctors often snidely said about the largest girl, a nurse: “She should have her own area code”.

Female doctors and nurses considered it acceptable to take time off for almost everything - beauty treatments, just too tired today, had an argument with my boyfriend, my kids are sick, their periods - and not out of their holiday allowance. One female doctor regularly came in late because she was getting her hair coloured – peroxide blonde, and when I mentioned this, as a senior nurse involved in work scheduling, she blew up in outrage. Though at least she had a reason; most just turned up late regardless, and huffed 'That's the time my train gets in' if anyone pointed at the clock.

From my observations it is as though, in a women-only environment, staff were unable to keep their defined roles. Arguments are a daily occurrence. It would start with snide comments between two people then, as others joined in, emotion and anger would grow until an eruption - shouting, screaming, swearing - which always left someone in tears – often the new girl or the most junior member of staff. (The male staff avoided these women in general out of fear of false harassment claims which caused more then a few problems with communication.)

Then the friends of the woman who was upset would follow her to console her, leaving one group in the department, another group in the ladies and all the male doctors trying to cover these women's duties and rounds. Both groups of women would then bitch unreservedly about each other - and do absolutely as little work as possible so the orderlies, junior doctors and senior male doctors had to cover the slack (often the junior doctors bore the brunt of this).

It reached the point that management held mandatory workshops for staff on how to be nice to each other. The advice centred on being respectful to everyone and treating people equally – most of the female staff assumed it was because the men needed to learn about sexual harassment but it was actually because the female staff were always causing issues.

The HR consultant said there should be no more criticising or whispering in the department. But although when people heard this they said they loved the idea, it made no difference.

Many of the women (especially the female doctors) were aggressive or defensive, or both. The most aggressive masked a host of insecurities with their outgoing nature, while the defensive ones opened up only when provoked.

The worst type I encountered, however, was the 'passive aggressive- a woman who doesn't seem cruel, but is the worst of the pack, ruthlessly bringing you down in such a sweet and unassuming manner that you don't realise what she's done until long after the event.

But the biggest force wasn't personality type, it was hormones. When one woman started having IVF, she unleashed her rage without warning and without apology. At 'that time of the month' - which in an female dominated work environment meant someone was always at that point - any bad mood was swiftly passed on to the rest of team as if by osmosis.

Hormones came second as an excuse for absence and bad temper only to love life problems. When one female doctors cheated on her husband and started divorce proceedings, the other girls in the department were told in no uncertain terms by her that ""we must be very understanding and sensitive towards her at work"" - in an email she sent around. A true drama queen, her tears went on for a week. Another girl had a happy accident that she told some of us wasn't an accident and eventually the guy she was dating found out and the relationship hit the rocks. So many arguments that week.

Another girl, fresh out of a divorce, frequently primed everyone in the department about what to say to whom whenever any of the male doctors were around.

Another girl, a student nurse, had a voracious sexual appetite and, in a female-only environment, saw nothing wrong with screeching across the staff room details of her marathon sex sessions or how many ”c*#ks she had in her mouth last night”. The department received frequent complaints about her crude language. Incidentally I found out from a friend of mine who still works there that that ""voracious nurse"" left after she caught chlamydia which she gave to her boyfriend (one of the security guards at the hospital).

When we had departmental meetings with male doctors, female staff turned ferocious, each out to prove that they were the sexiest in the room. With a male consultant of cardiology, one nurse said ”Watch this!”, then stuck her hands around her breasts and lifted them up while shaking them. The men were speechless.

Also, student nurses trying to sleep with Senior doctors is always a problem and most of these men are married. If the men decline, as most do, then there is the awkward environment to deal with as the other female staff gossip if they get wind of it. False sexual harassment claims happen a lot too.

I believe the work environments are ruined by the destructive jealousy and in-fighting of female staff. Selfishness and insecurities lead to nothing but problems and often times it is the male staff left to clean up the mess.


Finally on to a more serious note and guys this is very serious. Female doctos work drastically less then male counterparts even taking account them as groups (and male doctors are a minority now and male doctors collectively still work more hours the female doctors collectively). This published article outlines this and the necessity for more doctors (when they really mean more male doctors).

**Story continued**

Yes, nurses, even with seniority take a lot of abuse from junior female doctors because a lot of the female doctors are insecure (rightly so sometimes since they are not on par with their male counterparts). Male doctors rarely cause upset and generally treat men and women of all staff with a certain degree of decorum. I have a doctorate in nursing science and I attended several workshops as part of the mandatory credits we needed, and I had years experience over the other women there, that the women in the class were coddled, some of these were going to be future doctors. The best and highest marks were always the guys but the university tried to balance it out by making things more assignment based or team based since on an individual basis the girls couldn't handle it. Now, that isn't saying women are stupid. It is just that they were coddled because they were young female students. the male students worked their asses off. The female students spent half the lecture on facebook on their phones or taking snapchats. Most of these girls were on women only scholarships too. It is madness.

I am a female nurse myself and I have worked with great doctors of both sexes but it is clear that the vast majority of them are men and the competent female doctors wind up getting burned out and dropping out to become stay at home mothers, part time consultants or general practitioners (even that is part time).

**End of Story**

Some really basic take aways include:

**Female Doctors and Nurses**

(a - 0) women devolve into workplace tribalism, factions based on obvious hierarchies, those being wealth and more importantly beauty
(a - 1) older higher status women either doctors or nurses resent their younger juniors because of their beauty giving them access to the male doctors
(a - 2) despite obvious faction rivalries the women still try to protect their reputations as a unified group, which is less likely to hold in a female dominated environment

(b - 0) a lot of female doctors drop out of the workforce to become stay at home mothers
(b - 1) economic productivity of female doctors is low
(b - 2) government and corporate subsidization of women over qualified men reduces the number of active practitioners in the medical field, increasing costs for private consumers, or lowers access in a communist care system
(b - 3) quality of care is arguably lower

(c - 0) women abuse the workplace system to the maximum will giving the lowest ROI possible
(c - 1) most of them are back stabbing, gossiping,  dished out in a given workplace comes from women
(c - 2) excessive narcissism 

**Male Doctors and Nurses**

(a - 0) male doctors are basically fucked over by what's essentially a welfare system to sign in more female doctors
(a - 1) male doctors crank out the super majority of hours, even as a minority group even if they work in a female dominated environment
(a - 2) male doctors despite qualifications will still meet discrimination because of the ability of women to horde positions of economic interest, despite lacking qualification

(b - 0) women in the modern era tend to view men as commodities
(b - 1) cheating, lying, branch swinging, hypergamy, etc are all to common 
(b - 2) so common even male doctors are now averse, or significantly more cautious to marriage

In closing in my own anecdotal experience I've known a few med students who opted out of becoming doctors because the grind and debt weren't favorable. They were able to modify their own careers\ paths to get a ""nine to five"" which pays really well, without the trappings of a given work environment. Its a brave new world and its worth consideration what you're going to study pays well and just as importantly what your work environment will be like by the time you graduate.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Observations of Medical Work Environment Dominated by Women,0,1573044176.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dryltk/observations_of_medical_work_environment/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,dark,,,,,,1

AWALT's gonna lie to your face, slowly while blaming you and calling you crazy... 

# BEWARE, your gut knows when she's feeding you bullshit and calling it filet!

men, i have long learned to trust my gut feeling. i don't think it has really every failed me, as long as i listen closely and tune out the bullshit being force feed to me. let me preface this with a little caveat: if you're overly jealous (and likely can't hold frame) you may not be able to trust your intuition as much... jealousy might take over logic and intuition in these case.  however, for me, when my gut tells me something is fucky, i listen up. i don't react, i just collect info and ask a few questions to gauge the situation and how far she's getting demoted...

# BACKSTORY

i don't want to list too many details here because doxing is a bitch. to keep it easy, i'll just say this:  
a (now former) LTR of 3 years hit me with nasty case of ***trickle truth.*** the funny thing is, i've really learned to sniff this shit out over the years. i even surprise myself. i can smell that shit from the ""ding"" of the first text arriving, or ring of the first tale on the telephone. the problem is, if you go full, head on rampage when you sniff out bullshit (blow up your frame with a nuke from space) you're not doing yourself any favors... you need to remain totally cool, calm and IDGF.

# I ran into a friend...

so, everything started out easily enough. i was doing my own thing, and my LTR was doing her's in her part of town...  for some reason, i got a strange feeling. can't describe it, but i just thought, let me send out a feeler. texted her, ""hey, what's up girl?""

the response was fast and strange. a short, yet confusing run around to a really simple question (clue 1)... again, without getting into details. things just didn't add up. and, i was only asking ""what's up"". it was a slow wednesday evening, so, the strange reply just didn't feel right in the slightest.

to make a long story short, the ltr is gone, and i'm back to a few of my side plates. funny how, ""absolutely nothing"" turned into dinner, drinks, and intimate conversation... yeah. AWALT. the thing is, my gut is telling me nothing physical probably happened, but that shit doesn't matter because she lied. so, the end-game over. however, her excuses were rather interesting as a case study.

# DRIP, DRIP, DRIP...

at first, she had said she was with random friends. when i laughed and said her story was was funny, i was told, ""you're controlling and jealous if you think anything else!""... i held frame, and said have fun, and hung up. i had only mentioned, that her story was rather funny. why? it didn't make sense and my gut was tingling. as a betting man, i would have put at least 100 on her lying... so, i ghosted.

the ghosting opened up a storm gate of texts and calls (the i left all unanswered for a week). then, i finally picked up only to hear a bit more of the trickle truth drop... but, eve with the new revelations, i still felt she still wasn't being totally honest. yeah, more ""honest"" than before, but still a lying bitch. ghosted for another week, and finally picked up again. this time i agreed to let her take me out for a drink and explain. so, i went back to her place and fucked her, for the last time. a cold, hard, but really decent fuck... i wanted to see just how good my intuition was and hear her you. you better believe i wrapped my little man up, latex tight. 

fellas, i was spot on... even more truth trickled out after the fuck. i remained calm and left soon after, and ghosted again.

# Trust your Gut!

after many decades in this game, you start to read between the lines, and become good at translating women speak (bullshit). i had nothing to lose. yeah, it stung a bit, but i just swallowed hard and picked up with a couple side plates this past week. aside from the harsh AWALT reminder, all is well. i thought i might help some here with a trickle reminder that you (me, all of us) need to trust your gut, and that trickle truth is a bitch (but what a great description of AWALT, redpill reality).

# PRO TIP:

if the story doesn't add up from the start, and details quickly change or are fuzzy under some light, logical scrutiny., pay attention. then if you start getting hit with a load of defensiveness and deflection for no good reason there's an extremely good chance that she's lying her ass off to you. she won't tell you this. you could recite the truth from a video, but at that point in time, she will just deny, deflect and lash out. she'll blame you for whatever she came muster. she'll make you think you're crazy (gas lighting) and scorn you for being a dick and totally wrong. everyone, (all her friends) knows you're a jealous control freak, too. except, you're probably not. know at this moment, that you are likely correct in your assumption, and it's time to go fuck a few other plates so that hard nexting her won't sting you nearly as much.

i know, this is all a bit random, but i think, it still may help some of you when you get confronted with AWALT bullshit and get called crazy for it...

""[Did Emma Sulkowicz Get Redpilled?](https://www.thecut.com/2019/10/did-emma-sulkowicz-mattress-performance-get-redpilled.html)"" is a lame article by a ""journalist,"" but fortunately /u/monsieurhire2 has a better take on it. What follows is his and reposted with permission. 

It sounds like she did get redpilled.

Meaning, she's realizing what her best interest is, which is, namely, to cozy up to attractive, powerful men, namely, Chads, EVEN though, it goes against her previous cultural conditioning.

She WANTED to ignore that attractive wealthy-looking guy on Tinder, because that was what her brainwashing said to do. But her instincts kicked in, so she contacted him, and when he didn't turn out to be Patrick Bateman, she realized that she had probably been sold a bill of goods by unattached older women.

""If Sulkowicz is not making art, then it’s much harder to grasp why she’s doing this and what it means.""

Hypergamy. She is following her hypergamous instincts. It's not in her best interest to be dragging around a mattress and criticizing all men as rapists. That's not going to attract a good mate. So, instead, she is moderating herself, and distancing herself from what she did, to make herself more marketable, hoping that some guy will wife her up. That's why she's ditching her probable low-paying art gigs.

Also ""conservative"" is code for wealthy or at least economically literate. In a capitalist society, being anything else can be akin to cutting your own throat financially, which will then lead to things like unemployment, wage slavery, crappy life conditions, and even disease and premature death. So, she's going to these ""conservative"" events not to learn about the ""new"" ideas, which she could get off of wikipedia in 5 minutes at $0 cost, but to put herself out there to the guys that go to these events, who are hopefully wealthy guys.

Another thing that stood out. She states at one point that she ""hated all men"" and ""wanted all men to die.""
Think about how irrational that is. To want an entire group of people to just die. If anyone on here thinks like that about any group, they should really try and think about how they got there, who or what contributed to that mindset.
In the mainstream, there is a lot of talk about hatred at various groups, and how socially unacceptable it is. There is less talk about the hatred directed at men, because they are painted as an oppressor group, as are ""white men,"" so it's not a mystery how people are finding themselves ""hating"" men. Man hatred is completely normalized, and one finds it popping up everywhere. People who are supposedly ""tolerant"" and ""liberal"" and ""open-minded"" are completely comfortable publicly sharing rhetoric, that if used to describe another group, would get them socially ostracized.
Human nature being what it is, one has to ask, if these people ever considered that people in other groups would behave any differently, any better, or any worse, if they were in the same position.

Also, the hatred overlooks the hard, undeniable fact, that life for MOST men, is a giant shit-sandwich of vicious competition with few if any real rewards, and many illusory prizes that vanish when you try to claim them. I mean, the primary roles are: soldier, manual worker, skilled manual worker, and information manager. So, you either are a killer, a shit-shoveler, a mechanic of some kind, or a symbol wrangler. Each one brings its own set of hazards. And even if you are in the top 1%, you still have to face the plotting and scheming of other people at the top, who would love nothing more but to get rid of you and take your share so they can have more for themselves and remove you as a threat. That's why people of a certain income bracket HAVE to hire bodyguards and propertyguards. It's no longer optional. It's mandatory. They lose the freedom to blend with the masses. They must now have people in their lives. Mandatory servants, who could be co-opted and betray them. That's their ""reward"" for success: loss of privacy, and constant paranoia. Also, they better be generous with how they divide the spoils, because they want to stay on good terms with the people in their lives.

But I'm digressing.

It's not ""normal"" to hate an entire class of people, even if it is normalized through the hegemonic process. This young woman, without realizing it, was essentially weaponized against men, just as men were weaponized against her.
It's a game of divide and conquer.

It's not ""normal"" to hate the group of people nature has selected for you to reproduce the species with, who, if you thought about it for a moment, you could come up with some sort of rational collaborative cooperation scheme to make your lives easier.

Some people stay in the hate trap their WHOLE lives. I have seen it. It's not pleasant.

She's either trying to break out of her mental prison, or she's cynically posturing like she is, or her instincts are moving her in that direction, or some combination of the three. Probably a combination.

She's definitely approaching the Wall, and is probably experience an epiphany.
College is toxic. The small, cramped living quarters, the crappy food, the party life-style, the punishing workload if you actually take it seriously, the economic exploitation, the maze of bureaucracy... and you are most likely BORROWING MONEY to be there with NO GUARANTEE that it will pay off.


We're all crawling around in our ""reality tunnels"" where we think we know what's going on based on what we have read and our own personal experience, until something that doesn't fit either bitch-slaps us out of them, into another one.
But yeah, at lot of women I know read this shite, then regurgitate it, but then if you talk about it with them, you can kind of point out the logical holes, and then they are left to ponder.

It's also the same on here. There is the male equivalent of toxic feminism on here, and on other manosphere subs. There are guys that are more moderated and circumspect in their criticisms, and then there are guys who are like, ""they are all witches!"" If you have a run-in with a witch, it makes you distrust other women even more. I mean, people are hard to trust, especially in a society where everyone is brainwashed to prisoner's dilemma choose the instant gratification over the long-term solution that doesn't supply as much short-term dopamine. And then when you had hormones, drugs, shitty food, brainwashing, etc, it's like adding even more fuel to a raging fire.

It seems like she is less ""nuts"" than she was before.

Whether or not that makes her more or less dangerous as a person, and a romantic prospect, is a question that will be decided by men other than myself. : )

""Nuts"" is a gross oversimplification of what is going on. ""Nuts"" puts the onus entirely on the individual. Just like everyone else, she was born embedded into a toxic system that will gradually drive a person crazy. Alienated from the natural world, mandated by her family to do normalized make-work pseudo-educational projects that will somehow magically lead to remuneration, propagandized to fear and hate a whole gender, for crying out loud.

It's not a coincidence that there is a whole lucrative industry of mental health-care professionals feeding off a population of over-worked, over-stressed, over-stimulated, borderline mentally ill people with quack pharmaceutical cures designed to prolong and worsen the conditions they are supposed to be treating.

This is the same system that produces the legions of flabby, pimply, video-game, porn-fap junkies who can't lift a weight. It's a toxic system that preys on people by breaking them, and then offering to sell them fake fixes that never ultimately fix anything. It hopes to extract as much as possible from people before they die.

I often visit this sub, I disagree with any things and agree with others, and I believe it is important to engage with other viewpoints. I expect disagreement in the comments, but no vitriol please.   
  Firstly, and I imagine this will get a lot of hate, but not all women are as bad as many in this sub believe. I know many girls who will only sleep with men when they are in relationships, and who do not practice hypergamy to the extent they will leave as soon as the next best thing comes along. A high profile example of this would be Connor Mcgreggor's wife, who stuck by him when he was a bum. This leads me to ask, where are you meeting these girls? If all of your relationships have come from girls you met in the club or on tinder, *you are a moron.* The girls who jump on your dick after you buy them a cheap drink are not going to be good long term partners. I have a habit of attracting girls like those described on this sub, and every single one has been met in a club. Try meeting girls doing something you enjoy, for example, learn to dance. This means that the girl actually has interests and is not a vacuous bimbo addicted to her phone. A few things to avoid: 

 Never get into a relationship with a girl who cheated on her bf to be with you 

If she flirts outrageously with everyone and 'pulls' guys, drop her, 	she likely has low self esteem and craves attention

 She says she's a feminist

 No 	dad (with caveats)

 She doesn't want to be exclusive

 She wants your phone password. Your phone is your private space, its no different from a diary

 She keeps saying  how loyal she is (hint; she's not)

 You met her in the club or on tinder

 She says she doesn't want children

 She identifies as liberal or progressive

    
  Avoiding girls like this should help you in any ltr goals. Another point is recognising that as a man you have more important things to do than bang girls. 'Enjoying the decline' gets bandied about a lot, but our present situation exists purely because weak men did exactly that. Please, fight for something, even converting your friends from the West's dogma has a measurable effect. Additionally, conservative couples with traditional values will out-breed liberals, in fact the only way the progressive cult can spread is by brainwashing. Don't let this happen to your kids or your friends.   
  Another thing, there seems to be an undercurrent against minorities in this sub, despite the fact they are far more socially conservative than whites. Some of my best friends are minorities. Why? Because they are significantly less likely to believe chopping a male child’s balls off is right. Being at University, it is difficult for me to make genuine friends with middle class whites (like myself) who believe that the wicked white man is the source of societies ills. My working class roots revile it.   
  Finally, I think that while this sub is a good place for frank debate, I don't think the tips are all that useful for a ltr, as they are tailored to pulling bimbos. The last thing I'll add is why the hell is no one signing pre-nups? If she doesn't have access to your stuff after divorce, she is reliant upon you, fulfilling the age old relationship dynamic of Men and Women.

If you've ever wondered why dependable, stable breadwinning men have been devalued in today's society look no further. A family of complete losers magically becomes middle-class thanks to the welfare state. Everyone else turns into tax-paying cuckold servants for Chad and Tyrone's offspring.


The Truth About Income Inequality

The Census Bureau also fails to count $1.9 trillion in annual public transfer payments to American households. The bureau ignores transfer payments from some 95 federal programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps, which make up more than 40% of federal spending, along with dozens of state and local programs. **Government transfers provide 89% of all resources available to the bottom income quintile of households and more than half of the total resources available to the second quintile.**

In all, leaving out taxes and most transfers overstates inequality by more than 300%, as measured by the ratio of the top quintile’s income to the bottom quintile’s. **More than 80% of all taxes are paid by the top two quintiles, and more than 70% of all government transfer payments go to the bottom two quintiles.**

America’s system of data collection is among the most sophisticated in the world, but the Census Bureau’s decision not to count taxes as lost income and transfers as gained income grossly distorts its measure of the income distribution. As a result, the raging national debate over income inequality, the outcome of which could alter the foundations of our economic and political system, is based on faulty information.

The average bottom-quintile household earns only $4,908, while the average top-quintile one earns $295,904, or 60 times as much. But using official government data sources on taxes and all transfer payments to compute net income produces the more complete comparison displayed in the nearby chart.


**The average bottom-quintile household receives $45,389 in government transfers. Private transfers from charitable and family sources provide another $3,313. The average household in the bottom quintile pays $2,709 in taxes, mostly sales, property and excise taxes. The net result is that the average household in the bottom quintile has $50,901 of available resources.**

Government transfers go mostly to low-income households. The average bottom-quintile household and the average second-quintile household receive government transfers of some $17 and $4 respectively for every dollar of taxes they pay. The average middle-income household receives $17,850 in government transfers and pays an almost identical $17,737 in taxes, while the fourth and top quintiles of households receive government transfers of only 29 cents and 6 cents respectively for every dollar paid in taxes. (In the chart, transfers received minus taxes paid are shown as net government transfers for low-income households and net taxes for high income households.)

The average top-quintile household pays on average $109,125 in taxes and is left, after taxes and transfer payments, with only 3.8 times as much as the bottom quintile: $194,906 compared with $50,901. No matter how much income you think government in a free society should redistribute, it is much harder to argue that the bottom quintile is getting too little or the top quintile is getting too much when the ratio of net resources available to them is 3.8 to 1 rather than 60 to 1 (the ratio of what they earn) or the Census number of 17 to 1 (which excludes taxes and most transfers).

Today government redistributes sufficient resources to elevate the average household in the bottom quintile to a net income, after transfers and taxes, of $50,901—well within the range of American middle-class earnings. The average household in the second quintile is only slightly better off than the average bottom-quintile household. The average second-quintile household receives only 9.4% more, even though it earns more than six times as much income, it has more than twice the proportion of its prime working-age individuals employed, and they work twice as many hours a week on average. The average middle-income household is only 32% better off than the average bottom-quintile households despite earning more than 13 times as much, having 2.5 times as many of prime working-age individuals employed and working more than twice as many hours a week.

Antipoverty spending in the past 50 years has not only raised most of the households in the bottom quintile of earners into the middle class, but has also induced many low-income earners to stop working. In 1967, when funding for the War on Poverty started to flow, almost 70% of prime working-age adults in bottom-quintile households were employed. Over the next 50 years, that share fell to 36%. The second quintile, which historically had the highest labor-force participation rate among prime work-age adults, saw its labor-force participation rate fall from 90% to 85%, while the top three income quintiles all increased their work effort.

Any debate about further redistribution of income needs to be tethered to these facts. America already redistributes enough income to compress the income difference between the top and bottom quintiles from 60 to 1 in earned income down to 3.8 to 1 in income received. If 3.8 to 1 is too large an income differential, those who favor more redistribution need to explain to the bottom 60% of income-earning households why they should keep working when they could get almost as much from riding in the wagon as they get now from pulling it.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,The Truth About Income Inequality,0,1572928421.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/drclbl/the_truth_about_income_inequality/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

First post on here wasn’t that long ago.  It’s getting clear to me there are things true about red pill that I can’t deny, at least for nearly all women.  I understand it’s just common sense to put what you find meaningful in your life first, over a love life.  I’m glad I learned that if nothing else.

I’ve also been following mgtow, I understand there is a lot of overlap with mgtow and trp.  I’ve come to understand how dangerous women are.  How quickly they are willing to turn on you, and take everything they can from you.

So one thing I wanted to ask is why.  Why would you still want to engage in a dating strategy when women can just turn right around and cry rape?  This risk/reward looks very bad.  I’ve had several chances at sex, attempts to seduce me, and even if she was hot, I just didn’t think it was worth the risk.  Do people on here get the girl test for STDs, and or have her sign a consent form?  I’m seriously not understanding why you would want to spin plates with how much you could lose.  The unknown of STDs alone is enough for me to not let women seduce me.  Do you have your sexual interactions recorded so she can’t lie about it later?  I’m to where I don’t approach women not because I’m afraid of failing, but succeeding and wishing I hadn’t.  I’m thinking it’s almost worth just suppressing sexual desire back to where it came from, and use that pent up energy to pursue purpose and meaning.  Is part of the most people on trp to just deal with sexual urges?

I’m not here to advertise mgtow, I don’t believe I’ve even posted there.  I’m just wondering where the motivation is for me anymore to date.  Where is it for anyone here?  I’m thinking later in life, one reason I might want to get married, is just to have kids.  I will want that kind of fulfillment in my life.

Let me start by saying that getting laid will help you become happier. However, do not plan on it fixing all of your problems. 

For the past half year Ive put in a ton of effort into learning how to pick up women, Via online/apps and night game. At first, I was getting few matches on dating apps and could not even muster up the courage to talk to a random girl at a bar. Things got way better through lifting and working out, eating healthy, going out every weekend, and optimizing my profile. My match rate on tinder is currently hovering at around 11% (which is pretty high for a guy: tinder will give this data to you on their site). I hooked up with some random girl at a bar. I have a couple of solid ""plates"". I thought all of this would make me happy. It did make me ""happier"", but it did not fix my root problems.

I realized my root problem was more of a lack of belonging in true social circles. Sort of like a frat/brotherhood of male friends. And also not having the most meaningful and social of jobs. Social circle/having a life is heavily connected with game. Sure, I can pick up more women than I ever have before at this point in my life. But my life is also boring and pretty lonely. Women can begin to feel this from you the longer you are around them. This is especially true of higher valued women. 

I would suggest all to take some advice from Jordan Peterson  (and some other guy who I cant remember his name).  JP has a video talking about depression in his patients. He always asks a standard set of 5 questions to them. If any of these 5 things are missing from your life, you are at risk for depression/being unhappy. 1. Do you have a job (or something like school that forces a regular schedule that gives you a purpose, something to do with the majority of your time, something to regulate your circadian rhythms, and something to have goals that contribute to activating goal pursuit emotion systems in your body)? If you do not have this, this absolutely needs to be fixed. 2. Do you have friends? 3. Do you have an intimate relationship?  (this is where being able to pick up women will help you) 4. Do you have decent health? 5. Do you have a drug or alcholol problem? If you have 3 of these problems, overcoming depression will be nearly impossible. if You have 1-2 of these problems, you can become happy, but its still likely that at least one of them will bring you down when other things are going well. 

This was the case for me. After spending a ton of time trying to get better at the dating game, I finally feel competent/abundance. However, my lack of a true social circle like I had back in high school and college does not exist (number 2 on the list). This in part came from moving around a bunch for work. Its a problem, and until that gets fixed, Ill continue to get random bouts of depression which will bring me down in other parts of my life (work, school, dating,etc)

The plan to fix this problem came from some other guy that I cant remember. But its basically this: Pick 2-3 social hobbies/activities outside of work. Become extremely active members in them. Over time you will develop at least some friends from these activities and is your best shot at developing a true social circle. And Im not talking a friend here and a friend there (which I currently have). Im talking a true brotherhood/social group that many of us are missing in our current lives that is causing unhappiness for a lot of men out there.

I just wanted to put this out here for guys who are struggling to not solely focus on getting laid as your only source of worth and happiness.

A lot of time there is a strong emphasis put onto how much the poster doesn't care about the act. Common phases such as **I have more plates and didn't care about this one, I can get another one whenever I want, I'm not attached to this one girl \*BUT\*, I felt nothing leaving, etc.** The common threads meant to put emphasis on how much they were not attached to this single girl. However you read their post and their words do not align with their actions. Their post are filled with **anger, outcome dependence, rationalizing, ego protection, etc.** All things that reveal the true feelings behind their actions.  


I point this out not to insult as we have all been this men at some point but I think there is a strong lesson in introspection to be learned here. You can lie to the internet **but you can never lie to yourself.** Deep down you know the truth of these matters to yourself and despite trying to hide **they will always come to the surface** if you want them to or not. It is far better to be honest with yourself and with others as truth is where the growth will be found. What benefit is there to be found in trying to be tough in front of complete and total strangers that you will probably never meet?  


This also reveals an issue in congruence. If your words and actions don't align in one aspect they probably don't in most aspect. So while you think you're being indifferent, hiding your true emotions, being outcome independent, the fact that you go out of your way **to seek validation from complete and total strangers on the internet,** one can only assume that might be something to second guess.

She is attractive but not a supermodel by any means. She's also  in her 30's. I wake up plenty of days to breakfast and coffee waiting  for me. She is thoughtful and goes out of her way for me. She isn't a  selfish person. She also has a lot more money than I do and is very  generous. She has a loving, nurturing type of personality. Even still,  my foundation is rock solid and I know if she walked away tomorrow, I'd  be fine and would not have a problem finding a new girlfriend  or just a  fwb in no time.

The  problem I'm dealing with right now is my girlfriend has all but lost  her sex drive. It's an odd situation to find myself in. I have a very  high sex drive. I want sex all the time. Where as she is fine not having  sex at all. We've been together years and have had periods of not  having sex for over two months at a time. It wasn't always this way. We  talk openly about it. Frankly she says she doesn't know what her problem  is. She's gone to the doctor. She's tried switching birth controls.  She's tried going off birth control. She's tried the IUD which was a  nightmare for her. Things have steadily gotten worse since the IUD  because of how painful it was for her. Since having that removed, she  often complains of pain when we do have sex. I think it traumatized her.  Now when we have sex, she says my penis is too big for her and it is  very painful. Like to the point where she is either holding back tears  or just outright crying. In the last couple months, we've averaged  having sex once a month. The last time we had sex, we had to use lube. I  never used lube in life with anyone before.

Meanwhile,  I am getting pressure every time I see her family about us not being  engaged. With all the risks of marriage, she might be one of the very  few worth settling down with but how do I tell her family we're not  engaged because she has no sex drive?

I  will say this, our careers were very stressful for a while. Things are  settling down career wise so the stress levels have stabilized over the  last six months to a year. I know this took a toll on me and I am sure  it took a toll on her as well. The only time I ever felt like a beta was  when I'd find myself complaining to her about my work or someone in the  office. Looking back I worry that might have turned her off a little  because it was the only time I showed weakness. However, this was over a  year ago and I've since quit that job and now am on a much better path.  She hasn't heard me complain about work or anything like that in at  least nine months. That said, she was also having stress from her job.  The commute only made it worse for her. She very recently switched jobs  to a new firm that is a shorter commute and even more money.

So  anyway, I'm looking for advice on how to handle this situation. Do I  break up or try to hold on longer and see if her sex drive improves?  Again, not so much that I'm worried about standing on my own again, just  dealing with her low sex drive is not fun. It is a big sacrifice on my  part.

Then you lose it in spring when is rolls forward. You only gain if the clocks rolled back and never rolled forward in the future. So all in all, this shit just evens itself out. And to top it off, most are saying “gain an extra hour of sleep” in which that mindset you’re digging yourself in a deep hole. 

This post isn’t about the stupid ass clocks rolling back or forward, it’s about the mindset in today’s Society when today everyone is thinking “we gain today” (only to bitch in the spring). This post is a CLEAR example of a real life demonstration of dividends &amp; debt. 

Now everything you do in life has dividends and debt. Eat Broccoli, on your way to six pack abs. Eat a doughnut, on your way to a doughnut shape body. The broccoli is a dividend to the longevity of your health. The doughnut is the debt. 

Hour in the gym. Dividends to muscle. Hour in gaming. Debt for your mental health. Of course not one doughnut or just one hour of gaming doesn’t instantly makes you a 40 year old dude, fat neck beard, living in his moms basement, working part time at the local 7/11- broke incel... But years of just doing that will. Maybe not 5 years, maybe not even 10 but soon after you will get there. 

But what happens on the flipside? Minimum 5 hours a week at the gym. Or a high protein and vegetable diet and not a high carbohydrates salt &amp; sugar. Working hard at work, trying to figure out difficult task and not trying to just disregard it and push it to the side. 

What happens later in life you’re presented 2 types of males. One that has his shit together, the other one not. One that’s donating money, the other one asking for money. The one that runs 5ks on weekends, the other one that can’t get out of bed until 2pm. One that can handle many different types of females and doesn’t get butt hurt during a break up, the other watches anime porn.

If your mother has divorced your father as mine did, and if you are told stories that sound like fables of a person you have ever known. Or you see that when threatened and now needing to part ways from the bond of marriage - breaking the family apart, that it is a nasty divorce, and power you never knew was underlying is unleashed and you see a different person than just you mother - Then she is CAPABLE of doing it to you.

I am southern European, and I am engaged to a girl from the north of Europe. We have been together for around 5 years, and she is now 24 years old.

When I met her I was completely redpill. I was spinning plates with 3-4 girls at the same time, and one day in a club I saw her...she felt in love with me fairly quicky and soon we started dating each other. She was tall, blonde, kind, sensitive...soon I stopped spinning plates and started a long term relation with her alone since she was perfect for me. I was also tall, tanned, really fit, been training for 10 years, I was I think also a top guy. Furthermore I had a good job, a nice cabrio car, a ducati motorcycle...

I know that according to redpill my first mistake was stopping spinning plates, since she was now my best and only option.

We started seeing each other every week, and started travelling together. Soon we visited most of Spain, and also travelled to the UK, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Morocco...

During the last 4 years we shared everything and did everything together. She loved me deeply, and I know that because she was always sending me letters, and proving me that she was still in love.We then got engaged...I always knew that she loved Italy and I decided to organise a trip where we got engaged in Verona, the city of Romeo and Juliet. Everything was perfect, we had each other and loved it all together.

However, after finished her studies she got a job offer in her home country. Since I was working home office, I had the chance to move there too, and decided to give it a go. Moving there was not easy for me, a new language, environment, leaving all my family and friend behind...we I loved her, she loved me and we were going to marry and stay forever together, or so I though.

According to my old redpill me, this was my second mistake. I was putting myself in a position of weakness, a position where I was going to lose frame. By this time its been a long time since the last time i spinned plates, and I was now out of my environment, in a strange country were I didn't know anyone and I didn't speak the language, relying on her for a lot of basic things. I know according to redpill is a huge redlight too. I went from a top guy to a guy that couldn't even do the shopping by himself. Tha also depressed me and my actitude and frame started to got weaker.

Soon after moving there, she started behaving colder. And now, recently, she has been telling me that she doesn't feel the same way anymore...she is not happy with me and doesn't see me with the same ayes as before. My old redpill mind tells me that I completely let my guard down. I went to a place where I was weak, without power, without frame and where I was not so happy neither, and I felt out of position. She probably went from seeing me as her rock, as the man who knows how to have fun and how to do everything to a boy...

At this point my relation is probably not fixable, but I would still love to heard some advises. I feel that redpill is still true, but on the other hand what hurts me the most is not only loosing her, but knowing that if redpill is true I will never be able to have an honest relation. Its impossible to live long time with someone and not to lose frame ever, its impossible to spinn plates for ever...its impossible to be always a rock, to be always able to walks away...I am human and I cant pretend to be what I am not for such a long time, neither do I want to.

The hard truth is that I still love her, I feel sad about all our memories, knowing that after all the things we did at the end it didn't matter and we must part completely different ways. As a redpiller I was successful with girls, and I could go back to that again...but the idea of going back to those fake relationships its not appealing neither.

Any video on gender and relationships, or even bringing up your kids will make it look like gender is all about roleplay and choreplay and careerplay, and that somehow if you changed the roles, you've conquered biology.

Nope, this is about what you ARE and how you relate with each other - this is entirely about what energy, what kind of consciousness you are putting out - this is physical, emotional and mental. What you do, that comes a very long way down the road, and it is a consequence of what energy you generate, and what decisions you choose to make come first. Not the other way round. 

**Roles and jobs are skills that anyone can learn and master, so acquired skills are fundamentally a very poor way to try and understand masculine and feminine.**

Relationships at the seduction stage are entirely about masculine and feminine qualities - your sexual instincts do not know what chores and careers are. This has become obvious when social conditioning is no longer a factor. We tend to correlate who people are with what they do, which works well for roleplay, but beyond that it can be misleading.

Alpha vs. beta, while we generally think of hit in terms of ""sexy guy"" vs ""provider guy"", is a way of looking at men in terms of what masculine energy they output regardless of what job they actually do. 

Now I know what you're going to say ""But look at the military or construction or sports or the top of the ladder. There are unique gender dominated roles"". True, but this again is a product of masculine and feminine consciousness - the consciousness dictates the roles, not the other way around. If you've ever seen any Navy Seal Book or read the story of anyone who made it up there, you'll know that getting there is entirely about who they are first.

You intelligence might not get this at first, especially if you're in the deep blue end of the pool, have just been kicked by life in the butt and can't yet figure out what went wrong. But your emotions and body absolutely know what I mean, fortunately they can't be fooled by all the shit people hamster to each other. And so you will see people regardless of what they think a man should be, always gravitate to the guy who puts out the most masculine energy in the room. The ""nice"" guy who only knows roleplay will usually be used as the errand boy, and later he gets married and becomes his wife's butt monkey down the road. 

Going from BP to RP isn't changing 'roles' - it's a fundamental shift in consciousness, your mentality, your body, your beliefs that shape your frame and discovering what masculine energy is really about. The same thing done by a high SMV man can stoke reactions in others that cannot be achieved by a low SMV man. 

Any role / career changes are a natural consequence of this new you.

A siren to whisper sweet nothings in your ear. Maybe you’re just trying to fill a void in yourself that was absent in your childhood. None of these are bad, but how you go about fixing them can be.

Right now, you are **highly invested** in a girl, but you’re not showing it yet. You’re playing the cool, aloof guy. It’s all an act. The moment you show your cards, your relationship with her will crash and burn. Your **needy** tendencies will **resurface**, and you will depend on her to give you affection - to treat you like a child! A woman cannot raise a grown man, son!

I’m sorry, but a woman will **never love you the same way** that you will love her. They can only honor and respect you. *Psh*! Our job as a man in a marriage/relationship is a tough one. But it can be rewarding!

You’re much too hard on yourself, and to think it is to become it. 

Yeah, kid, approach anxiety is a mother fucker. It's not an on/off switch. You gotta build that rejection muscle.

Tell yourself this:

“*I am \_\_\_\_. I am good enough. What ever I am going through, I will push forward.”*

*“If she rejects me, she rejects me. But I did it because I fucking wanted to, and I was fucking brave!”*

It’s OK to be fucking scared! You want to make a move on that girl!? Go fucking do it you pansy! You’ll never move forward if you’re staying in the same place. Put one foot in front of the other and keep walking. Walk like it’s the path of no return! Walk toward your prey! Your insides, your paranoia is screaming at you to stop. Do fucking listen to it.

My ex broke up with me back in May, and it devastated me. That’s when I found the Red Pill, and started working on fixing myself. I applied for a job at the fire department in my city, something I’ve wanted to do for a long time, and started working out frequently. I start at the academy in February. I’m already in much better physical shape than I’m used to, and even have a couple plates already. She texted me about a month ago trying to start a friendship, I told her I wasn’t interested in anything but a relationship. She of course said no but continued to text me anyway, so I texted back very sporadically (maybe once every 3 or 4 days, and always very short, somewhat condescending responses, as if I were talking to a child). I felt pretty good, since she was still texting me a lot even though she was getting little to nothing in return. But then she texted me two days ago.

“It's been bothering me because sometimes when you text I'm over at my boyfriend's and I feel disloyal. So you're welcome to text anytime and I always have fun talking to you, I just want you to know so shit doesn't go down.”

I was devastated. Not because she has a new boyfriend though. I expected that. She and I aren’t in an exclusive ltr anymore, so she can date whoever she wants. What really hurt me was the fact that when she and I were together, she would constantly be talking to her ex. He even drove down to visit her at her university and spent the night in her dorm with her, and she only called me to tell me about it once he was there in the dorm with her and it was “too late for him to drive back home”.

She wanted to get one last good punch in. So I waited two days just to make sure she thought I didn’t care. I even went and had sex with one of my plates only a few short hours after reading the text. It didn’t help me feel better, but whatever. Today I finally responded “aw, ok buddy”. I wanted to be as uncaring as possible while still being extremely patronizing/condescending. She immediately responded with

“So patronizing”
“But it makes me so glad that we're ok because I was feeling pretty awkward about the whole thing”

I’m not going to respond. There’s nothing to say to that anyway. But I feel like I handled this well. I’m still really angry and hurt, and I don’t know how to get over it.

## Yes, all of them.

Yes, even your mother.   Definitely your sister; I can vouch for her personally.  Your granny.  Oh yeah, that tawdry little scamp.  Men still talk about her oral skills.  Your touchy aunt?  Charges by the quarter-hour.  That sweet little vixen in your college economics class that you tug it out to late at night because you don’t possess the sack to even talk to her?  W-H-O-R-E and she loves it.  Every one of them.  All certified, 100% grade-A (A for anal) whores.

We can talk about how sex is transactional.  We can talk about how women use their [fish holes](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/red-snapper) as ATMs when it suits their wants or needs.  We can talk about how women manipulate men with sex.  Blah blah.  You’ll get angry about it.  Bloopers will recoil in horror because I called their mothers whores.  Incels will twirl their nipples in delight that maybe, just maybe, they have won the game.  You’all are completely missing the point of why I said it.

Does your mother and sister explicitly take cash or goods for access to their pussies?  Statistically, probably not.  But if you cannot even consider uncomfortable ideas said with harsh words, then why the fuck are you here?  

I’m not making a moral judgment about women that take pay for tang.  Hell, good for them.  Like I said, they have an ATM installed between their legs and men will give them top dollar just to flop around on them for a little while.  Damn.  I wish I had an orifice like that too (insert butt joke here).   Good for you ladies; use it wisely is all I have to say about it.  But men?  You’re fucking idiots.  You will pay top dollar to flop around on them for a little while.   I called your mother a whore because you are more than willing to fuck someone else’s mother like a whore.

We talk about how to get the same testicular relief without having to pay top dollar.  And you just keep trying to find new ways to pay for whores.

&gt; Dear Max, my LTR of five years has been disrespecting me lately.  How do I MAKE her respect me.

She’s a whore, dumbass.


&gt; Dear Max, this chick in my church group makes my peepee stiff when I’m within 50 feet of her.  How do I make her touch it?

&gt; Dear Max, I’m really sad about this bird that once gave me a very drunk handy and then won’t talk to me again.  How do I get her to be my one true love?

She’s a whore, dumbass.


&gt; Dear Max, my wife refuses to put her mouth on my wrinkled, unwashed penis unless it’s my birthday.  What do I have to do to make her my twice-daily cum slut?

She’s a whore, dumbass.


## But what I’m doing wrong Max?

Fucking everything.  You tradcon cuck-el-fucks want to use my new world to fix your fucked up old world.  Kindly piss off.   You come here asking me how to fix your girlfriend.  You come here asking me how to fix your wife.  You come here asking me how to use old world rules, like dating rituals, promise rings and sexual fidelity to secure your access to occasional ass.  I keep telling you to keep multiple women in rotation.  I keep telling you to make you the prize that they pay for access.  I keep telling you to avoid marriage and all the trappings of the beta world female trap.  You don’t listen.

You just keep treating women like whores.  And you keep asking me how to improve on this.

## But I like whores.

Who wouldn’t?  Put a quarter in the machine and out comes your jizz.  If you still think I’m talking about sex workers, you’re a fucking idiot.  For the record, I fully support a woman’s choice to directly trade sex for cash or goods and do not judge them for it.   I understand that it isn’t for everyone and some are in a bad place.  It’s a shitty world.  However there are plenty that enjoy their career and make good money doing it.  Good for them.  We aren’t talking about them.  We are talking about your whore mother.

The real problem here isn’t you finding a quick and/or formulaic way to blow a load inside a woman.  That sounds like fun.  It’s where you go with it.  It starts off cute, but then you start dreaming of picket fences and what you’d like to do to June Cleaver after the camera stops rolling.  (Oh yeah, she’s definitely a whore.) You start structuring your life around this fantasy. You wish you can have one regular on-tap snatch, ever eager and willing, and [you can stop worrying about landing snatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KzCfIYArmQ).  You start making excuses for your blue pill dreams and you come to me to grant you forgiveness.

I personally don’t give a shit if you marry a unicorn which eventually shoves its horn up your ass in divorce court.  Your life; your choices.   But you aren’t getting my permission for it either.

## Not your personal army.

But you aren’t the worst I see.  Oh no.   At least you and your whore are just about you and your whore.  You aren’t dragging me into this shitshow.  The big problem is the sea of fuckheads that want to somehow rewind the clock and return to the Blue Pill Utopia they see as middle century America.  

House.  One car garage.  Thin, well kept wifey that is a dutiful sex nymph on demand.  Two crotch fruit and a dog.  Wifey?  Literally the Uber-Whore of whores.  Oh yeah, ever dime she gets is in direct correlation to her time spent on her back after the kids go to bed (and wonder why you are making those weird grunting noises behind the bedroom door).  Living the dream.

Nice dream right?  Well, to get it you want me to fight a culture war for you.  You want me to overturn my life, risk my position and risk my actual body to recreate to make it happen.  You come to this sub bitching about how women need to be put in their place and cheering on tradcucks like [Jordan Petercuck](https://www.your.md/condition/penis-health-how-to-wash-a-penis/) who champions this dream of yours.  

## My response?  Fuck you.  I like now.

In this day and age you can have a selection of women that want to spend little pockets of (naked) time with you just because it makes them feel good.  You can have this at no cost.  Wow.  How awesome is that?  Yet many of you are desperate for *A* (whore) girlfriend and can’t comprehend why you should keep plates in rotation.  You want to foul my world (free range pussy) with your world (whores) and you want me to make it happen.  Fuck you.   I don’t give a shit if you can’t get sex.  That’s not my problem.   That’s not your whore mother’s problem.  That is your problem.  

It has never been a better time in modern history for a man my age in my position to get my dick wet by a variety of young, sexy women.  You can join me in this club, but you need to do a few things; we talk about them all in the sidebar over there.  -—&gt;. Good stuff.  Ultimately though none of it matters if you keep trying to trap and/or pay women for sex, all while keeping gentle blooper sensibilities.

So give it a try.  Break out of those sensibilities.  Join me.  Say it out loud and be proud of it.  Ready?  Repeat after me:

&gt; My mother is a whore.  My sweetie girlfriend is a whore.  All women are whores.  I said a mean word but I don’t give a fuck because I’m saying it for my purposes, not for anyone else.  Now I need to stop being such a mincing fruitcake and learn how to fuck.

## But let’s not forget about the women (whores)!

While everyone is prone to this thinking, it’s pretty obvious that the incels are the most desperate to turn back the clock and secure a dutiful (whore) wifey.  They see it as the ONLY way to get their dick touched.  Whatever.  I think they are wrong, but I just don’t care.  I find more interesting their opposite numbers in the femtard world.  I have a much larger essay I will eventually post on this topic (it will be a while), but I want to touch on the point now.  

There is a large number of women (whores) that expect us to protect them from these incels who want to turn back the clock.  

Not your personal army, cupcake.  I will neither fight again or fight for the current society.  I’m a sidelined non-combatant just enjoying my time with a wet dick.  You keep isolating them.  You keep vilifying them.  You keep literally turning them into an angry army.   You have fun with that.   If you use your pussy enough, maybe you’ll con some men into fighting for you.  There is no profit for me in taking a side here—I find both equally repugnant and against my prerogatives.  And I already have the pussy.

They are able to instinctively pick up how invested a man is or where they stand with him. They seem to know how much to give and when to pull back. This is because for many, many years, emotionally manipulating men was absolutely essential for their survival. They didn't possess the brute strength of the male to protect and provide for themselves, their survival depended on their ability to sway and manipulate men to fulfill their needs and wants. The better they were at understanding men, the better their chances of surviving.

Men on the other hand, tend to be terrible at reading women. They didn't need to manipulate or sway women for their survival, they could generally survive on their own simply by co operating with the other men. This means that men tend to be far worse at knowing where they stand with their women and they often don't know how much to give. More often than not they're completely blindsided when their encounters with women blow up and fall apart. For women it's intrinsic, for men, it's a skill that needs to be learned and harnessed.

The first step most take as an early Red Piller is defense mechanisms. Learning to recognize potentially harmful behaviors and react. Like if she want's to go with her slutty friends to Europe for the summer you inform her that that will be the end of your relationship. This is a useful tool to learn, it helps you avoid situations where you later find out she was blowing Chad and his buddies in his lowered Nissan Skyline, but it's not where it ends. Defense mechanisms are simply treating the symptoms, they are not designed to treat the disease.

If your woman is talking to you about going to Europe with her friends, the problem is not going to Europe, the problem is that **she even wants** to go to Europe. It's indicative that ""girls party time"" is more important to her than the sanctity of her relationship. Women who are smitten with their men don't want to go to on trips with their hoe friends, they don't want to go on coffee dates with ""hes just a guy friend"", they avoid those situations all on their own because they don't want to risk losing the what they've got.

You telling her that you'll end it if she goes doesn't mean that she didn't want to go and a similar problem will manifest in a different way soon after. This is because you're not in control, you're doing damage control. You're not dictating the frame, you're reacting to it. Had you been more in tune with her behavior and better at reading it, you would have noticed the signs long before. You would have reacted and she would never get to the point where she's coming to you with ridiculous requests.

**How do you know? What do you look for?**

First you need to establish a baseline dynamic between you two. It can be whatever you want, but male-female relationships function best with masculine dominance and feminine submission. I like mine where she's sweet and submissive. She messages first, she does cute little things for me, cleans my place, fucks me like an animal and doesn't go out to places she knows could be compromising. She cock blocks other dudes herself and always respects me, no bitchiness allowed. That is my baseline, it's how things always are. From there on out it's simply maintaining that baseline with a healthy amount of subtle dread, like keeping up my appearance, my career, social life and generally not falling into beta bitch habits(If you are unaware of how to establish a dominant baseline, you should only be focusing on gaining experience).

The signs that tell me that things are veering off path is when there are deviations from that baseline. A women's behavior is a projection of her internal state,  if her behavior is changing, it's early signs that her feelings are changing. If you notice she's not messaging as much, or she's being less sweet, she's being more bold and bitchy or the biggest most obvious tell-tale sign with women, when shes not as keen sexually, then it's an alarm bell and you need to take back control. It's a clear sign that she is getting too comfortable and comfort kills attraction.

The simple fix is to change gears from subtle dread to direct dread. Withdraw attention from her, communicate less, be less affectionate, talk to other girls directly. Due to women's heightened ability to read male behavior she'll quickly pick up that her behavior is yielding a negative response from you, pushing you away and reducing your interest. This will spark tension and competition anxiety as the prospect of losing you dawns on her. She'll then adjust her behavior back to what works and you'll be back at your baseline. Continue this for as long as you want the relationship to last. Notice the changes, react, back to baseline.

This allows you to consistently dictate the frame of the relationship. It allows you to establish the baseline you desire and maintain it. You're not allowing small symptoms to fester into monumental shit test like hoe trips with the girls or coffee dates with Barry. You're being proactive and nipping it in the bud to give your self the interactions with women you desire.

Women have overwhelming support for their problems. If they complain enough, everything will be taken care of for them. Men, on the other hand, have almost none.

I had a hunch, so I did some digging on past winners (1986-2019) and found the following:

* Average age of man at time of voting: 40
* Youngest: 29
* Oldest: 60 

I wanted to find comparison for women, which (believe it or not) was trickier. It didn't seem fair to use something like SI or Playboy cover models, since that's much more one-dimensional and often serves as a model's first introduction to pop-culture. 

Esquire used to do a similar yearly feature, but it only ran from 2004-2015. FHM (UK) had probably the best analogue, but it too was limited (1995-2017). 

*Digression: there's probably a lot to be said about the current climate, in light of the fact that both of these publications have ended these yearly features. Even SI Swimsuit has opted for nostalgia and political statements in recent years. I will not be saying any of those things here.* 

Fortunately, both the Esquire and FHM lists share the same ""max"" data point (Halle Berry, though in differing years), so we can just use FHM for comparison's sake:

* Average age of woman at time of voting: 27
* Youngest: 22
* Oldest: 37

Take what you will from this. But for young guys who are just now unplugging, finishing an education, starting a career, still needing to lift... take solace in the fact that time is not *your* enemy.

Feel free to criticize it too..

Background : I am a 5 ft 5 inches tall,25 years old brown Indian guy who went from being a blue pilled cuck to getting laid with 50+ girls. Been a lurker on this sub since 2016. Today, I decided that I need to let out my story to everyone and how my life changed.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's go back to 2009. 10 YEARS BACK. All the girls used to reject me because I was short. I am good looking but I was short according to them. I never gave a fuck. But I was blue pilled due being exposed to Bollywood and the soulmate connection culture that Indians are born in. END RESULT : VIRGIN  


2011(BLUE PILLED BETA ME) :

&amp;#x200B;

 I had a crush in High school(HB 8.5), she was 2 years younger than me. She was way out of my league and there was no way for me to get her. She was the best looking girl in her grade amongst 150 girls aprrox. Far taller and better guys were there for her.   
March 2011 : She opens a Facebook account. I send her a request, we begin talking. I ask for her number. She denies. I get angry. She eventually gives me her number. She has a boyfriend. She says I am an elder brother to her.  
April 2011: We start talking over the phone everyday from 12 am at night till 6 am in the morning. Every fucking day. She still has a boyfriend, but now I am her best friend.  
May 2011: She breaks up with her boyfriend. I get mad and stop talking to her.  
June 2011: Contact resumes. Night calls resumes. I keep telling her how much I love her. She says she sees me as a friend.  
I keep on doing it.  
15th August 2011(4:15am at night) : after refusing me for like the 1000th time, I don't know what happens to her. She proposes me on her own and we become a couple.

Honeymoon phase. We makeout and everything. But I never spend any money on her. She brought me expensive gifts. Even when I was blue pilled, I knew never to spend any money on a girl and always make her spend money on you. She even said that she would pay for booking a hotel room for sex. I refused. I was a nice guy who didn't want to have sex before marriage. (YEAH I KNOW I AM AN IDIOT). I loved her like anything. She meant the whole world to me. My entire dreams and future revolved around her. She was a childhood crush who was finally my girlfriend. It was like Clark Kent getting the woman of his dreams.

&amp;#x200B;

11th November 2011: She tells that her parents saw our sex chat messages and they are angry with her. She says she is not going to break up with me and will continue the relationship after our exam ends in March. She was like an addiction to me. All of a sudden no contact. I went through PTSD. I had no clue what is going on. I was so depressed. I wouldn't eat for days, would cry all night until it was morning and I couldnt cry anymore. My life was a living hell. I was in love with the person I thought she was.  


21st December 2011: We have like a winter party in school. I see her roaming with her ex and holding hands. I get mad. I call her out for it. She just ignored me and went away.  


From November 2011 to February 2012, I would send her multiple essays of texts every hour, call her like 30-40 times, no response. I had no idea what happened.

Suddenly on February 28th, 2012 at 2 am, she texts me and starts abusing me. Calls me short and tells me her family would never accept me because they are all tall people. That I have used her money and what not. I had no clue for what I deserved such abuse.I beg her to talk to me. I just wanted to know what the fuck happened. I never got an answer.  


26th April,2012: I see on facebook that she is in a relationship with another guy. I realised that this person is a whore and this is not the same person whom I loved or I thought she was and moved on. I stop contacting her. I have no clue what the hell happened since November 2011.  


July 2012 : All of a sudden she calls me at 2 am and says she wants to talk to me and asks me to explain why I behaved rudely with her in December 2011. She says she misses me, her ""bestfriend"" and she wants me back. She keeps texting me and disturbing me for two more days until I decide enough is enough and go to meet her parents and the matter ends there. People change and that's the biggest lesson I learnt.  


Lesson 1 : Never put yourself on a pedestal.

A few seniors of mine explained why we love others. It is because we want them to love us back. We want our love to be reciprocated. Otherwise, we could be happy by loving them from far away.  


2013-2014 go by, I became a professional fashion photographer. Plenty of offers to do even nude shoots. But I had my policy. I would never date/bang any girl I know from photography. Integrity is the most important thing to me. After that school incident. My policy became, I will never date any girl from school/work/college.  


Mid 2013, I read two books - The tao of sexual dating for men, The dating black book. It made me aware of PUA techniques. By 2014 I had girls who are 5'7-5'9 and HB7-8 proposing me and these were friends. I rejected them. By 2015 I had done it with almost 20+ girls. Now mind it, my numbers game is way off the roof. I probably talked to more than 500 girls at that time and those were the ultimate converts. I didn't become friendzoned anymore. I used to friendzone girls. I had a girl who is 5'8 propose me for almost 2 months before I blocked her. I wasn't just into her. I gave various excuses like ""I am short"", ""I am ugly"", ""I am gay"", but these girls wouldn't simply get off my hook. I couldn't understand why they were so attracted to me.  


In 2016 during my youtube career, I discovered reddit and ultimately redpill. After learning and re-learning those techniques and understanding what frame is. I became a master manipulator. I had three different girfriends in December 2017 itself. 1st one was so desperate to get fucked by me, that she begged me to fuck her during her periods.

My online texting game and social media accounts(Facebook:Over 1000 likes on a single profile picture) are top notch popular. Picking up girls was easy as pie. I would simply text with a girl overnight and she would come to meet me the next day and we made out and had sex on the second day and by the third day it was over. I always keep my relationships supershort(less than a week). Always put your plates back in shelf before it breaks. Keep Spinning.

Even I had a girl, who had a boyfriend, all it took was me being in frame for a couple of hours and overnight she came to my place the next day. She was texting her boyfriend while I was banging her. It was all magic. I am eternally grateful to what Redpill has taught me and I hope to read this subreddit everyday for the rest of my life.  


2019: I have german,polish,american,latino and all other girls going gaga over me. If you want to see, I can mail you screenshots. Just DM me. I have mastered psychology and frame. But I am wise enough to know that you might do everything right and it still might not work. It's just a numbers game just like sales.  


Do I do No Fap? NO.  
Why not?  
Because, I believe in partly redpill and partly MGTOW and try to take the best of both worlds.  
When I need to study or work on special projects(Computer Science students). I don't like to waste my time, energy and mental efforts picking up woman after 16 hour workdays. I can just watch porn once a day and release my sexual energy. I don't become an addict. Addiction is bad.  


Moral of the story : If a 5'5 Gay brown ugly midget can bang way taller hot chicks from all over the world, then you can too. Stop being completely blackpilled. With your hard work and efforts you can bang any tier woman. All you need is the burning desire. Remember, it's all about Frame and a woman will always fuck a man with a stronger frame than her's. Also, AWALT and NEVER PUT ANY WOMAN ON A PEDESTAL. I hope this post inspires you to go out there and embark on your own journey and become the MAN you want to me. If you want any proof of banging chicks or my Social proof, feel free to DM me. Also remember, She is not yours, it's just your turn. You might do everything right and it still might not work out. Move on to the next.

They like fear, crowd psychology and people easily manipulated. They also like setting up opposing teams like feminist vs. MRAs and RP, so we focus on bickering and stay divided and distracted. But without challenging team-to-team at a large scale, there is no national dialogue. 

Unfortunately no one wants to hear MRA talking points (even though I generally agree with them.) RP doesn't have to, or try to dictate policy, it's more about improvement and understanding on a personal level. I still feel a moral obligation to speak up on behalf of my country and fellow humans.

It's a gross misunderstanding that RP aims to exploit women and reduce their happiness. There are certainly some extreme PUA types selfishly doing a lot of damage and using RP as an excuse. But the real meat of it (my version at least) is not fucking around like a sleazeball. It's about men and women finding a more natural equilibrium instead of fighting over a failed and forced philosophy.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,"Thoughts on ""RP vs. feminism""",0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dvscvb/thoughts_on_rp_vs_feminism/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

A common male archetype of guys who comes here to solve his sexual problem: the nerd. The nerd has no friends, get bullied a lot and went out to escape on video games, underground music, movies, anime, RPG and imageboards. It’s the guy who desperately wants to have people around him who enjoys his hobbies but he can only find them at the internet. He also desperately desires that one girl who is just like him and will save him from this miserable existence, giving his life some purpose. The dream girl most likely resemble some female character he likes with the bonus of having the same tastes as him. It’s a dream come true.

So, this was basically me for most of my life. In my teenage years, I used to do martial arts and there was this common girl that was the typical teenager hitting puberty. It sounds creepy coming from an old guy but something I remember quite fondly was seeing female colleagues turning into women, their bodies transforming and my hormones going wild with that scene.

She was deeply in love with me back then (I was 16) and we kissed for the first time. It was great and all but I didn’t liked her. She didn’t had a pretty face but was turning into a really hot girl.

So you may think “this is awesome, isn’t being with a hot girl the whole point?”. Yes... except that she wasn’t the nerd girl I really wanted to get with.

You see, back then that attitude of indifference had put me into a position that made her desire me for years to come. Also, that same attitude made me lose a really good opportunity to lose my virginity since she asked to date me the next year, which I refused. With a broken heart, she also didn’t wanted to come to my place that same day and I didn’t tried doing anything like that later on, basically ghosting her until I moved out of town to go to college at 18yo.

In college, I developed a whole bunch of oneitis. Since I was just a depressed and weird nerd virgin, my sniper mentality of having one girl at my mind made me wait for the right opportunity, to be the creep who sends message everyday and to be a doormat. Then, they would either give up and date another guy, tell me to fuck off or just disappear one day. My desperation grew each day. I drank and smoked a lot, had physical chest pain and stayed at my room doing anything to deal with the crippling depression. My grades were shit and would get me out of university a few years later.

That was until I finally met some fat 3/10 virgin girl at 20yo and started dating her because I thought “my standards were too high”. She also made me wait 4 months so we could fuck the first time (imagine the desperation). I would only found TRP 7 years later, with a big baggage of fuck ups.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gentlemen, as you have guessed, not only having oneitis will make you lose good opportunities but it will also make you lose the girls you actually want and settle for just about anything that will open the legs for you. And even if you meet the girls who maybe fit the “dream girl” criteria, your lack of experience and desperation will scare them away, making the outcome way worse than what you would desire.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of very interesting things happened

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre Selection**

The presenter used this simple idea to explain how pre-selection made a guy more attractive, using these 3 Facebook photos

1. Guy by himself
2. Guy with a bunch of guys
3. Guy with a bunch of girls

He then asked the room which guy was the most attractive, response was mixed. Then he revealed the answer was 3) and there was a literal audible collective gasp of disbelief from the gals in the crowd. He then singled out a few and asked them why. He let them point and sputter and rationalize for a bit and then asked point blank ""but is he attractive?"" and the answer was universally ""Yes, but"" que more rationalizing

The Hamster is the truly the strongest unstoppable force in the world ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

&amp;#x200B;

**Hard to Get**

The presenter offered a scenario where a guy asked a girl out, she's keen but can react in either of these 2 ways

1. Yes!
2. Umm ah, I don't know, let me check my schedule and get back to you, let's see

He then asked what was the correct response and guess who in the room was the only person who said 1)

And they wonder why they get ghosted or soft nexted....oh wait, nobody is going to soft next them because that's not how things work here

I didn’t link it because TRP usually removes the post whenever I try. But, here is the post copied line by line from relationship advice:


On Saturday night my (37M) wife (33F), sister (32F) and my mother (59F) joined me for a Veterans Day-related event at a local hotel.

There my wife randomly ran into a former co-worker named John (30-something male), and they spent a good chunk of the evening catching up. He basically kept coming over to our table and kept saying how thrilled he was to see her. At one point she went to the ladies room with my sister, but ended up staying with him at another table.
She was never really far from me, and I didn't think much of it, but I did notice she was drinking a lot more than usual, considering we rarely drink.

The event ended around midnight and most people had cleared out already, but her and John were still talking, at which point I came over and said ""honey we have to go, our Uber is waiting"".

As we walked to the car she made it clear she was not happy about me coming over and breaking up their conversation and called me a fucking asshole, which made me laugh out loud because she never talks like that, which in turn made her more mad.

We got in the car and I sat in the front, while my wife, sister, and mother sat in the back seat. As the driver started heading home, my wife rudely asked him where he was going. The driver said he was following the GPS, and she shouted at him saying ""nooooo....I'm going to Norms. I'm hungry"". Norms is a 24-hour Dennys-type restaurant that we've been to only once in recent years.

I apologized to the driver and asked him to keep following the GPS home, but she kept saying she was going to Norms. This behavior was completely out of character for my wife, who is a well-educated and very respectful woman. She had never caused a scene in public, and is always very friendly to our Uber drivers.
My sister and mother sat there quietly, until my sister texted me ""she wants to go to Norms because that's where John is going. I can see her phone and he's texting her right now"".

After that I told my wife, who was getting louder and more obnoxious, that we could go to Norms for Sunday brunch in the morning, but that we needed to get home. From there things took a turn for the worse.

She started screaming something like ""what am I going to do at home? Play around with your little dick? Your little dick does nothing for me. I should've fucked John when I had the chance. It's time I start fucking real men..."".

Boom. My world fell apart right there in that stranger's car, with the three people I love the most in this world.

My sister and mother intervened by telling her to shut up, but she kept going, telling me how bad I was in bed and how I couldn't get her pregnant, along with a bunch of other outrageous things I can't even repeat because it hurts so much.

When we finally got home my sister and mother (who was crying) went inside the house, and I tried to negotiate my wife's exit from the vehicle.

After a few minutes I gave up and told the driver to take her wherever she wanted to go. At that point I was more concerned about my mother. About 30 minutes later I got the notification that the ride had ended. She wound up going to her parent's house.

That was over 48 hours ago and I haven't heard a peep from her. I haven't tried to contact her either. Her dad came over tonight to get her car and some clothes because she has to work tomorrow.

I told him exactly what happened. He said she's not talking at all. She just told them (her parents) that she would be at their house for a few days, so they thought that I was to blame for whatever happened.

I really don't know what to do. I'm still shaking of anger for what she did, and fear that my marriage might be over just like that, with no warning whatsoever.

For the record, it's not that I can't get her pregnant. She's the one who can't have children, but that has never been an issue in our relationship. We knew that when we got married.

And I do have a smaller than average penis, but she's known that since before we started dating. We met in 2007 and became best friends, started dating in 2012, and married in 2016. We communicate our sexual desires very clearly, and I thought our sex life was great. Now I'm not so sure.

I have always had an unfounded fear of losing her, because she is so smart and beautiful and outgoing, that men are constantly salivating all around her. Even though she has never given me a reason to doubt, I have always feared that some man will eventually come along and convince her that I'm not good enough for her.

But she is by far the most ethical person I have ever met, so I don't think she has ever cheated on me, and I don't think she really meant everything she said that night. But I'm having a difficult time getting my thoughts in order, especially because she hasn't contacted me at all.

But then again, this is new territory for both of us. We have never had a significant argument, much less a fight that would lead us to sleep apart one night. Last week was a normal week. Saturday was a fun day. She was very happy all day and we were both very much looking forward to this event.

The only variable was her running into ""John"", whom I had met maybe 5 years ago when they worked together, but they had never dated or been particularly close. So I really don't know what triggered her.

She also has a very good relationship with my sister and my mother. My sister is one of her best friends and has been for years, so I'm sure she's embarrassed for them as well.

Probably the single best things you can do for your muscularity are:

* Learn solid form and focus on it every single set
* Eat enough calories and protein to recover decently
* Genuinely learn to love going to the gym
* Quit sets and even take a rest from gym if you're at risk of injury

This all sounds like common sense, I know, so let me point out what is conspicuously **NOT** on that list: *Make actual strength progress.*

That doesn't mean don't *aim* to get stronger and don't add weight to the bar when possible.

It's just not one of the absolute top things you can do to get stronger, *because this will happen almost inevitably as you move into your mid 20s regardless*.

All you have to do is DON'T FUCK IT UP.

--------------------------

**First, why are you going to get stronger almost inevitably?**

* The movements become more and more natural to your body
* You'll generally move up in weight and ""fill out"" your frame
* Your tendons and joints will steadily get stronger (and these things get strong over a *much* longer timescale)

As a young man hitting 20 years old, I sat at around 75kg and considered myself ""big"" at 80kg. But by the time I was 25, I would naturally sit at 85kg, without any bulking or even really eating that much more.

It just so happens that years of consistent training in weight sports tends to lead to people ""filling out"" their frame. This is particularly true in sports like powerlifting (you have some insane cases like Tom Martin who start in the 80kgs and now sit comfortably above 100kg), but it even applies in sports like boxing, too — notice how pro boxers tend to move *up* in weight class over time, not down.

You will simply put on more sustainable muscle mass over the years, and with that mass comes strength.

Additionally, your tendons will take years to thicken up, your grip strength will start to really come in in earnest (think of how freaky old man strength can be - you'll start noticing some seemingly ""lifelong"" strength from age alone in your mid 20s), and the movements will become more and more neurologically efficient for you, recruiting a higher % of your muscle mass as the years go.

This all stacks up to a *huge* degree.

Anecdotally, at 20 years old, with weight training being pretty much my only athletic endeavour... I was stoked to hit a 140kg deadlift for 1. Again to give the five years later comparison, *with weight training not even being my main sport anymore* (as I switched to mountaineering / hiking), I would take 3 months off lifting for travel, walk back into gym, and comfortably pull 180kg like nothing.

Was I dedicating much more effort to the endeavour? No, and in fact probably less. 

*You will simply get stronger over time as long as you have enough food for recovery and train consistently enough over the years.*

--------------------------

**Second, what do I mean by ""DON'T FUCK IT UP""?**

This one's a lot simpler to explain — just don't do anything that's going to prohibit you from getting in really consistent training over the years.

One aspect of this is obvious; prioritise staying injury-free at virtually any cost. It is way more important to train for 6 months out of the year at moderate-to-heavy weights, than to train for 5 months out of the year at heavy weights that you can't handle, injure yourself, and miss a month (or more) of training.

Learn form, subscribe to a bunch of strength focused blogs that are trustworthy, keep reading form as you go, and practice it every time you're in gym.

A second consideration here is to *not constantly program hop*.

Is your squat stalled at 100kg after running a single cycle of Starting Strength? You might be tempted to start adding accessory exercises, change programs, switch to high-bar, remove your deadlifts, hell even remove your squats. You've got to keep driving that number up, right?

Have some patience. The strength will come as long as you're eating enough and working on your form.

Stick to a program that emphasises the most effective lifts — squats, deadlifts, bench, overhead press, some kind of lat row (bent rows, chinups, whatever), and maybe some dips or core work if you want.

*It almost doesn't matter what that program looks like*, with those considerations. 3 days a week or 6, 5 sets of 3 or 3 sets of 12, three exercises per workout or six...

As long as you put in sustained effort into these lifts over the years, with a moderate weight each time, and eat enough and sleep enough and stay injury free, *your body will almost inevitably get bigger and stronger and better looking* as you age into your mid-20s.

Just don't fuck it up.

--------------------------

To end on a note of clarity... I am **NOT** saying that simply following the steps above is enough to be a truly great lifter or be absolutely shredded at 90kg bodyweight.

Obviously there is more to becoming proficient than just the fundamentals above.

What I **AM** trying to accomplish is to get young men to focus on putting in good solid work to build a base, *with the knowledge that doing that alone will give them a great physique by their mid 20s*, instead of rushing to be uber-Chad by their 20th birthday and burning out their rotator cuffs or slipping a disc.

**CAVEAT;** This is geared more towards HARDMODE but if it applies; you're welcome.

**YOUR ATWA**

Your **ability to walk away**(ATWA) is the ultimate and ONLY leverage that counts. Murder someone? Flee the country. Got a stranger pregnant? Child Support might be your new friend. I'll preface this by stating; I was born into ownership. NOT money. Ownership. I've never had to worry about my ATWA because regardless of situation(bar incarceration); my ATWA is untouchable. No one can take it from me. That said I'll break it down field report style for you handsome gentlemen.

**FIELD REPORT**

My current and I have been kicking it for about 6 years. We have a toddler together. In June after post-birthing issues I gave her an ultimatum because our sex life had gone through the sewers(fathers will understand). She's improved but we're not fucking on our balcony or in the kitchen again so there's still room from improvement. Since June(January in some cases) I've taken steps to ameliorate my ATWA. These include my; physical, fiscal and psychological freedom.

**PHYSICAL**

Anything and everything that could impact your physical self. Incarceration. Retaliation. Shit even IBS. ANYTHING. For those of you that are just dating, fucking and enjoying the bounty of youth this isn't as relevant(unless you get a stranger pregnant). I've always been a planner(bar the 2 fuck trophies I have strolling the face of the earth) so I THINK about things. How things affect me. If I hit this cunt where his boys at? Where are mine? What's my accountant going to say? When you're sticking your penis in a woman, or thinking about it; think to yourself; **what if?** Future-proofing has never disappointed me. You could benefit too.

**FISCAL**

**NO SHARED FINANCES. EVER.** I've probably harped on about it too much but after my first separation; I'd NEVER SHARE again. I was just lucky we were both too young for her to take advantage. ATM my current and I share a rental. She however is hinting at looking to buy. I've never said no to an investment but my response to her has always been; ""you buy babe; if that's what YOU want."" I've owned enough to know that if you make any sort of fiscal obligation/promise; YOU'LL PAY. If that's good with you; then all Gucci. If not; **DON'T EVER EXPOSE YOURSELF FISCALLY. NO SHARED FINANCES. NO SHARED ACCOUNTS. TITLES. Anything.** Why? Guess who pays.

**PSYCHOLOCICAL**

This is the most subjective. Emotion. Mindset. World view. A lot goes on in that football sized muscle of yours. That's good. What's not? Allowing emotional thought to dictate RATIONAL ACTION. 

Since January I've reconnected with one of my exes online. She's on the other side of the planet currently but I've queued her up that if I leave the current; she'll be on the first flight here to pick things; and me; right back up. Why? We have common goals. What's more important is psychologically; if after 6 years of no contact; no physical and **minimal investment on my part** I can get this girl to drop everything for me; I'll be fine. It's HUGE to be able to wield that sort of influence. That power.

That divulged I've rarely let little head dictate what big head does. When I did? I became a father. What I'd suggest is to *constantly self actualise.* Consider your emotions. Consider the consequences. The benefits. Then decide. Instinct is a great indicator when gauging situations; social or otherwise. Couple that with knowledge; and informed decisions can only help you. Grow. Learn. Then become the man you aspire to be.

SUMMARY

Your ULTIMATE power in ANY relationship lies in your ATWA. WORK. SEX. WIVES. FAMILY. In any circumstance; relationship or scenario; **NEVER SACRIFICE YOUR ABILITY TO WALK AWAY FOR ANYONE.**

As always hoping for invigorating discourse to stimulate discussion about YOUR ATWA. Hopefully; I'll find something I can add to mine.

Consequently your appearance, health and confidence levels get into a vicious downward spiral. Meanwhile she relishes in the control she's managed to exert over you. Once upon time she looked at you as an enigma, a new and powerful man for her to get with. You excited her and maybe even scared her a little. Now that her campaign has succeeded you're a harmless, hopeless puppy. She can make you wag your tail and pant excitedly if she suggests you might be getting some later tonight, and she can make you sulk in the corner all alone, feeling like you've done something wrong. She knows all your buttons and she doesn't mind pressing them. 

All of this change you've gone through has made any attraction she once had for you completely disappear.

Hey trp,

There’s a girl who’s stared at me for months on end at school.  I caught her at least two dozen times and it got awkward really quickly.  It was like she had some diagnosable OCD staring compulsion I felt low key embarrassed. I’d be pretty embarrassed if I checked out a girl and she caught me so many times. For her to stare at me with no self-control, sometimes turning red or playing with her hair, for literally 9 months, try to be in my proximity, say stupid things when talking to me and eye ball my junk, I had some classic trp evidence of interest. 

Thing is, she has a boyfriend. A 7 year relationship. I knew this pretty early on and focused my attention on open plates.  I didn't convey any interest for 8 months because I knew she was in a relationship from her prof pic and speculation and gained a tremendous upper hand.  Rather than go for her, I fucked around with a bunch of plates over the summer and was the guy who didn't like her back despite staring at him and showing 0 interest at all. Wild thing is we’re talking about an HB8, conservatively.  

Thinking even a tiny bit rationally, I figured no girl would put in the effort of staring at a guy and suffering the embarrassment of getting caught and getting avoided for 9 freakin months. That’s a self-esteem dumpster fire for a classical pretty girl clique type since grade school. To me, maybe she saw me as a potential guy to cheat with or a recruit for a potential seamless branch swing. 

So even though I considered her a creep and a pervert for being taken and basically being a peeping Tom checking any part of me out as she pleases, I figured, she’s mad hot, showed tremendous crush level IOI’s and for so long it’s nonsensical to think it could be anything but a invitation to get plated or branch swing. 

Last weekend followed her on instagram, dm'd her very sparsely and ask her out for drinks one night later this week.  This is the first confirmable sign I have interest in her.  This girl whose friends are awkward around me because their friend has a crush.  She mentioned that she has dinner plans with her boyfriend at night BUT that we should catch up after class.  To me, basic boyfriend shit test because she rescheduled. I brush it off and don’t become reactive and respond “np sounds like a plan what’s your #”.

No response and unread for 18 hours. Done. Poof. The end.

My mind is still blown.  To me, a girl who wants to feign IOI’s to get validation or feign real plate-able interest with IOI’s wouldn’t carry the torch for almost a year. Just for that little boost of knowing ooh a hot guy likes me on a shallow level like there aren’t plenty of hot guys who do and have her whole life. Why go through all that trouble just for one guy? 

I don’t even know if I’m compatible with this chick or like her as a person because I haven’t spent much time with her intentionally because I never wanted to let on that I thought she was hot while she was taken.  I didn’t want to be an orbiter for months with the chance they break up, I put her on ice till I felt why the fuck not.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Fuck IOI’s Women Have Not Been Scorned For IOI Mimicry for Validation,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dv0zfc/fuck_iois_women_have_not_been_scorned_for_ioi/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,dark,,,,,,1

Due to the nature of my job I'm around plenty and honestly the lessons I've learned from them over the years has instilled me with more red pill knowledge than any book I've ever read and I would have to say the main thing I've learn is **the power of frame.** 

As I said strippers are experts at exploiting their femininity for financial gain however the methods they use are inherently **masculine.** When men come to these women, strippers, other sex workers, etc. the woman quickly sets the frame of the ""relationship."" **You are less than me and therefore to be in my presence you have to pay me money.** This isn't unlike many real world beta relationships as well which is why this has plenty of application outside of the stripclub as well. How many women are only with men because he buys her things, pays her way, allows her to live with him, etc. **Most woman are playing stripper ""game"" without even being strippers.** That's not even to mention how many of there men are barely if ever having sex with their own girlfriends regularly. When you start talking about things like long distance relationships it gets even worse. 

Strippers even have classes now where they basically teach ""stripper game."" I had the opportunity to see one of them and the tactics they learn are no different from any other woman in the real world and it shows how casually women truly do view exploiting men for their own personal gain. **Most of their techniques center around making a man think they are their friend or that they have a chance with them, that they actually care about them and not just their wallets.** We see this outside of this context in **orbiters, men that women only keep around for validation and sometimes even financial gain.** This is only allowed to happen because **it is the woman who is setting the frame of the relationship, all of these men by nature have weak frames and that allows women to control their feelings, decisions and bank accounts.** When you think about it, strip clubs are literally beta houses built to harvest beta bucks in a quick and timely manner all under one roof.

The thing that used to confuse me in all this is the men that frequent strip clubs. **CEO, athletes, celebrities, politicians, movie stars.** I also wondered why these rich and powerful men would need to attend strip clubs. The more that I met these kinds of men in these settings though **the more I saw how weak their frames are and usually only when it comes to women.** In their own environments they are powerful and in control but put them around woman and their frame melts like putty. Even more astounding is many of these men **honestly believe they are being alpha by giving women money.**  Since society teaches us that men are only good for beta bucks when they fulfill that fantasy they honestly feel good about it. 

Something I now tell myself everyday is **set your frame or someone WILL set it for you.** Seeing the amounts of open manipulation I've seen over the years and the men who fall for it really does something to your perception. That's why I find it astounding that society disowns a place like the TRP but turn a complete blind eye to the openly manipulative tactics that men must face everyday. There are people out that who love nothing more than to take you for everything you're worth and leave you for dead on the side of the street **and sometimes it comes in the form of a cute smile and a short skirt.** Men you must remember to protect yourselves at all time. **Not just financially but mentally as well, do not be manipulated.**",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Learning the power of Frame through Strippers,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/duzyd6/learning_the_power_of_frame_through_strippers/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We often categorize certain behaviors as Redpill, Bluepill, Alpha, or Beta, but lack to understand the meaning behind why these things can be deemed as such. The answer lies in self fulfillment and dependency.

It is an innate human characteristic to find things that are independent more attractive or valuable. The car that breaks down every 15k miles and the man who attributes his happiness on a female are very much the same thing. They are dependent. They can be fucked with. The car isn't gonna make a road trip without problems in the same way the man isn't going to amount to anything without a woman to make him happy.

It is the car that breaks down infrequently and the man who doesn't rely on anyone that become valuable or attractive. You can't fuck with it. The car is just gonna keep running. The man is just gonna be happy. It is when you learn you can't fuck with something that you begin to either love or hate it. We can't fuck with female nature. Some men hate that, others love it.

In terms of sexual strategy, TheRedPill aims to make you independent by showing you reality. Learn to be happy by yourself and have nothing to be dependent on. That is the true meaning of ""Alpha."" Shit tests are designed to test this.

""I think we should break up."" ---- ""Are you reliant on me?""  
""Your shirt is stupid."" ---- ""Do you need my approval for what you wear?""  
""I think my ex is back in town."" ---- ""Do I control you? Are you dependent on me?""

We matched on Tinder on Saturday, I was staying in just watching netflix to join a buddy for surfing at 6am in Maroubra (Sydney Beach).  


She was drinking margaritas at her friends place... she's 27 (Im 33)... she's messaging me frequently, shes just 'rejoined tinder' Im her first match... We soon establish that she lives in my suburb... a surprise but not that surprising... A inner city apartment/highrise suburb that it is...   


Her photos are beautiful, me at any other stage earlier in my life would have been nervous AF... but first and foremost I genuinely didn't care much if I got laid... truth be told I fucked a 7 three days ago and I hadn't been eating body builder diet this past weekend... my testosterone wasn't that high... normally another negative detractor when seducing women... but then again she was a 9... that will spike testosterone on its own merit.  


We meet at the liquor store as planned after work 7pm, a mild Monday evening, Mondays are good for me as I dont have my Son staying at mine... but I had worked later to finish a project so had no time to spare....I go into woollies and quickly buy a 15 cent bag to hide our beers so that we can drink in the park. Shes as beautiful in real life as her tinder photos, we find a quiet park bench and cheers to beers.  


I've never been as confident with consistency as I am now... I had worked all day, I was fairly tired, Hadn't had a chance to shower or properly change attire before we met... I at least had good mens cologne on... I instantly put my arm on the seat around her, hand on the bench, but arm around her no less... the younger me would be nervous about doing this... its not even that I'm necessarily more confident as I simply don't have the time for games....and shes a beautiful women that I would like to put my arm around... she can always re seat in such a way to indicate shes not happy with this... she seems happy...  


She tells me about her life, works 2 jobs, on a student visa, gets paid cash for one of the jobs etc. I explain my situation, including divorced, young son etc. I live alone, she lives with 5 girls in a 2 bedroom apartment.  


My being a Dad is news as its not mentioned on Tinder, Not a problem but she wants photos of me and my son, I show a few...   


2 beers down now on the park bench talking about her old life in mexico, and countries we've travelled to... The sun is going down now, its cold and only she has a jacket, I pull her in with arm around her shoulder....  


The physical contact is a great way to speed things along, her eyes already told me that were down to fuck, but she still needs me to direct the interaction... she has work at 7.30am after all.... time is of the essence... time is ticking. I'm on autopilot really...  


I ask her to walk me back to my place, she says shes happy to. We arrive, my arm still around her, and I joke that we should go for a swim in the apartment pool, she laughs ""No way!"", as we're arriving to the aprtment complex, arm already on her shoulder I pull her in and kiss her, shes receptive in a very positive way... almost impossible to fuck up at this point.  


I then say Ahem... ""I really need to use the bathroom""...   


""So do I!!!"" she exclaims  


I look at her in the eyes, nod, grab her hand, ""Come"".  


I hadn't actually tidied my place, having been renovating the place, everything is a mess, zero effort, normally I keep my place tidy before a date, but I just didnt have the time today.  


There's tools lying around, powerdrill on the couch, hammer, hacksaw... the list goes on... bath room a mess... she doesnt seem too put off by the mess... we use the bathroom each and then sit on the couch, I yell ""Hey google play chill music"", Google hears me say ""Play the Killers music""... which is close enough...  


Arm around her on the couch, I waste no time, shes here, no questions about what happens next, I gather she hasn't been laid in a fairly long time, this is her night, I better perform. I want to perform because I want this to be more than a one night thing...  


We remove each others clothes while making out... like a couple of teenagers... she's beautiful, her tits perky released from the confines of her bra, now bouncing in my face and mouth. Her pupils dilated, with a serious need to fuck, her hair messy but so god damned beautiful.  


""Tell me you have condoms?"" she says, as my dick is blocked by her panties... I say I recently bought a 20 pack but I cant friggen remember where I put them... both nearly butt naked, I'm pretty sure I had left them in the back of my car... but I check the bathroom... turns out they were there afterall... a brief celebration ensues... a crisis averted.  


She puts it on for me, while I'm hard as a rock, how can I not be, her very existence is to attract males of her choosing to fertilise her egg.... and right now at this moment she chooses me... how lucky I am to be here now, living the life of an alpha male... when I had been raised to be so blue pill...  


Her beauty is astounding, how can such a cute innocent face be down on her knees as I grab a fist full of her hair and guide her mouth and drive myself to the back of her throat... stopping just as shes close to gagging... god its a beautiful sight, but at the rate shes going shes going to drain me before I've even fucked her, I need to stall...   


I manhandle her, lifting her by the hair back up to my level and kiss her, one hand on her throat with the other fist still holding her by the hair...  her moaning with each kiss a true pleasure to hear.  


I force her back on to her back on the couch, remove her g string, push her legs back so her knees are in near her arm pits and indulge on her pussy, I've never seen a pussy this wet before, it tastes delicious and I allow my tongue to slurp while applying pressure around and on her g spot, listening and calibrating to her moans, improving and improvising, I need to make sure she comes at least once because her beauty is going to drain me.  


It takes me much longer than planned, now using two finger scooping up deep in her pussy along side tongueing her. Its a true pleasure to hear her moaning and climaxing, my dick now raging, I need to have my way with her now.  


One hand back on her throat, slipping my thumb in her mouth as she sucks it like a dick... now with her legs up in the air and pussy offering itself to me, I drive myself inside her, as we both let out sighs of total pleasure...fucking her like I'm porn star Owen Grey, indulging in her sexual beauty.  


I manage to hold off for 10 minutes by switching positions, but eventually nut. 5 minutes later round 2, I fuck her with her on top as shes still horny as hell... while I was pretty happy to only bust once... and yet shes so fucking sexy I find myself busting round 2 once more sooner than expected.  


15 minutes shes putting clothes back on and walking 3 minutes down the road to her apartment as she has an early start for work.  


And so now I'm writing this FR...  


She's coming around for a swim at my apartment pool tomorrow as I'm working from home.. the perks of the IT industry (Meant to be 36 degrees C tomorrow)... :O  


**Some key things I've learnt,**   


Every time I seduce a woman, I become better at seducing a woman... I make no apologies... I enjoy the company of new beautiful women... and I enjoy having confidence which can only be learnt through practice...  


And besides practice practice practice... if I could distill it down to a single factor I'd say quite simply to enjoy the interaction, and allow yourself to be cocky, allow yourself to be confident... allow yourself to make mistakes... allow yourself to enjoy her beauty, don't be ashamed by the pleasures, the primal pleasures she gives you. She understands the mind of a man better than the other way around... its in her nature.   


**Just have your shit sorted, weights+Diet+Career+2-3 good mates**... after that your mind and the world align where girls can smell your success... and it doesnt even have to be thaaaat much success... its partly confidence, partly just in your mind, partly magic.

Ok, this is weird, but let me explain...

So, I am currently on this phase, I guess you could call it a MGTOW phase; I decided to focus on my self improvement and go on a little period of celibacy actually - semen retention and nofap. But I still want to be friendly and have fun with people. I have a new career and  there is a lot of women in my work and my school - I'm in a type of field now where 99% of the people are females. 

But I feel that I have trouble communicate with women as a friend. Even when I don't want them sexually I feel they often tend to misunderstand me trying to be friendly as flirting or something. I'm not used to having female friends, all my friends are dudes.

How do you avoid that? How do I make them see me more as their girlfriend or gay friend? How do I act? What do I do? How do I start conversations and do small talk to not be misunderstood?

All I want to do is help the men in here live fulfilled, conscious lives, in whatever way I am capable. These are my 2 cents. 

Almost everywhere in the Western world, there is a generic understanding that 8 hours of sleep is, well, not only healthy, but even recommended and be a virtue one should strive for. When TRP posts recommend it, that is still something I can accept. But when the entire medical fraternity all over the world is recommending it, this is what worries me. How truth has become a fringe phenomenon in today’s society, and actually lying in your face by doctors, corporations, media, business leaders, politicians, become a thing society accepts without question, is shocking (lets leave that for another post i.e. “Accepting Lies is becoming mainstream”)

Think about this:
You own a car. If your car has to be serviced for one week after two weeks of running, would it be an efficient car? Would you even use that car? No, you wouldn’t.  You would drive that car from a bridge into a lake, just because it would be nothing but an inefficient piece of shit. 

But, you are OK with the fact that 8 hours of sleep is healthy. The 8 hour sleeping routine isnt what human bodies are designed for. 8 hour sleeping humans are inefficient pieces of shit. Sleeping 8 hours means a third of your life you are practically dead. That is NOT an efficient body. Infact, it is quite the opposite: an inefficient piece of shit body. 

A perfectly healthy body (healthy diet, primarily) needs only 2-3 hours of sleep. If you work out, consume protein, then 4 hours is good. This is how it is for a lot of people. But those people are becoming rarer and rarer. That lifestyle is becoming rarer and rarer. That lifestyle is not good for business. Woke people are not good for business. Sleeping unconscious people are great for business. 

Let me explain: 
What is sleep? Sleep is when your body needs to come in a restful state, so that the next day and it can start its functions effectively. So basically, sleep is nothing but “rest”. 
A human body is the most advanced piece of machinery on this planet, it requiring 8 hours of rest wasn’t the way billions of years of evolution intended it to be. Humans are meant to live life to the fullest. Not be dead for 33% of life. Now, if you’re generally in a restful state (more like: at ease) throughout the day (you can be doing intense work, but you can still be restful and at ease), you body will require less sleep. 

But that is not possible for you. Because first and foremost, you eat grains 3 times a day. Grains require 12-16 hours to digest. How can it be possible for you? You eat meat/chicken/etc. Meat, chicken and fish take as much as 2 days to fully digest. So you bodily functions are always ON. Never actually rebooted even when you go to sleep. 

How can it be possible for you? You start putting in more grains and meat even before your body has not finished digesting the meat and grains from your previous meal. How can you be restful when your digestive system is working almost permanently, since years and years. That is why even when you sleep for 8 hours, you still don’t really feel “well rested” or “at ease” when you wake up. You basically have a piece of shit body. 

Add to that, nicotine and caffeine. They stimulate your nerves, but long term, they’re actually the biggest energy drainers because the for the nerves to recover from them, they need a lot of down time. 

Because of such habits, your body needs 8 hours of sleep. For a moment, let that sink in. Youve doubled your sleeping and reduced your alive time just by having corporation backed doctors who want to ensure that their junk shit food sells. So, those doctors recommend you 8 hours. They want to ensure that you stay asleep. Its good for their business. They more awake you are, their business, their lies, their societies, their governments, their countries, will crumble. 

Whatever. I converted to vegetarian (not vegan) 2 years back, started doing some breathing practices, fast 2 full days a month, and my sleep quota has come down to 6 hours. My target now is to get rid of the nicotine and caffeine, and get my sleep quota down to 4 hours. I want to allow my body to be restful throughout the day, when Im out and about, so that it doesn’t need the absolutely unnecessary 6-8 hours downtime. Heck, some idiots even think sleeping 10 hours is supremely healthy. Wake up, you idiots!

Before I sign off, I don’t want to put you down for thinking 8 hours of sleep is good. I just want to make you aware that sleeping 8 hours is a choice you are making. Just be conscious of that. That is my only intention. Let go of the myth that 8 hour sleep is healthy, because, it is the opposite.

Those who get it don't need to be told to leave it, they break out.**

The biggest reason why society and your family and the people around you try to betaize you into compliance, minimize your attraction and hide your authentic sexual energy right from when you hit puberty is because you don't get it. Those who listen to them and play by those rule-books end up as males who have no mastery over their sexual energy and are therefore unable to figure out how attraction works, how to raise their SMV, how to avoid spiraling into destructive and covert sexual behaviors and so on. 

When the people around you realize you're not a master who gets it, you are seen as a threat, and maybe later, a non-male. These rules, the things people say, all those were not meant to help you master your sexual dimension, they were made specifically to limit it where it would be safe for others. Because you don't get it. People talk a lot about how sex, love and relationships should be logically, precisely because the actual nature of those instincts are different. 

This facade continues to be maintained by society as long as they see that you don't get it and you're still a potential threat because you're green and ignorant of your own power. But at the same time, by making it safe, they are also completely eliminating the possibility of your masculine energy finding expression and relationships. As you grow older, their rules and words are the very things that hamper you ever further, like a solid rocket booster that is spent and is now dead weight dragging you down and off course. They also eliminate the possibility of you getting the respect you need in your life, or the possibility that your life is in your own frame at all. They are also unable to respect you and hope behind their words that you'll get it and won't stay as a castrated piece of life in a masculine body forever.

All this is already known stuff, right? Besides, we've all been there in beta hell. So what's this post about? 

You must recognize that society by itself has no way out of this Catch-22 - left to themselves they simply create a bigger problem in response to a potential one. The solution can therefore only come from you. Only you can get it.

Masculine energy at the root of it is all about finding the solutions that do not yet exist. the stuff that others can never give you, but you must create them and give them to others. This place is what it is today because of that. The books and writings exist because a man walked the dark path and then wrote them where they did not exist. Hell, the world is where it is because of it. Everything you see around you did not exist at some point in the past. When the men of the past saw that they had nothing, they made everything. 

And this is the first thing about being a man that you need to get - a man is self actualized. Masculinity is not a crown someone can place on your head. You have to make the crown, the throne, and your own kingdom - that's what it's about. Realizing that is a moment of clarity - the first ""getting it"".

And then you need to get the art of mastering your own masculine energy and taking it to its peak. The Catch - 22 of society is a giant shit test - what needs to come from within cannot come from outside by definition. That's what you need to get. The solutions are not with them, they're with you.

An expert of the game has the knowledge, the skills, the SMV, the experience and the mastery to put it all together and get it to work. These people get it. Society and women treat them very differently. These people do not need any rulebooks designed for to keep the ignorant under lock and key, they write the rulebook that works. The highest level of masculinity in any dimension of life appears only when a man is good enough to actually write the book on the subject himself. The same people who told you the rules do not tell those guys the rules, they listen to them and submit to their rules.

These people can tell you what women and society is like when the facade has fallen, when they need not hide who they actually are, when they can actually drop their guard because they need not tell you the stuff to limit your sexual self and can instead enjoy it -- because you're the guy who gets it. Then they enter your frame instead. So utterly different from what they claimed they were right? Damn, now it's obvious why.

There are no shortcuts to mastery - all the experts here who've walked the path have fallen more often than you've tried. And the same thing is true for reaching the peak of your SMV. Now that virtually all that needs to be said has been said and written here, you at least know honestly what you need to do. You must now stop listening to your betaizers and defy their rules and eventually get out of their frame altogether. The path must be walked, and one will stumble and fall before one learns to run. 

Real mastery won't come overnight from just a moment of clarity, being angry about what you were fed, or by being a mere rebel of the rules, but it will come with the knowledge, skills, experience, the transformation. But knowing that you are supposed to become a master of your masculinity and that it is only ever your responsibility all along -- that is the first step out.

Naturally if you make a big show of your growth before you're a master, with the maturity of a 13 year old, you'll set off alarm bells around and be seen as a threat. Although the people around you may be logically aware that this is in your best interest, disrupting the status quo and your past equations is scary to them. But when they see that you've got it, their resistance drops, and acceptance happens. 

So rule zero - you do not talk of fight club or mastery, but be aware that subtler is better, and at the highest level, when mastery is in your being, you need not do or say anything to show it. Others know. The level of being is the highest level of authenticity, where your mere presence gets the message across. That's the level you need to aim for.

Being a nice betaized male, is a paradigm specifically designed for those seen as unfit to be a master of masculinity and who don't get it. Those who get the secret break out of it by themselves. They do not stay in the followers's prison nor do they wait for anyone to give them keys to the door - they make their own key, break the lock and get out themselves, because now they know. The rulebook is given to you because you do not realize you're supposed to be a master. When you're a master, you write the rulebook where none exists. That's the secret.

Go to her moms apt in the hood to smoke a blunt. IDGAF and follow her upstairs. I escalate and ignore everything she says and bat all the shit tests. Her ASD is in full effect. I had taken off my shirt as soon as we got in the kitchen. I am like 9% or less and very muscular. She is all over me at this point. She had already showed me her ass and tattoos etc. Girl is a certified freak and has all the red flags. 

 I find out she likes to be choked and hair pulled etc.  I grab her and kiss her. She kissed back and bit my lip hard and then pushed me back with ASD. I ignore and kiss again. This time I grind her into the counter and she lets out a soft moan. I kiss and pick her up on the counter.   Her legs spread and I feel her pussy through her panties. She pushes me away. I put my clothes on and say I have to go home and sleep. 

She wanted me to force my way in and take her. I can recognize nonconsensual consent because my wife is like this. I chose to leave instead of trying to fuck this girl in moms kitchen because I don't want to get a rape charge from a woman I don't know. 

Should I have just repeated the kissing push pull cycle a few more times? How do you break the ASD cycle of push pull? 

Is it best to just ignore and then text a week or two later? I figure I would text her something like ""I want another massage, did you move into your new apartment yet?""  I still want to plate her for a good sport fuck.

Anyone who has been around here for a short period of time knows that you’re religiously told to push yourself beyond means you thought were possible. Your body has unknown limits... and finding out just how far you can push yourself can be one of the most fulfilling experiences you can ever have.

Decompressing and relaxation can serve as a great tool to keep you focused and give you time away from this constant self-induced torture. Aside from sleep, it makes up 25% of my time while I am awake, while the other 75% is spent going balls to the wall hard as I can at everything I do. Time that is set aside with you in mind. You can put your goals on the back burner, even if it’s only for 10 minutes at a time. 

Here are a list of some of the best activities you can do to keep you functioning at your best.


Daily activities:

1. This goes without saying, sleeping. You need rest to recover and get your strength. Sleep 8+ hours a night.


2. Mindfulness meditation. Even if it is only for 10 minutes. Build yourself up as time goes on and add 10 seconds a day. Pick a time during the day and stick to it. The point of it isn’t necessarily to detach at all. Rather, become hyper focused on the here and now and becoming okay with the human condition while in this state. In other words, accepting that your back hurts from sitting up straight. Accepting the thoughts that are occurring in your mind and just letting all the pain, boredom and everything else be.


3. Get yourself a dog. You don’t have to pretend to be any certain way with your dog. Your dog will love you no matter what. You can invest in your dog, and know that your investment won’t go upside down. You can show your dog affection, and it won’t turn on you if you do. If you train it properly, it will always listen to you. You can walk your dog so both of you can destress together. 


4. Get yourself several hobbies. Or, just things that you can do that make time stand still. It can be as simple as chess and ping pong, or as complex as rock climbing and MMA. Regardless, the more active you are, and I don’t mean intensity here, the more you’re using your body in different ways, the more difficult it is to notice how much time has passed. It has to do with using your body to do something to keep your focus. This means working with just your hands will take focus, but not as much as something that takes many more body parts and muscles.








Less frequent activities:

1. Massage. I’m talking about deep tissue massage. Go for 90 minutes with the right person and you will feel like a new man when you’re done. It shouldn’t necessarily all feel good while they’re doing it. If it does, tell them to go deeper.


2. Take a bath... sounds kinda gay, but it works. You put the water on as hot as it goes and let the water run the entire tone so it doesn’t get cold. Drain it when it gets a little full, but keep the hot water running. Sweat it out in there and relax. Work on your breathing while you’re in there... deep breathes into your stomach. Repeat to yourself, “The breathe starts at the naval, and ends at the nostril.”


3. Have several groups of friends that all enjoy an activity. For example, I have one group that does flag football, another that does poker, another that has a game night. I don’t get to see all three each week, but because they’re all on different days, I get to go at least one each week that works best with my schedule.


4. Go into the woods and let it out. I want taught how to process or deal with emotions. Sometimes I get really pissed about stuff in my life that I caused, be it something as simple as when I got myself into debt, or something more complex because of some life trauma that occurred, someone’s death that was close to me, or a family members suffering. Since finding TRP years ago, I knew that emotions couldn’t be processed in front of others. Specifically, I couldn’t take my anger or anything else out on other because it isn’t their problem and they don’t deserve that. So, I take them out in the woods. I will sit in the woods and process my emotions. Really feel what it wrong. And then I will explode. Scream as loud as I can and do what I need to in order to process my problems and emotions.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,"In order to remain a machine, rest relaxation, and rejuvenation are necessary.

Fortunately, I have found a solution to this problem. I simply take an uber to a bar 15 minutes away which is near a much less prestigious university which does not care so much about greek life. My success rate at this place is noticeably higher than at bars near my university and when I mention the name of the university I attend girls I am conversing with actually seem to gain interest.

The foundation of the Red Pill is for men to take control and responsibility for their lives and relationships. After taking the red pill men should know the truth of gender dynamics and relationships, but that doesn't mean you won't screw up and make mistakes or misinterpret these truths in your life.

Take the recently popular post 'All Women Are Whores' or /stupidslutsclub for example, it's making a point about hypergamy but it reads more like all women just want to be dirty sluts. That's just not true, most women don't want to sleep around and most would feel sincerely guilty about such behavior.

While most men settle for less, Red Pill men should only 'settle' for a LTR with women at their same or higher SMV because you know the rules of the game. You have all the advantages that an AFC does not.

My point is that the Red Pill is all real and we should always remember the lessons, but when a man is holding frame, living a purpose driven life, and aiming high then his woman will submit.

“Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.” (Gen. 3:16.)

If we lead, if we take charge, if we embrace our masculine identity with compassion and understanding then we should not be overly threatened by hypergamy.

Having known about the Red Pill since I was 15, I have **never** sought to implement its teachings although I see many similarities regarding the method (道) I have nevertheless chosen to live my life. This is my short reflection on ""Profit-Maximisation"", which may provide an outside perspective in an otherwise insulated community.

To me, it seems a majority of men here are converted subsequent to some ""dawning realisation"" about the nature of Women. From my small vantage point in Singapore (possibly the most woman-biased Asian nation - just consider our *Women's Charter* for a start), I find that many posts on here are literally **dripping with pathos** (the post which evoked this realisation was entitled ""All women are whores""; how sensational). There is an undercurrent of lamentation and sadness (as possibly recognised by max\_peenor) permeating the MGTOW, incel and RedPill communities which rival the spectacular and ridiculous performances (or farces) of Blue-pilled men attempting to woo ""their"" women.

All this difficulty, sadness and/or hatred is simply unnecessary. Nor do you need to feel satisfaction or contentment, although I would advise *striving toward* achieving such a state (for motivation's sake), although such strife may be eternal.

**What is the reason I am posting this here?** I find the Red-pill community as possibly the most analogous to my ideal of a Brotherhood of like-minded individuals, each of who at least ensure that their struggles mean something to themselves. To me, this is leagues better than submission or self-pity or contentment. It is the struggle which I admire.

Since I was 15, I have been utterly convinced that the world may be resolved into **net detriments and net benefits**. There is no need for more, but there should be no less sophisticated analysis of the world. This is enough for the bare necessities of life: although you may *want* or *wish for* grander themes of morals and love and family (etc) to dictate the story arc of your life to achieve some sort of intangible fulfillment, these are superfluous. The iron law of life *has been* and *will always be* the dictates of survival, and survival neither requires emotion nor thrives on it (although it is quite possibly hurt by it). For you, as MAN, you require to propagate your seed - but also, to paint in a modern influence, to propagate your *legacy*. This requires you to achieve the most you can - and the benchmark by which you measure your achievement is the benchmark of profit.

This profit is not so easily reduced to a simple money-measure. Profit is not only material wealth, but the pleasure of procreation and possibly commanding *some degree* of fidelity (no such thing as absolute fidelity these days). You might at this point realise that ""profit"" in the way I am talking about it evokes the orthodox economic idea of ""utility"". This, however, may be considered by each to have broader or narrower meaning, as the accordion of life stretches and squeezes with the abstract melodies of life. **The overarching principle? ""Profit"" is self-interest**.

There is no greater law than the law of self-interest. For self-interest, greater men live and die, where lesser men are foiled by their animal propensities and brainwashed by the Hobbesian Leviathan. Will you live and die for others, or live and die for yourself? I have chose the former, and run my life according to that iron law.

The fascination with women may be biological - but my rational mind commands that my greed overtake and outlast all softer affections. Pleasure can be bought with money, but only women have the option of buying a meagre stipend with pleasure.

If You run your life according to the ethos of profit-maximisation, marriage and divorce becomes an easy decision to make. Lying and manipulation (or even REFRAINING from lying and manipulating) for the sake of self-interest will become easy to partake in. Violence: murder, rape, pillage - you DO NOT engage in this BECAUSE it does not pay to do so in a modern society, where you can live much better refraining from such activities than partaking in them. Only weak men and fools prefer the dictates of morality over the dictates of profit - reason: because you are probably more likely to survive by following the latter than the former, and that is the only benchmark you should concern yourself about about.

To you, the player, women are defined by the pleasure they bring and the respect you gain in society as a result of having a *possibly loyal* mate. It is the mark of somebody worthy of respect, which can be resolved into profit. Since the institution of marriage is *no longer* as respected today - act accordingly, and only marry if it pays - if not, abstain.

You who are reading - how does your mother, father, brother, sister, wife benefit you? If you assess that they are likely to reciprocate loyalty, then perhaps you might assess it to be of greater benefit to honor your familial contract - act only in a way which benefits you. If not, I would advise that you follow the outcome of your brief calculus.

This is why the world is run the way it is - it is why there is such phenomenal greed exhibited by those at the apex of society; it is why the ruler is distinguished from the ruled by the capacity of rationality. Perhaps one day if you have practiced enough the ethos of profit-maximisation, you may be better able to appreciate the ability of simply being able to **count** \- maybe then, you can be the judge instead of the judged, the balancer of life instead of the one balanced by life.

I, too, have magnificent ambitions. Perhaps if more persons thought like me, the current status quo may be upended and I would have a better chance of reaching the apex.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,The Ethos of Profit-Maximisation,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dyzscm/the_ethos_of_profitmaximisation/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Selective banning of voices has now given way to outright insanity on a daily basis. In my country (Germany), there are now only two camps of people throwing shit at each other - leftists saying ""all Germans must be eradicated from the planet"" and ""all whites are racist murderers"", and right wings increasingly embracing nazism as a defence mechanism. It seems that there is nothing in between, and that's all that we're left with. End times.

But the reality is, it isn't. Twitter is not a medium that successful people bother with. It does not represent society at all. Twitter has become a marketing tool for the outrage economy: Posting outrageous shit to get the maximum emotional reaction. And who was the first to make a serious impact with this? A man named Trump. This shit can get you elected as president.

For people who are not trying to become a career politician or sell stupid books with no actual content, Twitter should simply not be a part of their lives. The same goes for most of Reddit and anywhere else where discussions do not resolve around skills or facts, but mere emotions. Use Social Media to organise meetings with your hobby group, to read up on your workout routine and inform yourself (in a scientific, fact-based way). 

Start flushing this shit out of your system. Bookmark websites with useful, scientific information. Websites that promote skills, hobbies and business advice (Not fucking Tai Lopez or Gary Vee, which is the exact same shit, but actual skill-based stuff) or gadgets and tech stuff. Make AthleanX, How to play the piano, cooking shows and so on your personal timeline of positivity.  

We are not immune to outrage marketing. Hell, I thought I am a rational as fuck guy, but these assholes even get me to react. You must stay away from it. Can you influence them? No. Instead, focus on yourself, and your immediate surroundings aka friends and family.  Some TRP folks might not like my post, as they themselves are engaged in the outrage economy, making some nice cash from it. But the fact is, for 90% of the people on here it is poison.

Don't waste your time in the outrage economy machine (Twitter, Reddit, other social media)

However, what they will all never admit is that they also want to keep the advantages that come with being a woman in the old culture of gender inequality. For example; women still PREFER men to pay for the first date, or engage in chivalrous acts, or provide for the family. 

What I'm seeing as women gain more and more ""equality"" is that they seek to gain as many of the advantages as they think men have while simultaneously LIMITING men to the roles they believe men should play. In other words, women are trying to empower themselves as much as possible but are also telling men to ""Get back in the kitchen"" Ha! 

Here's the truth: Women HATE gender equality. They do not want to assume the issues that come with it, that is why they are trying to have their cake and eat it too. Imagine if the court system was fair towards men and women equally. Imagine if fathers had a say in whether or not their pregnant women could get an abortion or not. (Sex requires two consenting adults yet if the father doesn't want the child he's 
on the hook for 18 years so shut up.) They ALSO do not want to put men in a more empowered position by having us gain advantages that we would otherwise not such as getting out of child support. 

I probably sound like an MRA but I don't care. Here's the redpill perspective: In order for women to maintain this false sense of gender equality they have to hold the false position that men and women are the same. I just want to note that no matter what women say MEN AND WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT. Men play a certain role in society based on their strengths, so do women. Do not allow women to undermine your strengths in the name of their own empowerment. Your value is based on your strong masculine role to society (and to your women). Men as a sex are more sexually attractive when they keep frame in the midst of these power plays by women. Pass this mass shittest by maintaining your power AS A MAN. You are a strong masculine leader and no matter what women say it's what they respect. 

Even if this doesn't make the cut it's still on SOUL CAMERA!

And my conclusion? You're disgusting.

Talking about women, no sorry, other human beings, as plates..?

This is just gross. 

The amount of heartbreak you've caused for so many women, is the reason so many women today complain about not being able to find a good guy. 

A lot of you have money, good and stable jobs and are fit. WHY DID YOU TAKE THIS PATH?

You could have been decent men, that settle down for a good woman, and have a happy family. But no.

You go and sleep around with girls and break their trust. You realize a lot of you might have scared a lot of these women for life right?

To the point where they can't commit to someone because they've been betrayed so badly by your kind

But you don't care. In reality you only think about your needs. I can only hope that women come to their senses and stop sleeping around with guys like you.

I saw a post about how a dude dated a girl for 3 months. And after she asked him if he slept with other girls, he said he didn't, but saw no reason not to. 

How in the right mind do you not see something wrong with that? If you're going out with someone, please don't be a garbage human and fuck other people. 

Do you really need to? Really? Why aren't you just honest from the start. Why lead a woman on and pump and dump her when you get tired of her?

I know most of you that do this are fucked up inside. And guess what? It's because you live this type of life. You can say you're happy all you want, but that void in your cold, dead heart won't be filled, no matter how many women you sleep with.

Sally was a looker. Sally fucked me whenever I wanted, cooked me dinner and canceled other plans to spend time with me. 

We had been seeing each other for around 3 months and I found her femininity endearing. 

One night, while we were hanging out at my place, she reached deep in her purse as she said, “I got you something for Christmas.”

She handed me a small package and looked on in anticipation of what I would do next. 

“Thanks, that’s awesome!” I said as I walked across the room and put it under my sarcastic joke of a Christmas tree.

I had not gotten her a gift as we had only been fucking for a few months and it would be absolutely ridiculous to buy her anything. 

I also wasn’t going to open it in front of her because, “I have to wait until Christmas morning to open presents, silly.”

I walked back over and kissed her. 

As I began to escalate, I felt a hard object under her bra that felt like a stone of some kind. 

Sally was in fact, the type of girl who believed in the magic power of trinkets and stones, so I pulled back and looked at her inquisitively.

Her facial tone had changed to nervous. 

“What’s up?” I asked. 

She looked at me with puppy dog eyes...........like abused puppy dog eyes. 

“What is it?” I asked.

**“..........are you still fucking other girls?”**

“..............................”

I chuckled and rolled my eyes. “I’m not NOT fucking other girls”

Her eyes teared up. 

“What’s wrong girl?”

“It’s just, I have feelings for you......and I’m not fucking other guys because I want to be with you. And you don’t feel that way about me. That’s how it’s supposed to work. If you feel that way about somebody, then you don’t want to be with other people.”

“Hmmmmm” I said with an intrigued tone.

“Sally, guys and girls are different. I’m really enjoying the time we’re spending together but I’m a guy and I have no desire to stop fucking other girls at this point. We have only been seeing each other for a few months. That’s not long enough in my opinion, to really get to know someone like that.”

With a sulk she said, “I understand.” 

“Do I not spend some quality time with you and have a good god damn time doing it? I’m not sure what you’re concerned about.” I said.

She smiled.

I resumed escalation kissing her.

She stopped me.

“I can’t have sex with you tonight because I have to go home because I have work in the morning and I can’t have sex with someone if I’m not staying the night.” 

“.......ok babe, I’ll walk you out”

She looked deflated.

I walked her to the door and kissed her like it was the last time I would ever see her. 

I closed the door and waited patiently to see what happened next.

Get ready for the shocker.....

NOTHING HAPPENED

That was it. 

She never contacted me again. I never contacted her again. And all is well in the universe. 

I moved forward living my life exactly how I wanted to. 

No commitment. Lifting weights. Making money. Spinning plates. Having great experiences. 

I never posted on askTRP looking for advice on what to say or do to bring her back into my life. 

Honestly I haven’t really given it any thought until right now. There are a million other ways I’ve been spending my time.

Sure, maybe I could have handled the moment differently and kept her spinning for a bit longer, but it was already in the past.

Only here we'll hold you before the mirror, call you a faggot if you are one, and tell you to start with the lifting, read the stuff and implement them for your own good, and respect you when you succeed.** 

I am actually surprised there is actually something called an International Men's Day. I only got to know of it even when a couple of greeting pics got sent on the family group and some friends posted about it on Facebook - it seems to be getting a little popular now -- but obviously it's nowhere on the radar compared to the scale of International Women's Day. 

My first reaction was to imagine a mental image of a beta husband getting butt hurt trying to negotiate validation for himself for being a man with his wife, and getting obviously burned in the process, and telling myself never to become that guy cause a) why take seriously something that changes like the weather and because b) You're a faggot when you live by other people's approval, and die by their rejection. Any husband in my whole family group and virtually everyone in the neighborhood or the entire state could easily be that guy.

So ok, I go to google, search for the men's day messages, and predictably, what I find is :

A lip service to the statistics, the suicides, the homocides, the mental illness, the prison sentences, the homeless men, the dangerous low level jobs, the workplace deaths, the falling academic grades, but NOT the divorce stats, the infertility and low T levels or the false rape claims or dead beadrooms -- of course.

Lots of messages about being emotional, vulnerable, and talking to others about the shit you're actually supposed to fix. Mostly by women, supported by their reverential white knights.

You have people and celebrities with mental and emotional issues, and habits (drugs, alcohol, the like), telling other men to be vulnerable because being vulnerable = showcasing your shit at all levels of your being and not your toned muscular body.

Lots of women approving messages from men who promise to be their saviors and treat them like the princesses they are (while the real issue is only if she actually feels that kind of admiration for her man)

A couple of faggots in ballerina costumes claiming masculinity is a social construct. Or photos of Justin Bieber.

Masculinity is all about men crying pics and memes and that men are shamed into hiding their fragility.

Men's day as a celebration of the fragile beings were are underneath that mask.

A few angry feminists claiming in all their apparently Buddhahood levels of sage wisdom that ""Every day is a man's day. It's women who don't get appreciated"".

Lots of men talking about the challenges and shit they face, what they do to support their families, and the things they've achieved with their sweat and blood and lives, probably expecting women to understand their sacrifices and give them validation and maybe even sex like the great empathetic beings we think they are.

Some messages about how men are fathers, brothers, and husbands and any role that purely exists relative to others in terms of utility. And how they can be better providers at said roles in getting other people's needs met at the cost of their own.

Not one, not ONE image of a guy who lifts and looks healthy. Forget mentally healthy guys. 

Not a single link to anything that actually tells you what you need to do about solving these issues.

Nothing, not one thing, about the athletes, the geniuses, the musicians, the artists, the builders, the talented, the skilled, the sportsmen, the mentally strong, the warriors, the wise, the masters, the heroes, the lovers, the sages, the scientists, the problem solvers, the engineers, the enterpreneurs, the inventors, the garbage cleaners -- not even the men who've made a lot of money !!

Ok, one or two quotes from the great men of the past who actually talked about challenges, grit, strength, character, respect, wisdom and greatness, none of whom exist today. Even if they did they probably couldn't get past the outrage disease. Somewhere down the list, somewhere buried under the haystack.

NOTHING about an attractive man and his qualities, duh, it might just expose the truth. Seriously, I just realized virtually everything that's wrong with the human race in this one search.

All of this shows you just one thing - **society is so fucked they have no fucking clue what a man or masculinity is, or are in denial. They can't give it to you. Masculinity is a gift we learn the hard way, give it to ourselves and show the world where it is.**

If we don't, someone else will set the frame for us, and that will be our prison.

Society's image of a man is all about his utility value and his issues these days. In those days when we spoke of men, we looked at the greatest of our kind - older, wiser, who walked the path, who were respected. We still did until recently, until social media was invented. After that it even became fashionable and the norm to depict the hero as the guy with the biggest issues rather than the most awesome character in the show.

Guys, this world ain't going to see us as anything but a problem or a utility, but only as long as we let them, and act as living proof of their assumptions.

And honestly, no place out there except here now has all the stuff you need to know that will help you become this man you are meant to become. But it's your responsibility to put it all to work. No one can do that for you.

So on International Men's day, let me give you guys something that will actually prove useful to you in your journey to becoming the proud man you are supposed to be (it's where we all start) :

Strong, proud and powerful, he roamed, freely without a care in the world. None could harm him and his majestic power shone freely in his eyes. All the animals looked up to him and through fear and respect as he ruled his domain. 

One day, a beautiful maiden stumbled lost in his domain. Seeking something to fill her heart, she got lost and wandered into his lair.

When she saw him, she screamed in fear and ran away.

Curious, he thought, but paid the strange creature no more attention.

The next day, his keen eyes noticed her looking at him in the distance.

His roar shook the earth itself and she ran in fright back into the shadows, and yet, each day, she kept coming back, and despite his nature, he took comfort in her presence and decided to let her be in his domain. 

Many days passed and the lion grew to enjoy her company. Each day she'd get a little closer so that she could stare at him as he stalked through his kingdom. 

Then one day she brought him a gift. A great meal of the finest meats the lion had ever seen.

The lion fought each day of it's life for everything and this small token brought it a sense of joy. He grew to like this creature and she reveled in his affection and attention.

The days grew to weeks and the two formed a bond. He would permit her stay in his kingdom and enjoy her affection and adoration and in turn he would hunt for her and protect her from anything that threatened her safety.

One day, she brought forth the best meal he had ever had and when done he slept lazily at her side. When she put a collar and chain onto him, he didn't flinch as the realization didn't set. Once it had, he roared and thrashed in fury and anger, but she looked into his eyes and pleaded.

""I just wish to keep you near me, I do not want you to be angry. Look, I will feed you and we shall be together always. Do I not treat you well?""

This was true. She had fed him and cared for him. She gave him comfort that he did not know he ever lacked. While his savage heart reeled at his submission, he knew that his time is not forever and eventually it'll pass. Age and sickness will take him. Maybe it's best to have someone care and assist him.

He did not complain and for awhile things were good.

One day, he heard a sound and looked up from his bed. There stool the maiden and her friends. The eyes of each filled with awe before him. They had come at her request to see this beast that stalks nature. ""So strong and proud,"" they said. They too were seeking something missing and from envy wanted to see themselves.

Emboldened by the chain around him, they threaded onto his domain and disturbed his peace. 

He roared in righteous fury and they fled.

The maiden was not pleased and for many days she did not come to bring him food. He sat there chained to his bed and grew angry at her actions, but that anger turned to hunger, and so, when she came again, he was filled with submission.

""You have scared my friends and they now fear you. Come, I shall file your teeth and remove your claws and show them that you will not be mean.""

This troubled the lion but she looked into his eyes and pleaded.

""Have I not been kind to you? I have I not brought you food? I do not ask for much so please give me this. You have no need for claws and teeth as I will keep you fed and take care of you.""

This was true and while it troubled him, the lion submitted and allowed her to file his teeth and clip his claws.

The weeks turned into months. Without running and hunting, the strength started to ebb away. Without his freedom the lion's pride and majesty eroded. It's claws and teeth removed, the other animals contempt and indifference brought the lion to despair. It spent it's days waiting, staring at it's chains, hoping for the comfort of the maiden. Eager to hear her stories of the outside world and to enjoy the comfort of her company, for none else kept his company.

When she came, her eyes were sullen and she brought him food but there was no mirth or comfort to the action. It was more of duty then of joy. That night she did not stay.

Days passed and her time with him decreased until one day she came to him with no food and no smile.

""I do not feel like I had before,"" she said with little remorse in her voice.

""You are fat and lazy. The pride and joy that I had enjoyed is no longer there. My friends now mock me for all the time that I waste coming to you and I do not feel safe and secure.""

She removed his shackles.

""You are free to go. I have moved on.""

With those words, she walked away from the lion never to return.

A great sadness took him and for many days and nights he lay there hoping for her to return but she never came back.

Its called a IQ test and in general is a good predictor on your capabilities and processing speed. There are two major ones, Mathematical IQ and Verbal IQ. These determine your constant appearance as what happens internally in you but more importantly externally.

Lets showcase four examples of these variations:

Super High Verbal, Super Low Maths: Schizophrenic, someone who is detached from collective language.

Super High Maths, Super Low Verbal: Autistic, clinical dependency with the real.

Higher Maths Than Verbal: Systematizing

Higher Verbal Than Maths: Justifications

Assuming we have a normal person with normal balances then someone who can think mathematically is more inclined towards jobs such as programming or logistics. Their sentences and topics are very consistent and clean. Sometimes bourgeois people virtue signal by inorganically mimicking this trend on social media. Someone with higher verbal tends to want jobs such as sales or whatever requires expression.

The efficiency is determined by potential IQ. In general women are low on both and the smart ones are always higher verbal. Men and betas as a rule are higher maths. Ideally they would compliment each other. ""Before you would have the church (verbal IQ) that would justify men's passions, now with the dissolution of the church the burden is set on the individual"". Hence why we navigate towards chaos and degeneracy as a whole in society.

Lets break into subcategories now. Trivium is the end point of all speech. It is summarized with: 1. Reference points, 2. Grammar, 3. Logic, 4. Rhetoric. Usually there is a strong combination of two with a unimportant theme of others.


Neutral Academic = 1 and 2

Liberal Normie = 2 and 3

Convinced Ideologue = 4 and 3

Teacher Archetype = 1 and 4

There's a split between mathematical and verbal IQ. 1.Reference points and 2.Grammar are on the side of mathematical while 3. Logic, 4. Rhetoric are on the side of verbal. If we were to break down these elements alone they would be something like this.

Fundamental: Reference Points (Ideology)

Carrying Mechanism: Grammar

Highlighting Negative and Positive Outcomes: Logic

Persuasion, finding the right mechanisms that trigger you towards a flow: Rhetoric

When the sum of a cultures individuals are put together then we have a general message forwarded. This can take the form of analytical vs continental philosophy for example. English culture is a symptom of Reference points and Grammar. Their expression is very strong however lack style and meaning. Continentals are the opposite but sometimes ""uninterpretable"" to the reader. Novices usually have strong ideological biases and dogmatic styles that analytics hide. This hiding is done by approaching language from many directions. You could find 4-6 ways to express a given topic if you wanted to. However this dependency is based on your characteristics.

The bitter reality makes us stronger, it makes us see what the gifted ones can't. We all know that we can better ourselves in small things everyday, even if it is just to take a 30 min walk everyday or drinking more water.

But the truth is that when you start to understand that our reality as men is a bitter and cold one, that we are meant to be the grounded pillars and the foundation for others to rise on. Then one thing becomes very god damn clear.

Everything you do matters, but only if you're up for the challenge to become the best version of yourself. The version that people look up to, the version that keeps composed in difficult times and the version that writes and reads to become better everyday.

But then there is the other path, were everything doesn't matter because we don't owe society anything. We are disposable, we drop out of collage at a faster rate than ever before and the suicide rates are over the roof.

From trying out dating sites and day game approach I’ve come to the conclusion that the night club scene is the most consistent way to get laid and add plates for. So I’ve complied a step by step list on how I have through trial and error got a very high success rate going out alone. 

Some background on me

I have been applying the things I’ve read in TRP for about 2 years now and I would say I’ve had great success in only the past 6 months. I go out once a week sometimes twice if I can and I always try to go out alone on at least one night. And for the past 2 months or so I’ve been able to fuck a new girl each week sometimes two. 

Things to know before going out

If you haven’t been working on your social skills, lifting and your personal purpose this will be much harder because you’ll hit road blocks in my steps. No one gives a shit about you in the end so don’t stress looking like a loner or weirdo. Don’t go out to find someone to fuck, go out to have a good time, listen to music, people watch and make friends. You will subconsciously come off as creepy/needy especially to girls, who are highly perceptive, even if you aren’t trying to. “Your subconscious thoughts always project into the real world” 

Step by Step

1.	⁠To start off I’ll say some basic things like : make sure you’re dressed nice (don’t overdue it black is subtle and always a go to) and you have a good cologne on. Moderate jewelry and a nice pair of shoes. Make sure you have condoms and your place is at tidy. If you’re nervous pre-game at your house a little and Uber there if you can it’ll help you lighten up. 

2.	⁠Very important to get their late (10:30-11ish depending on the time your clubs open, close, and have peak population) and make sure it’s a place that has a lot of people in it regularly if it’s a club. If it’s a bar only no cares at all if you’re alone. 

3.	⁠There will be other guys there who are alone or guys in a group who look like they’re having fun. Start a conversation with one : give a guy a compliment in a not weird way or say whatever, tell a joke, or comment on the girls in the club, just make sure this is one of the first things you do. It’ll help you get in the mood to talk to girls later. (Focus on yourself and having fun) Girls will notice this and want to get in on the fun. 

4) Just some things I do to not look like some guy sitting and glaring at people like some lunatic. I always have a drink in my hand and I’m making sure I talk to people near me. Also make sure if there’s music you’re acknowledging it and if you like to dance go dance and if you don’t a simple nod to the beat works. Girls are very observant and if you’ve caught their eye they WILL be watching you. In fact I don’t even think I pick the girls anymore when I go out I feel like I’m picked and I capitalize if she’s hot. Don’t have a scowl! Look approachable and fun without coming off as you just did a line of coke in the back. (Every guy is a creep until proven otherwise unless you’re a chad)

5.	⁠If you see a girls whose solo and you are genuinely ATTRACTED to her go up and say something you’ve observed. I steer away from “hi my name is...” because it’s unoriginal and most girls will put you in a box of normal boring guy. If she’s in a group or you see a group of girls, feel out their vibe and just go for it and talk to the one who looks the chill even if she isn’t your target. Make them laugh and keep it positive and but make sure you’re assertive and if you get hard resistance pull away quick and move on it’s not worth it. (Game and masculine frame mixed with assertive confidence/humor)

6.	⁠Look for IOIs and approach from there, but don’t go with the intent of seeing any. As I said girls will put themselves in your vicinity, they will bump into you, ask you a stupid question and so on. Learn how to distinguish if a girl is actually into you or likes the attention. One way to do this is through keno, things like grabbing her hips and pulling her closer. Making strong eye contact is always a must. Also when talking keep it SHORT! And speak with a deep and loud voice but no in a ridiculous way. Make sure there’s always some form of subtle or not so subtle physical contact. (IOIs and conversing)

7.	⁠If you’ve made it this far it’s hard to fuck it up but very possible. After you’ve got to know her and she’s actually into you I do one of two things : 1) tell her to come dance and grab her hand and move to the dance floor. 2) Say it’s too loud and ask if she wants to go outside for a bit. Let’s say you chose (option A) dance with her, if you “CaNT dAnCe” then just grab her hips and follow her motions while making short/small motions with your hips. If she seems like she wants to kiss do it but pull away shortly after. (Push and pull) Kissing too much will lose you many girls because it’s needy behavior. Or she “doesn’t want to dance or can’t dance” and you go outside, talk for a couple minutes then go to a different more quiet bar. &lt;—— do this step after dancing. (Isolation)

You’re in there don’t fuck it up

8.	⁠This is probably one of the most important steps and the one you can fuck up. She’s going to start gauging your value now if you’re one on one and talking. Hopefully you’ve been on your purpose. You can find out what she likes and sell her a dream or you can be honest and brag about yourself in a humble way that makes your seem like the shit. Don’t give direct answers or spill your guts, mystery is your BEST FRIEND in these situations. Make sure she does 80% of the talking, you don’t have to fill the silences you can look into her eyes silently, this will build sexual tension. (Shit test and display value)

9.	⁠Now see if you can close at your place but make sure there’s some amount of plausible deniability(“Hey there’s this new horror movie on Netflix let’s go watch it at my place”). Or suggest a spot to eat and try to see if she’d like to come home then. If she has friends she might make some excuse she has to stay with them. Get her number and text her that night saying you had a good time and nothing more. (Plausible deniability and logistics)

10.	⁠From this point the girl has always texted me either the next day or that week wanting to meet but if she doesn’t invite her out for drinks or something that will end up with you watching Netflix and you fucking her. (Closing)

Some things that will improve your success rate

This is rarely talked about in trp but girls do have bias so, figure out what kind of girls you truly like and what kind of girls like you. It’ll be more organic and easier. The higher your SMV the less this will matter because you’ll have a bigger pool of girls already initially attracted to you. 

Don’t get super wasted, in fact just enough to relax you is enough. Focus on building confidence in your game while being sober. 

Don’t ever talk to shit faced girls at all. It’s a MeToo gamble that isn’t worth it. 

Don’t compliment her looks, compliment anything else. 

You WILL rejected and you will find some bitches but don’t let it phase you. Never get angry and always leave with a “have a nice night”.

Show her that the outside world (your reality) is something that is worth her letting loose of her resistance and stepping into your adventurous reality that you have full control over. Take her on a journey and turn her life with you into an odyssey. If she starts following a different guiding light, let her roam free and allow the next fresh, new escapade fall into your dimension of reality. Grasp every opportunity in life so that it may become a part of your marvellous reality. Life is short, so make the most out of your time and do not let anything become a stress or barrier in your path to self-actualization. If you feel as if your reality is at an all time low, remember: there may be many shadows in your life right now, but where there are shadows, there is light. In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity. See that opportunity and grasp it now.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Free her from her cage.

One of the hallmarks of a man is being able to create the life you want, and I believe you can do that anywhere. However, having road-tripped for months around the country, certain states feel more like home than others.

I love spending time in midwestern and western (NOT west coast) states. The men are more fun and the women don't chew your head off when you open the door for them. 

The south has a reputation for ""tough"" men or whatever, but they spend a lot of time complaining and posturing, all things that are anti-redpill.

I am in my 30s, got married in my 20s to my high school sweetheart. She is the only girl I dated before we got married, so I had no experience in picking up girls.

I am an average looking non-white guy in New York, I immigrated to the US a few years ago. I'm probably 6 in terms of looks and have started to get a little out of shape, I looked like 7 when I used to work out last year.

I became a millionaire at 25, and make $300k-$400k/yr, my wife is also equally successful in her career.

I am big-time into the house music scene, and I've been going to raves and music festivals since I was 18. I did not start drinking until 21 and didn't do drugs. At some point, I got to know A-list DJs, clubs, music festival owners, etc. and hung out with them backstage or at private events.

**In my 20s:**

I traveled the world to go to the dance music events and music festivals in my early 20s before getting married. These parties were full of hot rave chicks, but I did not approach any girls. Occasionally, I was approached by girls at the parties but I didn't pursue them for three reasons:

1) I did not understand their accent well in loud music since English is not my first language.

2) I wasn't interested since I was in a committed relationship.

3) I'm not good at small talk, even with men. I don't talk much with strangers, but I won't shut up if you get to know me.

**When I hit 30:**

I was a new immigrant in the US, I was focussed on making a life here, buying a big house, nice cars, etc. I almost stopped going to the parties.

I had a nice happy life with my wife but had a boring sex life. I figured life is too short for boring sex life, other than that I had a perfect life.

**Sugar Dating:**

Since I was married and had no game, I ventured into sugar dating. I signed up on an arrangement site, and it seemed like a discreet way to hook up with HB 9s &amp; 10s.

Over the last three years, I've probably hooked up with more than 20 HB 9s &amp; 10s and had multiple threesomes. I've even had threesomes with two smoking hot models who were taller than me (6 ft) and HB 10+

Yes, I gave them an ""allowance"" but it was a small price for me for the discretion this lifestyle offered and the girls were 9s &amp; 10s. I don't have to spend time picking up girls and playing games, I can invest that time to grow my business and make much more money.

I also met some girls who didn't care for money and enjoyed hanging out with me. We enjoyed nice experiences together and they turned into FWBs. I haven't given an allowance to any girl in more than a year.

Some of them were in it for the lifestyle, but some just wanted me for sex.

Since I've been fucking super hot models and Instagram girls, I no longer put hot girls on a pedestal.  Since getting hot girls for me became as easy as getting an Uber, I stopped giving much importance to hot girls. That greatly improved my confidence with women in my normal life as well.

Girls often get flirty with me in my day to day life like at work, friends of friends, social events, etc. But as a rule, I won't have sex with any girl who knows my real name. I want discretion.

**Back into the party scene:**

Over the last year, I got active again in the house music scene and started going to some amazing parties.

This is my natural habitat, unlike many guys, I don't go there to pick up girls. I'm there to enjoy the music and have a blast!

You'll see me on the dance floor very happy, great vibe, and enjoying myself. I dance in a very fun way, people (mostly girls) often come towards me and start mimicking me. They try to talk to me, but I still suck at small talk with strangers and especially in loud music.

I read on this forum on how to approach girls at the clubs, but that made it even more difficult for me. I can approach girls, but can't make small talk.

**Molly changed the game:**

I recently started doing molly at the parties, I do it occasionally, once in 3-4 months.

I didn't need MDMA to have fun, I was having a lot of fun already! But it turned me into a social butterfly.

On molly, I'm on fire! I am like the life of the party! A lot of people (mostly girls or groups of girls &amp; guys) come up to me, chat, dance and take pictures with me.

I also go talk to a lot of girls. I'm not even trying to pick them up, I'm just having fun. I don't even think, when a girl makes eye contact, I just flirt automatically. I don't even think of what to say, it flows smoothly, and rejection is not even a thing. If I'm not trying to pick her up, I can't be rejected 💁‍♂️ I don't even pay attention to what she is saying and escalate it to dancing, touching and kissing.

One night I said to a girl who was dancing next to me, ""You're fucking hot!"". She responded in awe, ""WHAT???"". I said again, ""YOU'RE FUCKING HOT!"". Then she said, ""nobody ever says like that"". Two minutes later, we were making out.

I don't even care if they're with a guy, I just go for it!

Some guy randomly high fived me and then introduced me to his crew. One of the girls was taking more interest in me than the rest of the group, I flirted with her a little and then asked for her number saying ""let's hang out sometime!"". She refused by pointing to her boyfriend next to her, I laughed out and said: ""okay.. you can hang out with him 😝"". Then she took my phone, put in her number and said: ""we can all hang out..."". A few days later, I texted and hooked up with her.

Last time I went to a rave on molly, I must have interacted with at least 30 girls. I made out with 7 of them and ended up with many selfies with the girls and their phone numbers on my phone. All of them at least HB 8+, I don't take interest in girls less than that.

The bad part? You can't get hard while on molly, so I gotta text them back after a day or two and go from there.

I don't want to use molly often, but it showed me a different side of my personality. My social game has gotten much better, even when I'm not doing molly.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,MDMA Changed The Game,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dy8kdc/mdma_changed_the_game/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

I'll keep short as a friendly reminder for you guys and myself as well: be grateful that you have it harder than other people, because now you have the opportunity to start your self-improvement journey and will eventually learn a shit ton of stuff that will be useful for other men in a similar situation.

**Learning point 2nd last Paragraph**

&amp;#x200B;

How I came to TRP

&amp;#x200B;

The Sweet Girl

 I am a 19 year old boy in Singapore, I came to hear of the RedPill 2 years ago (but didn't look into it) when I stumbled across MGTOW. It was definitely the lowest point in my life. I had been surprised by a girl (who I was emotionally invested into) with a boyfriend of 8 months. Not because she came clean with me, but because her friend who had a crush on me sold her out. I am an INTP(was reading about how some here happen to be as well, considering we prize truth above all else) and I am terrible at reading social cues and stuff like that. When I asked that girl who had a crush on me why she didn't communicate with her boyfriend, she laughed and I was genuinely confused. I guess this shows I was also absolutely blind to the fact that my concept of a relationship was completely wrong and that I'd been led on by someone who already was attached. I was a firm believer that WE ARE A TEAM. But i couldn't be more wrong. The crushing blow from that girl I had oneitis for was compounding in pain as the MGTOW videos I watched from Sandman broke me, I dare not go back there for the pain was incomprehensible.

&amp;#x200B;

Marriage and the Mother

I had a throbbing headache that left me physically incapacitated(lying down was the only way to ease the pain) and thought it could not be worse. But I was wrong, for the truths revealed to me the state of my parents marriage. I thought back to the days she kissed him goodbye as he left for work when I was about 5. Now I know all hope for him to share even a hug with her is lost. The financial crisis of 2008 tore my father's job away and my mom had just given birth. I never took heed to notice any of their feelings, but one day as I was going to school my dad asked, ""Just saying, if mommy and daddy go different way who would you choose?"" He was in despair, I could see but not feel. Deep in my heart I swore my brothers would choose my mother for she would often spoil them, I didn't answer my father, I just knew I'd go with him. Shit was happening as my mother refused to speak to us and my older brother and I hid away in our rooms knowing something was wrong but I never really thought about it then. My dad took us out for a long walk at a park without our mother for the first time. I lashed out at my mother when I came to recognize the things Sandman had said. It was true. I couldn't believe it. I was broken. She did not love him, or seem to care much for his concerns. My caring Mother. What a monstrosity of a wife. These sort of incidents start to resurface and slowly the confirmation that I had been BLIND my whole life. My dad came to me(obviously manipulated by my mother), trying to resolve my anger and hatred. I told him to tell that woman to talk to me herself, he pleaded and I walked off. I am a terrible son. It was only after a month or so that things seemed to go back to the norm. But I was policing that woman now, I confronted her everytime she disrespected my father and glared at her with fury. Fast forward 2 years from then,things got better, I stopped explaining things and treated her as a kid. MIRACLE. Instead of telling her to fix her diet I told her she's fat and so on. Today the more playful dynamic soon sets in peace for my household.

&amp;#x200B;

I did not learn my lesson

I told myself I wouldn't like anyone else after that. I did. After getting over that girl, in about a year and a half I came to idealize this girl who in my eyes was proper, pure and sweet. I ended up GIVING her my number(coward) instead of asking for hers, telling her that I'd be there for her if she needed anything. Obviously she didn't text me lol. I grew more desperate for her as graduation approached. It was to wish her well, a bouquet of flowers and a card on the day before the final examinations. It was great seeing her accept and smile, but she appeared fearful later on in the day and her friend upon seeing me took her hand and whisked her away. I felt like a Monster.  I am a catholic boy, and I'd always promise myself that I'd take care of a girl and commit to her before I ever made a move. What a delusional idiot. I watched this sweet girl change from what I adored in her, a SIMPLE girl who focused on her studies, to an Alpha female of sorts as the girls in her class all came to know my deeds and flocked around her as though she was some queen. She even began trying to flaunt her ability to get my attention at ease which was astounding to her friends as I never ever bothered looking at any other girls and actively avoided/ignored those that liked me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Saving Grace?

I was sad, truly sad. I did everything that the Church, the society and media told me. I was truly hoping that it would be rewarding, but instead I was punished. In even MORE desperation I sought out the one person that came to mind. The one that comforted me, my teacher. I texted her telling her just about everything(even that I was crying lol), and she essentially guided me and took care of my emotional concerns. She even went to get some articles for me to read up on for relationships. I really do admire her. I find it incredibly difficult to apply some of the red pill knowledge to her like ""all women are whores"" and such. She has made sacrifices to save the environment and stuff as such as she is one of many fighting climate change and that was interesting to me as I don't remember a time I'd EVER see a woman sacrifice her comfort without a significant gain.

&amp;#x200B;

Relevant characteristics of Singapore: Basically 1 in 5 are rich as heck. I am in an above average school so more rich ppl. I am not unfortunately, and there is a class divide. I am in the middle portion luckily. 

Education is tough as nuts, high up in global ranking

Very traditional, women push for the singles to marry

NATIONAL SERVICE: Male nationals serve for 2 years usually age 18-21 thereabout, I always had a gripping fear of losing her (thespecialone) when I was in the army to someone else. That primal rage of jealousy when I think of someone else having her, and worse the thought of her enjoying it or deceiving me to cheat.

 According to a recent Durex survey that listed the **average age** people **lose** their **virginity**, **Singapore's** was 22.8, which was the third oldest after Malaysia (23) and India (22.9).

How the 16-18 year old  ~~princesses~~  girls are like: 

The girls are incredibly self-entitled and have ridiculously high egos, they need reality checks.

Lazy as !@#$ never would see them push themselves during sports lessons, I detested them for it. I scolded a girl and her friend was pleasantly surprised by my dominance(I was honestly confused)

I noticed that the girls would use us as emotional  [**whatchamacallit**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=whatchamacallit)  and it became painfully obvious that they didn't care for us(except the girls that seemed into me). I really hate them for it, the way they abuse my friends and treat them with so little respect. I know that my friends allowed them to out of lack of confidence or general niceness but I was JUST like them. I remember following a girl around in school when I was 16, I felt AMAZING. I was finally accepted. That feeling, how many of us guys can feel? I can tell you I'd think myself miserable but I know some girls do like me and sometimes it makes a hellish day feel that tiny bit better, really helps.

&amp;#x200B;

Learning points: 

* My faith into Religion,Media and Society had led me to not see the world around me
* Girls are incredibly manipulative and inconsistent with rules
* Girls enjoy following more than leading, dominance seems to be true
* Focus on friends and family, males before females
* Men are human doings, only women and children have a right to simply being
* Life is honestly summing itself up to be a game of nature
* Men with the looks really kill the rules for any woman(definitely for those in their teens)

Can you help me with the following?!

I am 3 days into TRP. I have been absolutely engrossed and grossed. I feel like life has no meaning.

* What should I do to get forward with life. It seems that the lifelong dream of marriage is done and dusted, but in my heart I still crave an LTR. I still dream the woman to be immaculate, I really do. Even if I went on and became successful with LTR I believe the woman would want marriage and that would really mess me up so its not a good idea. I want to be able to do the things that you guys are able to, pickup and so on. However, the housing options are incredibly expensive so I am not sure how I can isolate.. Any ideas??
* I am curious to know how to help fellow men who are feeling helpless and trapped to find freedom, true that the blue pill might leave them happier but only if they do not end up married.. Is there a way I can save my father?
* Is there a way to save my friends who still want to get married?
* What do I do with the women in my life that  I care about(my teacher who picked me up and cared for me,my mother and aunt)?
* Do any of you want to hermit or go into isolation?

What is your endgoal in life? I appreciate all your input, thank you so much for your time. It has been a time of immense growth for me. I really struggle to see the unfaithfulness of women in my society and as such has made it difficult for me to swallow the pill.

I started my self-improvement journey ten years ago, back in my freshers year of university.  I was eighteen, struggled academically due to my disabilities, and could barely socialise. I had the mind set that as long as I got to go home and play computer games at the end of the day, nothing else mattered. One night, I was sitting in my dorm room watching some slice of life anime and thinking ""Damn, I wish I had friends and fun times like these."" I knew at that point I wanted to change, so from then on, I threw myself into every social situation I could. I had lot's of ups and downs over the next couple of years, learning lessons and picking up skills that most people had learn't at a younger age.

After five years, I started to really get into the swing of things. I felt my confidence and ability were average, I'd but there was still this underlying anxiety. My competitiveness with some acquaintances made me feel bad if I didn't pull, and I felt scared that I was going fall down the social hierarchy ladder if I didn't show to some events. 

One night, I was at a hotel convention and was drinking with a load of new people I'd just met. There was this one girl, maybe a 6 or 7 in the group, who was laughing along and generally joining us in a good time, but I didn't really notice her. We decided to go join some other people in a comfy seating area, but after sitting down, I noticed that she was left standing, with no where to sit. Without thinking, I immediately looked her in the eyes, and patted my leg, indicating for her to sit down in my lap. She went ahead sat down, and I casually put my arm around her waist without thinking. We then spent maybe half an hour chatting and laughing in our group, I didn't even think about how physically engaged I was with this girl.

Eventually my drinks ran out, and at £8.50 for a double vodka and coke at the bar, I decided to get more from my room. I invited her to come grab some with me, and when I took her back to my room, she immediately slumped down on my bed without me even asking and suggesting. I scored that night, and shortly after I realised something.  


**""I got laid with one of hottest girls I'd been with, and all I did that night was focus on having a good time""**

&amp;#x200B;

Previously, when It came to girls and socialising, I had these pressures I put on myself that limited my enjoyment and how much my confidence  shone through. After I realised this, I knew that in order to look confident, all I had to do was focus on having a good time when I went out. When I did, I enjoyed my time with other people much more, I connected with other people, I laughed more, I was a more genuine person and scored with girls much more often. 

Ten years ago I'd have ranked myself a 3/10, but these days, I feel like a solid 9, and all of this is because I''ve learnt to enjoy my time with people. To those starting there journeys, and those that have been with us along time, remember, learn to enjoy you time with other people. When you do, that's when you will grow more, and that's when the best you will shine through.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,The one piece of advice I would give the younger version of myself.,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dxr6z7/the_one_piece_of_advice_i_would_give_the_younger/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

But many younger men don't know what their mission is; it sounds too theoretical and larger-than-life. Does a man have to change the world in order to become alpha? Surely that task seems discouraging. I too felt that way at one point. I had no mission and didn't know how to find one.

Until a career mentor gave me some advice: every morning when I enter the office, I should write down projects that I need to work on that day.

That specific advice didn't help me find my ""mission"" per se, but it did keep me focused and organized at my job. However, I gradually realized that the advice's concept could be applied to other aspects of my life. Now, every morning when I awake, I ask myself, ""What do I need to accomplish today?"" My self-answer includes everything like chores, career, hobbies, social situations, and much more. I mentally list everything that I need to do before I rest my eyes again that evening.

By asking myself this question every morning, I see the bigger picture (aka my mission) over time and break it down to manageable tasks. For example, I am on the planning committee for a Thanksgiving Day parade that has been a neighborhood tradition for decades. So during the past few weeks, I have knocked out all of my responsibilities day-to-day. One day I need to solicit sponsors. Another day I need to send applications to parade entrants. Another day I need to advertise on social media. And so on. This all leads up to the big event, which I know will be successful.

I encourage young TRPers to follow this method. When you wake up, think through every single task that is on your plate for the next 16 hours. Write a physical list if you need to. It ensures that nothing falls through the cracks, and allows you to steadily progress through large projects. Consequently, you will improve mentally, find and stick to your mission, and be one step closer to realizing your masculinity.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Ask Yourself This Question Every Morning,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dxq1rp/ask_yourself_this_question_every_morning/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Lately I’ve been craving to argue with people, to openly disagree with them, to refuse their requests and to shut down their opinions. I feel that, in this softened society I - and many others – live in, strangers are all just expected to agree with each other, go through the motions and act like we really, *really*, care for one another and are best friends just because we happen to live in roughly the same place. To me this feels extremely artificial and tiring. 

It’s not like I hate my neighbours, my colleagues and the strangers I see every day, nor am I looking to just go out and pick a fight, but I just want to be kept on my toes – to keep my mental edge sharp so that someone truly dangerous or aggressive doesn’t sneak up on me and screw me over some day. Heck, I’d even welcome running into a disagreeable person who could give me some harmless attitude, for a change.

I’ve been noticing this more and more ever since I started changing to TRP mindset. I think it’s a consequence of me wasting much less time and energy on meaningless bullshit, with the consequent surplus in vitality and mental energy making me edgier and more active. Now more than ever I willingly put myself in uncomfortable situations, venture into the unknown on my own and interact more actively with strangers while making less and less effort to please them or appear like a nice guy, all because I think these things will contribute to my personal development and make me a more grown, experienced individual. Plus, it’s very rewarding when you run into an unknown situation in which you can only depend on yourself and realize you have to rely on past experience and knowledge to solve the problem.

You've hit the weights. You're financially free. You have strong friendships and a close family. You have a hot regular gf. You have various interesting hobbies. You can speak another language. You constantly travel. You have a life most people would dream of.

You're the most confident person you know, yet here you are, still resorting to the internet to fulfil your biological desire, and to exercise your will as a man.

I am of course talking about (social) anxiety, online dating, and our mind's tendency to rationalise using Tinder in order to the reduce discomfort of going out and meeting people. Or perhaps taking the path of least resistance, regardless of anxiety. It's easier to press buttons on your phone than to go out and find people. Particularly in unfamiliar territory.

But why do you subject yourself to such limitations? Why do you confine yourself to a world characterised by infinite validation for women, and infinite struggle for any man below the top 5% of looks (or rather, the top 5% of photos)?

After all, what normal person has the time or inclination to sit inside staring at their phone for hours upon end, hoping that they'll somehow find happiness. Expectations are created that you can never really meet. You might be working ""hard"", but you're certainly not working ""smart"". It is no coincidence that the only true meaningful connections you've formed online were with those who had just downloaded the app.

Even your ex understands: *""You can get someone way better than me. You could find a supermodel. I don't feel like I'm enough. I'm just the best you could get on Tinder""*.

And even if you did find her and manage to talk to her, how could she possibly realise your true value through pixels on a screen? How could she know you're a better choice than the 1000 other sets of pixels whom are desperate to meet her? Have you ever seen Tinder from a girls perspective? By merely being female, she is stuck in analysis paralysis. The only sane way forward is for her to choose the 2-3 best sets of pixels and meet them.

By not putting yourself out there in the real world, you are doing all of the kind, hot, interesting girls a huge disservice. They want to meet you and you are depriving them of joy and happiness. The lone foreign girl sat on the park bench is craving your masculine presence. The 8 at the burrito place is pissed off that she has to wait for you to come and buy your lunch to be able to talk to you. The shop assistant feels like you rejected her after you ignoring her obvious signs of interest.

Remember your life motto: ***""happiness and contentment aren't determined by what you have now, but rather by your known (and proven) ability to be able to get what you want, when you want it"".***

If you know that can't walk up to her and make her yours, then you aren't quite there.

Yes it is uncomfortable. But it is 10x better than living a life of perpetual mediocrity.

*Disclaimer for those who think in binary*: I am not necessarily telling you to avoid online. Of course it has its benefits, if you have good enough pictures and perhaps limit your usage. Just remember that you will always be able to get better quality in person. Not to mention have more fun and develop yourself as a person.

But, for me personally, I notice my happiness increases drastically every time I completely remove all dating apps and social media. I get more done, and I form more meaningful connections every time. I Believe that expectation (via dating apps etc) can lead to disappointment, which leads to unhappiness.

yet, in the last five months i have made more gains just by working out in my apartment than i did in those 2 years. you can push so much harder when its just you and the weights. it becomes almost a spiritual experience. yes, you should still hit the gym for those exercises that you can't do at home (otherwise neighbors might get hella mad when you drop barbells, especially if you are not on the first floor) plus its important to network with other guys into lifting, and hitting on chicks. many advantages. this would be done in addition to that.

i know you all already lift and are probably bigger than me, but i am proselytizing this solitary lifting strategy to everyone now. working out solo is a game changer. 

if you are fully against eating processed food or vegan food, the post ends here. cheers.

\---

you might consider buying huel if you are currently lean bulking or recomping. it is a nutritionally complete food, a powder you mix into water just like protein powder, except it contains every vitamin and mineral recommended by the food administrations in both the USA and the UK. get berry powder huel if you can, the rest of them suck. it is the love child of a top nutritionist and a body builder. its not super cheap at 10 dollars per 2000 calories, but its cheap enough, its got hella protein, everything you need to survive, and prepping food before weight lifting becomes entirely unnecessary. you can use it to replace meals for those off days you don't feel like cooking. use that extra time on your mission.

one thing about huel you should know is that this shit makes you fart like crazy if you haven't already been on a lean diet (high fiber, occasional probiotics, low gi/sugar). this can be avoided though frequent bathroom breaks, but if your job doesn't allow for this adjustment period, or if you have a nut allergy, huel may not be for you. i don't work for huel, although [i post on their forums a lot](https://discourse.huel.com/t/huel-for-one-year/5765?u=omikes), and i don't bother referring people because their referral program sucks and isn't as good as just buying in bulk. 

for those weary of a food that is comprised entirely of ground up seeds and nuts and what effect it will have on their health, my health is better than ever. it makes me feel full. old reviews of huel mention that its gross, but its the vanilla flavor they are talking about. vanilla flavor is gross. berry flavor is more like a light berry aftertaste, mostly it tastes like berry flavored nothing. just a mild taste (unless you drink only huel for a while, then it tastes pretty good, i don't drink it for the taste, i drink it for the time it saves in my life). a recent blood test showed all my vitamin levels are within the healthy range, my blood pressure was literally 121/80 last time i went to the doc, and i feel great. 

it is vegan, but for those worried about the protein quality, it isnt just pea protein. the protein is a combination of pea protein, oats, brown rice, flaxseed, and mct powder. these ingredients contain all nine essential amino acids (Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Valine) from which all amino acids can be produced from your body. 

I have gained an inch on my arms in the last six months at only a small 300 calorie surplus. for full disclosure, i am also taking creatine, rosemary extract (for the ursolic acid), lactic acid, and several supplements that keep your testosterone from dropping if you are deficient in them (magnesium, copper to absorb the magnesium, some others).

i am not a vegan. tomorrow i am going to eat a jimmy johns blt and i am looking forward to that shit immensely. i only eat huel when i am not with company (just like my drinking policy, outside of tonight...) the only reason i am recommending this product is that i have benefited hugely from the red pill community and this product has made body building so much easier than it used to be when i used to have to cook ground beef, eggs, and make tuna sandwiches all the time. 

If you don't want to fuck with it, and think i'm being a lazy sack, i respect the hell out of that to. If i'm being objectively honest (which i am when i am drunk like now) i should probably learn to be even more disciplined and eat natural foods, but i've been either losing weight or gaining muscle for about a year and a half straight now. if anyone is completely exhausted, but still wants to press forward, maybe this advice will be of some use.

feel free to shit on me too and tell me everything thats clearly wrong with me that you can discern from this post. i have a bad habit of getting tunnel vision in general and am uniquely capable of taking constructive criticism.

That you have no right to be entitled; because as a man nobody is going to support you or even care about you. Furthermore that you have no right to be a victim because a male victim, perceived or otherwise, is a pathetic thing and the cruel anonymous hand of ""society"" will smack you down for even asserting such. 

**All of this is is true.** 

However, there is another side that is not talked about, and is often horrendously contrarian opinion to have in many societies. **You owe nothing to society**. You owe nothing to the world at large and have no obligation to contribute anything to your country, your government, the greater good, or any abstraction used to shame people down certain lifelong pigeonholes. It starts with recognizing that Humanity, as much as we have changed in the modern world, still operates in our caveman tribe mentality. Those who are members of our tribe we are comfortable around, those who aren't are shamed, ostracized, or killed. (Ie Patriotism). We are members of many tribes with varying attachments to each; (family, political party, friend group, province, country, etc). As much as we consider ourselves rational beings, we often do not even see the tribal biases that subconsciously influence our opinions. It stems from our comfort and poor ability to see the thought processes of others that went into their own tribal opinions. **Each time you feel that tinge of annoyance at someones behavior (especially a stranger), remember that it likely does not have any effect on your life at all, and that letting it affect you will only hamper your own growth. We live and die by our choices, and so will they.**

None of this is inherently a bad thing. Tribal mentality kept us alive for millennia and supported the propagation of the species. The problem is when these tribal frameworks become intertwined with morality and ethical obligations. 

*Eg. The repulsion one feels when they are next to someone who is mentally ill on the bus. And the extension of this is the institutionalization and over-medication of those that we consider deviating from the societal norms of behavior which we are quick to classify as mental illness.* 

*Eg. The public shaming of MGTOW because they arnt marrying post wall women and supporting the ""Plan"" for a normal life.* 

*Eg. The kids who arnt getting jobs and playing video games all day in their parents basement, because they arnt being a good worker citizen and paying taxes.* 

**How do we act in this sort of world?**

The most terrifying thing today is the use of mob force, providing anonymity to its individual members. It takes a level of courage to reject the approved paths laid out for us, and in a way that is what we at TRP are doing. **Shaming doesn't have to affect our mental equilibrium or inner peace. Inner peace that only comes from living in accordance with the ethical code that you have devised for yourself.** These codes are only formed through critical thinking, asking ourselves: *Does this make sense? Why am i doing this?,* even while the whole world tells you it does, and if it doesn't, being content with watching the world burn in their error. 

Once you get up on a soapbox and start preaching your personal code as a way of life to others, one that only makes sense through your personal mental processes, you become part of the problem and the cycle repeats.

In the end, you cant change society behavior, you can only change your own. If you wish to toss your ""obligation"" to social utilitarianism out the fucking window; and dont get married, dont follow ""the american dream"", dont vote, play video games and jerk off in your basement, never do anything charitable for African children, never shower, do drugs, sprint across the street when the light says stop, let a loud fart rip in a silent church service, or kill yourself; society will hate you for it. Some people on TRP might even hate you for it. Everyone wants to give you 10 rules to live your life by, but ultimately you are the only person that can live the one life you're given and in the end, **You have a choice.**",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,You owe society nothing.,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dxd0wc/you_owe_society_nothing/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

So while I searched for said thread I stumbled upon this gem. For reference, asktrp has 65k members right now. This abomination, has with 204k members, thrice as much.

Sluts reinforcing sluts. That's only half as fun as it sounds. I'm not posting anything of it here but there's enough firewood to last me several lifetimes.

Let me tell you this. The anger phase comes in waves. Whenever I think that I've seen it all, some woman that I know of or who my friends know, unlocks another level of degeneracy that I cannot even fathom.

Two recent examples -

I had set up a date with this girl at my Uni that my professor said was interested in me. The girl was all for it, then I reposted one of my fav Instagram model’s posts to my story without really thinking much of it. A few hours later she texts me calling the date off realizing she has to work blah blah blah lol I just said “okay”. 

Another one was when I added this 10/10 on Instagram. Hit her up to arrange a date once or twice, she talked like she was interested then flaked twice. I soft nexted, and funny enough I picked up a weekend job where she just so happened to work too. Completely random. She was caught so off guard, I was teasing her etc. she was like a 6-7 in person.

I have been around the block and tried just about every sort of M/F, MFF, MFFFFF relationship - FWB, ONS, LTR, STR, MOLTR. I used to date a lot in the 90s, and in the two decades that followed. Some things are always gold - be above average physically, hold frame, amused mastery. However in this goddamn clown world we live in things change. The goal posts keep on changing and it has made me turn my mind to what works best for right now. After Strauss published The Game it was all about peacocking and canned lines. Then along came TRP and it was about getting jacked and abundance mentality. What I am about to suggest is that things are changing yet again, welcome to the current era where normal is the new black.

I should explain what I mean by “normal”. I am deliberately using a term which is flexible. In the 1930s it would have been normal to respectfully approach a girl’s father and ask him if it was OK to take his daughter out. In the 70s/80s it was normal to meet a girl at a disco, in 2015 tinder was the place to be. So what’s next? I think it is time to give normal a chance. So what would be a normal way to pick up attractive consenting female adults for fun times in 2020 and beyond?

I just act normal. No game, no lines, no manipulation. Cute girl at coffee shop, walk straight up to her, say she seems friendly and ask if she would like to join you for a chat. Instadate or get her number and meet up. Laugh, have some fun, hold her hand. If she responds positively, escalate and close. Badda bing badda boom. You catch a girl’s eye, you smile, she smiles back. You approach and she is open. You have a nice simple interaction, no canned lines, no tricks, no negging, no preselection, no disqualifying yourself, no stupid tricks, just two grown ups having a chat. It either leads to something more, or it doesn’t, rinse and repeat. Same thing online, have fun, don’t act weird, don’t overthink shit, just act normal.

We are now living in a post game era. When the normies are running game it is time for red pilled men to cease and desist. Women want the guy who is different and I am asserting that being “normal” is now different. Girls are so used to dudes running game that the guy who refuses to play the game just stands out. It goes without saying that this will not work if you are overweight/ underweight/ dressed like a homeless guy/ bad posture/ bad hygiene etc. However if you are above average in your physical fitness (this is not optional), you own a few nice shirts and you can look a girl right in the eyes while having a normal conversation, then you should really try this out. 

Oh and don’t text, ring her up. Sexting is fine as in my experience it always leads to the real thing but generally text is just for logistics.

The first major target/victim of the Indian MeToo movement has come forward with irrefutable proof in a true TRP fashion of how Kukreja, the vile psycho who spearheaded the movement and all his false accusers completely fabricated their very serious claims and jumped on the bandwagon. Here's the [first post](https://twitter.com/Wootsaw/status/1197466305495846913?s=20), check his twitter for the complete thread.

The man does a systematic takedown of all the doctored/out of context screenshots and of the false accusations. The response of these women? 'wHy diD hE kEEP thE ScrEensHOTs??' The whole spiel about 'continuing and withdrawn consent' is drawn out, the time he took to come back with the rebuttal (1 year) is questioned, the fact that he disclosed the identities of these false accusers is made a big deal of, all the while conveniently sidestepping the women's guilt with gems like 'no victims is perfect' and 'people misremember things'.

I'll let y'all read the actual details but I have to point out that while this guy's life and career (he was a comedian) was utterly ruined, this Kukreja women made an international career out of it.

""I only fucked her once, at the start, 5 months ago""

Saturday late night, no plans just trying to finish reading a book. I get a message and catch a glimpse of who sent it, almost immediately he calls, i know what this is about. Asks me what my plans are and if we can grab a couple beers. -- This happened as well when his gf said she needed time to think, i shared some info on what might happen and what he should do. -- Childhood friend and always have a good time with him, i get dressed and hit a plate to fuck after (we did, and she got anxious af but not the point). 

We catch up for a while and talk but he seems reluctant to talk about his girl, so i bring it up. 

How's the girl? ""Not so fine, we were supposed to go out today but she's having dinner with an old friend""

We all know what that probably means.

So i told him, that's a red flag. 

""It's worse"" ... How could this possibly be worse? ""He's driving her home after"" -- I lacked imagination it seemed. --

He showed me the text she sent, i told him if you tell her not to do it she will lash out and do it anyways, but you can't let this be, first don't answer her text, she'll will notice this and might understand you're not ok with this (which did happen), then you have to let her know this is not ok.  ""Well she has gone out with friends and without me before, but i don't mind them, they seem ok, she introduced us a while ago"".  That's ... worrysome. ""Right, i'm not mad right now, just dissapointed"". 

He proceeds to tell me she has problems at home and might be the reason for her being disstant as well. She doesn't work so he pays for everything when they go out, he drives her everywhere. ""I know this is not what i should be doing but you know ... "" he proceeds to rationalize his and her behaviour. 

Let me ask you this : how often do you fuck her? ""I only fucked her once, at the start, about 5 months ago"" ... dude ""I know but whenever i try to be sexual or initiate anything something comes up, shes busy, im busy (i call bs on that) or she's on her period"" ""And it wasn't like this at the start, i fucked her brains out and she was giving me bj on traffic, we sexualized heavy on text"" I read the conversation, he's right, they were being pretty sexual over text. ""But now every time i sexualize over text she just ignores me"" He shows me the messages, can't remember context or exact message but he wrote something like:

 I want to bend you over, pull your hair, rub your clit with my dick and wait until you beg me to fuck you. 

She replied next day with ""Hi"" didn't even adress the message. And it happened a couple times after. 

I show him some of my messages where i sexualize, i tell him a bit about the plate im fucking after we finish. He's receptive to everything and likes my train of thought (so trp train of thought for the most part). 

""If a girl told me she was interested in me right now i would break up with my gf"" -- looking back, i didnt really discuss this with him but i should've told him to drop her and start going out again. --

I told him to ignore her more, he's always available, to go out and post some pics with some female friends (or just females) and frame it like he met with an old friend. To change his behaviour because nothing will change unless you make it change. 

At the end of night he suggests a double date, me thinking it was just a let's get together again type of comment, i let it slide and tell him sure.

Hits me up couple days later, ""so i told my gf about that double date, she's down with it"". Fuck.

 For a man, having a lot of sexual experience means you have work for it because we now it's the man who lead and provides energy to make the seduction. So a man that have sex often symbolise the work. Before to do that, he needs to have a great situation that means to earn money, he needs to have an attractive body that mean he go lift.

*EDIT : Yeah. It's really late. I've wondered why the hell I've not been able to get this post up despite trying continuously for like a week now. As it turns out, reddit is too touchy about me using some politically incorrect, but factually correct labels.*

I am actually surprised there is actually something called an International Men's Day. I only got to know of it even when a couple of greeting pics got sent on the family group and some friends posted about it on Facebook - it seems to be getting a little popular now -- but obviously it's nowhere on the radar compared to the scale of International Women's Day. I am pretty shocked that such a thing is even allowed to exist in today's popular narrative. Surely it can only mean one thing...

For the record, a typical women's day in my extended family and social circles usually involves the women doing whatever it takes when she thinks she hasn't got enough of validation from the men (which is the norm). So being butt hurt is essentially their right on this day.

My first reaction was to imagine a mental image of a beta husband getting butt hurt trying to negotiate validation for himself for being a man with his wife, and getting obviously burned in the process, and telling myself never to become that guy cause one, why take seriously something that changes like the weather and because you're a fool when you live by other people's approval, and die by their rejection, without any authenticity. Any husband in my whole family group and virtually everyone in the neighborhood or the entire state could easily be that guy. What else would men's day even be for?

So ok, I go to social media, search for the men's day messages, and predictably, what I find is a curated collection :

A lip service to the statistics, the men taking their lives, the men getting killed, the mental illness, the prison sentences, the homeless men, the dangerous low level jobs, the workplace deaths, the falling academic grades, but NOT the divorce stats, the infertility and low T levels or the false abuse claims or dead beadrooms -- of course.

Lots of messages about being emotional, vulnerable, and talking to others about the shit you're actually supposed to fix. Mostly by women, supported by their reverential white knights.

You have people and celebrities with mental and emotional issues, and habits (drugs, alcohol, the like), telling other men to be vulnerable because being vulnerable = showcasing your shit at all levels of your being and not your toned muscular body.

Lots of women approving messages from men who promise to be their saviors and treat them like the princesses they are (while the real issue is only if she actually feels that kind of admiration for her man)

A couple of male jokers in ballerina costumes claiming masculinity is a social construct - I don't think I can unsee that. Or photos of Justin Bieber.

Masculinity is all about men crying pics and memes and that men are shamed into hiding their fragility.

Men can be feminine -- no seriously look up Twitter right now, you'll get it in 30 seconds of scrolling.

Men's day as a celebration of the fragile beings were are underneath that mask. To all the strong men out there...

An actual message that claims Men's Day actually happens on April 1st...

Let's talk, let's talk. Open up. (so we can find out if you've got issues and put you into the reject bin). Usually at a meet chaired by women. But do nothing of worth.

A few angry feminists claiming in all their apparently Buddhahood levels of sage wisdom that ""Every day is a man's day. It's women who don't get appreciated"". In today's America (and the rest of the developed world).

Lots of men talking about the challenges and shit they face, what they do to support their families, and the things they've achieved with their sweat and blood and lives, probably expecting women to understand their sacrifices and give them validation and maybe even sex like the great empathetic and understanding beings we think they are. Guess who upvoted?

Some messages about how men are fathers, brothers, and husbands and any role that purely exists relative to others in terms of utility where the man is a sacrificial offering. And how they can be better providers at said roles in getting other people's needs met at the cost of their own.

Some people pointing out that the equality of sexes is so fake in real life. But...

Not one, not ONE image of a guy who lifts and looks healthy. Forget mentally healthy, mentally strong guys. Men are strong? Mentally strong? Wow, since when?

Not a single link to anything that actually tells you what you need to do about solving these issues.

Nothing, not one thing, about the athletes, the geniuses, the musicians, the artists, the builders, the talented, the skilled, the sportsmen, the mentally strong, the warriors, the wise, the soldiers, the masters, the heroes, the lovers, the sages, the scientists, the problem solvers, the engineers, the enterpreneurs, the inventors, the garbage cleaners -- not even the men who've made a lot of money !!

Ok, one or two quotes from the great men of the past who actually talked about challenges, grit, strength, character, respect, wisdom and greatness, none of whom exist today. Even if they did they probably wouldn't get past the outrage disease. Somewhere down the list, somewhere buried under the haystack.

Nothing appreciating a man by the larger society or women. Just a few men patting themselves on the back.

NOTHING about an attractive man, and his qualities, duh, it might just expose the truth.

Seriously, I just realized virtually everything that's wrong with the human race in this one search. Wikipedia seems to claim it's legit and it's meant to help men's issues (it was started by a man after all, and apparently he faced a lot of opposition from feminists), but I wonder if at the end they've actually made any kind of positive difference in even one man's life so far.

All of this shows you just one thing - society is so fucked they have no fucking clue what a man or masculinity is, or are in denial. They can't give it to you. Masculinity is a gift we learn the hard way, give it to ourselves and show the world where it is.

Also social media is very highly biased in favor of the blue pilled narrative. All search engines and social media sites boosted any message supporting the popular narrative up to the top. I had a long way to go before I found a Roosevelt,

These people writing the popular narrative are too messed up themselves to be of any help to men - they're the very reason why so many boys and men are messed up at so many levels. So it's up to us - and it works so much better that way too. Unfortunately it only works when we've been hit hard by the red lightning bolt of reality and shocked awake out of delusion.

If we don't, someone else will set the frame for us, and that will be our prison.

Society's image of a man is all about his utility value and his issues these days. In those days when we spoke of men, we looked at the greatest of our kind - older, wiser, who walked the path, who were respected. We still did until recently, until social media was invented. After that it even became fashionable and the norm to depict the hero as the guy with the biggest issues rather than the most awesome character in the show.

This world ain't going to see us as anything but a problem or a utility, but only as long as we let them, and act as living proof of their assumptions.

And honestly, no place out there except here now has all the stuff you need to know that will help you become this man you are meant to become. But it's your responsibility to put it all to work. No one can do that for you.

So on International Men's day, let me give you guys something that will actually prove useful to you in your journey to becoming the proud man you are supposed to be (it's where we all start) :

Legion athletics website -- the articles on how to build a workout routine, how to lose fat and gain muscle, how to diet for cut and bulk and how to increase your testosterone

The point is not all those supplements he wants to sell at the end, it's the workout advice - it's seriously legit. You can get his books, I made real gains for the first time in my life and I thought I had shitty genes before that. It also fixed a lot of my mental weaknesses. These are the first of the real issues we face, and these are the first of solutions that actually benefit us. Now that is a gift worthy of men's day.

Every book on the sidebars you need are cheap on amazon and free to download on library genesis. Any book by a Navy seal or a sportsman who pushed themselves past their limits to get where they are will be inspirational for the mind. It's time to work.

Today, instead of doing our own version of a butt hurt woman needing special validation on women's day, let's just send that to the grave for good. Of what use is the hollow lip service from these idiots anyway? When we know the truth, validation seems fake especially when you realize where the feedback is coming from.

If people actually gave men real stuff that could help them in their lives, this so called men's day would actually be something of worth, rather than the retarded, lip service, make things worse hogwash they turn out to be.

The mirror in your room and the mirror of life never lies to you. 

*PS : And before you rush in to comment on what you think a man should be and make a to-do list on what is probably your first comment on the sub, I hope you've spent the time reading the sidebars of this and mrp, at least getting your ass to start exercising and have done the work enough to get it, at least gained some success at gaming and frame, got out of validation addiction, have high standards for yourself, and have started figuring out what you need to be and how to get there.

The reason typically comes from trying to improve one or many aspects of our lives whether it’s improving access to resources, respect, women, or all of the above. The red pill is often if not always swallowed with an onslaught of bitterness at ourselves, others who are doing better, or women themselves. The strength comes from getting past that bitterness and moving towards application of methods to self improvement.

The comparison comes when you dive more into each sub. Here we have an abundance of men who have a bad taste in their mouth left from their experiences with the opposite sex. That bitterness has turned into caution which makes us refrain from pulling punches when speaking brutal truths about the nature of women. in that sense, FemaleDatingStrategy is no different. Go on that sub and you’ll be greeted with posts that outline a multitude of ways that suggest that women must exercise extreme caution around men. There’s anger. There’s bitterness. But most of all, a community that’s doing what they feel is best given their personal experiences with the opposite sex.

Now this post isn’t meant to tell you that I agree with what they say about us or disagree. It’s meant to outline my thoughts on every group having their space to discuss harsh perceived truths with like minded people. I’m glad they have their sub and I’m glad we have ours. This post is meant to outline the fact that on the surface, that subreddit has a lot of the same issues ours does, and yet we’re the only ones quarantined. It’s a shame that reddit as a whole has a problem not with harsh truths and mean words, but a problem if those words are aimed against women. It’s a major indicator to where the power is socially.

Two weeks ago I finally had enough of being a kisssless virgin. I've been wanting to get good with girls for a long time but always made excuses. Two weeks ago, I decided to create a tangible and measurable goal for myself. This goal is to go on at least 1 date a week. I can either meet the girls through tinder, class, cold approach... it doesn't matter. What matters is to go one 1 date a week. 

Week 1 was horrible. I set up a few dates on tinder but something always seemed to come up and I was not able to hit the 1 date a week goal that I had set for myself. Angry at myself, I told myself that on week 2 I had to make it up and go on 2 dates. 

This week (week 2) has been amazing. It has been a true shift in my approach. I seem to give a shit about what others think a lot less than I did a short while ago. In short, I went on 3 dates (all from tinder), cold approached 3 girls, and kissed a girl for the first time in my life. 

Although this doesn't seem like much for most of you on this sub, this was a huge stepping stone for me. The first date was simply getting coffee with a girl. The second date was getting drinks with another girl. I hit it off well with the second girl so I asked her over to my place a couple nights ago. It was probably the most awkward date in my life, but I did manage to kiss her twice and I did not pussy out. I kept going for it. However, she decided to leave (friend emergency LOL), probably because I did not have the proper skills. She kept referring to my moves as awkward. I made a lot of rookie mistakes, such as bumping my head against hers when trying to kiss her. But that doesn't matter, theres a first for everything, and I'll learn from this experience. 

I'm hoping this post is motivation for those young guys like myself who are avoiding transitioning from theory into action. Theory honestly makes up about 10 percent of game, and that 10 percent comes after you take action and analyze what you did wrong. Furthermore, the most important piece of a advice I can give is to create goals that are challenging but not too difficult. The 1 date a week goal seems to be a fair goal for me right now. I'll keep going this for the next few weeks, and who knows, I might be losing my viriginity soon.

I'll be 18 years old in December. I've been masturbating since the age of 12. I don't really know what exactly made me an addict, since most of my friends started around the same age I did, if not sooner.

I literally haven't been able to speak about my problem to anyone, due to the fact that I live in a muslim country and things like that are very taboo. I think around the age of 13, I started masturbating daily, with a minimum of once daily, and a max of 5-6 times. The average has always been around twice daily. 

I started watching soft porn like everybody, but as the years went by I started discovering my sexualty. I'm into some pretty weird shit to tell the truth. I always believed in love and always thought of sex as this huge awesome thing. But when I lost my virginity, I felt like it was very overrated. I have never used a condom with a girl, because of the simple fact that sexual entercourse didn't feel good to me, at all. Other than blowjobs, I don't feel anything. At all. This hasn't stopped me from doing it. I became sexually needy with my partners. Very needy. When I have sex I feel like I'm a fucking beast, I would keep thrusting for a long time until I either get bored, or we run out of time. When I lost my virginity, I tried doing it for about 15 minutes but asked my partner to stop because I didn't like it.

At my current state, I feel like absolute shit. I stopped feeling any sort of connection to humans. I used to care a lot about people especially girls, but not anymore, I feel like they can only benefit me sexually. For example, I had a girl best friend for 8 years but this year I didn't feel anything towards her so I just stopped seeing her completely. Sometimes I do feel alone, but then my mind goes all negative, and I convince myself that I don't really care about anyone, and no one truly cares about me.

Last week I had an ex sit with me during lunch with a couple of mates at school, somehow I ended up fingering her under the table, with all our friends sitting at the same table. I fucking loved it. The following day a friend of mine told me that my ex currently has a boyfriend. I felt sick. I couldn't think straight, I didn't even ask her about herself and wether she's seeing someone. I went straight to sex. When I'm horny, my mind feels like it's on drugs. I can't think, at all. I can't even count the number of times I arrived late to school, because I woke up with a morning boner and had to spend 15 minutes jerking off.

Religion, philosophy, governments, even the TRP ""ideology"" springing from the TRP workshop is a meme. 

Right now, the Western civilization ""meme"" is dying. Why? Its being replaced by a ""better"" meme ie a meme that is currently more fit to survive in today's climate: ""feminism"" with elements of marxism.

Why? Because now women have the right to vote.

And it's not because women **have free right to vote** that is the problem. No. It's because **that vote gives them power over the earning potential of millions of beta slaves and they don't have to open their legs to do so.** Women, by their nature, are communists.

Before, women had to find a balance between the two sides of man: that of the beast and that of the protector. Now that they have gained access to the earning potential of the protector they can focus solely on the beast.

So my point being is this: giving women the right to vote was Pandora's box. It cannot be closed. Not because women should or shouldn't have a say in government, but because government itself is evil by having power over the value of a man. Government is basically a mafia telling you what you can and can't do with your **value.**

Those pieces of paper called money? That represents your value. What's the definition of value? **Your time.**

Time you can never get back.

Much like we needed a separation of Church and State, we need a separation of economics and State.

""But that means that we'll be ruled by capitalist companies with no say!"" Like right now? Do you think your vote matters? If the founding fathers were alive today, DC streets would lined with members of Congress hanging from light posts from both sides of the aisle.

My point being is, it's too late. It's too fucking late to ""save"" this world. And honestly, what's so great about it? 

What was so great about fucking the same girl for the rest of your life? What is so great about working the same fucking job for years? What's so great about taking pills to stay healthy and paying loads of taxes to a ravenous beast of a government? What's so great about having kids born into this world only to be turned into slaves?

Nothing sounds great about that. And all of that was born from your precious ""Western culture.""

You want to change the world? Change yourself first and show us how its done. Hell, if an idiot like Trump can become president, what the fuck is your excuse? **Show us how it's done.**

Don't come here trying to recruit us to a cause that you only pay lip service to.

Don't come here telling us to fight for a cause that you don't really know anything about.

Don't come here telling me how to feel about a world that ruthlessly chewed us up and left us for dead on the road.

You know what it sounds like? Sounds like desperation. The desperate cries of **weak** men.

You're fucking **weak.**

And you see the new world coming.

A world where your dad bod won't cut it.

A world where your money wont matter.

A world where you'll be at the bottom because you wont have what it takes to adapt.

You won't have the balls to grit your teeth and **do what needs to be done to survive.**

And what would you have to do?

**Whatever it takes to survive. To win.**

The great shedding of humanity is coming.

Mother nature has been waiting patiently for this day.

What day would that be?

EDIT : I wonder why the hell I've not been able to get this post up for like a week now. Maybe it's some words I'm using.

I am actually surprised there is actually something called an International Men's Day. I only got to know of it even when a couple of greeting pics got sent on the family group and some friends posted about it on Facebook - it seems to be getting a little popular now -- but obviously it's nowhere on the radar compared to the scale of International Women's Day. I am pretty shocked that such a thing is even allowed to exist in today's popular narrative. Surely it can only mean one thing...

For the record, a typical women's day in my extended family and social circles usually involves the women doing whatever it takes when she thinks she hasn't got enough of validation from the men (which is the norm). So being butt hurt is essentially their right on this day.

My first reaction was to imagine a mental image of a beta husband getting butt hurt trying to negotiate validation for himself for being a man with his wife, and getting obviously burned in the process, and telling myself never to become that guy cause a) why take seriously something that changes like the weather and because b) You're a faggot when you live by other people's approval, and die by their rejection. Any husband in my whole family group and virtually everyone in the neighborhood or the entire state could easily be that guy. What else would men's day even be for?

So ok, I go to google, search for the men's day messages, and predictably, what I find is :

A lip service to the statistics, the men taking their lives, the men getting killed, the mental illness, the prison sentences, the homeless men, the dangerous low level jobs, the workplace deaths, the falling academic grades, but NOT the divorce stats, the infertility and low T levels or the false abuse claims or dead beadrooms -- of course.

Lots of messages about being emotional, vulnerable, and talking to others about the shit you're actually supposed to fix. Mostly by women, supported by their reverential white knights.

You have people and celebrities with mental and emotional issues, and habits (drugs, alcohol, the like), telling other men to be vulnerable because being vulnerable = showcasing your shit at all levels of your being and not your toned muscular body.

Lots of women approving messages from men who promise to be their saviors and treat them like the princesses they are (while the real issue is only if she actually feels that kind of admiration for her man)

A couple of faggots in ballerina costumes claiming masculinity is a social construct. Or photos of Justin Bieber.

Masculinity is all about men crying pics and memes and that men are shamed into hiding their fragility.

Men's day as a celebration of the fragile beings were are underneath that mask.

A few angry feminists claiming in all their apparently Buddhahood levels of sage wisdom that ""Every day is a man's day. It's women who don't get appreciated"". In today's America.

Lots of men talking about the challenges and shit they face, what they do to support their families, and the things they've achieved with their sweat and blood and lives, probably expecting women to understand their sacrifices and give them validation and maybe even sex like the great empathetic and understanding beings we think they are.

Some messages about how men are fathers, brothers, and husbands and any role that purely exists relative to others in terms of utility. And how they can be better providers at said roles in getting other people's needs met at the cost of their own.

Some people pointing out that the equality of sexes is so fake in real life. But...

Not one, not ONE image of a guy who lifts and looks healthy. Forget mentally healthy, mentally strong guys.

Not a single link to anything that actually tells you what you need to do about solving these issues.

Nothing, not one thing, about the athletes, the geniuses, the musicians, the artists, the builders, the talented, the skilled, the sportsmen, the mentally strong, the warriors, the wise, the soldiers, the masters, the heroes, the lovers, the sages, the scientists, the problem solvers, the engineers, the enterpreneurs, the inventors, the garbage cleaners -- not even the men who've made a lot of money !!

Ok, one or two quotes from the great men of the past who actually talked about challenges, grit, strength, character, respect, wisdom and greatness, none of whom exist today. Even if they did they probably couldn't get past the outrage disease. Somewhere down the list, somewhere buried under the haystack.

NOTHING about an attractive man and his qualities, duh, it might just expose the truth. Seriously, I just realized virtually everything that's wrong with the human race in this one search. Wikipedia seems to claim it's legit, but I wonder if at the end they've actually made any kind of positive difference in even one man's life so far.

Nothing appreciating a man by the larger society or women. Just a few men patting themselves on the back.

All of this shows you just one thing - society is so fucked they have no fucking clue what a man or masculinity is, or are in denial. They can't give it to you. Masculinity is a gift we learn the hard way, give it to ourselves and show the world where it is.

These people writing the popular narrative are too messed up themselves to be of any help to men - they're the very reason why so many boys and men are messed up at so many levels. So it's up to us - and it works so much better that way too. Unfortunately it only works when we've been hit hard by the red lightning bolt of reality and shocked awake out of delusion.

If we don't, someone else will set the frame for us, and that will be our prison.

Society's image of a man is all about his utility value and his issues these days. In those days when we spoke of men, we looked at the greatest of our kind - older, wiser, who walked the path, who were respected. We still did until recently, until social media was invented. After that it even became fashionable and the norm to depict the hero as the guy with the biggest issues rather than the most awesome character in the show.

This world ain't going to see us as anything but a problem or a utility, but only as long as we let them, and act as living proof of their assumptions.

And honestly, no place out there except here now has all the stuff you need to know that will help you become this man you are meant to become. But it's your responsibility to put it all to work. No one can do that for you.

So on International Men's day, let me give you guys something that will actually prove useful to you in your journey to becoming the proud man you are supposed to be (it's where we all start) :

Legion athletics website -- the articles on how to build a workout routine, how to lose fat and gain muscle, how to diet for cut and bulk and how to increase your testosterone

The point is not all those supplements he wants to sell at the end, it's the workout advice - it's seriously legit. You can get his books, I made real gains for the first time in my life and I thought I had shitty genes before that. It also fixed a lot of my mental weaknesses. These are the first of the real issues we face, and these are the first of solutions that actually benefit us. Now that is a gift worthy of men's day.

Every book on the sidebars you need are cheap on amazon and free to download on library genesis. Any book by a Navy seal or a sportsman who pushed themselves past their limits to get where they are will be inspirational for the mind. It's time to work.

Today, instead of doing our own version of a butt hurt woman needing special validation on women's day, let's just send that to the grave for good. Of what use is the hollow lip service from these idiots anyway? When we know the truth, validation seems fake especially when you realize where the feedback is coming from.

If people actually gave men real stuff that could help them in their lives, this so called men's day would actually be something of worth, rather than the retarded, lip service, make things worse hogwash they turn out to be.

The mirror in your room and the mirror of life never lies to you.

Alpha Widows(AWs) range from the screaming banshee, hell-hath-no-fury types, to the more subtle, forever secretly broken women (might make a post about these later on) and everything in between. Regardless of where they fall on the spectrum, one thing unites every single AW: they all have that *one* guy they can't get over, that one man who occupies their soul, and whose mere presence is such an addictive elixir that they will risk anything to taste of it again (incidentally, this elixir also comes in the form of semen, which every AW will taste upon her many, many boomerang trips). These women are perpetually stuck on one particular man, for a variety of reasons. This widowed status may last a year, it may last a lifetime, but it's distinguishable from  simply reeling from a breakup or ""not being over"" someone.

I've had my fair share of alpha widows, the majority of whom were created well before I stumbled upon this forum, and before I even knew what the term for these women was (I used to call them ""Clingy Clunge"". Inelegant, I know, but I'm a sucker for alliteration.) When I first read about RP principles, and surveyed how they applied to my life, I quickly realised that I had, unwittingly, been creating AWs. Now note, I didn't come here to learn how to pick up women. I can say that's one area of my life I've always had down pat, since I've been aware that girls were girls and boys and boys. Rather, I came here to find explanation for a lot of what I saw, experienced, and , critically, what it all meant. As I reflected on my sexual past, I identified recurrent themes in all the AWs I had had in my life, and these themes have held true ever since, as I have seemingly continued to widow women.

So this will serve as as an illustration and semi-guide, based on my experience, on just how I created my AWs. A few points to note before we dive into this: 

* I take no responsibility for what you intend and choose to do with what I tell you here.

* These are not ironclad rules and steps. You could do all of this and the woman could still dump you and never contact you again. In fact, there is a good chance that you won't succeed in intentionally creating one, as there is significant overlap in the things and RP man should do in general and what creates AWs. So don't be wondering about why it ""didn't work."" Maybe you suck, maybe she's already widowed. Who knows/ cares?

* Don't think that having a widow is somehow desirable. If you have any sort of experience with women, then you know how much of a pain they can be when you *want* them around, never mind when you don't. Tread carefully.

That out of the way, let's proceed.

**Excessive aloofness** 
-

I know a lot of you put up a show of aloofness when you're trying to get into women's panties, and that's all well and good. Well, lemme tell you right now, it's hard to match inborn aloofness. Thing is, I've had people tell me I'm aloof even when I've thought I was being engaged and personable. It's  a combination of various factors in my life, but I am simply an aloof individual, and if you know anything about women, it's that aloofness drives them wild. So of course, they were immediately engaged.

**Intermittent but intense attention**
-

I've always been very caught up in my own life, to a fault at times. This means that, naturally, I have a limited amount of attention to give to women. I can go for a long time without talking to a woman, without anything having gone wrong. But when I give them attention, it's almost always my complete focus on them for whatever amount of time I choose to spend with them. I've noticed that this seems to create a reward circuit in their brains, where they seek out my attention like an incredible high that they sometimes get.

**Best sex of her life**
-

Again, if you're any sort of RP male, you should be able to consistently make the women you're with orgasm and enjoy the sex. Where it goes a step further, is when you give them incredible sex more regularly than not. I can't tell you how to do this, I can only tell you what has worked for me is to simply be in the moment and do whatever my lizard brain dictates. So if I feel like lifting her up into a tombstone pile-driver position for oral, I will. If I decide I'm done with sex mid-round, I'll climb off. In the middle of the act, I kiss them deeply, whisper lecherous things in her ear, use her body as the conduit for my appeasing my sexual appetite.

Interestingly enough, sometimes pulling away from them has seemed to drive them wild. I've orgasmed within minutes sometimes and fucked off and, contrary to what you might think would happen, it wasn't a major issue. Of course, this isn't the sort of thing you want to be making a habit.

**""I've never done this before / I can't believe the things you make me do""**
-

I like pushing boundaries, and making women do things they wouldn't normally do. Now, of course this differs from woman to woman and the circumstance, but you'd be surprised by how plain and boring most women's sex lives have been. For example, I left my LTR, and I've been with a variety of women. One of them was a divorced woman 9 years my senior. She'd had a limited sex life with her abusive husband, so I decided to change that. You know what I did one night? Took her hand, pulled her out of her car, bent her over the bonnet and fucked her from behind in front of her apartment building. Then I made her walk into building caretaker's office to collect her key with my semen dripping out of her (I don't advocate unprotected sex by any means, and this is one of the few instances when I've indulged my less-than-wise proclivities.) 

Another girl got married some years ago. She contacted me some time after her first kid, talking about missing me and such. [I wrote about her here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/43etph/it_shouldnt_be_this_easy/) So after that, she visited our town and got in contact and you can guess what happened. During all this, she constantly reiterated how I was the only man she'd ever cheated on her husband with, and how she did things with me she never let her husband do (anal is sinful, apparently.)

I could go on, but you get the gist: when they do things they wouldn't usually do, it creates some sort of glue to you.

**Commitment as a carrot she can never catch**
-

I've only ever had one serious, monogamous LTR. One. That's out of numerous lays and almost equally numerous requests for commitment from the women. I never gave them commitment, but I did tie it in front of their eyes and keep them chasing it. In all honesty, I did this more when I was younger and liked to have a steady stream of clunge to fill up. These days, I'm more upfront about my desire to not be tied down, which might explain the slight downturn in AWs. But see, being deprived of commitment is enough to completely offset a woman's mating strategy. This is truer the more beautiful/sought  after she is. Men usually ask her to commit, and here I am, casually dangling only the possibility of possibility itself in her face, and getting away with it. Eventually though, most wise up and decide to go their own way. Which is when the next bit comes in.

**""Like one of a thousand yoyos""**
-

This was said to me by an old plate who'd started pulling away, and who I reeled back by dangling two carrots closer to her nose. I told her I would stop sleeping with new women, and I did...but not the women I was already with. I asked her to give me time to sort out my affairs as it would be unfair for me to simply drop these women at a moment's notice. Did I drop them? No. Scummy? Sure, I guess. But I don't put too much stock in breaking my word to women in love affairs. All's fair and all that. She left not too long after, but I reeled her in a couple of more times my own amusement. She was with other guys every time. Speaking of my amusement...

**They were my playthings**
-

I didn't grow up with much, so I had to make do and find my own entertainment and toys. And what better plaything than these mercurial, fluffy creatures around me? Early on, I discovered that women were the perfect fidget spinners to cure my penis of its autism, the moment I knew they wanted me, it became an enjoyable, if rote game. I've played with their emotions, giving them both great highs and incredibly low lows. I've never been afraid of hurting women, which meant I'd go in for all sorts of games that most men wouldn't. A favourite of mine was seeing how may women around her I could sleep with before she left me. The number was usually higher than I guessed. For most, it wasn't until I slept with a sister or cousin that they called it quits. And even then, it was never permanent. I remember making this girl I was seeing make out with her cousin and grab each other. I didn't get the threesome I was hoping for, but the cousin was  a wild lay. The girl I had been seeing was distraught and went out of town for Christmas and New Year's, only to rock up on the second of Jan, crying about how much she missed me and how loose her cousin was. Fun.

**No closure**
-

Long, emotional passages detailing the pain of the breakup are the sole domain of women and bitch males. ""Talking about it"" is the act of the desperate. When I decide it's over, then it's done. No closure; I'm not a movie or a [shitty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk13zKYgwz4) rock song.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's mostly it. I'm sure there's more, but I'm not trying to be here writing all day. Again, making an Alpha Widow isn't the fun you might think it is. It gets bothersome dealing with women when you're done with them. I will say, most of these are just aspects of my personality that happened to mesh well with romantic pursuits.

u/whatsthisgarg 

&gt;#holy shit what a bunch of losers

&gt;Guy puts up a post with a very simple point about **abundance mentality** and **outcome independence** -- two of the most important and primary and so ironically most overlooked (hence motivation for the post) elements of TRP: should be easy.

&gt;In the post: woman places unreasonable conditions on future access to her un-unique hidden charms. Guy has other options and laughs. End of story.

&gt;Message to readers: maybe you're not there yet, but this is what abundance is like, it's a wonderful feeling, and it's a worthy goal, work for it.

 

&gt;In the comments:

&gt;20% got it. Maybe half of those got it because they have experienced it, and half got it because they have what's called reading comprehension. Well done.

&gt;20% (including some ECs ffs, yes, are there so many losers in that population?) said you ""left ass on the table,"" and you could have intercoursed this non-special, imminently replaceable female 3 or 4 more times had you not flubbed your response. In other words, **they totally missed the message.**

&gt;20% focussed on how they thought you were still hung up on this chick, because you mentioned it happened at some time in the past, exhibiting their own lack of abundance. **IE, missed the message.**

&gt;20% predicted you would die lonely and alone LOL because you rejected this chick who had weird, out-of-place demands for you (like you should only have sex once a week and only with her because that's what she wants). To be charitable to these clowns, they are saying you will die lonely and alone because you will reject a series of women who have presumptuous and silly and uncompensated demands on you. Even worse. Also **missing the message.**

&gt;20% wanted to know and ONLY wanted to know what the gift was / what the weirdo stone in her bra was. In this case I will say maybe half got the message and were just mucking about and having a laugh, and the other half were total dweebs who really thought this was just a story and you left out the important part, **IE missed the message.**

&gt;In sum, perhaps 70% of commenters offered, in a post about abundance mentality and outcome independence, **testimonials of personal non-abundance and massive outcome-dependence, and advocated that you should adopt their attitudes.**

&gt;That sound you heard some time in the last year was the tanking of a sub.


Outcome independence and abundance mentality are like the compound lifts of the SMP. We can talk accessory work all day, but when push comes to shove, the truly strong will remain unfazed. 

I advise everyone to build these muscles first, as a foundation.

Even though his words were expressing he was happy/excited, I could just tell from his tone/energy that it was contentment/comfort at best and apathy at worst. Even though we are now very different, I still have this mans back no matter what...but it really irks me that I know what his journey likely leads too and even though I am his best friend and am aware, there is nothing I can practically do but cross my fingers and hope he doesn’t get divorce-raped.

&amp;#x200B;

A very good friend to mine, and a man who is a rolemodel in my life, always told me ‘when things get complicated, always go back to basics’. 

&amp;#x200B;

As always, there is a number of newbs on ASLtrp who just don’t ‘get it’. Who are attempting to walk a path, without realising they aren’t digeting, swallowing and walking the red. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are the guys focused on ‘that one girl’. Oneitis. The guy’s with blocks of texts wanting to work out ‘why this one girl I’m with does whatever’. ‘Everything was cool, but now she gives a little less attention and I just ddoooonnn’t know why’. ‘I don’t have oneitis, but let me write ten pages recollecting every minute detail of my existence with her and ask you guys to help decipher every nuance of her mind...'cuz I just want to understand, #nooneitis’.

&amp;#x200B;

If this is you, you never fucking ‘got it’. 

&amp;#x200B;

See, people condem a man living a red pill style. A man who intentially has options. A man who sees, sleeps with and pursues more than one woman at once. Abundance mentality. 

&amp;#x200B;

What the critics and male-shamers don’t understand is, we’re solving problems. Unorthodox, unaccepted, un-mainstream, but highly effective solutions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have...more...than...one...woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

Red Pill, imo, was born out of problems, in an attempt to find solutions. It was built simply on ‘Everthing’s fucking good, women are awesome, but I’d like to fuck more’.

&amp;#x200B;

It was born from ‘This is fucked, I do all I’m suppossed to, all they tell me, and I still run into shit, women’s whims, their childish antics, I just don’t get this, wtf’?

&amp;#x200B;

See, if you want to solve the majority of your problms, stop focusing on ‘this one girl’. More than you need to figure out what is going for her, wether you should sk her out, inititate, drop her, soft next, why she didn’t laugh as much as yesterday and the plethora of other minute shit doing you head in, you need to PURSUE OTHER WOMEN. Plates. Plate theory. Abundance. You know. Sidebar.

&amp;#x200B;

RedPill men have figuered out how to solve these problems. You don’t try to solve her. You FUCK OTHER WOMEN. 

&amp;#x200B;

See, a blue pill guy has a problem. He gives to a woman, he fucks her, he gives his exclusivity. She then goes weird. It’s what girls often do. Unpredicatable, emotional, courting orbiters etc. The blue pill guy, wanting sex and validation goes running to his buddies ‘oh, it’s really fucked and I don’t know why. I can’t figure her out and I’m stressed. But I don’t want to lost the onities’.

&amp;#x200B;

The RedPill man diverts the stress. ‘Oh, she’s acting like an unpredictable five year old? Oh well, let’s call up number two or three’. Not long later my dick is sucked, I’ve nutted, and I’m at the gym or back on mission’.

&amp;#x200B;

The bluepill guy is fraught with bluepill moral dilemma. ‘She’s acting like a bitch, and there is this girl who likes me, but but but I have to be honourable and moral and have integrity’. 

&amp;#x200B;

The RedPill man says ‘She’s acting like a bitch. Well, watch this honey. Or don’t. I don’t care, I’m busy busting’.

&amp;#x200B;

Before the long ass essays on ASKtrp. Before trying to work out ‘this one girl’, once you have one, the FIRST thing you need to focus on and learn is GETTING ANOTHER ONE. 

&amp;#x200B;

If your desire to understand ‘this one girl’, outweighs your action of finding a number two and three, then you are doing it wrong. You are only locking yourself into the same problems RedPill men fought to avoid. A RedPill man isn’t writing Essay long questions on ASKtrp. You’re still stuck in blue. 

&amp;#x200B;

See, RedPill solves men problems. PLATES, solve your problems. If the girl you’re with causes you problems, you should ONLY pick up your phone not to write essays to us, but to text one of the other girls you see. 

&amp;#x200B;

Work. Work hard to create options. That is the number one thing. If you don’t have options, you can’t use the pill.

From a guy who went from a never kissing a girl at 23 to a full on high smv alpha Tyrone . 

I initially started out a I would say a 5 and was able to pull myself to a 9 . 

When I graduated Howard university it was a full on shock to my System at the graduation that I never even kissed a girl when I was taking a picture with Keisha. Keisha was the “the one” in my Beta eyes and I spent 4 years orbiting and being a emotional tampon .  She was my best friend and at that moment when I fake smiled for the photo I realized that I wasted 4 years of my life chasing her and waiting for her to realize I was the perfect guy for her .  Then I watched her introduce her boyfriend to her family painful .  

I went back home and spiraled into a full on depression and put on a lot of weight . I was always chubby but then I put on even more.  And my fat distribution is awful. Shaped like a BBW pornstar with fat face and cheeks and skinny arms massive gut and thick thighs and ass.  I became obsessed with pua videos wishing I was that guy and that was pretty much my intro into redpill /mgtow . Then I started to understand what went wrong and realized at 22 why I had never kissed a girl . I started self improving myself everyday .  I dropped the weight and shot up to a 7 and had my first kiss soon after came close to having sex but the beta in me fucked it up and I didn’t get there yet . But it was still a massive improvement . After college I got a job I hated and came home to eating a massive meal watching tv with my mom then going to my bedroom for YouTube , video games and porn before the next day of work and for the first time in my life I was focused and dedicated to making money and improving my appearance .  After I went to a dermatologist and fixed my face up. I had severe discoloration where some spots of my face was darker then others. I went to a 8 after several procedures and face wash routines. Next I got a new haircut , put on some muscle and got veneers my teeth was so fucked up it looked like it was directing traffic at a Intersection.  


At this point I was already on gear trying to bulk up to put on lean muscle because I felt like it was my final step and I got impatient. Each step of the way I started to see the difference in women and their true nature . I almost didn’t want to believe the red pill and that it was all lies but that even if it was the improvement would be good for me anyway.  But everything said was confirmed .  I had quit my shitty job and started making a lot of money working for myself . And I started living far out my means . Leasing cars I can’t really afford , expensive clothes and jewelry and a apartment downtown  with a amazing view . I soent countless hours reading seduction/pua redpill books . Buying the online courses and then went applying it and experimenting.  I was smashing everything in sight trying to make up for lost time.  

5-10s I was plating all of them and fitting them in my busy schedule.  But then I cut my rotation to just 8-10 cause I started to notice this weird effect of lower smv women of other races . A lot of them looked at high smv black men as a more bang for you buck deal  on the sexual marketplace and they started to get really entitled like I should be happy to have them . And on top of that I was tired of being the stereotype of black guy with fat/ugly white girl , Asian , Latina  and other . So I cut my roster down to just the best looking two/three girls at a time because it was becoming to time consuming anyway with work . 

I did this for about two years and then it happened at a networking event for professionals in the business world I saw her . It was Keisha . She didn’t even recognize me at first . We got to catching up and of course I added her into my rotation . The Oneitis came back after about 4 months It was amazing at first but After about 2 more months I came to the realization that Keisha is red flag galore and not wife material . I had become obsessed with her only because of her good looks and charming personality but she doesn’t have any other redeeming qualities . I dumped her after THE TALk and went back to plating and it felt empty and like a waste of time and it didn’t make me happy like I always thought it would . I went through another depression and put on some weight again  when I got off the gear . Just coming home from work and smoking a shitload of weed every night was my routine and it caught up to me . I’m a lot better now and have more balance in my life . I downsized my living situation and stopped living check to check to impress others . I’m at a healthy weight and I’ve started to date again but I’m more of mgtow monk mode for the most part .

All of that is incidental and only important to the extent that it improves your STATE OF MIND. No, the real source of this power is already within you. It is how you see yourself. It is your decision to move through the world without apology, to set aside complaining for decisive action, to let your brass balls do your talking for you. The quintessential masculine quality women cannot resist is supreme unshakeable confidence. You can be poor, out of shape, stupid, unemployed, addicted to drugs, and meet every one of society’s standards for loser ness, but if you radiate those confident vibes that say you are perfectly fucking pleased with yourself, you will get laid all the FUCKING time. And the kind of women that get wet for such men aren’t just bar sluts, smart women, women with high self-esteem, and MBAs, and even, especially HARDCORE feminists will crave the cock of the man who exudes such power and happily take it in the FACE and UP THE ASS if it means he will grace her with his presence for a little while longer. 

This is the kind of power that matter. FUCK THE NORMAL RULES. You make the rules now. They tell you to give, give, give till it hurts. To do your duty and throw yourself in the blood-soaked grinding gears of the Korporate Akademia Kredentialist Krell Machine in service to society’s great gaping Maw, and then maybe, maybe one day you’ll be lucky enough to get chained for life to some mediocre pussy and infrequent, tepid sex. Whereupon, you will work yourself tirelessly to the bone, shuffling your ungrateful brats, through one societal sacremental rite of passage after another, feeding the endless, insatiable hunger of the machinery of the state. And they will pat you on the head for your devotion to the cause with lateral promotions and certificates of exemplary service and announcements in the local paper and a brand new set of steak knives.

There is a dirty little secret they don’t want you to know. And everyone is in cahoots, from the alphas, to the betas, to the keepers of the vagina. And it is this: You don’t need to play by their rules to get what you want. Women will still flock to you if you shit all over everything you were taught you needed to do in order to earn their love as long as you do it with style and unwavering boldness and a TAKE IT or LEAVE IT attitude.

The Bible calls for wives to respect their husbands and for husbands to love their wives. For the atheists here, don’t groan and click away just yet. I have a non-religious point to this. I had two thoughts about the Bible verse.

1. Why did they use two different words? Why didn’t the author calls for wives and husbands to love AND respect each other? They used two distinctly different words.

2. I noticed that this has something in common with Red Pill theory (something I remember reading in the sidebar somewhere): a woman is not capable of loving a man the same way a man can love a woman. Women are not capable of unconditional love, at least not towards men. The sidebar also has a very common theme of only going after women who *respect* you.

I found it interesting that the red pill was so oddly in line with a verse from the Bible, so I looked up the definitions for love and respect.

Love: an intense feeling of deep affection.

Respect: a feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements.

Here’s my main point. Wouldn’t you rather have something that you know you *earned* than something that was just *given* to you? In my past relationships, my insecurities always stemmed from the fact that I didn’t know *why* she “loved” me. Since I didn’t know where it came from or why, I was always scared that it could be taken away from me at a moment’s notice, and it always was.

If she *respects* you, you should know exactly why. That’s something that can never be taken away from you, because you earned it.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,There is a difference between love and respect,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/e0iewm/there_is_a_difference_between_love_and_respect/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

A simple story. Once upon a time there lived a lion. Strong, proud and powerful, he roamed, freely without a care in the world. None could harm him and his majestic power shone freely in his eyes. All the animals looked up to him and through fear and respect as he ruled his domain. 

One day, a beautiful maiden stumbled lost in his domain. Seeking something to fill her heart, she got lost and wandered into his lair. When she saw him, she screamed in fear and ran away. Curious, he thought, but paid the strange creature no more attention. The next day, his keen eyes noticed her looking at him in the distance. His roar shook the earth itself and she ran in fright back into the shadows, and yet, each day, she kept coming back, and despite his nature, he took comfort in her presence and decided to let her be in his domain. 

Many days passed and the lion grew to enjoy her company. Each day she'd get a little closer so that she could stare at him as he stalked through his kingdom. Then one day she brought him a gift. A great meal of the finest meats the lion had ever seen. The lion fought each day of it's life for everything and this small token brought it a sense of joy. He grew to like this creature and she reveled in his affection and attention. The days grew to weeks and the two formed a bond. He would permit her stay in his kingdom and enjoy her affection and adoration and in turn he would hunt for her and protect her from anything that threatened her safety. 

One day, she brought forth the best meal he had ever had and when done he slept lazily at her side. When she put a collar and chain onto him, he didn't flinch as the realization didn't set. Once it had, he roared and thrashed in fury and anger, but she looked into his eyes and pleaded. ""I just wish to keep you near me, I do not want you to be angry. Look, I will feed you and we shall be together always. Do I not treat you well?"" This was true. She had fed him and cared for him. She gave him comfort that he did not know he ever lacked. While his savage heart reeled at his submission, he knew that his time is not forever and eventually it'll pass. Age and sickness will take him. Maybe it's best to have someone care and assist him. He did not complain and for awhile things were good. 

One day, he heard a sound and looked up from his bed. There stool the maiden and her friends. The eyes of each filled with awe before him. They had come at her request to see this beast that stalks nature. ""So strong and proud,"" they said. They too were seeking something missing and from envy wanted to see themselves. Emboldened by the chain around him, they threaded onto his domain and disturbed his peace. He roared in righteous fury and they fled. The maiden was not pleased and for many days she did not come to bring him food. 

He sat there chained to his bed and grew angry at her actions, but that anger turned to hunger, and so, when she came again, he was filled with submission. ""You have scared my friends and they now fear you. Come, I shall file your teeth and remove your claws and show them that you will not be mean."" This troubled the lion but she looked into his eyes and pleaded. ""Have I not been kind to you? I have I not brought you food? I do not ask for much so please give me this. You have no need for claws and teeth as I will keep you fed and take care of you."" This was true and while it troubled him, the lion submitted and allowed her to file his teeth and clip his claws. 

The weeks turned into months. Without running and hunting, the strength started to ebb away. Without his freedom the lion's pride and majesty eroded. It's claws and teeth removed, the other animals contempt and indifference brought the lion to despair. It spent it's days waiting, staring at it's chains, hoping for the comfort of the maiden. Eager to hear her stories of the outside world and to enjoy the comfort of her company, for none else kept his company. When she came, her eyes were sullen and she brought him food but there was no mirth or comfort to the action. It was more of duty then of joy. That night she did not stay. Days passed and her time with him decreased until one day she came to him with no food and no smile. ""I do not feel like I had before,"" she said with little remorse in her voice. ""You are fat and lazy. The pride and joy that I had enjoyed is no longer there. My friends now mock me for all the time that I waste coming to you and I do not feel safe and secure."" 

She removed his shackles. ""You are free to go. I have moved on."" With those words, she walked away from the lion never to return. A great sadness took him and for many days and nights he lay there hoping for her to return but she never came back. She would never come back.

&amp;#x200B;

*PS : I would have added in a part where she also shaved off his huge mane, as she felt he spent too much time grooming it in front of the mirror, and besides, they'd look more alike - he wouldn't look so wild and scary and she wouldn't have to hear her girlfriends keep talking about it and wanting to touch it every time they got together. After all, a lion shouldn't define who he is just over a bunch of hair, why was he so insecure? Wasn't she fine without a mane? It didn't make her a better cook or a mother or a hunter. He believed her when she later told him he looks so gentle and sweet without a mane and that it was so nice of him to honor her wishes and that her girlfriends were jealous and wished they too had such an understanding partner. However, from the next day, she slept apart by herself, claiming that he snored loudly and she had been sleepless for days. He agreed, as he felt she should sleep well as she did everything for him and would of course be tired....*

***And then this part*** *-- When she left, she didn't bother to unchain him, as just touching him repulsed her. He roared and cried and whined and mewed, pleading with her to stay. He tried to stop her, but the chains held him back. She hit him with her paw and he shut up, and wept. She looked at him with disgust in her eyes and told him, ""You're not worthy of calling yourself a lion. You're pathetic. And no one will ever revere you again."" And then she turned around and was gone. She never came back, but he remained chained, hungry, weak, shattered. Several days later his old animal friends chanced on his den, found him still barely alive, now reduced to skin and bones. Quickly they unchained him, brought him some food and told him how a rival lion had taken over in his absence, and that his beloved had been pursuing him for months. They spoke of her admiring him with her glances and showering him with affections in ways that he had not known for years.* 

*This shattered what was left of his will to live, and for a while he contemplated jumping from the tallest cliff in the jungle down into the raging rapids below. Two years ago, his brother had jumped to his death from the very same spot without warning - he had last heard that his brother too had pursued these mysterious maidens, and had not heard from him since. Until word spread of his last act, but now at last he knew what had really happened. Grief gave way to anger, and he finally roared after many days, as he realized that he could not let his brother's death go in vain.*",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,The story of the once proud lion is back.,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/e0ekxv/the_story_of_the_once_proud_lion_is_back/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Treat them with respect...

All my life I've been brainwashed by movies and the music industry.. About romantic women who want to be loved and respected. The Disney movies I watched where beautiful innocent women are in love with their prince or romantic lovers... The movies where the man opens her the door and gives her flowers... 

Why didn't they show the truth?! The truth about their real nature? About what really happened behind closed doors? 

Fuck romance. Fuck respect. Fuck love. The truth isn't easy to swallow, it still blows my mind. I can't comprehend this reality. These fragile, beautiful, innocent, perfect looking angels that I want to love and respect, they...

They want to be treated like livestock, mere howling bitches, animals, cum dumpsters that gets their holes filled up by arrogant, tyrannic and aggressive Genghis Khan seed! This can't be real! Why do they look so innocent, talk so feminine yet ultimately only crave smelly, animalistic seed?! 

What about the thing I've learned?

It's still unfathomable to me, yet... I remember, in school, this one guy. This one tall, loud, arrogant, cocky bastard that only talked shit... yet somehow he was always surrounded by the highest tiers of females. All the girls everyone considered innocent and beautiful, they all were flocked around him as if a warlord opened his Harem full of whores... 

But they were the blond ones, the ones that looked like angels the most, the ones that never showed perverted signs or anything near sexual. The girls I respected and loved...

Yet, these angels are the ones that crave these alpha males seed their raw cocks, their stinky hairy balls and their hands that show them their place as the whore and bitches as they are... these angels...

These alpha males, without reading any theory, they just got all this knowledge inside of them instinctively. They always felt these holes were just to fill up, not to respect them... It's not like I didn't felt it, as a child, looking at these innocent, angelic barbies, as mere sex objects. But I forgot, and continued to be nervous, instead of treating them like what they are: filthy livestock that needs to be put in their place as the holes that they are.

How much did I get with my nice guy personality? Nothing. How much would I get by treating them as cum dumpsters by day 1? Probably more. And even if not, I would at least not hopelessly fall in love with them.

This isn't true, there's a hell of a lot you can do to maximise your facial attractiveness. 

**Facial structure**

We'll start with what you can't change, you're born and develop with a specific bone structure that can't be changed without extreme measures like surgery, we can however change how this structure looks and maximise what we already have.

The first and simplest way to get a more chiselled look is simply lower your body fat %, once you get to sub 10% you'll naturally look more angular.

Next you want to start chewing a pack of chewing gum a day to work your Masseter muscles, after around a month you should notice more definition in the jawline and cheek bones.

Honourable mention for the mewing technique (passive tongue positioning), all evidence is anecdotal but some people swear it's massively transformed their face's, not personally something I've ever needed to bother with though.

**Skin care** 

The difference between a man with good skin and the average man doesn't come down to genetics, it may make it easier or harder but 99% of people can have clear attractive skin with the right effort and skin care routine.

Caring for your skin isn't gay if it gets you pussy.

I'm including a simple skin care routine that aims to remove all acne, improve your complexion, your facial skin health and general overall appearance of your face. 

This is not an overnight fix, you'll notice improvements immediately but it could be 3-6 months until you sort your face out completely.

 

1. Daily facial cleanser- wash your face 2-3 times a day (morning, afternoon and night) with a cheap foaming facial scrub and warm water.
2. Daily micro-bead exfoliating facial scrub- Use this once a day to help scrub away the excess skin and dirt that the facial cleanser missed, again just buy a cheap one it doesn't matter.
3. Acne fighting- Get a benzoyl peroxide (2.5%, any higher just increases side effects) containing spot treatment and apply that shit every few hours or so till you don't have acne anymore.
4. Moisturiser- Apply a small amount at the end of your skin care routine each morning and night, this will eventually improve your overall complexion, skin appearance and skin health
5. Chemical exfoliater- You use this only once or twice a week, it clears away all your dead skin and gets below the surface layer leaving you with clean pores and smooth as fuck skin. This should contain alpha and beta hydroxy acid. (I recommend the one by The Ordinary, its about 7 quid and lasts me 6-9 months at a time so can't go wrong)
6. Charcoal Facemasks (Optional)- These are good for removing black heads and making you feel like a princess.

&amp;#x200B;

On a side note whenever you're done using water in your routine finish off with cold water so for example: You use your facial cleanser and micro-bead with warm water, then you'd apply cold water to your face again to close your pores, then you'd move onto acne fighting and moisturiser. 

The whole thing is relatively cheap, probably only costs me £100-150 a year for flawless skin.

**Grooming**

The amount of men i see that don't have a fucking clue about basic grooming is astounding, it's really noticeable.

We'll start with the eyebrows, a mono brow isn't attractive, get some tweezers and pluck on all the hairs in between your eyebrows and above the bridge of the nose.

Then comb the eyebrows upwards and look for any longer hairs and pluck them too, the aim here is to neaten them out a bit not shape them (That would be fucking gay)

Then take your tweezers and move onto your nose and ear hairs, if anythings sticking out its getting plucked.

On the subject of ears make sure to clean out your ears with cotton buds (Q tips for the Americans I think?) at least a few times a week, you can easily lose points for having visible wax and it’s an often overlooked area. 

Your hair cut is also going to have a direct effect on how your face looks, you should always go for a look that complements your facial shape (There's guides online), it mostly comes down to personal preference though.

For beards, get rid of it, they're for people with weak jaws, lumberjacks or paedophiles.

**General lifestyle changes**

* Drink more water, it's good for your skin cells appearance and reduces water retention making you look leaner.
* Reduce dairy from diet, It's linked with acne
* Eliminate smoking and drinking, its also really bad for your skin.
* Start supplementing a vitamin B complex, magnesium and zinc (others if you're deficient)
* Clean pillows and bed sheets every week, it'll reduce break outs
* Touch your face less, hands get dirty as fuck
* Reduce stress (cortisol levels) it causes acne
* Exercise more, if you're lifting heavy and sweating you're flushing all the shit out of your pores.
* Remember to brush Teeth 3 times a day and floss, it makes the overall face look better
* Get a haircut with a short fringe, long fringes can cause acne on the forehead.

This might sound like an extreme thing to say, but actually it isn't. When I say love, I ought to add I am not a huge fan of the word because one word includes so many different phenomena at work serving totally different goals -- these can basically be classified into either attraction or devotion. Attraction is ultimately a self serving thing even though it is the glue of a relationship. Devotion doesn't need a relationship to exist. Failure to distinguish the two can be fatal. 

I think virtually every man has been in this situation where a woman isn't attracted to him anymore and expresses Stage 4 betaization behavior. The poor man responds by giving her more and more and it's never enough. I've been there too. The guy is left broken at the end, because he failed to realize a simple truth. 

How much he loves her will never be enough, because it's not about that at all. How much she loves him, how much attraction and desire she has for him, how much she needs him, that's the real thing that matters. 

Women and men love differently, Rollo observed it, we know it. Men are idealistic fools for love. They evaluate a woman only for sex and have to learn how to evaluate her for anything more. Nature binds them easily by giving their dick a huge head start over their brain. 

Women disguise their true intentions with a simple trick. They claim they like someone who is nice to them, ties their shoelaces for her, makes her feel loved etc...they approve of the one who loves her. But look closely -- in this scenario the woman really only loves herself. 

In this interaction she actually does not have any kind of pure desire to the man herself. Now go back and read all those social media messages and all their relationship advice on quora and Twitter and Facebook and reddit and the rest. Do you see the fine print in the contract now? If you see people who say they want someone who likes them, how much they like you isn't even in the picture. 

In the story of the lion that deserves gold IMHO, the lioness is initially attracted to the lion from the beginning and the lion just needs to work with that and escalate it. A man hardly needs to try to get attracted to a woman so his side of the story is a given. 

So if she says she loves someone who does anything like tying her shoelaces for her, the thing you ought to pay attention to is whether she actually wants to tie your shoelaces. That's the only thing that matters. 

Time and again women go after jerks who don't treat them well not because they love the abuse but because regardless of how much he likes she, she likes him and is attracted to his SMV. 

Nevertheless I have observed that no matter how much a woman is attracted to you, she can't love without a covert contract. Every now and then she wonders how much she is being loved and her pain body awakens at these moments.

1. Create the life you want to live. Do what you makes you happy, and give no fucks about how it makes others feel. 
2. Do not look to others for a sense of belonging or companionship. You will never find this from anybody. Instead, look to others to improve your quality of life. In order to cultivate this stream of thought, learn to love yourself.
3. Love yourself. Put absolutely no one above yourself. Learn to believe and trust in yourself. If you love yourself, no one else can define you. Take care of yourself and be kind to yourself, because at the end of the day, you are all you really got. 
4. Release your anger. It’s important to get rid of built up and repressed emotions. Go hit the bag, hit the weights, get angry. Take it out on something productive. Go out into the middle of nowhere. Scream. Cry. Let it out. Do not hold that shit in. 
5. Practice mindfulness in daily life. Let negative, self-conscious, depressive, or destructive thoughts go. Do not identify with them. They are products of your mind, and your mind doesn’t always know what’s best for you. 
6. Have a mission. If you don’t have one, make one. We, as men, have an evolutionary drive to create, express, and conquer. If we lose this, we lose our manhood. A mission is how you fulfill this. 
7. Create progress by forcing yourself to do what you fear. You can only conquer an issue by making yourself uncomfortable. What you fear is where you go. Toughness is forged in fire. 
8. Failure is inevitable. In the face of failure, learn from the experience and continue forward. Do not allow yourself to be knocked off center. Expect and welcome failure; it’s how you grow. 
9. Set your own disciplines/principles, and follow them with rigidity. This will give you structure.
10. Never take the easy way out. Catch yourself looking for cheap outs and vices. Get rid of these habits. They almost never serve your true interests.
11. Always have something to offer. Have a fun life, be rich, be attractive; etc. The world doesn’t give a fuck about your feelings, but it does give a fuck what you have to offer. 
12. Isolation is dangerous. Do not isolate yourself. Always be making connections and taking advantage of social opportunities. Be proactive, not reactive. 
13. Have abundance in all aspects of life. In social life, with women, with finances. Do not let yourself become reliant on one commodity for anything.
14. As for the people you keep around: It’s either fuck yes or fuck no. Invest your time in people who respect you and add to your life. Get rid of those who don’t. Life is short and time is your greatest asset. Don’t give it away to people who aren’t a positive presence in your life.
15. Always be in control of your own life. The moment you find yourself losing control, it’s time to step back and re-evaluate your current position.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Bullet Points,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dzy7re/bullet_points/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,dark,,,,,,1

But i feel like if i don't give them love i will not be able to get them to like me.

But still all women want him and it pisses me off. To be honest im totally jealous. I feel like the only hope i have is to love myself so that the girls can start to run after me. You know that Law of attraction thing. But no matter how much i visualize, or how much i read and try the stuff nothing works.

Am i really so ugly that i don't deserve love or sex? Did i do something wrong? People would say lower your expectations but i refuse. I don't plan on sleeping with women out of desperation. I want what i want!

But wanting something and not being able to do anything to get it really makes me mad and sad. I need help. I don't know what to do. I feel that if i love myself ill be able to become popular. But im afraid that if i love myself i would stop caring and will lose my dream of having sex with different beautiful women. Yeah i know the irony.

(Ugly guys don't want ugly girls, and ugly girls don't want ugly guys, and beautiful people just like beautiful people).

And im far away from were i want to be. But let me tell you no person is perfect. Women want to be with a perfect guy when they are not perfect themselves. Yes i want to have a good looking woman is that bad? Does that mean i don't deserve it for not being beautiful enough or tall enough? How come girls only want tall guys when they are short but we can't? Im so done with this. Im so tired of all this bullshit. I don't know why but this sucks. Im a person that deserves what i want because i have been good and i have improved and keep improving everyday. But still nobody cares about me. Just because im not a 10 does not means i don't deserve the attention.

People will just say well you didn't love yourself enough. Or you have to suffer in order to appreciate it more. And i say. Bullshit, if this is true, then when will it be enough? When will i be good enough? How much more do i have to suffer to be able to appreciate it? How come people that haven't done anything still gets whatever they want?

Yes we all know the world is not fair and you do what you can with the cards you have. But to be honest im exhausted. Exhausted of trying, exhausted of not trying. Some people say you have to try. Others say don't try and it will come. But i tried both and im exhausted.

Im just writing my frustrations because i honestly don't know what to do. I have been focusing on myself to be worthy of whatever i want. I heard that i first have to love myself to get love. And i have tried. And i like myself. Not as much as i would want to. But i still like and respect myself. So how come im still lonely. Yes i feel like i have myself and can do whatever. But when it comes to being loved by someone else its seems impossible. Maybe its destiny to be alone. Maybe i did something so bad in my past or my past life that i don't deserve love anymore. And im sad, because i like myself but even if i do love myself and respect myself. nobody else does. And im a human i want a connection. I want to be with the person i like, i want to be able to show myself and how i really am as a person. But when all people just judges you by your looks. People just look at you with disgust. Even tho i know im not that ugly, to feel those looks really hurt my pride and makes me question my self worth. Yes ""i should not have my self worth decided by women"" but to see everyone talk about how many different women that approach them or how many girls they had and vice versa, it makes me wonder Why i don't have something that is so normal.

If anyone have a magic pill that can make me have that person i want and have abundance with women or atleast have options that i want. Ill take whatever. Even tho my love life have been hell in the past i still have hope. And even if i don't get to be in love at least i don't want the pain of not being atleast likes at all.",True,False,[],False,TheRedPill,t5_2ve1u,0,public,self,Im confused and need help.,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dztwvw/im_confused_and_need_help/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

I mean 'energy' and 'state' as how someone else perceives the combination of your body language, vocal tone, optimism/pessimism/state of mind. Your energy.

I don't know much about trp, but this was the first place I thought would understand or be able to explain this because a grounded, relaxed presence is alpha. 

I watched part of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDUIZqXNk-M) interview with Shia LaBeouf, and was shocked how changed his presence is. I'm curious what specific changes he's made in his life that gave him that groundedness and how to maintain that every day. I know that feeling after lifting or meditating, but getting it to stick is difficult. Apparently he does an hour of cardio every single day. I can't imagine that's it though. There has to be a mental aspect to his change too. 

The interview had the odd effect of making me realize that other people frequently make me feel being grounded or just an alpha type presence is wrong. The tldr of the video is that Kristen Stewart gets more anxious as the interview goes on, but the man is so unaffected by it. My overall take on the situation is that honest attention and actually listening makes a lot of people uncomfortable, and they want shallow interactions and small talk. But during conversation, their anxiety makes me want to shift my behavior to make them more comfortable and it breaks my zen. Doing stuff like sympathy laughs.

Individuals in positions of power were not merely handed these positions; and if they were, it doesn’t necessarily negate the fact that you have it within all of your faculties to obtain a higher status. 

&gt;“Certainly, genetic differences matter. Some people’s genes dispose them to be unusually ambitious, or clever, or athletic, or artistic, or various other things— including unusually rich in serotonin. But these traits depend, for their flowering, on the environment (and sometimes on each other), and their eventual translation into status can rest heavily on chance. **No one is born to lead, and no one is born to follow**.” – *The Moral Animal* by Richard Wright

There are those who seem to dominate whatever arena they do with a confidence that suggests that they were *born with it.* And to some degree, they were; but that confidence that they exude so effortlessly would have been isolated and buried had they not been brought up a certain way or had been exposed to certain life-changing environments that seemingly revealed themselves through chance. 

&gt;“And to the extent that some people are born with a leg up in the race (as they surely are), that birthright probably lies at least as much in cultural as in genetic advantage. In any event, there are good Darwinian reasons to believe that everyone is born with the capacity for high serotonin—with the equipment to function as a high-status primate given a social setting conducive to their ascent.” – *The Moral Animal* by Richard Wright

If the next argument, then, is to posit that “unfortunate” social settings are what is holding back your genetic “birthright” (which we all have with our own little quirks) from flourishing, I doubt your plight, barring severe medical deficiencies (which pose their own examples), is as dire as an actual slave.

Frederick Douglass was born a slave and grew up one. He escaped and became the greatest voice for the abolition of slavery by seizing upon the opportunity to read. He learned letters through his “mistress” (slaveholder’s wife); and when threatened to stop, he stole bread to give to local “poor little white boys” who gave him reading lessons in secret. Douglass later in life reflecting, credited them substantially for being who he was. His natural inclination for the pursuit of knowledge, fostered by a very specific social context, created the figure that has transcended his time.

&gt;Self-made men are the men who, under peculiar difficulties and without ordinary help of favoring circumstances, have attained knowledge, usefulness, power and position and have learned from themselves the best uses to which life can be put in this world, and in the exercise of these uses to build up worthy character."" - *Self Made Men*, speech given by Frederick Douglass

This is an extreme circumstance used to illustrate that anyone with the correct mindset and creativity can efficiently climb the social ladder.

Something that just doesn’t add up from listening to people’s field reports. 

TRP has some great philosophies and great content. Nothing wrong with going to the gym, working on yourself, your business/job, nothing wrong with any of that. These are all great principles to live by—studies show that people who adhere to these things are generally happier and healthier.

Here’s where some of you are going to throw a fit—“spinning plates” is not an end goal nor is it a healthy medium of forming relationships. It can have some minor benefits, but mostly it is not conducive to a physically or mentally healthy lifestyle. Let me tell you why and do hear me out. 

Let’s talk about sex. When you have sex with someone, something very critical happens. You enjoy yourself, you have fun, whatever. However your brain is releasing chemicals that make you feel good and also chemicals to allow you to bond and develop a relationship further. 

When you set out to have sex with someone just to get a nut, you’re screwing your mental health in the long run. You’re trying to cheat biological and chemical releases of your brain. By “spinning plates” you have made the conscious decision that “I won’t get attached, I’ll only use them for pleasure.” A lot of you also spin plates in the name of “AWALT, so why try and have a relationship?”

That’s where you’re dead wrong—it is impossible to not get attached to someone when you enter into a sexual relationship. You’re body and brain does it on its own. No matter how much you say you don’t care about the person or how RP you are, you do care about them a little bit. You’re all human and most of you have empathy, emotion, feeling etc. Very few people on this planet are true psychopaths/sociopaths where they lack feeling and whatnot. 

After awhile of trying to cheat the bonding process, eventually you’ll either go nuts or you’ll start to feel empty-guaranteed. It may be moments after non-monogamous sex, a day, a week, a month, or whatever—but you will feel something not good. It’s because you didn’t begin with the end in mind. 

The idea of spinning plates is not entirely a bad thing. This usually happens when you’re young because you’re in the vetting process. But it should be short lived. 

See, going to the gym, working on yourself, your job, your business etc, are not goals—those are minimums. It’s easy to do all that. You can’t take anything with you when you die, but you can leave a legacy and something for your children to carry on for their children. 

You want to know what’s hard? Finding a good woman, balancing your life while you’re with her, raising children, and adhering to these principles the whole duration. 

Monogamy is not the enemy. I’m assuming most of you desire a mate at some point. “Well how could you just assume that?!” Biology, lads. For the most part there’s a biological tick inside you telling you to procreate and have children; that’s how humanity has survived for thousands of years and the population is increasing. Well how do you do that? You COMMIT, you take risks, but you hedge that risk as best as you can. The hardest part of finding a good woman is vetting her to make sure she is the best mate out there, invested in you, and completely committed to you. 

BUT if you adhere to these principles, you will hedge your risk against getting divorce raped, and hedge your risk against a woman leaving you because you properly vetted her. 

You can be happy alone, I’m not saying that. You can live a good life, but guess what? You’ll never live the close to perfect life. You can have it all—but you won’t have it all alone. You can get close to having it all alone, but you’ll never get it all. You may have to take risks, but it is possible to have a marriage or LTR that is grounded on male/female dynamics and will prosper forever. Spinning plates isn’t a goal nor is it conducive of a healthy lifestyle.

The desire for connection and intimacy with a woman. While mentally, we tend to associate intimacy and connection with serious relationships and marriage, this is actually a bad association. True intimacy and true connection happens when a woman doesn’t care if she ever sees you again. Only in that moment does she take her mask off and act like her true self. Only through a causal connection can you ever really be intimate with a woman and know her for who she really is. This is why you feel nauseous at the idea that your loving girlfriend used to have casual sex. It’s not just the sex she gave away, but the knowledge that other men had real intimacy and a real connection with her, while you see only the mask she wears as she hides her real self from you.
_____________________________________________

The Red Pill focuses primarily on sexual strategy. Characteristics and behaviors a man can use to improve the outcomes of his sex life. More opportunities with a larger number and greater quality of women, who tend to behave better for the man.

The overarching concept is fairly simple: Become a man who is valuable (or at least a man who emulates the behaviors of a valuable man), and women will want to have sex with you and will behave in a way that avoids losing the opportunity to have sex with you. We could talk for days about the tiny details about what makes a man valuable and why, or why women act the way they do, but the main idea is very simple and obvious. Being awesome gets you more opportunities to have sex with more and better women, and the women act better.

There are a lot of reasons men want to have sex with women. The most basic is the biological urge. Humans are driven to do the procreative act. Also fairly high on the list is the physical pleasure. Sex is fun and feels good. But there’s more to the desire than that. If sex was just about the orgasm, men would masturbate and avoid dealing with women entirely, and that would be just as good. Better, maybe, since you wouldn’t have to deal with women.

Some might say that having sex is validating. But validation is a very funny and loaded term that can mean a lot of different things to different people. For example, do men really have sex to brag to other men in the locker room, or avoid being made fun of for not scoring? Nah. Past adolescence, most men barely talk about their sex and relationship lives with other men, and most men don’t give a shit what other men think. Do men really care if people laugh at them or think they don’t score? Only to the extent that women overhear it and it costs you chances to have sex.

Men don’t really swell with pride over the idea that third parties know that they have sex. Sex isn’t about what other people think of us. We’re not after that kind of validation.

Sex is about you. Knowing that you can score. Knowing that you are desirable to certain women and skilled enough to make sex happen. It’s not even really about what the woman you’re having sex with thinks about you. It’s about you knowing what you are capable of. It’s about you knowing that you can meet your own sexual needs and that you are desirable.  For men, internal validation is far more important than external validation. We fuck because it validates us to ourselves. Not because we need others to think we’re great. Indeed, when a worthless incel, despite his best efforts, can’t have sex, he hates himself far more than he hates the women or other men laughing at him. He feels worthless due to his own standards, not the standards of others.

But there is something even more important than validation at play. More than the biological urge, more than the physical pleasure, and more than the internal validation we feel, sex is about intimacy. It’s about connecting with another person. We have sex because we are searching for connection. We don’t talk about the intimacy of sex that often, because we mentally equate intimacy and connection with marriage, relationships, serious commitments, etc. And most Red Pill men steer clear of those. But the majority of the fun of sex isn’t the orgasm. It’s the other person. It’s connecting with another human. As noted above, if it were just about having an orgasm, you can do that on your own.

The primary reason we are so wary about women is that we don’t trust them. We want to connect with them very badly, but we don’t trust them. Women aren’t evil, terrible, degenerate animals or anything like that. They’re just self-interested. And fickle. Their feelings change when their circumstances change, and the second a circumstance changes, the woman who loved you more than anything yesterday can tell you today that she hasn’t been happy for a long time, and in her mind, that is really how it feels.

We are hyper-sensitive about women’s sexual natures. The games they play, when they are casual about sex, when they pursue relationships. We always want to make sure we get the best deal: Casual sex whenever we want it, a relationship if we choose to pursue it. The idea that your girlfriend today, who had sex with you on the fourth date and says she loves you more than anything, used to drive out to bars to meet guys off of Tinder, with the explicit understanding that they were meeting for drinks followed by sex, and had sex with these guys the night she met them grates at us.

Why? We tell ourselves that this is just logic and economics. We don’t want to pay too much and invest for sex she gave away for free to other guys. That makes us a chump, right?

But it’s more than that.

Somewhere, deep inside, we know that when the woman we are dating seriously has been a casual girl for other men, we aren’t really connecting with her. We aren’t really getting her. What we have with her isn’t real intimacy.

Because when a woman is going to see you tomorrow, she cares what you think. She behaves in a way that will keep you from thinking bad things about her and judging her unfavorably. She acts like a good girl instead of the slut she has been for others, she hides her sexual history, and instead of acting fun, flirty, dirty, forward, cool, and casual, she puts on a mask for you and performs a dance intended to make you think good things about her, not judge her, and see her again tomorrow.

This is not real intimacy. This is not a real connection. This is an act.

When she drove out to meet a guy from Tinder, with the understanding that this meeting was for drinks followed by sex, and she didn’t care if she ever saw this guy again, in that moment, she was truly herself. She wore no mask. She did not perform a dance. She was fun, forward, flirty, dirty, slutty, cool, and casual. She enjoyed meeting the guy as herself. She enjoyed the sex simply for what it was. She behaved in a way she never would have behaved in front of a man she’s going to see tomorrow, and did things she may never tell anybody about.

In that moment, she was truly herself. No masks. No dances. No pretending. Because she did not have a dog in the race, did not care if she ever saw this guy again, and did not care what he thought about her, she was her most genuine. Her most free. This was true intimacy. The men she met in a casual context got to know the real her. What she is really like. They were intimate with her. They connected with her.

Her boyfriend? Her future husband? These men don’t know her. Not really. They are not truly intimate with her. They have never really connected with her. They know and love the mask she wears for them, but they don’t really know her. She has shown the real her to other men. Connected with other men. Been intimate with other men. But to the men most important in her life? She hides it all. No real intimacy. No real connection. So afraid of what they might think of her, and so afraid of being judged, she wears a mask and performs.

We seek unrestrained sexual desire from women, typically in the form of casual sex, because this is the only way to really and truly connect with a woman and experience actual intimacy. This is the only time you ever connect with the real woman. When the woman doesn’t care and has nothing to hide from you, because she isn’t going to see you again, you connect with the truest and most powerful intimacy. Her genuine self. Something she can never show her future husband for fear he will judge her.

Men often think about casual sex as an empty pursuit, and a more serious relationship as something more meaningful. They always ask stupid questions like “Casual sex is so empty. How do I find a girl to marry?” But a serious relationship is less intimate and less of a real connection. Not more. A serious relationship is a girl behaving well to make you think highly of her, while hiding her real self from you.

The reason dating a casual girl seriously makes us sick to our stomachs goes far beyond economics. It’s because we know we aren’t really connecting and aren’t really experiencing intimacy. We know we’re not getting the real her, while other men did. We aren’t just over-paying for sex that other men got for free. We are over-paying to not have real intimacy and not have a real connection, while other men had the true intimacy and connection we crave. Other men not only fucked your girlfriend.

Women horizontally. A woman is actually ""women"".**

One of the top rated posts here went like - ""Stop wondering what women's frames are, they don't exist"". Read it if you can. More specifically I observe that women's frames follow their emotions and are like water. They can change totally if enough of emotion is created. 

We also know women are herd animals - but let's look at it in a bit more detail. Observing the behavior of women closely for a while has made me realize that collective consciousness in women functions a bit differently from men. Men are more influenced vertically - i.e. a group of men can be made to follow the vision, mission and values of a leader who is at the top of the pyramid. Women on the other hand, are highly influenced laterally -- by the overall direction of the herd - what the herd of women overall feels or reacts or thinks or believes, that influences who she becomes. 

When a particular frame or narrative becomes established beyond a critical mass, your individual woman will change to reflect this, even unconsciously without external prompting. A woman is not an individual nearly to the same extent as man. To make man into a herd animal, we literally need to put them through the military grind where order is established after a lot of training, and rules and consequences, and even these men can be very individual in their frames outside of the call of duty. Men essentially are what they are because of creatures of habits. 

A woman on the other hand operates as a collective creature by default. A woman is not so much of an individual - a significant part of her is actually a collective woman herd consciousness.

When the herd was religious and god fearing and sex could cause pregnancy, most women were one way, believed and felt strongly in that direction. When it was the collective principle that women ought to become mothers and children, we had women marrying early and a childless woman was treated as bad luck (by other women no less). I come from a place where I'm seeing just how much people can change in 2 generations. When society is what it is now, you see them trying to identify themselves as feminist, or even bisexual or lesbian even if that is not who they are. Today when society tries to call the family as a burden, you see even otherwise normal women wanting careers and postponing or abandoning motherhood, much to the surprise of the previous generation, who are a different herd of women. 

The herd body of women is not just a mental thing. This really affects them at a deep level, down to even basic emotional responses - it's visceral in nature. You can make them revere a tradition or react with disgust to it just based on which way the herd goes, not on any objective criteria. You can make them start and drop a habit when it reaches critical mass in the herd - to make a man change a habit you need to literally rewire the cells in his body. In places where everyone seems depressed or having some kind of mental issue, your woman would probably turn into a case in short order (even if she isn't normally that way). You could change just about everything in their mind by just the herd momentum. That's how weak their frames are.

What doesn't change is the body. That hasn't really changed at all, therefore at least in matters of sexual attraction, women have not really changed, although it can lead to some real cognitive dissonance in them. But if you can get them out of their head for a while, you'll see that hasn't changed. If anything it's reemerging in it's original form now.

To understand women, one must study everything and everyone around them in addition to who they are. Your woman is actually more of ""all women in her range of her awareness"" than one person.

Hey guys. 19M. 6’5”. 191lb. I’m writing this very soon after the event. My friends I are going to sleep after this disaster.

I got with my old friends from high school for alumni night, and planned to get fucked up later, but this chick, name her Q, who always had the hots for me when I was a bp orbiter (and so retarded I never took the hint for four years), tagged along. She was not an experienced drinker. We all got to her place to chill bc she insisted her place (?) and we don’t really want to put a fuss and just chill with my willing host adult sister.

I want to emphasize Q never went to college, her mother and entire abusive family (all women, literally, a chain of unplanned births) kicked her out of the house at 18, and her recently engaged LTR cheated and dumped her. She has no one. I knew all of these going in, and was *not* sticking my dick anywhere near that hellfire. Before alumni night, she had reached out to me first, practically forefronting her affection. I'll admit fault for leading her on.

Her apartment is a total mess, and she owns four house animals. The place was disgusting. I had thought I could get a FWB or some dumb shit from her attraction, but I’m beginning to delve into this girls’ inner madness, simply because I was curious to see where it went in the end. The shitty cats and dogs are irrelevant, but annoying as fuck the whole time.

She brings out eight bottles, most unopened, saying she’d never gotten “totally drunk” before. She drank an entire bottle of cherry wine. It was kind of me and my friends’ faults for encouraging her to drink so much, because she went off the rails. For the next three hours, we had to *slowly* babysit her into bed while she cried, stumbled, confessed and whined for three fucking hours. We were miserable. Our original goal the entire night was to get merrily fucked up on our one night in town together, but then it became **get this bitch to bed.**

In her blackout state, she kept telling me she never wanted me to leave and how much she loved me, whining, being sick and puking as her body reacted to the poison she drank with no chaser or nothing. We helped her as best we could to keep her from dying. She was acting like a child, and I had to console her like one.

We didn’t want to leave Q while she was dancing around her gross apartment, crying at every misinterpreted stimuli and drunken bruise (fainted 5 times). It was a pain in my ass because she was so incredibly infatuated with me, and the only way to calm her down was to hold her hand and play the billy beta.

I’d known this girl as a real person in high school, and watching her downfall as her shitty upbringing destroyed her mental state over four years was so deeply painful to witness crashing open all at once. A woman’s spirit being torn down with nothing left. She made me too sad. I couldn’t stay. Her emotional baggage in of itself was a huge turnoff, no matter how badly she wanted to fuck me that night.

Side note: I know many guys attest to never emotionally investing in a woman, but I’m not sure here. I cared about her platonically, and she was a good friend who stuck with me through practically everything I did before I graduated and moved states. The sudden openness of her feelings would have caused a different version of me to throw myself on top of her (or get on my knees), but now, I knew I needed to stay the fuck away.

I tried leaving her bedroom so she could sleep and I could go home, by this point, it was 12pm and the night was ruined. She began to panic hard, crying and screaming. When she got out of her bedroom, suddenly she turned conscious. My friends were surprised that she’d suddenly regained her memory, and Q was saying she couldn’t remember anything past falling off the couch.

The guys explained to me later, apparently I, as a flat fucking 245lb 4-5 in high school with complete BP indoctrination, convinced no girl liked me, was being **orbited** by a crazy chick who I had always felt platonic to, and it drove her insane. Q got with someone else who seemed great for her until he very recently ghosted her. Plot twist: Micropenis, dead bedroom, mutual gaslighting and codependency.

The three of us men began to leave (1am and we’re all tired) after she slowly recovered from her unconsciousness, puking a few more times.

**This particular moment is disturbing to me.**

During her recovery, she started to emulate her extremely abusive single mother she’d grown up with, lashing out and taking all my men’s words, actions and expressions as ego attacks or whatever she wanted to interpret. She began shouting at her dogs, which made some hard callbacks to me seeing her mother when Q was 15, shouting and cursing, as though that was normal when it's not.

My best friend is trying to console her with wisdom (drink water, go to bed), when she flat out tells him to *shut the fuck up.* He reacts by turning and heading for the door, where she immediately backpedals so hard she’s practically begging and crying for him to stay when he’s at he door (he later told me he no longer gave a fuck about her). My mind was exploding from witnessing a live redpill moment, the likes of which I’d never seen, only read.

Eventually, we secure her safety and leave the apartment. Before leaving, I had to finally break it to her that “it:” whatever her hypergamy was looking for in me and my future, wouldn’t work: I live at college two states away, and she works as a hospital janitor to make ends meet. She bursts up the stairs to her place and slams the door.

We all decided to get pizza and milkshakes after, as reward for our endurance. I made a new friend, too. Were it not for the third’s arrival, my best friend and I may have been trapped without emergency transport.

I’m not hurt at all by any this.

EDIT: I'm going to be honest that this has been seriously fucking me up of late. After the event, I got high as shit so I didn't think much of it, but now I feel so ashamed that I could matter this much to a person and not reciprocate. **She's been wanting to fuck me for four years.** I've considered an LDR, but I know from reading that's a hard no, and as to any kind of relationship past this point, I want to preserve the good memories of her I have, because I've cut her off completely, as has everyone I believe.

Yet I feel partially guilty. I led her on a few days prior through suggestive Snapchat texts, thinking this was just some easy poon when I got into town, and my friends and I encouraged her to “get lit.” She made me realize many new things about the world we all share.

I’ve felt for so long like my smv has always been lower, despite boxing, inconsistent, but dedicated lifting, and careful dieting. I feel like I’ve worked hard to produce a better version of myself since I discovered the redpill on pure accident (browsing through reddit until some leftist openly mocked the subreddit). To be honest, I do believe my smv has gone from 4 to 6, but I was never aware of this woman’s disproportionate attachment to me.

I’m not sure what else I can learn from this, besides not sticking my dick in crazy. My best friend leaving after being insulted displayed consequence for her actions, which she still hasn’t learned, I think, and may never. She takes her anger out by verbally assaulting her two puny dogs. She is honestly a basket case. Perhaps we, as men, can learn from BPD women.

It was censored / unpublished in every sub so far; even though it was appropriate for their forum. A complaint about the censorship got me banned from one.

I was gone from reddit for a while. The number of women/trolls/lurkers/WK/simps giving me a hard time in DMs and chat because of my posts has increased significantly since I have been back. So I decided to rewrite this to have it in my post history.

I’m not even going to get in to the petty stuff like the time I lost a job because I formally complained to HR about a female supervisor sexually harassing me.

Lets start with my mother. (I usually call her by name, but I don’t want to give away info.)

I am blind in my left eye from birth because my mother tried to kill me and my twin in the womb. She succeeded with him. She wanted to get rid of us. She lived in a time, place and family where abortion was neither practical nor even legal. But she got lucky. She came down with a vaginal yeast infection. She let it fester for months (I have read the medical records) until it penetrated the cervical mucosa plug and entered the amniotic sack. It got into my twins lungs. He was born dead. It got in my left eye.

My childhood was a nightmare because of this.

I had three eye surgeries before age five to save my life. I had a growth that was blocking a drainage duct. My eye was either going to push back into my brain until I bled to death in my skull or it was going to swell outward until it popped like popcorn.

I died on the operating table all three times.

I remember the last time. I was five. I have been told, but do not remember doing it, that if you wore a white coat or jacket around me I would scream. But hey, that’s toxic masculinity right there!

When I was three the older boys in my neighborhood started tormenting me. I’ll get back to that.

My mother and the old man broke up when I was seven. He walked out on us. Of course it was all my fault. (To be fair he was a piece of crap too. I usually call him by name too.)

She spent the next five years torturing me to punish me for him leaving. She beat me and starved me. She made me watch her have sex. She did a lot of drugs. There was a lot of screaming and psychological abuse and just a lot of really messed up stuff all around.

One of her short-term “boyfriends” climbed into my bed one night. It wasn’t to molest me. He was too drunk to find his way back to her bed. He had gotten beaten very, very, very badly by some guy in our drive way. Then they had drunk sex with his head all split open and bleeding everywhere, with her door open which meant I could see everything. (It was against the rules for me to close my door, ever, even if I didn't want to see some things. There were lots of rules.) They passed out. In the middle of the night he had to piss. He made it to the bathroom. I suppose that was an accomplishment. Then he crawled into my bed and passed out. I was eight.

There was quite a bit of sexual abuse when I was younger, mostly 6-9. It was always at the hands of slightly older females (teenagers); most were babysitters, a few were relatives. Fathers: NEVER leave your young boys unattended around women aged 12-19. I was molested every single time, without exception! Even if it is a group of them. That actually makes it worse. They egg each other on.

I got a lot of crap about my eye as a kid. All the girls teased me and were mean to me. And I mean every single one, without exception. Of course a lot of guys were jerks about it too. But a lot didn’t care. I got beat up a lot, mostly randomly. But there were two groups that made my life hell from ages 7-12; because of my eye they hunted me for sport. Literally.

It was two large groups of boys. The group at home was 20 total and was organized by a local older boy with severe clinical issues, like setting his younger brother on fire. The group at school was 19 total and was organized by the younger brother. He was the only overlap. The older one tried to cut me a few times over the years. We suspect that he planted a broken 2 liter glass Coke bottle in the grass where everyone knew my 7th birthday was going to be held. I stepped on it. It almost cut my foot in half long ways through the middle. I estimate that the two groups kicked my butt in groups of 3-17 at least 150x. I think I was hit by somebody, either at home or school, almost everyday from age 3-9. And I just took it. I thought that was my lot in life. Then I had an original idea one day at age 9: I don’t have to take this crap. When I started fight back then things got really interesting. But that is a story for another day.

And yes feminazis, that is MoM VIOLENCE! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Don’t be triggered! It’s OK. Besides, if my mom had not made me a target by leaving me with a minor facial defect by trying to abort me with a disease then maybe my life would not have been quite so hard?

I finally got away from her when I was 12. I finally got away from that neighborhood about 2 years later. But I did go back to visit some. I did have some friends. ALL GUYS!

I never got any dates.

When I got muscles in high-school I started getting laid at parties. And had several bad experiences. I was never accused of rape. But there were some fights over that too. Everyone of them was because I hooked up with some chick I met at the party, while she was there with her boyfriend! And every single time they lied to me and told me they were single.

Marriage #1: 1.5 years total relationship. Early 20‘s. She was fat. I hurt my back lifting at work. She dumped me shortly after. It took me about 1.5 years out of work total for me to recover. I was out of work out six months before she disappeared for two weeks. She came back to get her stuff. I had to move into a subdivided basement apartment literally the size of a jail cell with a community toilet. That was all I could afford on my workcomp benefits. I worked hard. I got a lot better but was left partially disabled.

Marriage #2: 2.5 years total. I stopped a nut job from killing a building full of women and children while on the job and got some very, very high level medals. (BTW, none of the women I saved ever said thank you. Not one! But the men in their families could not say it enough.) That incident hurt me bad enough that it took me almost 3 years to recover, get back to work and get my muscles back, but within my limitations. I KNOW how to rehab injuries. I’m very good at it. My legal disability was bumped a few percentage points. She kicked me out after about 12 months. I had to go live in my grandmothers attic.

When I tried to move out of my grandmothers house she black mailed me for $500 for a rental reference. (I swear to God I am not making this up guys!)

Rebound: This one was weird. It lasted nine months, until I found out she was married.

""Marriage"" #3: This one lasted 13 years. To give credit where credit is due she did stay by my side through my gut issues. As a matter of fact she literally carried me through those 2.5 years. If not for her I would be dead. I think she stayed because what I was going through was so similar to how both of her parents who passed away from bowel cancer died.

But it was not cancer. It was abdominal sepsis caused by a \*female\* surgeon screwing up my gallbladder removal surgery. (Am I the only one seeing a pattern here or what?) She used the wrong version of the operation for me because it put more cash in her pocket to do that version.

I spent 2.5 years in hell on the brink of death. I was in and out of the ER 6-12x a month with infections that could have actually made my intestines fall out. At one point I was in ICU for 30 days with multiple organ failure. People use the word agony far too lightly. They were putting needles in my spine Borg style to kill the pain!

None of the other hundreds of doctors that I saw ever told me what the problem was. They all blew smoke, meds and tests up my butt. They had no answers. I don’t know if that was specifically a pussy pass or if they were just protecting another doctor.

I figured out how to fix my gut issues with diet, exercise and natural medicine. (I found out much later, much more recently, that it was sepsis from a male Navy Corpsman who I told all the details to.)

We got our lives back on track. We maxed out a bunch of credit cards in her name. We got a truck and an RV. We were going to work and travel. We hit the road $40K in debt, with a dream and waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much of her junk.

We were in a rollover wreck. I triple broke my neck. Not our fault, the other party got away, but I was smart enough to get us good insurance in my name and all assets purchased were in my name. We also never did the paperwork on the “marriage”. It was a sham for her fefes because she didn’t want everyone to know I wouldn’t marry her for a very long time. When we collected from the insurance it was in my name only. She split. But I dictated the terms. I got the lions share. But I was far more generous with her than I was required to be by law because I have found a way to be immune to cohabitations legal dangers. I know. It worked for me. I would still not do it again though. I have never done the divorce paperwork with #2. SFAIK, neither has she. I have not seen her in 20 years. Evidently if you are legally married, but estranged, at least for insurance purposes, that makes you the sole receiver of funds if assets are titled only in your name gentlemen.

Note: Do no climb up on you high-horse and blast me for scamming her. I was running a scam, but it was not on her. It was on our creditors. The scam would take a few years to pull off but the basic plan was she would declare bankruptcy. I would transfer all assets into her name. I would declare bankruptcy. We would get married. Then she got drunk one night and revealed the REAL plan: Wait until I put everything in her name then dump me on the curb.

I have no doubt that I was far more equitable with the distribution of our assets than she would have been!

When she kicked me out I was still having seizures from the TBI and I could not lift anything over 10# without screaming.

Dr.s wanted $250K to rebuild my triple broken neck out of rubber and steel.

I said ###$#$\^\^\*&amp;&amp;\^ NO.

I ate about 1600-2000 hours of pain over about 15-18 months in various gyms to put myself back together.

I got an RV.

I hit a couple of different cities.

Worked out like a mad man far too often and put my neck back together fairly well.

Even though I have limitations I know how to workout around them. I am muscular again. I bench bodyweight and deadlift 1.5x bodyweight; which is a miracle considering what I've been through. I look like Stallone in Demolition Man, but with better definition and vascularity. Now that I look all muscular again all these women that are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too young for me (1/2-1/3 my age) keep looking at me like I am a medium rare filet mignon sitting in a big old bowl of cash salad.

Quite frankly it’s disgusting.

I've seen a bunch of women's magazines articles on the net telling young chicks they should date old dudes like me because we are desperate to get between their legs, have money and we'll buy them expensive crap (shoes, bags, etc) to get a little poontang.

Younger women are already primed to think that us old dudes are rich and waisting money on them by this junk. Then they see me with muscles and a tan, both of which take time and money, and it's obvious that I don't have any money problems.

They look at me they l like I'm a giant wallet that's wrapped in a nice package. It doesn't hurt that I have a larger than average chest and a larger than average crotch.

But the look in their eye tells me that money is absolutely their first concern. The chest and the crotch are just a bonus.

One of my Wing Chun Brothers says that I am the equivalent of a nice new shiny bank.

It literally disgust me when women look at me like that.

I have not had any woman, at all, look at me in any other manner in the last 3 years since my ex kicked me out, not one; which is a major factor in me going my own way.

All women of every age, including my own, look at me like I'm the shiny new bank.

The raw avarice is blatantly obvious.

It insults my intelligence because they all think I am too stupid to see it. It is written all over their faces.

I am trying a new gym. I dislike those money-grubbers so much I would rather deal with the cleaning crew at the gym than all the whores trying to get into my wallet through my zipper. So I switched over from a day schedule to a night schedule. All the THOTs at the new gym disappear at 11:45p because the floor cleaners come out at 12a. All guy crews in the areas where I was. There were all cool. I talked to them tonight. The pool and hot tub are not shut down for cleaning till 6a. There were a couple of other dudes there working out. But I basically had run of the place. It was great. I took one of my Wing Chun Brothers with me. We got a really good workout. 

I can go from 12a-6a and basically have run of the place. It might be fun. I think I’m going to like working out around the cleaning crew a lot more than around the gold digging, yoga pants whores that keep trying to get into my wallet through my zipper. We basically just stay out of each others way.

That is a perfect example of how I have gone my own way. I would rather flip my schedule 180 and go from living on a day schedule to a night schedule than put up with a bunch of women objectifying me and bothering me while I try to achieve goals in peace.

At this point I literally have no use for females at all, what-so-ever. I know my value to them:  I am a tool, a resource and a utility. As a man I have no intrinsic value as a human being. When I need help, when I am no longer capable of providing I am to be set out with the trash. At least until such time as \*after\* I spend years eating pain and get myself back on my feet. Then, just as soon as I have muscles and pay check again all of a sudden they get \*real\* interested in getting some of what I have.

I have a very high libido. I keep it under control. At this point I am so disgusted by women that I seriously doubt that I will ever have sex again to the day I day; despite having more than ample opportunity. 

Now you are up to speed on why I have no need to interact with certain people in this place; especially those of a vaginal persuasion or their defenders. It’s bad enough that I have to interact with you out in the world.

Are you not capable of giving us men a little room to have our own conversations? Does that hurt your fefes to know that we don’t want you here. And please feel free to take the phrasing in every possible manner.

Now, go away.

Cuz now men are going to crack beers, scratch ourselves, manspread, relax and talk. Do you mind? Is that OK with you? Do you know sarcasm when you see it?

Don’t go away mad, just go away. Go be strong, independent women who don’t need men like me and my crap!

Match allegedly not only sent false advertisements claiming a fictitious person wanted to meet them, they knowingly allowed users to be contacted by third party romance scammers to boost their bottom line.  Match's business model allows people to sign up and view profiles for free, but requires an upgrade to a paid subscription to respond to messages.

Some highlights of the report:
* Match knowingly allowed romance scammers to contact unpaid members to induce them to purchase subscriptions
* Millions of contacts that generated Match’s “You caught his eye” notices came from accounts the company had already flagged as likely to be fraudulent. However, Match blocked these messages from being sent to existing paid subscribers.
* During a 2 year period through 2018, nearly 1/2 million people purchased a Match subscription within 24 hours of receiving a message from a *fake* profile
* In some months between 2013 and 2016, more than half of the instant messages and favorites that consumers received came from accounts that Match identified as fraudulent
* In 2018, romance scams ranked number one on the FTC’s list of total reported losses to fraud.  The Commission’s Consumer Sentinel complaint database received more than 21,000 reports about romance scams, and people reported losing a total of $143 million
* Match promised a free six-month subscription if users did not “meet someone special,” without adequately disclosing numerous requirements before the company would honor the guarantee
* Customers who unsuccessfully attempted a chargeback were blocked from services they had paid for
* Failed to provide a simple method for a subscriber to stop recurring charges from being placed

I moved to California from Russia 2.5 years ago, but I started to approach American girls just recently (I was in relationships). I’m 23 years old, good-looking, have my own business, a car, do semen retention, yoga, mediation. I have a high-value in my country, but here everything is different. I’ll appreciate your help in understanding the situations that keep happening to me. 

So, here’s my experience. There are couple girls in my college from two different classes who clearly showed their interest in me (smiles, stares, staying close to me), but when I approached them they were cold and didn’t look interested at all. I decided just to give them my business card (I’m professional photographer) and told that they can follow me on Instagram or text me. Didn’t want to push. So, they didn’t follow me and now they don’t show any signs of interest at all. I was like “ok, fine. I don’t want to play games, so I don’t care”. 

But today was important! Because I approached one girl from yoga class (not in the college), who is just divine-looking. I’m absolutely amazed by her beauty and her energy. She was definitely interested and she was very friendly. I complemented her and she told me that I look good too, she liked my name, she stopped when I was talking to her and looked in my eyes, she asked questions, and she decided to hug me at the end!! I didn’t want to ask for a date the first minute, so I told her that I’d be happy to take some photos of her (to have an opportunity to see her again). She agreed to collaborate and I gave her my business card. I said the same, - “to follow me or feel free to text me”. Now I think that it was a mistake. I should have asked her number, because even though she acted not cold at all, I didn’t hear back from her!! 

People, I just want to know! Why is it happening? Is it ok to tease me like this? Is it ok to keep things move so slowly? What to expect? 

I will definitely go to the same class next week and hope to see her there, but I feel so weird now.
