27,54,"&gt; The majority of women have faked an orgasm at least once in their lives. In the current study, we assessed how women’s worldviews about gender relate to their faking orgasm behavior. A survey of 462 heterosexual women from the UK (Mage=38.38 years) found that those who espoused anti-feminist values—that is, those high in hostile sexism—had faked significantly more orgasms over their lifetime. In contrast, those who espoused ostensibly positive but restrictive ideas of gender relations—that is, those high in benevolent sexism—had faked significantly fewer orgasms over their lifetime. Furthermore, the more that women believed female orgasm was necessary for men’s sexual gratification, the more likely they were to have faked an orgasm at least once in their lives compared to women who had never faked an orgasm. These effects were small to moderate and emerged after controlling for demographics, sexual history, ease of orgasm, and previously established psychological correlates of faking orgasm, including suspected partner infidelity and intrasexual competition",onlyforsex,2019-10-03 23:19:10,2019-10-04 02:10:50,/r/Feminism/comments/dcyn3j/xposted_from_rscience_women_who_hold_antifeminist/f2cz5tg/,t3_dcyn3j,Feminism,2,0,2019-10-04 02:10:50,0.27377,0.00097,0.00706,0.02339,0.00722,0.0026,0.76559,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

There was apparently a lot of backlash and the columnist had to issue a retraction, saying that in trying to very hard to be ""sex positive"" he had not even thought about the wife's perspective.  It took angry people writing in and cancelling their subscriptions for him to even begin considering the woman's side.

Strange, it doesn't happen to me. Feel free to check my karma. And what will you do with your imaginary Reddit points? Hahahahahaha. 

Some valuable informations for you: 

&gt;Why did you, a misogynist, do this?

&gt;There are several reasons you may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

&gt;Rudeness towards other misogynistic Redditors,
Spreading accurate information,
Not pandering to your rape cheerleading heteropatriarchal ideology,



&gt;did you got banned from the Reddit?

&gt;No - not yet because Reddit is a hub of irrationally misogynistic folks like you. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.





&gt;You don't believe your comment deserved a downvote on per with other misogynists. Can I un-downvote it? Of course, but I literally don't have a reason to do so...cause  you are a misogynist. 

&gt;I'm completely unforgiving towards those who support misogyny, transmisogyny, perisexism, racism, rape, homophobia, LGBT phobia, classism, castism etc.. So, there's no reason that I will ever undo my downvote.  

&gt;How can you prevent this from happening in the future?

## Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## Am I banned from the Reddit?

## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

84,135,"I believe that clothes are an extension of our personality, at least for those who put a lot of thought into it. Initially, this began as a personal wear for me because I really wanted a feminist-themed shirt to show my faith to the movement, but the more I thought about it, the more I thought it would be nice as a feminist themed graphic tee line. The design above depicts an abusive relationship, and is actually from a comic that all of you should read from an artist named Cailey Tervo (link's here  [https://caileytervo.tumblr.com/post/37624945670/be-sure-to-full-view-each-page-because-at-least](https://caileytervo.tumblr.com/post/37624945670/be-sure-to-full-view-each-page-because-at-least)). The name is *Youth Against Misogyny*, which was a phrase that came to my mind one day and I thought that sounded really nice. I looked up the phrase, because it sounded like it could be the name for a real feminist organization, but it turns out it wasn't. The reason I like that name is because to me, it supports the idea that teens (like me), young adults should be fighting for the cause, and should show that appreciation in the form of graphic tees. Weaponized fashion I like to call it. Basically, I want the community to tell me what they think of this idea, and if I get enough support, then I'll probably start making a lot of designs and sell them on a website. I haven't decided what I want to do with the earning I might make, as I don't want to keep them to myself. I might donate them to feminist organizations, at least if I can find one where I can give an unofficial donation to. **This is not for pure profits.**",AngelWysterra,2019-10-09 23:39:12,2019-10-09 23:39:13,/r/Feminism/comments/dfpb2a/my_idea_for_feminism_theme_shirts/f34z5zw/,t3_dfpb2a,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-09 23:39:13,0.00622,1e-05,0.00063,0.00089,0.00082,5e-05,0.0011,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I""m not aware of any study that has proven an effect of this sort of porn movies on misogynistic attitudes let alone criminal offenses, so I see no reason to forbid them (those that are not actually forbidden anyhow). I am quite happy with them being shunned in civil discourse though and obviously protecting the youth from seeing them is important.

Advice:

* Change at least half of your male characters to female. You can probably keep all of the characteristics and storylines you've already built because women are people with a wide variety of personalities, personal histories, and quirks. It sounds like you're terrible at writing female characters, so it might be better if you wrote the characters as male and then made them female at the end to ensure they're actual characters and not just props.
* Is the wife beater in the story seen as a bad guy, or is he a protagonist/regular dude whose his wife exists just to make his character seem more complex? If it's the latter, get rid of that whole storyline. At the very least, give the woman a name.
* Add another character to the fair to flesh out your ""distressed people in difficult life situations"" angle.

Well, a lot of cis women also support gender stereotypes and happens to be hard core misogynists. Does that mean you stop being a feminist for cis women? Just like some cis women, some trans women are misogynists. This observation further prove that trans women are indeed women . 

&gt;hormone therapy, and surgery being targeted at younger ages. I think a lot of this is core body dysmorphia issues, and if a person were given some good therapy and some good acid, they would see the idea of surgery to look a certain way as barbaric (because it is). I really wonder why we are so quick to throw some pills at the situation instead of diving into why the person feels so depressed being in their given body in the first place.

BDD(gender neutral and a pretty common disorder) and GD are different things. Dysmorphia and dysphoria are not same thing. And not all trans women experience GD.  To qualify as trans women, they simply don't have to.

159,246,"I'd like to get in to this and give me perspective .

1. Gender Stereotypes have been a part of our society for so long that certain behaviour and actions are attributed to one gender or another. A lot of trans people are immersed around these stereotypes for a young age and they feel like they can relate more to a certain ""role"". Not saying it's right but that's how the media has impacted minds.

2. I do not necessarily think its targeted, I myself only learnt about hormone therapy and surgeries when I was in my late teens. Most trans people state that they knew they were born as the wrong gender from an early age and when they are older they may choose to transition. And it is a huge change for the person, they will not proceed unless they are 100% sure.

3. Honestly I think that comment is fairly demeaning. It's not exactly fair to put trans people in their own category as if they were sub human.

You dont need to understand the trans movement but need to acknowledge how hard it must be to know you are not born the way you feel like you should be.

my issue with the trans movement is as follows :

 1. it reinforces gender stereotypes. many trans people I have met or talked to online will say things like, I knew I was really female because I like to paint my nails and wear dresses etc. 

2. hormone therapy, and surgery being targeted at younger ages.
I think a lot of this is core body dysmorphia issues, and if a person were given some good therapy and some good acid, they would see the idea of surgery to look a certain way as barbaric (because it is). I really wonder why we are so quick to throw some pills at the situation instead of diving into why the person feels so depressed being in their given body in the first place. 

3. trans athletes. this is a quick fix, there needs to be a trans devision for sports. what is happening in female athletics right now with the introduction of trans mtf athletes is making a mockery of the entire thing.

Any man that makes you feel like you have to put on an act is not worth it. Your purpose in life is not to constantly please men. You are your own person first. Also men have different tastes and preferences so it’s impossible to please all of them. You’ll spend your entire life putting on different acts, changing your style, etc. My mom would always say things like “boys don’t like a lot of makeup” or “boys don’t like women who swear”. One time my sister wanted to cut her hair short and my mom immediately said “Boys like long hair”. I used to take what she said  seriously until one day I thought, “Well I like makeup”and “But my sister thinks short hair is cute...and it’s HER hair”. Why deny myself of something that will make me feel excited and confident? Why spend my whole life trying to impress men? Your opinion matters more than a hypothetical man’s opinion.

I realized that I will be with myself everyday, but I won’t always be with the people I tried to please, so what’s the point in focusing on what they think instead of what I think? I should do what makes me happy and comfortable. It can be small things. For example, I now wear red/wine colored lipsticks around my mom even though I know she thinks it looks bad.

333,1042,"&gt; Put in quick simple terms it’s an economic system free of intervention, apart than the government making sure contracts are upheld, so first thing to understand is that a fully capitalist system doesn’t exist 

Seems it is you that does not understand what capitalism is. A ""fully"" capitalist system doesn't exist because it CANNOT exist without the state.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; This blog post doesn’t even understand what capitalism is and starts off acting as if Central banks trying to manipulate interest rates is a function of capitalism. If you don’t understand why that’s silly I don’t believe you know what capitalism is either 

&amp;#x200B;

So you are one of those 'end the fed' Ron Paul types here to lecture us. Yeah, the thing is, without the central banks ""manipulation"" capitalism couldn't keep expanding and growing. The fed was put in place to keep capitalism afloat. Even in the idealized vision of a world with money backed by gold that you 'libertarians' espouse there was still all the inequality issues, unjust hierarchies and oppression. The modern global economies of the world couldn't last one day without the central bank institutions. Capitalism relies on constant growth, otherwise it fails, plain and simple. You might not like the solutions that the government has used to ""bandaid"" capitalism, but without them capitalism would already be finished. Also, its almost on its way out anyway with the invention of automation and robotics.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Why on earth would women not be able to be treated equally in a free market?

Theres no such thing as a ""free market"" markets under capitalism are prone to market failures and negative externalities, for a simple example, pollution is a negative externality enabled by capitalism. According the the ""free market"" pollution is beneficial, thats how the economy works. You then have government attempt to regulate, which would be fine if it wasnt for the fact that capital accumulates at the top and then gets used to lobby the government to ignore negative externalities. The profit motive always ends up winning.

Your free market is a fantasy, capitalism and the state are one in the same and as long as they exist, woman will never be free. Heck men aren't really free either, but in a system of hierarchies such as this, they get a better shot.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Having a Marxist economy or something wouldn’t make anyone less sexist. It’s just silly 

Correct. That's known as being class reductionist, however, its much easier to oppress woman once you have financial dominance over them. It's not called a capitalist patriarchy for no reason.

Of course reactionaries like to meme here about how its a competency hierarchy but nobody with any honesty can actually believe that. Capitalism is primarily about being born into positions of privilege and the rags to riches stories are just numerous enough to ensure that the capitalist propaganda machine is never questioned.

Yes, you 'could' escape poverty by risking all the capital you have, risking bankruptcy and homelessness to 'make it'. Meanwhile a multi-millionaire can bankrupt 75 businesses before having one succeed, turning them into a billionaire. Definitely a game of skill.

&gt; Perhaps women were more likely to initiate divorces because, as Rosenfeld found, married women reported lower levels of relationship quality than married men. In contrast, women and men in non-marital relationships reported equal levels of relationship quality.

I think its hard to know exactly what the motivation is or who has the motivation to leave, but according to this study https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3153584/ men are less likely to survive cancer and I would suspect therefore deal with cancer for a shorter period of time.

Am i denying it exists? no, but i am leaning towards that it may be caused by some personal responsibility issues rather than it just be because you're a female. The 2 big reasons i think this, (this is not backed by data, this is in my head) :

1. When i apply for a job, 90% of the time it has something like ""compensation: 65,500/ yr"".  Ive never seen one say ""compensation: for Men $65,000, Women: $45,000"".  My point is, if i were female and applied at a job, and they offered me $45,000 a year, even though i know it said 65 on the job description... wouldn't you question that?
2. Theres too many factors that go in to determining a ""gap"". For example, just saying ""Women who have the same job and same title as a man, gets XX% less."" Ok, but does that woman have the same education? experience? awards? dedication? etc.. as the man?  I am a network engineer. lets say i get paid $90,000 a year (i wish), i have an uncle who is also a network engineer, he gets paid $220,000.  Why? Its the same title, same job description?

438,1181,"Statistically, if you own a gun, you're more likely to get shot than if you don't. The idea that a gun provides safety is, unfortunately, a fallacy. Especially, if you have children, getting a gun needs to weighed *extremely carefully* against the risk it poses.

A gun isn't even that useful for preventing rapes or assaults. Stranger rapes are the minority. Even then, rapists don't yell ""I'm a rapist"" and then give you a chance to shoot them. Chances are, a gun you carry would just be used against you in such cases. 

Most rapes are committed by people the victim knows. Suppose your friend gets tipsy at a party and gets a little handsy with you after everyone else left... at what point do you decide to pull your glock (from your cocktail dress friendly underarm holster) and blow his brain over your sofa? When he tries to kiss you? When he goes for 2nd base? When he's on top of you? Or should you wait for penetration, maybe even ejaculation to have some evidence for the police?

Holding a gun makes you feel powerful. I get it. But realistically, in practice, it's not a useful tool against rape or sexual assault.

For that matter, self-defence classes probably won't enable you to overpower your attackers either. Kung fu movies make it seem like technique is all important but in real-life, size and weight matter above all else and most women are outmatched by most men. What self-defence classes help with, is with giving you mental preparedness, so when something happens you're less likely to freeze and more likely to be able to respond at all. Rapists are fucking cowards and if you have the wherewithal to stand up for yourself, make a scene, cause a ruckus, maybe fight back at all, they'll let off. Even if you wouldn't stand a chance in an all out fight, just putting up *some* kind of fight is often enough to get them to let off.

I'm all for taking self-defence classes. Just don't expect to turn into Black Widow.

Some women do own and carry guns and feel safer with them.  Some women use their guns in self defense successfully.  But many women have their guns turned against them, especially in domestic situations.  Many other women use their guns legitimately for self defense only to then be unfairly prosecuted for murder.

Also a lot of times the difference in how women will be treated for self defense with guns depends on whether she's white and whether her assailant was non-white, so race is a big factor here too.",snarkerposey11,2019-10-03 13:15:01,2019-10-03 13:20:21,/r/Feminism/comments/dcp6zh/why_dont_more_feminists_push_for_women_getting/f2a4lws/,t3_dcp6zh,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-03 13:20:21,0.0085,9e-05,0.00046,0.00881,0.00202,0.00024,0.00097,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

# Gender Pay Gap

""Gender pay gap"". I hate this. This is the worst thing that the feminism movement has brought to modern attention. This is for a few reasons, but to point this out now: I have no idea where any of the raw data for this topic comes from, so if someone could enlighten me, that would be very helpful, thanks. As for the other reason...

There is no single gender pay-gap. There are pay-gap**s** that are very big, gap**s** that are very small, gap**s** that are either nothing or next to nothing and there are also (albeit less and of lesser magnitude) gap**s** in favour of women ([Source](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/findoutthegenderpaygapforyourjob/2016-12-09)) I think the problem that I and many people have with the gender pay gap issue are that it is very unclear where feminism wants to move the wage to and from, if you want to go through each individual circumstance and alter each gap accordingly, that's fine, if you want to take the biggest range, take it across every job and attempt to ""overthrow"" men, then I have a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

# Poor Media Representation

I don't think this is something that is exclusive to women, especially in the news. In fact, I think any repesentational divide in the media is less about gender/race and more about general political standing, specifically liberal vs conservative.

&amp;#x200B;

# Reproductive Rights Being Chipped Away

On this I completely agree, it's fucked up how this is even something that can be debated in politics. The only thing I will add (and this is to a post where someone was asking why a woman wasn't pregnant yet ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/ddwwvi/my_body_my_choice_always/))) is that the choice should probably be made with both partners in mind (excluding obvious circumstances where this is stupid). For example, if a couple are in a loving relationship and the woman gets pregnant, at least get the father's opinion on what they should do.

&amp;#x200B;

# Impossible Beauty Standards

I don't see how you can say that beauty standards are impossible for women without saying the same thing for men. When you're looking up at celebrities, of course its going to be impossible. And the large majority of men realise that, or at least I hope they do. As for men's beauty standards, yes they are fucking hard to get, because looking at the celebrities at the top, I would never be ready to compare myself to any of them. I don't have the designer clothes, the designer shoes, the time to allocate to getting ready every morning, the time to allocate to fitness, or the money to get any of the accessories such as watches, cars, houses, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

# End

Finally, **my** problem with feminism; I'm not against ""equality for women"". My existence doesn't make the Pay Gap come in to fruition,  I'm not a member of congress/parliament, I'm not a man who bragged about sexual assault or has even fucking done it. I have never been responsible or supportive of governments taking away women's reproductive rights, nor have I ever imposed any impossible beauty standards or tried to misrepresent women in media. And without trying to be too self-absorbant, I feel like I've overall been quite a neutral person.

But whenever I hear interviews with feminists or have seen feminist demonstrations or even anti-feminist demonstrations where feminists have just attended I've felt grouped in with these horrible misogynistic, abusive and straight up horrible fucking people which I'm just not. I'm not a feminist, I'm an equalist.

My boyfriend doesn't really like shaving, but people are much kinder to him when is tidied up, and to be honest, I (and pretty much every woman) MASSIVELY prefer the way he looks unbearded (he grows a great beard, but he has a wonderful jawline).  

Same thing with the way he dresses.  He just wants to wear the same old, stretched out T shirts, and his paint stained New Balances.  However, he concedes this makes him much less attractive, and it really is night and day difference.  He gets better service when he is well dressed, he is taken more seriously at work, HUGE difference.  He doesn't feel victimized, or that he is being oppressed... he just acknowledges people of all genders are inherently kinder and think more of you when you are dressed and groomed a certain way, and the majority of people prefer a certain way, and so he does so to make things easier for himself.  

Long story short, I think this is beyond a feminist issue, and more of an inherent part of human biases in any culture.

No, we shouldn't defend or ""glamorize"" being unhealthy. But how do you feel about the glamorization of models who are 5' 7""+ and &lt;110 lbs? How do you feel about body builders who have 0% body fat? How do you feel about actors who rapidly drop 80 lbs for a role, only to gain 100 lbs a year later for another role? If you want to talk about glamorizing being unhealthy, I'd start there. The ""fat acceptance"" and body positivity movements are not about sexualizing, glorifying, or normalizing being overweight; they're about teaching people to love their bodies regardless of what's considered conventional attractive. There are very few fat people within the communities who would say, ""I love being fat, I just want to keep gaining"" or ""Everyone should gain weight/be fat"" because that's not what it's about.",UsagiHotline,2019-10-15 15:30:13,2019-10-15 15:30:14,/r/Feminism/comments/di5azx/stop_giving_problematic_men_a_pass_just_because/f3u5mhs/,t1_f3u2avj,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-15 15:30:14,0.00444,3e-05,0.00024,0.00243,0.00107,0.00011,0.00192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

672,1531,"So I studied psychology in uni and I do think this has some truth to it. When you only come out as an adult you get an opportunity to sort of reinvent your identity to include your sexuality, which is why sometimes when people first come out they want to consume all the LGBT media etc and might dress a bit more stereotypically queer (e.g. I dressed way more as what I thought was ""gayer"" when I realised I was bi, and then after coming to terms with it better toned it down into a more balanced look).

When you're kind of developing your personality/identity through adolescence it takes a lot of formation and some trial and error before you become the balanced, more fully formed person you are as an adult.   


So, when you come out this can often make you go through a very similar process again, so you have to go through the kind of trial and error stages of it, and this might make it seem like you're not as mature or you might start off with much simpler views on what it means to be gay etc and latching onto stereotypes (e.g. the catty gay man) the try and fit into this new identity as easily as possible. 

So I think there's some truth to this though of course there's many more variables and complications that I won't have covered, but from my own studies into some of this stuff and also from a lot of LGBT people I know I'd argue it's a fair theory.

Just because we’re gay doesn’t mean we magically let go of all the baggage. Conditioning doesn’t stop when we discovered we didn’t fit society’s default, it simply adapted to fit with our new identity.

Glad we agree.

I’m not sure of the numbers or statistics, but this seems likely to be correct.

&gt;none of this makes you a man or a woman.

Of course not.

&gt;only your reproductive system and chromosomes determine that - and it is important.

This is wrong. There are a myriad of chromosomal abnormalities. There are also a myriad of genetic abnormalities. Some women don’t have functioning reproductive organs. Some women have chromosomal anomalies. People can be intersex.

Sex is not, nor had it ever been, defined by chromosomes. Sex is a complex thing, comprised of chromosomes, primary sex characteristics, secondary sex characteristics, social function, societal acceptance, and more.

Whether you like it or not, our brains are not identical. Statistically, neuroscientists can tell—just from scans—whether a brain was a man’s or a woman’s about 80% of the time. So, obviously, there’s overlap.

Just because someone is over 6-feet tall doesn’t mean that someone is a man, but it’s significantly more likely. Just because someone’s brain “looks” like a woman’s brain doesn’t mean it is—but it is more likely.

These differences aren’t as readily prevalent in children. And we don’t know what causes these differences. It could be hormonal, it could be societal, it could be any number of things.

But, for fuck’s sake, even if there were no statistical differences between the brains of men and women, that’s no justification for the fucking hatred I see from TERFs. 

What’s important is recognizing that women and men are equal, even if there are differences. What’s important is making this known. Women are just as capable as men in all respects, and gender should never be a boundary.

But reducing women to the presence or absence of an X chromosome is horrific. It doesn’t make you a better feminist.

734,1619,"The privilege/oppression dynamic requires that one party harms the *other*. Although men have problems, as all demographics do, this is not oppression because women are not the ones perpetuating this.

For instance, the vast majority of murders are men as well (over [85%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/1635092/) ). This means that the issue is men killing other men, not women killing men. Therefore, it cannot be considered oppression because there is no greater privileged party causing this harm.

Or another example, men do make up the majority of suicide cases, but again, this is not an issue perpetuated by another, more privileged, group. The reason men die by suicide more often is likely because they make up the majority of gun owners. They are also more likely to try more violent methods- again, such as a self inflicted gunshot wound. Additionally, men are less likely to communicate their emotions compared to women. This lack of expression is based in the dynamic of men and their peers. Male suicides are not perpetuated by women. 

Similarly, military deaths are not the fault of women either; joining the military is voluntary. Women are not forcing men to join. The reason so many military fatality victims are male is also largely due to the disparity between male vs female soldiers. Men are the ones who originally chose to forbid female soldiers, which still contributes to the gender difference today.

&gt; 
&gt; One thing I can't stop thinking about lately is 
&gt; 
&gt; how heterosexual marriage benefits men 
&gt; 
&gt; and tends to harm women but it's culturally 
&gt; 
&gt; framed as something women want and men
&gt; 
&gt; resist.

&gt; 
&gt; The statistic that sticks with me: per a 2009
&gt; 
&gt; study in the journal Cancer, 21% of women
&gt; 
&gt; got abandoned by their husbands while
&gt; 
&gt;  sick. Just 3% of men. Control group was
&gt; 
&gt;  12% divorce rate. Cancer made husbands 
&gt; 
&gt; more likely to GTFO, women more likely to
&gt; 
&gt; stay.

when i say i am against sexual 

exploitation, trafficking and trade of

""so you're against sex?""



it clearly tells me how you view sex 

as exploitation, humiliation, and 

coercion. much more about you than

me.

787,1703,"In contrast, ""less than a third of researchers are women in Hungary, Luxembourg, Finland and, perhaps most surprisingly, Germany, which is actually led by an accomplished female scientist, Chancellor Angela Merkel."". But Finland has a moderately successful ""women in Medicine "" story : 

In Finland, the representation of women in medicine has surpassed the rest of Scandinavia, as 56% of physicians are female and 66% of physicians under 35 were women in 2012. Most (64%) Finnish physicians are specialists, and of these, 52% were female. Interestingly, while fewer women than men under 35 are specialists, the proportion of male and female specialists tends to become more equal between the ages of 45 and 65. As in other countries, female physicians tend to be overrepresented in pediatrics and underrepresented in surgery. 



female physicians have advanced significantly in the realms of administration, teaching, and research and constitute approximately 40% of these fields. However, women have been underrepresented at higher administrative positions, as indicated in a 1996 study which showed that only 20% of chief physicians in hospitals were female.

If your assertion is that men will always underreport, even for a study, then there is no way to test that your assertion about the population exists.

Though Italians were viewed as white for purposes of naturalization and voting, their social standing was that they represented a ""problem at best."" Their racial status was impacted by their appearance and that they did not ""act"" white, engaging in manual labor ordinarily reserved for blacks. The trial of nineteen Italian immigrants for the murder of New Orleans police chief David Hennessy in 1890, which ended in the lynching of eleven of them by a white vigilante group, sparked debate in the press over Italians supposed racial characteristics. Italians continued to occupy a ""middle ground in the racial order"" through the 1920s.[81]:55–62

Could you be able to provide some evidence that each and every nordic prostitutes feel that way ? If punters are unhappy, then criminalisation of punters work, right? Why don't you want these men to be unafraid? Given the fact that society and state have long been marginalizing/dehumanizing prostitutes and supporting/promoting men's right to buy consent from disadvantaged women and girls? I mean are you one of those ancap? If not, why do you hold neoliberal/libertarian/conservative positions when it comes to women's issues? Which anarcha feminists were supportive of pimping/punting ? As an anarcha feminist, why do you want to sustain a societal structure that supports unnecessary commodification of women's (who are more likely to be trans, intersex, black, women of colour/Caste, dalit, Asian, poor,etc.) bodies and sex ? 

&gt;the government don’t actually know if the law has reduced human trafficking, because they didn’t bother to do the research. So I don’t see why anyone would model sex work legislation after this.

Among nordic countries, Finland and Denmark actually decriminalised men's right to buy consent. I don't know what kind of anarchists believe that consent obtained via money (a means of coercion) is actual consent.  Iceland, Sweden, and Norway (even though they are not perfect...not at all) are far more better when it comes to women and LGBTQIA+GSRM people's rights than any other nations and have consistently been shown to hold progressive attitudes toward sexual freedom. These three nordic countries criminalized punters/pimps. Also, no one is actually claiming that legalisation alone would magic away prostitution, rape trafficking...so, why are you claiming to prove and there's no proof that these three countries have more trafficked women and children than any other countries such as New Zealand -- where punters/pimps are completely decriminalised and they still managed to kill 16 women. Local governments of NZ also regulates prostitutes' bodies and tax independent prostitutes, criminalize and deport migrant sex workers on daily basis. It's quite clear from your comment that you are actually supportive of NZ model. So, tell me why do you think (unless  you are an ancap) (taxation+regulation) of prostitutes' bodies and sexual behaviour and and state sanctioned prostitution is compatible with anarchist theory ?

The fact is that a 'girlfriend-experience' high-class escort who owns her own business and charges rich guys thousands of dollars an hour to giggle at their jokes at a fancy restaurant and then have sex later, is not engaged in the same profession as a trafficked sex slave. You can think about similar differences in work conditions and autonomy in other industries.

And then you get anecdotal claims from sex workers, typically somewhere in the middle of that spectrum, who sincerely think of themselves as a kind of mix between therapists and masseuses, and believe that their work does provide a valuable service, report greater job satisfaction than when they worked in retail, and so on. I know several people who feel this way about the work they do.

It's a real problem because if you make claims about one of these forms, it's practically guaranteed to not truthfully apply to the other. Therefore both sides in the sex work debate within feminism accuse the other of being dishonest, with some validity.

David Graeber wrote that one of the major problems with high-paying sex work isn't so much that it's exploitative but that it says to young women that no matter what kind of accomplishments they pursue, the market will value sexual access to their bodies more highly. A high-paid sex worker can earn more than a surgeon.

1075,3209,"The problem is that your idea of why rape is bad is simply because of being unpleasantly penetrated. If that were the case then a parent trying to force-feed their child vegetables would be as bad as rape. Yes it's awful parenting and they shouldn't do that, but the actual physical act of penetration is far from the only factor in why rape is traumatizing.

I've never been a victim of rape personally, but my understanding is that it is far more damaging psychologically than it is physically. 

It's an act of violation onto a very private part of the body, either penis or vagina it doesn't matter. It is still an invasion of sorts on one's personal space and an act of being forced to do something incredibly intimate against one's will. Many victims of rape struggle with feelings of guilt, that they did something to deserve or instigate being raped or that they should have done more to try to prevent it, even though physiologically freezing up or giving in is a very normal and instinctual response. Nevertheless, victims of rape often feel as though it is, at least partly, their own fault. What genitals you have between your legs or what form the rape took does not change this. 

In addition, having someone perform some sexual act on someone against their will often leaves them with a psychological feeling of being unclean, like no matter how much one tries to bathe themselves that they have been tainted by the violation they experienced and that there is nothing they can do to get their purity back.

These are a couple examples of the kinds of emotional suffering rape victims endure.

“Sexual Orientation
Sex of Perpetrators among Female Victims
Most bisexual and heterosexual women in the United States who experienced rape reported having only male perpetrators — specifically, this includes 98.3% of bisexual women, and 99.1% of heterosexual women who reported being a victim of rape in their lifetime. “


For reference, the inverse would be 1.7% of bisexual women, .9% of straight women having had only male partners. The lesbian number was evidently too small to create a reliable estimate. This study however describes rape specifically as being penetrative sex, and in this case it would involve the use of other penetrative objects, in the case of a female on female rape. It indeed goes on


Similarly, 85.2% of lesbian women, 87.5%
of bisexual women, and 94.7% of heterosexual women who reported experiencing sexual violence
other than rape in their lifetime also reported having only male perpetrators (data not shown).

14.8% of lesbian women, 12.5% of bisexual women, and 5.3% of straight women experienced “sexual violence other than rape”

from table 1, the total sample size for each population was Thus: 
214,000 lesbian rape victims, 756,000 lesbian “other sexual violence” victims;
1,528,000 bisexual rape victims, 2,482,000 Bisexual OSV victims;
19,049,000 straight rape victims, 47,325,000 straight OSV victims
(I’m not sure whether these numbers are meant to be mutually exclusive in this table)

Rough math here, over 100,000 lesbian OSV victims, about 300,000 bisexual OSV victims, little over 2 million straight OSV victims.

On one hand, rape is an outcome pursuant to a power imbalance, and one in which the person of greater relative power is willing to take advantage of that power. The reason you see policemen raping women (and men) in police custody is because they have ultimate authority in those situations. The reason you see UN aid workers (men and women) raping women (and men) in those situations is because they have tangible resource control int hy situation. The reason you see more men raping women is an extremely complicated problem including facets of, and this isn’t a compete list, institutional power imbalance, social pressures, poorly regulated pornography, insufficient or nonexistent sexual education, and an institutional failure to adequately prosecute rape cases that are brought to court. And NONE OF THIS IS ADDRESSED IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY IN THIS POST.

Furthermore, by declaring it incontrovertibly as a male issue alone discounts the very real, very sad, and largely ignored, female on female and female on male rape statistics. 

Women are more than just victims to an unconquerable male overlord, rape is a social ill that is caused by a myriad of factors, and if you want to engage with real problems you have to engage with reality.",anothermook,2019-10-02 04:12:54,2019-10-02 04:12:56,/r/Feminism/comments/dc51gu/rape_is_a_male_issue/f2611pv/,t3_dc51gu,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-02 04:12:56,0.06076,0.00021,0.00129,0.01372,0.00463,0.00097,0.16963,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(Legend:

M&amp;F = Options between male or female lead

P = Alternation between male/female protagonist)

\- Mirror's Edge

\- Assassin's Creed: Syndicate (P) &amp; Liberation

\- Halo: Reach (M&amp;F) PS: I'd say most Halo games in general. While most have male leads, they have some pretty bad-ass females and none of them are sexualized, like Kat or Miranda)

\-  Prey 2017 (M&amp;F)

\- LEGO Worlds (Childish, sure, but hot damn is it nostalgic)

\-  Far Cry 5 &amp; New Dawn (M&amp;F)

\- Ashen (M&amp;F)

\- Absolvers (M&amp;F)

\- All Mass Effects (M&amp;F) (Word of warning; avoid Andromeda, it's a shit show story-wise)

\- Unturned (M&amp;F) (think Minecraft but with guns and in a zombie apocalypse; plus, it's multiplayer so you two can play together)

\- Tomb Raider series

\- Wolfenstein: Youngblood (Overall crappy game)

\- Destiny 1 &amp; 2 (M&amp;F) (I'd strongly advise against it, though, since it's basically a robbery with how much it all costs)

\- What Remains of Edith Finch (Holy shit, is this a heart-wrenching game; I would highly recommend buying for the story alone)

\- Women have the social power to incarcerate any regular Joe on the street via false allegations (even if they didn't personally know him)

\- Suicides for women are considerably lower than men, who make up 3/4s of all suicides

\- Workplace fatalities are also lower for women, over 95% of them being male

\- Women, by default, get court custody over their children, oftentimes flying in the face of evidence that the children should be with the father (and science has proven that, with children that are above four, it's better for them to be with their father if the court had to choose just one parent)

\- Women have rarely, if ever, been drafted both in history or present day

Should pedophile kink not be criticised? Should murder kink not be criticised? Should zoophilic kink not be criticised ( a lot of time it involves animal cruelty)? Should necrophiliac kinks not be criticised?

Also, are we just suppose to feed these kinks and act surprised if people decide to act on it? It just seems like such an unnecessary risk, and what for? So people can get off? Getting off isn't a human right, enough with that crap. It reeks of men's right activism.

Let's be honest here, a lot of these kinks are the manifestation of deeper mental health problems. I don't think people should be shame, I think they should be treated.

Feminism is a political ideology. So if they identify as a feminist, they need to support core principles of feminism and feminists of all branches, including liberal feminists are very critical of porn. There are two feminist positions regarding porn -- 1. Anti-Porn 2. Porn-critical.

We live in a world where rape victims are denied justice because they have had an orgasm during rape, where male perpetrators use BDSM and this very ""consensual"" rape fantasy as defense tactics.  Also, feel free to think about male and LGBTQIA+GSRM rape victims.  I think these victims matter more than faux feminist women who pretend to love rape fantasy. These women have other options to fulfill their needs.  Another solution is they themselves could produce amateur rape porn to satisfy their like minded peers and create a community of their own.

**Millions of Women Suffer From a Disease That Virtually Sucks the Life Out of Them -- But Doctors Sti[*ll Don't Take It Seriously*]**

According to a 2011 survey, **85 percent of health care providers** believed ME/CFS was fully or partly a psychiatric condition. But in that, too, ME/CFS patients aren't alone. Many women suffer from invisible chronic diseases — from fibromyalgia to vulvodynia to interstitial cystitis to migraine — that have historically been seen as psychosomatic and remain poorly understood. I've spent the last couple years writing a book about gender bias in medicine, and the story of ME/CFS is a textbook example of a catch-22 that's hindered scientific knowledge of a great many health conditions that disproportionately affect women: Women's unexplained illnesses tend to be assumed to be psychosomatic until proven otherwise. But the medical community puts little effort — and research dollars — toward understanding conditions it assumes to be psychosomatic.

1236,3424,"Table 1 from that journal article shows 18 articles from 1974 to 2006. It does not mention religion or politics, but I'm highly skeptical that all those surveys were all biased in the ways you suggested. And an additional bias you did not mention is that its hard to get people to confess to taboos, so the rates are overall likely under reported. But that's really besides the point. You have been presented with evidence that shows its possible feminist women also have rape fantasies, and rather than admit this is a hypothetical possibility (just as its hypothetically possible that all women who have rape fantasies are ""rape cheerleaders"") you insist on your a-priori conclusion. Which is ironic because this is a tactic thats been used throughout history to preserve the status quo against women and minorities of various kinds.

By the way, those authors are from the University of North Texas and have survey data of their own: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19085605](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19085605). Basically they asked355  undergraduate women in psychology classes about their sexual fantasies, and reported the results. 

&gt;""Participants were 355 women over the age of 18 from two universities in the Southwestern United States, who received research credit for their participation. Most (81%) were between the ages of 18 and 21 (*M* = 20.04, *SD* = 2.41). The racial and ethnic composition of the sample included 59% Caucasian–White; 16% African American–Black; 13% Hispanic–Latina; 6% biracial; 5% Asian, Asian American, or Pacific Islander; and 1% American Indian or Alaskan Natives. Most participants were single (90%), heterosexual (91%), and Christian (78%).""

""Results indicated that 62% of women have had a rape fantasy."" I took a look at table 1, and specifically: 33% of responders ever fantasied about being ""raped by a man"", and 9% ever fantasied about being ""raped by a woman"" No results are presented regarding political leaning or religion.

Absolutely, there are small study issues here, and we are blinded from important information.

Like how to assess of one of the kids in our school is actually planning to go on a shooting spree one day (what a time to be a teacher).  The instructor said that generally, the threat of violent video games as a precursor to violent actions in real life are only as such of the kid has a lack of human connection in their life.  If a person plays violent video games, but has a healthy connection with a parent and peers, the threat goes down immensely.

I think I would use the same logic in assessing  someone in terms of rape porn.  I am into BDSM and some of my exploration goes in the realm of rape play.

Problem is is that they are wholly difficult to diagnose and current research funding is so tight that people only tend to want to research things that are an absolute, i.e. cancer, heart disease, genetic disorders etc.

ME is probably the most profiled of these group of diseases but only a handful of studies have shown clear, diagnostically different patient phenotypes, so they're not in the widespread remit of your everyday GP. This also makes basic research complicated as there is no clear yes or no as to patient diagnosis and there is a lot of disparity in classifying diagnosis, so cohorts are far more mixed than is useful. 

It's a pretty dire situation, but there are some of us out there trying to improve things, we just need the funding to work on it.

It’s also how foot fettishes or MILF or any other fettish or kink sometimes forms. With lack of sexual exposure (healthy consensual adult sex) sometimes bad or odd things get imprinted in us when young. 
The imprinting age I think is something like age 4-7

&gt; Traditional factors that once explained men’s sexual difficulties appear insufficient to account for the sharp rise in erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, decreased sexual satisfaction, and diminished libido during partnered sex in men under 40. This review (1) considers data from multiple domains, e.g., clinical, biological (addiction/urology), psychological (sexual conditioning), sociological; and (2) presents a series of clinical reports, all with the aim of proposing a possible direction for future research of this phenomenon. Alterations to the brain's motivational system are explored as a possible etiology underlying pornography-related sexual dysfunctions. This review also considers evidence that Internet pornography’s unique properties (limitless novelty, potential for easy escalation to more extreme material, video format, etc.) may be potent enough to condition sexual arousal to aspects of Internet pornography use that do not readily transition to real-life partners, such that sex with desired partners may not register as meeting expectations and arousal declines. Clinical reports suggest that terminating Internet pornography use is sometimes sufficient to reverse negative effects, underscoring the need for extensive investigation using methodologies that have subjects remove the variable of Internet pornography use. In the interim, a simple diagnostic protocol for assessing patients with porn-induced sexual dysfunction is put forth.

This following article only shows a correlation between porn consumption and verbal and physical aggression but does not say whether it is causation

A neuroscientist who wrote The Brain That Changes Itself said

&gt; “Sexual tastes are molded by an individual’s experiences and their culture. These tastes are acquired and then wired into the brain. We are unable to distinguish our ‘second nature’ from our ‘original nature’ because our neuroplastic brains, once rewired, develop a new nature every bit as biological as our original.”

Which is pretty biologically and psychologically sound IMO. 

I think there's such thing as ethical porn, I just think there's a huge problem in the mainstream porn industry with treating women horribly, normalizing sexual violence to a wider audience than would otherwise show interest in it, and causing a sizable portion of the population to require more and more extreme sex acts over time to get off.",homo_redditorensis,2019-10-05 05:30:01,2019-10-05 06:04:20,/r/Feminism/comments/ddeerw/rape_porn/f2i7u2g/,t1_f2hdlwv,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-05 06:04:20,0.02293,0.00018,0.00145,0.00325,0.0012,0.00025,0.14347,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1261,3461,"Um no. Not really. There’s some reeeeeaaaaally fucking violent games out there. Many of them are hyper realistic. Here’s a few scenes that stand out to me from my video games: 
GTA: Basically everything. Degradation of women, so much gore, death. One scene has a woman get sucked an eviscerated in a plane engine. 
Red Dead Redeption 2: you have so much control over people’s lives and your own choices. There executions, rapes, murders, robbery, etc. One scene I particularly remember was a character cold heartedly shooting an old woman in the chest. 

More on read dead, RDR2 is so realistic looking that users started posting content on r/earthporn. Some of those posts got over 10k upvotes before being discovered to be fake. 

Skyrim: Literally lets you kill whoever you want whenever you want. You can burn people alive, execute them, there’s even rape mods and dismemberment mods for the game. (I only downloaded the dismemberment mod lmfao)

Fallout: (Arguably the most desolate and depressing of all of the games above) everyone you meet is a cold hearted cutthroat murderer. You can literally turn people into mush 

Ryse Son of Rome: It’s literally only violence 

Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising - Arguably the best example against your claim, has users have no health bar, no HUD. If you get shot in the leg, you have to bandage it and can go into septic shock. Everything is hyper realistic. Reloading times, ammo, grenade throwing, bullet velocity. It’s literally almost a perfect war simulator.

So there’s just a few explained for you. 

Let me explain why I think video games actually **help** kids and adults be less violent. Ever watch a kid (usually male) play violent video games? So much pent up anger and frustration gets released during the process. 

Why is it that men are so drawn to violent video games? Because (I’m a male) it’s extremely cathartic in specifically American culture. Our culture has all of these rules about gender (which as a feminist ally I am working against along side you) that we are expected to follow. 

Men have to be emotionally underdeveloped, stoic, quiet, unresponsive in the face of adversity. Women are expected to be dainty, gentle, soft spoken, and emotionally cathartic in the face of adversity. 

There’s a reason 242/245 mass shooters are male. (There’s an article on the NYT about the issue) There’s a reason that statistic is unique only to highly fundamentalist traditional countries (like many parts of the US). It’s because the current gender roles for males and females has a massive imbalance on how much we are allowed to be cathartic. 

This impacts *everyone* because angry, pent up, emotionally underdeveloped men are the ones who become abusers and become awful human beings. But there is one way the US allows men to have catharsis. Video Games. 

All of that rage and frustration I mentioned earlier, is not always caused by the game. After all, I used to be a huge gamer myself. That emotional pressure cooker was caused by all the shit every human has to go through that men are expected to ignore. It’s a release. 

I would argue that without video games men were more violent. Fights happened at school more before video games. Nerd culture was seen as a reason to be bullied instead of praised.

1340,3613,"Transgender people who have gender-affirming surgery are less likely to need mental health treatment, according to scientists who say such interventions must be as easy as possible to access.

Gender-affirming treatments can help a person align their body with their gender identity. An individual might choose to take masculinizing or feminizing hormones, for instance, or have operations which surgically change their face, voice, or body.

For their study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, researchers looked at data collected between 2005 and 2015 from a Swedish population register linked to a national healthcare database, and assessed the available information on the 2,679 individuals diagnosed with gender incongruence.


The health condition is characterized by feelings of distress because the gender a person was assigned at birth according to their sex does not match their internal feelings—for example, a person with a penis being described as a man despite identifying as a woman. Transgender people may experience gender incongruence, although not every trans person feels this way.


The research team recorded whether the individuals they assessed had gender-affirming hormone or surgical procedures, and whether they received mental health treatment. This included visiting the doctor for a mood or anxiety disorder, being prescribed antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs, and/or being hospitalized following a suicide attempt.

Of the individuals with diagnosed gender incongruence, 70 percent took hormones. Some 48 percent had gender-affirming surgery, with 97 percent also having hormone treatment. Just under a third had neither treatment.


On average, when compared with individuals who don't have gender incongruence, those who did were six times more likely to be hospitalized after trying to end their life, and six times more likely to visit the doctor because of a mood or anxiety disorder. They were also three times more likely to be prescribed antidepressants and anxiolytics.",Yeahmaybeitsdetritus,2019-10-07 22:58:09,2019-10-07 23:22:25,/r/Feminism/comments/der9xr/new_study_find_that_among_trans_people_with/f2ycewf/,t3_der9xr,Feminism,2,0,2019-10-07 23:22:25,0.01236,0.00039,0.00074,0.0066,0.00306,0.00121,0.00525,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1382,3676,"I mean - ignoring the fact that mainstream culture for both men and women exists for the sake of calling men shitty and bigoted is kind of ridiculous.

There’s a huge culture of women who love the bachelor/ette, expensive fashion, expensive makeup, celebrities, drinking at parties and mainstream music. These are their top priorities - more than academics, or any subset of skills outside of cosmetics. This isn’t me being sexist - this is me  being a young man living in an extremely wealthy and vain area. If you think I’m generalizing - please come visit coastal Southern California and bear witness to what I’m referring to.

Finding people outside that very large mainstream culture can be difficult - and ideally I wouldn’t want to date someone who constructs their value system around those things - I already did and it was awful.

Using a cliched phrase like “you’re not like other girls” might be a little overdone - but if it simply means “you’re not like most people” or “you share my niche interests that aren’t mainstream and therefore aren’t like most of the women I meet”.

All of these same tropes exist for men - just in a different form. Guys can be really superficial, into cars, fighting, drinking, vaping, and competing with their peers to an unhealthy degree. If a woman found a guy that doesn’t do those things and she is happy about that and says to him “you’re not like other guys” I doubt there would be half the negativity over that statement.

Sorry to play devils advocate - I just feel like men being demonized in feminist cultures can be a little over the top at times. I understand that women have been and continue to be oppressed for millennia - but there are more important things to worry about than the phrase “you’re not like other people” as inherently, it’s fairly meaningless without the context of who “other people” are.",Austinjuststfu,2019-10-07 15:13:03,2019-10-07 15:13:21,/r/Feminism/comments/d1evy7/this_aint_it_chief/f2w4gb9/,t1_ezpt3cd,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-07 15:13:21,0.21657,0.00048,0.06137,0.0159,0.11946,0.0004,0.00524,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Don't get me wrong, like I said, there's solid research done that shows even when both partners work full time women do more domestic work, but this particular statistic is just sensationalising the problem, isn't it?",hepheuua,2019-10-08 22:32:50,2019-10-08 22:32:50,/r/Feminism/comments/df4ddy/domestic_labour_is_predominately_performed_by/f31exc5/,t3_df4ddy,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-08 22:32:50,0.00224,2e-05,0.00015,0.00165,0.00067,0.0001,0.00043,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some say safety, some for form. But all backflips are banned, not just the one footed variety that Bonaly did.

And people have been doing backflips on ice long before Bonaly was born, including in the Olympics (though she did the only one-footed in the Olympics.) Others have done one-footed backflips in other competitions and lost points for them too.

Bonaly undoubtedly had to deal with sexism and racism as a figure skating athlete, but I'm finding it hard to believe the whole backflip episode wan an example of that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm no figure skating expert, so I have no idea if it really is so dangerous that it should be banned. But one woman doing it successfully doesn't prove it's safe.

Bonaly is currently 41 and continues to do the move. Any move can be dangerous if attempted by someone inexperienced, but this move is demonstrably not inherently dangerous.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A 1260 in skateboarding may not be banned, but there are plenty of rules and banned moves in sports based on safety.

Yes, this is demonstrably not one of those rules.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The idea that the Olympics should allow everything because the athletes understand the risks is crazy. Many of these athletes are minors and have been training since they were small children.

I did not make this argument. This is a straw man.

&gt;sport in general carries inherent danger. It's your job as an athlete to understand and mitigate those risks. For example a 1260 in skateboarding carries a lot of risk, but it isn't banned.

A 1260 in skateboarding may not be banned, but there are plenty of rules and banned moves in sports based on safety. 

The idea that the Olympics should allow everything because the athletes understand the risks is crazy. Many of these athletes are minors and have been training since they were small children.

1504,3844,"Right so college. Let’s start there.
Going to college and learning /doing well / getting a livable wage job after college are different things, correct?


SO when a woman is raised by her mother to do female things like cooking, cleaning, servitude, being desirable, but not the values men are taught in order to do well and be independent, where do you think those skills come from? Everything one needs to do well in the world is a skill. Not being in crippling debt, study skills, paying attention in class, processing information, networking, routines for success including getting homework done and getting to class on time and not missing too many days, work ethic. All things that are not valued in women and thus aren’t socialized for. So imagine starting from the bottom and not having any of those things and being tossed in the same room with a bunch of men who more than likely were taught these things automatically just because they were born with a penis. This is only one reason we aren’t given a fair chance. We’re not taught to be leaders in the work place or in life. We’re taught to be polite and never make others uncomfortable. How do you think negotiating works when it’s ingrained in you to serve rather than take? On top of that, the hundreds of years of the workforce being a men’s club. The whole concept of locker room talk. Not everyone is going to want a giRL around to stuff up the party. Then there is the fact that women are the ones to carry a child, and take maternity leave, as well as leave work to pick up sick children or stay home with them. This further mucks up our ability to climb ladders even though it’s illegal to discriminate. We still lose clients, control of big projects, could have hours given away so that we have to quit to find another job, have bonuses withheld until we’re out of the office on leave (as per some policies of being on site when bonuses are handed out). Add to the fact that we are usually the lesser paid one in a relationship, is if one of two parents is going to stay home with the baby for a year or more, it’s going to generally be the one being paid less. Then we have an employment gap on our resume which means good luck getting an interview at a decent work place.

1546,3913,"Before I get into this, I want to say that it is not very likely he will reconsider his stance. I am just trying to cover all bases.

I think what it's going to come down to is how open minded he is. Information thus far suggests he will most likely not be receptive to reconsidering his own views. I try to give everyone a chance to listen and give those ideas that challenge their own a fair shot. Most people don't want to hear it. But it's possible he has just never really had a lot of exposure to a feminist perspective. I would give him **one** chance to listen. Sit him down and have a very serious discussion about it. If you are confident in your knowledge of feminism, talk to him and let him discuss why he thinks women have the upper hand, then explain why these are misconceptions that stem from anti-feminist rhetoric. Be respectful, be calm, really listen to what he is saying. Most people are not very receptive if they feel they are under attack. (He might interpret it that way anyway.)

I would say there is a good 97% chance he will just dismiss what you have to say in favor of what he already believes. That's usually what happens. But you don't know until you try. I have met a couple people in my life with shitty views that just needed a discussion to at least reconsider. Don't hold your breath, but if you really want to see if he is worth your time, I think it's necessary to make an attempt.

Not to mention... if he is not even willing to listen and consider what you have to say, you don't want to be with him anyway, because he is demonstrating in doing so that he 1. does not respect you and 2. he is not likely to become any more feminist leaning, which personally, I consider to be a deal-breaker.   If you establish that he isn't willing to listen to and consider your perspective, it's best for both of you. Neither of you are going to change stance, so at that point, just nip it in the bud and call it quits.",Ghiraheem,2019-10-12 17:24:09,2019-10-12 17:27:35,/r/Feminism/comments/dgscnz/on_a_date_with_a_possibly_misogynist_guy/f3fqiby/,t3_dgscnz,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-12 17:27:35,0.03204,8e-05,0.01207,0.00195,0.00536,0.00022,0.00236,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1. Gender Dysphoria
2. How sexual abuse and rape can cause forms of mental illness.
3. Taking advantage of the mentally ill to get away with sexual abuse.

And the feminist views.

1. Feminists generally endorse the treatment for Gender Dypshoria widely accepted, practiced, and proven effective by medical institutions and professionals. Namely, transitioning to a more comfortable gender identity. That is to say, they support trans rights.
2. Feminists are generally in favor of reducing the stigma associated with talking about and seeking help for these things.

Whether it's small decisions like extending a friendly smile or demeanor to someone in line at the grocery store who looks anxious or troubled, or larger actions like deciding to protest/agitate/organize for system changes, and everything in between, each one has significance in the larger scheme of things and each time we decide to act from a place of empathy, each time we remember what others have been through and use that understanding to treat those around us with respect and care, we weaken those impulses in humanity that seek to brutalize and demean others, that seek to violate and to hurt.   


We can use our experiences with the worst impulses of humanity, of which reading the words of those who are bravely sharing the details of their trauma is part, to underscore the best things about humanity, the things that have elevated us and allowed us to thrive as a species at large, things like cooperation, networks of care, respect and kind regard for others. By doing this we honor the victims, we use what they have shared to inform our actions so that society is less likely to visit these harms upon others in the future, and that, I think, is the best thing that can result from such horror: a transformation of it into its opposite, for the betterment of each of us in turn and all of us in kind.

College relationships often aren't that serious anyways, but the guy could also be a bad boyfriend or the relationship could just not be a good fit.

Making it so that people aren't kicked out of their home, or charged with a crime for paying for goods because they are a sex worker.

The neuroscience of sex differences is the study of characteristics that separate the male and female brain.  Psychological sex differences are thought by some to reflect the interaction of genes, hormones and social learning on brain development throughout the lifespan.



Some evidence from brain morphology and function studies indicates that male and female brains cannot always be assumed to be identical from either a structural or functional perspective, and some brain structures are sexually dimorphic.

But, this ""brain sex"" argument is very harmful to woman kinds, especially women who happen to be intersex and trans or both or women who are suffering from autism and other disorders, and disabilities, and women who want to pursue careers in STEM, Politics, etc. Some American doctors use that ""brain sex"" ideology to promote unnecessary IGM (trans women could also be intersex).

So there aren't like, clear bright lines in terms of brain sex, but there are recognisable patterns of variation that do tend to differ between men and women. 

What those patterns mean, whether they originate from genetics or socialisation - and whether they have any significant influence on how people think or act - is less clear. There's zero evidence to suggest that men and women's brains differ in ways that are actually influential on beliefs or behaviour, for instance. 

The brain differences MRI scans are detecting could be involved with the brain's governance of autonomic bodily functions (for example), given certain autonomic functions vary between the sexes, rather than being involved with higher-level thought. They could also be broadly incidental to cognition. We have no real way of telling at the present time.  

And of course, the differences we *can* detect are very possibly the result of people being raised in a society that teaches men and women to behave in different ways. Other differences are (as you say) likely caused by hormonal balance, which isn't really an innate trait, but an environmental one. Most importantly, the limited evidence we have suggests that these differences are trends, not absolutes - because there are definitely cases in the research material where the study's imaging algorithm guesses man for a woman, or woman for a man, and gets it wrong. 

In short: it's a big, complicated subject, and we have no evidence to suggest that men and women experience meaningful differences in cognition, but we *can* say that there are some trends (with exceptions!) of physical difference in the brains of men and women, which may be more or less significant, but which are certainly present.

If being trans has a biological basis, there's literally no other place for that biological antecedent to manifest other than the brain. It makes no sense that your gender identity manifests in your toe. Dysphoria isn't a sensation in your arm, it's a feeling in your brain.

Far from settled what structures in the brain cause gender identity but they are likely present in all people including cis people, since if you medically and or socially transition a cis person against their will, they have essentially identical experiences to dysphoria.

Does having a structure or structures in your brain that determine gender identity mean there is male and female brains? Well, yes and no. Brains are so unique to the individual, plastic over a lifetime, and current science can identify trends in brains that are more common in men and more common in women, but there's certainly no features that all female brains have and all male brains have. In that sense there isn't such a thing as a female brain, to the same extent that there isn't such a thing as a female height - any human can be any height essentially.

In the sense that if you are a woman you have a female brain, yes of course there a female brains.

Really what TERFs want to do is conflate the entirely reasonable, science based argument that there is a neurological basis for gender identity with the batshit insane misogynist phrenology stuff. So that way they can argue that any trans person claiming they have an innate gender independent over their superficial physical development is somehow now saying women are all... bad at math or some dumb shit.

1934,4463,"Hey OP!

I agree with you, this isn't fair, none of this is ever fair. It sucks that you have to deal with this, especially at a young age. I used to deal with similar situations, and I think the important thing to note is that you have a choice to think about, and a choice to make.

A lot of people will tell you that you should hide your body, and it's perfectly valid advice! That's the option I personally opted for. But that was MY choice. You can continue as you are, develop your confidence, wear what you want! It's great when people are able to be comfortable in their own skin and ignore what other people say! People are going to do what they always do and it's important to know that you won't change that in a day or two, but what you can change is your attitude towards it. You can ignore it, build more confidence, be who you want to be!

But I'm personally not like that, and can never be like that. When I gave in and started to cover up as a response, it felt like giving up, but it's not. It's another choice that you're deciding to make, not for them, but for your own piece of mind. This isn't some 'modesty is better for society' bullshit, this is just me saying that I personally don't like cat calls, and me changing the way I dress doesn't make me 'weaker' as a result.

That article literally backs what I'm saying. It highlights the importance of trying to further our understanding, whilst not gatekeeping identities.  It also highlights that trans brains are different to cis brains in some areas, and in some of those areas that are different, they align with gender rather than birth sex, In others they are uniquely trans and don't align with cis people of either sex, and for other attributes, they align with birth sex.  And this is all at a population level, with a bunch of individual traits, all with overlapping distributions.  Some of those traits vary by sex, some by gender, and some by trans identity.  And none of them give us predictive capabilities at an individual level.  None of it means we have an explanation of gender identity, or any indication that there is a single simple explanation for gender identity.  These are facts, and if facts are a problem for your ideology, well, your ideology is eventually going to hit a barrier it can't cross without changing.

And challenge libertarians.  From what I can see, they think that, just because they don't actively work to harm women and minorities, that that's all that should be expected of them.

2012,4572,"Because the lightest arm has empowered on it and the darker the arms get, the more it's semantically about being empowered by the already empowered light arm?

I don't think such a message is intended. Note how there's not one arm helping another, hand in hand. If part of the message was that the lighter arm is meant to help the darker one that would probably also be reflected in their pose. However, the poses are identical, indicating equality, all balled into a fist, indicating power.

I agree, however, you could argue the lighter on top, darker at the bottom ordering could (inadvertently?) reflect social strata as tied to race. Random colour ordering would eliminate this but I think the artist ordered them to allude to a ""spectrum"", meaning not just the exact colours shown, but the entire spectrum they represent, i.e. all skin colours. 

Maybe just inverting it would work better for you? But then, if we insist the colour order is tied to the semantics of the text, the message would be women of colour need to somehow empower white women, which doesn't make sense either.

I think it may be best not to over-interpret this. I think the colours represent the spectrum of all skin colours, so the message in that, to me, is merely that the text applies to *all* women.

The text itself has a dual meaning:

1. Empowered women empower women. Meaning, women who are empowered, can and should pay it forward and empower other women.

2. Empowered women empower women. Meaning, with every woman who is empowered, women as a whole become more empowered.

These two meanings, of course, affect and support each other.

For instance, many people hold the position that women are inherently nurturing and less competitive than men. Some MRA troll argues that women should be restricted to the home to allow only men to hold jobs, because only men possess the natural competitiveness to succeed at work.

i know the argument is the same: these abortions are absolutely necessary to the women who need them, and no woman who doesn’t need one would have one. i just think the ones who made a choice for different reasons deserve representation too, and shouldn’t be hidden away in a closet as if pro-choice advocates are ashamed of that contingent.",danielle269,2019-10-23 03:14:16,2019-10-23 04:35:50,/r/Feminism/comments/dll0br/pete_buttigieg_educates_chris_wallace_on_the/f4u6jk5/,t3_dll0br,Feminism,12,0,2019-10-23 04:35:50,0.00336,1e-05,0.0001,0.00149,0.00085,8e-05,0.00045,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I honestly think that might actually be one of the only situations it could plausibly be justified to have an all male panel.  I mean, I'd still think it was stupid not to have at least one woman on there, it is definitely running quite close to mansplaining, but if they were doing it consciously as a strategy to bring more men into the discussion then that's a bit of a different issue to them just not thinking about gender equality at all. 

There is an obvious problem with this - a lot of men still see gender equality as ""anti-man"" when the message that really needs to be stated is that gender equality is good for everyone. The example I always use in these arguments is to ask somebody who opposes gender equality whether they'd be happy with a substandard surgeon operating on them or a substandard pilot flying their plane, because that's exactly what you get if you live in an unequal society (the best people not rising to the top, everything being worse as a result).",zolidparks,2019-10-24 06:03:21,2019-10-24 06:03:22,/r/Feminism/comments/dm4j32/something_about_this_panel_doesnt_seem_right/f4z6m4b/,t3_dm4j32,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-24 06:03:22,0.03836,3e-05,0.00053,0.00362,0.03734,9e-05,0.00051,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2223,4886,"The kind of fantasy world decides what level of persecution is normal/realistic.

If it's a world like ATLA, the only persecution we'll realistically see is Bender -&gt; Nonbender, not Male -&gt; Female. It really struck me as unrealistic when several of the ATLA societies were sexist simply because men and women benders are on equal physical footing (physical strength doesn't matter when you can summon elements and fight with water, fire and air). They are a society at war, they should be happy to take whatever competent help they can get, male or female. Forbidding women from fighting like they do in the Southern Water Tribe is just crippling their own army for no reason.

Also, in a bender/bender couple, there should be no reason why the male is the head of household. In the past, men were heads of the household because they could use physical force to enforce their decisions. Of course, they use justifications like religion and ""logic"" but it really boils down to the fact that the strong write the history and religious books and the weak are taught to accept it. Men who were in charge shaped the law and cultures to benefit themselves (hence the old expectation where wives are expected to be faithful while tolerating their husband's mistresses). However, the ATLA world is different. In a family with two benders, who the head of household is will come down to who's the better bender, not who is male.

In the non-bender families, it would make sense for men to still be the head of household since physical strength matters without bending, but since the high nobility and royalty will all be benders (see what I wrote above about Bender -&gt; Nonbender oppression), nonbender culture won't matter on the big scale. In other words, it would make sense to have much more women at the highest echelons of power than ATLA currently does.

I'm not saying ATLA is antifeminist or anything, I think it is very feminist actually (there was a part where Katara says she's confused, Aang kisses her anyways and instead of giving in Katara pushes him away and said ""I just said I was confused"") but that part is just unrealistic from a magicbuilding perspective.

On the other hand, in a low-magic world like Game of Thrones, it makes sense to be patriarchal since the leadership is very much a ""macho culture"" led by those (often men) who can fight well. But in GoT characters don't ""cast fireball"".

2326,6934,"As of 1998, an estimated 17.7 million American women had been victims of attempted or completed rape.5 
Young women are especially at risk.

Female college-aged students (18-24) are 20% less likely than non-students of the same age to be a victim of rape or sexual assault.1

82% of all juvenile victims are female. 90% of adult rape victims are female.6

Women, on average, earn less than men in nearly every single occupation for which there is sufficient earnings data for both men and women to calculate an earnings ratio. In middle-skill occupations, workers in jobs mainly done by women earn only 66 percent of workers in jobs mainly done by men. IWPR’s report on sex and race discrimination in the workplace shows that outright discrimination in pay, hiring, or promotions continues to be a significant feature of working life.

If change continues at the same slow pace as it has done for the past fifty years, it will take 40 years—or until 2059—for women to finally reach pay parity. For women of color, the rate of change is even slower.

The US Department of State estimates that anywhere from 14,500 to 17,500 people are trafficked in the United States annually.

 It is not uncommon to encounter sex trafficking victims in their early 30s who have become psychologically and emotionally disabled from working in prostitution.6 In one study, providers reported that sex-trafficked women were less stable, more isolated, had higher levels of fear, more severe trauma, and greater mental health needs than other victims of crime.2

As of 1990, two thirds of married
women were employed in the American labor force (Schor, 1991), yet time-use study data indicate that women continue to be responsible for 70% of unpaid work in the home (Hartmann, 1987).

 

n 2005, 1,181 women were murdered by an intimate partner.1 That’s an average of three women every day. Of all the women murdered in the U.S., about one-third were killed by an intimate partner.2

232,960 women in the U.S. were raped or sexually assaulted in 2006. That’s more than 600 women every day.

Young women, low-income women and some minorities are disproportionately victims of domestic violence and rape. Women ages 20-24 are at greatest risk of nonfatal domestic violence

The wage gap does not take into consideration that women typically choose majors in college with less income than the majors that men choose.

Companies nowadays are trying not to be offensive and try to hire less qualified women instead of more qualified men for a job because they'd rather not be discriminated.

Women can falsely accuse men of raping/sexually harassing them and 9/10 times get off scot-free while the man's life has been ruined. This is getting better, somewhat, so at least there's progress there.

Male emotion is ignored and discouraged in society based on the ""don't be a wimp"" perspective.

It’s much easier to provoke outrage or disgust from people by using incorrect terms, slandering a cause, and employing emotion than to talk about what things actually ARE and are trying to accomplish. Look at poor Greta (the climate activist) getting shredded in the media for everything EXCEPT her message. Her age, clothing, hairstyle, skipping school, parents, culture, blah blah. But no one is talking about CLIMATE.

I think the definition of feminism is the same way.

Montazeri said FIFA had “no legal authority” to tell Tehran how to manage its sports arenas, including allowing women to enter grounds and watch men’s teams play.*    
&gt;  
&gt; *During a press conference on Sept. 22, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said Iran had “assured” FIFA that it would allow women to enter football stadiums “as of the next international game.”  The FIFA president’s comments came after criticism targeting Tehran following the death of a female football fan who killed herself after she was denied access to watch a men’s football game.  Since 1979, the ultra-conservative Iranian regime has prevented females from attending male football matches.  In October 2018, Tehran said it would reimpose the ban on women attending live football matches prompting FIFA to call on Iran to end the practice or face strict, and more explicit sanctions.*",rieslingatkos,2019-09-29 23:07:36,2019-09-30 02:01:56,/r/Feminism/comments/db2qi5/public_prosecutor_in_iran_slams_fifa_demand_on/f1xhlua/,t3_db2qi5,Feminism,1,0,2019-09-30 02:01:56,0.00188,2e-05,0.00014,0.00128,0.0006,8e-05,0.00033,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2461,7169,"Yeah I remember it being very uncomfortable to have to dance with bullies and people who in general made me uncomfortable. Of course since almost everyone was uncomfortable with the situation in general, we stood as far apart from our partner as possible. When we had these dance lessons there was a system where we rotated partners, so you couldn't choose who you danced with. Which is good in the sense that it prevents people from being left out, but bad because it forces people to dance with people they dislike and have been bullied by.

Also, one thing that made the whole thing much worse for many girls was that the boy's gym teacher was super creepy. He was a a bodybuilder, very big, and very boisterous. And he had a tendency to touch girls a bit too much. I remember once, he came over to show me and my partner how to do something, and said he'd dance with me to show how. He pulled me right up to his chest and basically put his whole arm around me. I felt so trapped and uncomfortable, but he sort of treated it as a joke. And of course, my then current dance partner was the boy who had a crush on me, so he then also started pulling me very close.

I'm okay with dancing now. I'll dance with friends and with my boyfriend, and by myself.

In high school I was usually good at avoiding bullies and was generally well liked, but this girl managed to single me out by targeting me when my friends were not around. Being touched by someone like that while dancing just made me feel completely powerless. I remember getting feelings of dread whenever it was P.E. day.

I wasn't expecting so many people to have had the same experience as me and if these schools are still doing this forced dancing together thing then something should really be done about that. I've looked up the school syllabus in my state and it looks like this is still going on. 

I have nothing against ""dance"" itself, despite these not so great early memories, I actually love to dance but in school no-body should be forced to partner up, you should be able to say no.

Interviews like these (a minor alone in a room with an adult man in a position of authority) are common in the church, and a lot of them are used to determine the “worthiness” of the minor.

2487,7198,"I think it’s important to note where this comes from. This is stuff the Mormon church exclusively teaches teenage girls. I was taught this before I left the church. Once, I declined one of my guy friend’s invites to homecoming. We were still on good terms - I just wanted to go stag with one of my girl friends. My mormon parents were a little pissed, but understood that I wasn’t being mean. My church leaders and Mormon peers on the other hand.... they told me I was being bratty and selfish for turning him down and that I should apologize to him. Even though he wasn’t mad at me for saying no to him. Him and I are still pretty good friends now. Those girls that told me I was a jerk...not so much. 

Every year, the teenage girls in each “ward” (a region of mormon church members) goes camping with their church leaders. It’s the biggest event for the teenage girls every year. They normally have a theme, and at the last camp I went to, my leaders wanted to focus on modesty. They specifically targeted some of the girls who weren’t as conservative in their dress (like, they wore tank tops in the summer. The horror! How immodest!) Being one of the oldest girls in the group (17 at the time), I felt comfortable raising some concerns about this to the leaders. I told them I felt how they were targeting certain girls was unfair, and I was uncomfortable with how they taught modesty was to “keep the boys from having bad thoughts,” especially when there would be no boys our age at the camp. To which my leaders told me that there would be priesthood leaders there. As in, adult men. And we had to be modest around them to keep their thoughts clean. TEENAGE GIRLS. Most of the girls were 12! And they were being told they couldn’t wear tank tops because the adult men would have unclean thoughts about them and it would be the girl’s fault!

2492,7210,"The justification by the Canadians was that natives were often drunkards, prostitutes and criminals and their sterilization would a stop them from bearing progeny that would bear the same traits (the trait being poor in a capitalist world). In other words, Eugenics. 

Many native children were also kidnapped from their families to be raised in christian schools too to ""fix them"" with western culture and education and that went on until very recently.

To the women who were sterilized, they were often lied to and told they needed a hysterectomy. It depends on the case. In many countries, plea bargains would involve vasectomy/hysterectomy to people of color.

This didn't happen only in Canada, but in many countries including Puerto Rico. And let's not forget the Tuskegee experiments (US government infecting black people against their knowledge with Syphilis masked as a vaccine) was going as late as the 1970s.

I'm not a Marxist-Leninist at all but i heard a episode by the Proles of the Round Table (a leninist history podcast) which is very good on the subject of the history of eugenics, forced sterelization and reproductive rights in the west and the Americas. The connection between homophobia/transphobia and racism towards colonized peoples is very enlightening. Early anthropologists would see the different definitions of sexuality and gender in pre-industrial societies in the third world like Africa and the Americas and claim that was a sign of how they were godless barbarians and they should be exploited, enslaved and raped by the white man if that meant they would be ""bought up to civilization"". The history of the sterilization of first nations women in Canada is directly related to that eurocentric white supremacist idea.

And this is doubly true if the rape is done by a woman because males believe men cannot be raped. We don’t live in a vacuum. Men are not the only ones capable of rape or violence. Feminism is supposed to be about liberation of all women from the heteropatriarchal values? Let’s get our facts straight and attack an entire gender when men are more capable of  being horrible people as women.

Misogyny is such a pervasive force around the world, and I can understand why these kinks/fetishes/preferences may be a trigger for a lot of people, specifically women. People who tell you that you aren't a ""real feminist"" for harboring these sort of feelings are being hugely problematic. Period. Your feelings are legitimate. I want to make that part 100% clear. Feminists who embrace sex positivity can be just as problematic as any one who ascribes to any ideology, and I am sorry you had these negative experiences and felt unsafe.

That being said, I do think that you are being incredibly reductive not only to feminists who embrace sex positivity, but also toward people in the BDSM community. I believe you are acting in good faith, but I think you are unintentionally setting up a straw man argument that makes it seem as if feminists who embrace sex positivity are all just men who secretly just want to abuse women. Your analysis thus far has also totally overlooked the agency that women possess in BDSM; while I do not think you purposefully did it, I think it's a sexist assumption.

2620,7383,"&gt; Do you think maybe one reason you thought female rape was...less legitimate or less harmful....was because maybe there is a stronger acknowledgment of male sexual destructive power and an inherent disregard for female sexual desructive power? And in general a disregard for female sexuality being viewed as the same caliber as male sexuality?

Yes, and I don't think I have reason to change my mind.  While I do accept that it's possible for a rape by a women to be extremely violent and physically harmful, generally it would be less than if by a man.  HOWEVER, this is just a conclusion I make based upon the fact that men are more likely to be violent (again, not *always*, just more likely than women), and are generally (not always) my physically stronger.
   
&gt; I'm a bit of a lurker ..and I've seen tons of post on r/sex where dudes are specifically talking about there genitals being bent too far in one direction or another during consensual sex...or they say they can't do certain positions because of how strained it feels for them...like it could break. So with that being a limitation of the male anatomy...couldn't it be possible its just as physically painful?
   
Okay...I don't think there's a scientific way to necessarily 100% decide which one is more painful.  However, I would have to again conventionally conclude that a physically traumatic rape would be more &gt;common&lt; if a male was doing the rape than if a woman was (assuming she's not using an object to *sodomize*).",Broflake-Melter,2019-10-02 12:53:15,2019-10-02 12:53:16,/r/Feminism/comments/dc51gu/rape_is_a_male_issue/f26qu6c/,t1_f267eir,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-02 12:53:16,0.09399,0.0005,0.00319,0.01702,0.00324,0.00135,0.46824,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When I was new to feminism, I came across this account called feminist\_tinder on IG. She's direct, confrontational, and doesn't ""pretty up"" *anything*. Her honesty and directness opened my eyes to so many aspects of the patriarchy that I understood intuitively through my personal experiences, but I had never known how to analyze or articulate those experiences or the feminist ideas/concepts behind them. (I even wrote her a really dorky message declaring my gratitude a few months later, lol.)

Even the idea in this post - that **male** violence is behind the vast, vast majority of rape, murder, assault, etc. - had never actually occurred to me as a new feminist. 

I guess my point is that I don't think potential allies/feminists will be turned off by the frankness in this post.

2667,7452,"Some guys prefer us dependent on them for protection and literally don't want us to be able to protect ourselves. Some people are just afraid of guns (probably never fired one) and are optimistic that they will never need one. Some posters worry about having a gun turned against them by a stronger man. Some of us know that when we're educated and trained, a weapon makes us at least equal to whoever threatens us in most situations. The best way to avoid being a statistic is to understand tactical situations and laws and plan accordingly. At range where someone is within reach or contact with you, you're probably better off with a knife. There are ways to fire and protect your weapon at contact range that aren't practical to get into here. Lots of tactical instruction on youtube. Nothing's  perfect though. Avoid brandishing your weapon just because you're scared. Your weapon should be kept hidden like a secret until you are ready and willing to use it. I'm not a fan of purse carry so I wear looser clothes when armed. 

Gunfighting is a martial art to learn just like any other. Learn jiujutsu for the other stuff is you plan on fighting stronger men. Nothing's perfect though. Good luck and stay safe.

Less females enter politics in general for the same reason females earn less money: it's hard and females would rather not put in the effort.

I have no idea where you get the idea that females have ""poor media representation"" when females get more media jobs than men because all they have to do is look good and read cue cards.

Having the privilege of murdering a person isn't ""reproductive rights"". If you don't want to be pregnant then keep your legs together or do anal.

2707,7522,"Wow, okay. Well if you're actually looking to understand how it makes a difference...

We as a country elect people who represent our interests. That can be business interests, religious interests, safety, equality, etc. 

Someone who is very religious would be unhappy if 0% of elected officials were religious, but they would feel that their concerns would not be properly understood or addressed. The people elected do not represent their interests

Likewise, our government is mostly made up of old white men. That is problematic in a number of ways:

1. Age. Did you watch when the US gov questioned Mark Zuckerberg about security and Facebook? The majority of people who questioned him were old and out of touch with technology that they couldn't even properly ask him questions on the topic. Likewise, their concerns at the stage of their life are not representative of the concerns of someone in their 20's or 30's that is just entering the workforce and encountering massive difficulties with cost of living, healthcare, and other issues. They are out of touch with the electorate and not representative of our population
2. Race. The majority of them are white, which means that the interests, needs, and concerns of minority races are often ignored and underrepresented in the US government.
3. Gender. The majority of them are males, which means the the interests, needs, and concerns of women are often ignored and underrepresented.

2766,7617,"Sorry but this is an optimistic speculation but it's not rooted in reality. In reality, oncologists are encouraging more research into why men are more likely to separate/divorce from their wives when she's the one who gets a cancer diagnosis. They are actually worried because the patients experience a lack of social care, which is detrimental to their ability to recover.

Patients who get abandoned by their husbands are also more likely to use antidepressants, again, a sign that its a real breakup. 

Also, the longer the marriage the likelier it is for the male to not abandon his wife. This is more proof that it has nothing to do with benefits as you're speculating. It's more to do with emotional attachment.

This is just one of the studies, I encourage you to do more research as well.

Plus, schools do teach kids to ""keep your hands to yourself"" in regards to physical violence. 

Sex on the other hand is very hush-hush, not to mention a lot of people who say things like, ""If she says ""no"" it's really a ""yes"" you just have to keep pushing"" or ""women love being abused by assholes"". And there is this weird narrative about women consuming rape porn in their books so therefore women must like rape on some level.

But it's also tricky because if more women spoke up about their issues as they happen then maybe there'd be an inertia effect that speeds progress up. So I think it's tricky and it depends on the specific issue.

2806,7680,"I've been thinking a lot about women's obligations to combat sexism to protect other people, though. It shifts responsibility heavily towards women, as opposed to men. While I agree that hopefully women are there for each other, I wonder whether it's healthy to obligate ourselves to protecting each other all the time at the detriment to our own person. I'm not saying I disagree with you, but wondering what you think?

For instance, I've read a lot of this sub that women should have the obligation of reporting an abuser to protect other women that may be abused by that person. I was sexually assaulted and didn't report my abuser due to very complex and personal reasons (who am I kidding, aren't all assaults complex and personal?) and it was not in my own mental best interest to pursue that avenue.  By the standards of a lot of women on this thread, I have sinned because I'm not looking out for other women, but I don't feel that it's my obligation to go through more pain.

That being said, I'm very vocal in other instances, and often call people out, especially friends, when they're being sexist. I'm not sure where the line is, if there is one.

I've read about language surrounding discussions of sexism, assault, etc, and the language we use is often very passive to the detriment of women (there's a thesis discussing this out of Harvard called ""More than Words: Passive Voice Use in Courtroom Depictions of Violence Against Women"" and another study by Pacific University called ""The Effect of Passive Voice on Perceived Responsibility of the Perpetrator"").  This is an example in a different area (crime) but I feel it's sort of applicable here.  At what point do we hold men accountable and stop trying to fix their shit, and at what point do we step in so that someone else doesn't get hurt? Is begnin sexism (if there is such a thing) always our problem to deal with for each other? What if it's stopping us from bettering our own situation or is detrimental to us? Is that option always from a place of privilege?

Releasing Afghanistan's dominant culture from accountability is foolish. They are fighting internal progress with the same zeal they fight foreign invaders (successfully). Foreign invaders did not create their culture and Afghanistan's gov. / shadow gov. will ensure that culture remains in place regardless of foreign interference.  

That's an incredibly narrow and distorted way to sum up the highly debatable motivations for military conflicts in Afghanistan. But that's another topic.

Regardless of the history - You're relieving Afghanistan's dominant culture from all human rights responsibilities - and placing the blame on foreign interference. I disagree.


Leaders throughout history have used religion as a vehicle for destruction - Islam is particularly susceptible to this. Afghanistan will continue to create conflict (internal and foreign) regardless of interference. Afghan gov. / shadow gov. will continue to persecute social progress in the absence of foreign conflict. 

(Just to preface - Islamic jihadi zeal should not be associated with all Muslims. Media fear-mongering is foolish and so is bigotry. Many Muslims walk a path of peace and humanity would lose significant contribution and advancement without their fair participation) 

But let's not pretend there aren't those who would gladly decapitate an innocent schoolgirl. Let's not pretend that Afghanistan's dominant gov. / shadow gov. hasn't successfully normalized and solidified a medieval culture of brutality. Their population is near powerless - with very little access to outside media, influence, or education. Extreme religious zeal will ensure that their ideology is the only education. If individuals don't agree, then they will be brutally killed. 

Also! I am very honestly curious about what you mean by ""patriarchal structures being in a place long before Islam in Afghanistan.""

[podcast about fetish and sexual imprinting ](https://youtu.be/0c8xDVbTcLY) 

There are tons more resources on the topic but this is one I listened to bc I know the person being interviewed

Edit: 
I know the podcast is long, but it’s an interesting listen. There are a few big takeaways just spaced out and talked about in depth. 

One very interesting example about a sexual imprinting on a fetish seams abhorrent and grotesque, but in reality it’s our brains being weird about what we see as a child and relating to sexual desire. The example was one Jewish holocaust survivor who was very young during the concentration camp time period and saw ads and graphic material about raping/taking advantage of Jews and basically being demoralized and abused within the context of sexual acts... so like I think he said it was the porn back then in Germany had these sorts of things and now this little girl was exposed to these things at her young age before any “normal” sexual imprinting had occurred, and as an adult she has this fetish. Most people with these fetishes are looked down upon like they are immoral or wrong, but it has a LOT to do with what we’ve been exposed to as kids that might have related to sexual desire or acts. People with these kinds of fetishes don’t WANT to have this fetish but they do and they feel so compelled to act out the fetish because of our imprinting basically telling us this is how sex and pleasure work(from like an evolutionary or biological standpoint) and lots of people don’t talk about this stuff because they feel so much shame, but it’s very common to have weird sexual fantasies or fetishes based on what you’ve been exposed to and related it to sex as a young person. 

I could go into detail cause it’s really interesting but you should give it a listen",kaylazomg,2019-10-05 21:46:55,2019-10-06 02:31:46,/r/Feminism/comments/ddeerw/rape_porn/f2n492u/,t1_f2lo1nc,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-06 02:31:46,0.22678,0.00133,0.03258,0.03346,0.00679,0.00097,0.25983,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Which gives zero qualification to talk about the cultural context of the ""F-word"".  
The origin of a word is also ignored by feminism frequently, so I'm sensing an inconsistency here. Example: ""Weib."" As the similarity to the English word ""wife"" may suggest, it means simply ""woman"". There never was any misogyny inherent to the term. However the word ""Frau"", which used to be a very flattering word, as in ""lady"", got used so commonly in poetry and when being especially polite to a woman, that it became common in everyday speech to the point that it was normalised so much that if you call a woman a ""Weib"" nowadays, she'll likely be offended by the term, even though it was never a sexist term (unless you think ""woman"" is also a sexist term because of it's relation to the gender binary) and simply fell out of use. So in this case, normalisation of the term ""Frau"" has changed the perception of the word ""Weib"", and its origins are blatantly ignored, if known at all, German women's advocacy included. So yes, the origins of a word aren't ""eradicated"" through normalisation, as in, the origins still exist, but it reduces and potentially eradicates the relevance of the origin, and can strip a word of its power. 
I disagree on the second part. Words aren't magical, the meaning of a word  is a social construct, and subject to change. Any and all meaing or other attribute a word could ever have are intrinsically contextual.  
As for ""the F-Word"" (I'm sticking with that, to make clear we aren't talking about the English word), it is used by both men and women in Germany, from my anecdotal experience actually more by women, but again, anecdotal, could be the other way around. It is used mainly to refer to women, analogously to the German equivalent of ""the W-word"" (I feel like I'm back in Kindergarten, can I just say the words I mean without being banned?), and yes, directly analogously, though I'd add the ""W-word"", as it is a clear attack on the man's claimed reproductive success is reducing him to that reproductive success, so please don't tell me it is less dehuminising than referring to a woman by her genitalia because reasons.  
Interestingly, Germany doesn't usually call men by their genitals, as in, we don't usually use a ""D-word"" equivalent, important point to point out that this particular trend works differently in Germany.

That may be true but it's still important to mention stories such as this one.

You talk about misandry and how ""new wave"" feminism is all about hating men. Misogyny has seen women raped, murdered, hindered, abused, sexualized, enslaved, objectified and denigrated. This misandry you speak of, aprt from hurting your fragile ego, what has it done to you?

Actors in traditional movies only act while in porn, people actually have sex. No one actually gets murdered or raped in movies but a lot of men and women actually got raped or violated in porn.  And plenty of people are actually outraged about violebt depictions of rape in movie.

Textbook definition of a MRA female who is trying to co-opt feminist to advance rape culture.  If you indeed have rape fantasy, you can fulfill your urge by reading erotic rape fantasy/bodice ripper/arranging role play with your partners/ by making amateur rape porn of you.  But, you are trying to establish a class of marginalized people to fulfill your urge. Also, fantasy is not being developed in vacuum. Victims matter more than you and your antifeminist bourgeois values. And most importantly, it's you who is performing the kink shaming by equating kinks with rape.  Did you notice only misogynists like you are accusing me of kink shaming and no actual kink practitioners came here to accuse me of kink shaming.  It's comedic at best when rape cheerleaders like you accuse others of kink shaming by performing and practicing kink shaming.

I'm a feminist and a victim of sexual assault.  It's very common for female victims of assault to develop simulated rape fantasies because it's a way to regain power over a traumatic experience.  I know that consensual power-play was key to decreasing my physical triggers during intimacy because it allowed me to recreate victimization in a safe setting.

I think rape porn does more harm than good because it's not framed as simulated.  There's no conversation at the start of the movie with consent and safe- words established.  Even titles that establish ""power play simulated non-consent"" would make a big difference.

I've been on a few of those ridiculously expensive medications. I pay a lot for my medical care, but not $20k/month. I think the sticker price on my most expensive one averaged to about $16k/month (10+ years ago), but I paid my insurance costs (and fortunately my employer at the time paid for a service that would argue with your insurance company for you, so my insurance company eventually covered it, because $16k was like half my yearly salary at the time.

3015,8055,"I'm glad to see this is being published and hopefully society and the medical community is becoming more aware of gender bias. I have Hashimoto's which is the autoimmune version of hypothyroidism. Thyroid issues affect 80% of women. I was diagnosed when I was 22 and the gaslighting and psychosomatic games were very prevalent and drastically effected my self esteem and self confidence. What made it worse is that there is no conventional medical treatment for the autoimmunity portion of Hashimoto's, it's treated exactly the same as any other hypothyroid condition with the exact same medication, and the autoimmunity is thought to ""just resolve itself"". 9 years later and I'm still trying to manage joint pain, inflammation, and many other symptoms. The only doctors even interested in addressing the immune portion are functional/naturopathic/integrative medicine doctors, which is very very disheartening for anyone like my younger, poorer, college self who had no insurance coverage or access to these types of doctors. In addition, a lot of the protocols these doctors take are diet and supplement based which is an even further barrier to proper treatment because of the expense. The treatment for this diagnosis is literally not accessible for some individuals because of conventional medicines refusal to help patients manage autoimmunity instead of blaming any unresolved symptoms on the patient. When I was 22 I was told my joint pain was me getting older and that I had to get used to it, my fatigue was me doing too much in my life and drinking energy drinks, my inflammation and weight gain was me also getting older and needing to learn that I had to work out (see fatigue), me sleeping 10-12 hours a day and not feeling rested was another problem for another doctor and could not possibly be related. I did my own research and brought questions to my doctor about alternative medications and I was told they were only prescribed to drug addicts to wean them off of cocaine (because of the metabolic energy they create) and that if people could access them easily doctors would be hawking them for weight loss....

There are entire communities of people with Hashimoto's that have similar and worse stories. When it comes to fertility, there are women who have had multiple miscarriages with conventional medicine doctors dismissing the thyroid connection and not even bothering to test patients and follow the standard obstetrics treatment for pregnancy and thyroid levels. The nail in the coffin of our Hashimoto's lives is that conventional medicine most of the time won't actually fully and completely diagnose patients with Hashimoto's because their standard of treatment won't change. So we have a very high percentage of women walking around completely oblivious and with absolutely no consideration for their autoimmunity who are constantly struggling with symptoms that doctors refuse to acknowledge even exist and won't even entertain the idea to test for or tie to thyroid issues.",p0wderedwater,2019-10-05 14:47:17,2019-10-05 15:27:55,/r/Feminism/comments/ddk5s2/millions_of_women_suffer_from_a_disease_that/f2kliw7/,t3_ddk5s2,Feminism,3,0,2019-10-05 15:27:55,0.00165,1e-05,0.0001,0.00074,0.00038,9e-05,0.00033,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3053,8113,"**Wide-Eyed and Legless**

Wide-Eyed and Legless (known in the US as The Wedding Gift) is a 1993 made-for-TV British drama film directed by Richard Loncraine.

It is based on the 1989 book Diana's Story by Deric Longden, who co-wrote the script with Jack Rosenthal. It tells the story of his marriage to his wife, Diana, who contracts a chronic, degenerative illness that medical officials were unable to understand at the time (now believed to be Myalgic Encephalomyelitis). As Diana's health faltered, she secretly set him up with another woman to help ease his pain over her eventual death.

I will also have you know that these organizations both take pride in following an incredibly misogynictic, weirdly respected leader who is thought to be the honorary father of Kurdish awakening. 

I'm not usually a person that takes solid sides in political conflicts, however as a citizen, I feel obligated to prioritize between my actual physical safety and over-idealized portrayals of insurgents. I believe reality is very different. I am not claiming that there is zero chance social progress is being made in Northern Syria, but I'm skeptical because YPG naturally would want to appeal to the western eye by mimicking their ideals. After all, they need all sorts of support. If Taliban was in the same condition, under the same circumstances needing political and financial support I doubt they would insist on their ancient oppressive policies. Besides, if Taliban or any terrorist organization went under a huge change today and started to improve women's rights, that would not make all of their actions acceptable let alone explainable. If Turkish Army were ruled mostly by female commanders your views on this matter would naturally be the same, so I'm expecting you to understand my point. This is kind of like huge companies run under patriarchy going bonkers on International Women's Day. What's been actually done is 1% of what is shown. At the end of the day it is just a show, which is my main disturbance, because the roles of women in an organization should never be used as a tool for PR, especially when most information on the web is too good to be true.

Patriarchy also allows for men in government to make laws to control women's bodies (anti-abortion laws) which limits their ability for education and employment as well as medical costs since they are forced to carry a baby they can't afford.

Moving away from feminism to just general anti-capitalistic talking points, there's just the problem of where a person is born. What if you are born in a poor run down place where the majority of the big employers have abandoned due to crime rates and similar issues? And you can't really travel super far because cars are expensive to obtain and maintain?

Hence the original assumption that [full service] sex work is rape must be incorrect. 

Sex workers don’t generally consider what they do to be rape.

3353,8596,"Not trying to justify it but ""Women"" and ""Men"" are a group of individuals not a monolithic entity.

Within the group of ""Men"" there are some who create and try to maintain the male-only clubs.  But there are also some who find this idea wrong, and push for equality and inclusion.

For the people who push for equality and inclusion, it's frustrating to see the same toxic ideas start popping up on the other side. 

Now that said, not all exclusive groups are toxic. Things like support groups and safe spaces can be exclusive without the goal of trying to exclude others. 

Similarly, for the most part, the people complaining about these things are often not the people who do care about equality and inclusion. Rather they misrepresent themselves as caring about equality and inclusion and are really just part of that boys-club that tries to promote that toxic behavior.

I like to think of myself in the category of supporting equality and inclusion. I don't have any grudge against any feminist woman-exclusive group right now because all of them that I'm aware of are in the business of trying to help build up women, and if that's what I want to do, I can try and do that, but I don't need to invade another group that is doing it because I feel like I can do it better just because I'm a guy. 

I think if the pendulum swung too far, if there were exclusive, powerful groups of women who were using that power to try to exclude men and be able to maintain some kind of ""competitive advantage"" over them, locking them out of their careers and aspirations based on their gender, in that case I would argue in support of equality and inclusion again.

But I guess what I'm saying is, there's a situation where men might argue against exclusivity and this might not be hypocritical because they might also argue against exclusivity in male-only clubs; ""men"" is a diverse group. However, it's my opinion that the men complaining right now aren't really interested in inclusiveness because they don't suffer from being excluded from these groups, they just want to try and ""teach a lesson"".

In the same way that feminist groups aren't toxicly exclusive, male-only testicular cancer support groups or male-only sexual abuse support groups generally wouldn't be considered toxic by most reasonable feminists.  A male-only international business group on the other hand would be.  

A female-only international business group wouldn't be either unless it was the most powerful one out there, but if it was just a smaller group that was trying to help women get a leg-up in areas that they were previously discouraged in and especially if it was focused on the particular experience of women in business/that industry, then it's kind of a necessary stepping stone. On the other hand, if that group became dominant and was using that power to consistently deprive men of opportunity, then the people who do care about equality would speak up. 

We're not there. The only reason I'm writing this long-winded post is that I don't think that toxic exclusivity is right or justified by a group just because it was practiced against a group in the past.  However, I also don't believe that current female-exclusive groups are toxic in the way that certain male-exclusive groups are and were toxic.  At the same time, there are male-exclusive groups that aren't toxic.  I'm for getting rid of the ones that are hurtful through their exclusion.",zeidrich,2019-10-08 16:21:56,2019-10-08 16:21:57,/r/Feminism/comments/deoivi/this_comic_understands_the_problem_with_our_spaces/f30d1qr/,t1_f2zsdww,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-08 16:21:57,0.01708,6e-05,0.00058,0.00783,0.00361,0.00015,0.00754,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3429,8700,"I think some misogynists have the knee-jerk reaction to think these astronauts were chosen because they're female, in order to facilitate this feel-good girl power stunt of conducting a spacewalk with just women. Some of them have showed up here in previous threads about this spacewalk. 

Everyone who knows even a little bit about space operations knows that these astronauts are *highly* qualified and the selection process is brutal. What's really happening is the space station has male and female crew and astronauts conduct spacewalks in teams. There have been all male spacewalks, mixed gender spacewalks... Now, two women were picked from this pool of available, qualified astronauts. Really no big deal for the operations up there.

What makes it a big deal and worth reporting is it's an indicator for how far we've come in our struggle for equality, precisely because it isn't some stunt but because the reality in space right now is that men and women can be picked for spacewalks, so much so that an all-female spacewalk is a possibility as well. That's worth reporting because it's yet another signal that women are worth as much as men.

Sooner or later, with signal after signal like this, the aforementioned misogynists are going to see the error of their ways too. 

Just compare how the general public thought of women as world leaders 25 years ago (""she'll have her period and start world war 3"" was *widely* parroted, not just by hardcore idiots) with how easily imaginable a female world leader is today. The times are changing.

3502,8811,"Institutional misandry? You mean toxic masculinity?

The reason men don't win custody battles? The usually-male judge is incapable of seeing a man as nurturing, because it's seen as a feminine trait. Or the reason men don't win domestic dispute cases against their spouses? Because the usually-male judge is incapable of seeing a man let his guard down, and expects him to be strong and masculine and not such a pussy. It's not misandry - they're not being hated when they're told they can't raise a child - it's toxic masculinity setting unhealthy standards of what manhood /should/ be and what a man is capable of. Men are overwhelmingly in power, men are the ones making these decisions for other men. 

The thing about actual misandry, though, is it's not attached to feminism. My mother didn't hate men because she was a diehard feminist, she hated them because she attached her trauma to men as a whole and projected it on me and other men. And that angry teacher that bullies her male students? Once again, probably incited from a bad experience with a man, maybe an abusive ex husband. Not because she reads too much feminist literature. 

The issue with misandry isn't what feminism teaches, but the fact a minority of men do very traumatizing or damaging acts. And since we're a culture that's only just starting to dive into mental healthcare and individual accountability, it's easy to see why so many women project traumatic experiences with one men onto other men. It's not agreeable, it's not healthy, but moving past it requires better ways of treating trauma-induced symptoms.

Of course it also requires men to be held accountable whenever they traumatize women. And it also requires women to be believed when they claim a man caused her to feel abused so they can make strides in getting help. But that isn't the *direct* issue, the issue is how these women are handling the resulting anxieties after the fact. So it really begins to detach itself from feminism and moves into how we treat mental illness in this society.

Yes, there's movements against men that claim feminism. Right away, as a trans person, I can point directly towards TERFs. Trans-exclusive feminists usually are an unhealthy mix of misandric and transphobic. They hate men so much, they consider me an ""intruder"" when I decide to transition to become a woman. And they consider transmen ""confused and self-loathing women"".

But honestly, do I consider them feminists? Absolutely not. Their identity isn't fighting for liberation and rights, their movement is more so about taking the rights away from others. It's an anti-trans anti-men movement hiding behind a much softer tone of ""were not anti-anything. We're pro-women"". But it's bullshit - they coddle women, label women submissive, push for nuclear families, they're realistically just as misogynistic as anyone else.

Beyond that though, we have expanded on the *core* movement a lot more in recent years. Feminists ideally should be fighting for men and women, because feminity is not inherent to one gender and femininity is the real victim in our society. A masculine woman will be successful, but a feminine man will face hatred. Yes there's still some nuance to it, as even a masculine and dominant woman will be discriminated against for her gender. But not as badly as if she allowed her feminine traits a voice.

In the end, ""I hate men"" is generally just a frustrated way of venting about some shitty dude ruining someone's day. Those same women go home to their boyfriends with a smile, tell their dads I love you, etc. They're intersectional, and are at least beginning to understand stuff like cultural differences and how we incorporate LGBT issues alongside woman's rights issues. They're working to be patient with men, understanding that men are raised in a way that sets them up for failure and makes it almost hard to not act like a misogynist sometimes. They're working to figure out how to approach the issues they have with men from a perspective of ""You're damaged by society, and it's not your fault. You just need taught better."" instead of pretending like every men has created the issues themselves and getting mad when they don't know what they're doing wrong. 

Very very few women are personally doing any damage to the male identity and definitely not any more than male society does to itself.

What can you personally do to fix things? If your friend is being a shit head to his girlfriend, call him out and tell him the way he treats his girlfriend is very indicative that he doesn't view her or other females as equal in societal standing. Likewise if your friend has a girlfriend who is shitty to him because of a bad experience with an ex boyfriend treating her in a misogynistic or abusive manner, call her out and tell her to stop projecting her trauma and to get help. It's about breaking the twisted cycle now that we're finally having people see eye to eye. Not so much about fighting a ""new trend of misandry."" More like, solving the aftermath of a society ravaged by misogyny that has only decided to fix half the issue before calling it quits.",FirstNameHere,2019-10-17 19:23:24,2019-10-17 20:28:40,/r/Feminism/comments/ddp6gj/say_it_again_for_those_in_the_back/f43b4u7/,t1_f42pxhc,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-17 20:28:40,0.10321,0.00275,0.0119,0.0402,0.01221,0.00412,0.09067,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dogma is when you build gatekeeping around that.  Dogma is when you try and assign standards and measure validity based on them.  Dogma is when you say that these differences are the one true source of trans identity.  

It's possible to look at the data and acknowledge what it says without becoming a gatekeeping transmed. It's exactly the same way that you can say women are taller than men on average, but being a tall woman doesn't make someone a man.  The first idea, that men are on average taller than women is a correlation built from data, and it has no meaning, no moral value by itself.  It's not dogma, it's not good or bad, it just is.  When you start using height to gatekeep access to womanhood or manhood, that's when it's dogma, and that's when it's a problem.

3553,8890,"&gt; no - most intersex people are classified the same way everybody else is, genitalia at birth. 

Corollary to what you just said: some are not. There are people who are literally born with a set of genitals that are a combination of the two, and often those are 'classified' by someone preforming surgery on them (obviously without consent because the person has just been born). This is not 'classifying' in a useful way, this is an attempt to force reality to fit the dual sex model rather than fixing the model to fit reality.

&gt;I am not anti trans people, most aren’t radicals themselves. i’m against the ideology sprung by a minority of activists and their allies that rests on sexist tropes being revitalised in their name. 

You are claiming that you are not anti-trans and yet you used the term ""trans ideologues"" which implies that this is a commonly held trans view (not to mention implying that trans people existing is an ideology and not a fact of life). Now you are trying to back paddle by claiming that you just meant a view held mostly by some 'male allies'.

You also say:

&gt; only your reproductive system and chromosomes determine that \[where 'that' was reffered to as being a man or a woman\]

Yes, I can see how that view is compatible with trans men and trans women (much less non-binary people) existing.

3568,8912,"&gt; yes there are chromosomal abnormalities - people are still male or female, intersex people are still male or female - they aren’t a third sex or less male or less female because of it. 

Well, I guess once in a blue moon even someone with a degree in biology can be wrong. Intersex people are, in a literal sense, people who have a mix of biological traits and as such some of them literally can't be classified as either male or female. Assuming your biology degree covered human biology you really should already know this.

&gt; i do not have a misunderstanding in biology. i have a degree in it. 

I know a lot of people with PhDs, does not mean that they are incapable of having a misunderstanding of science even in their own field. Also, you are making an appeal to authority that we literally can't verify the quality of.

Feminists have become people who only care about women rather than people who care about making men and women equal. This isn’t all feminists, but it’s a lot. What you have to understand is your making everybody into your enemy by doing that. 

One example I saw was about pregnancy. Basically this guy (who did get downvoted pretty hard) asked people the following scenario: obviously you all believe that if a women gets pregnant, they have the full rights to do what they want with the baby. They can abort, or they can deliver. The idea is that women don’t have to accept a baby to have sex. He then asked about the man not wanting the same baby, and whether they were still responsible. His point was that if women don’t have to accept a baby just because they have sex, men shouldn’t either. Everybody but one person who responded said that women have the right to choose, and men don’t. Even if a man doesn’t want the kid, it’s too bad, he has to take care of it anyway. That’s so hypocritical! The one smart person said that if the man puts it in writing soon enough so that the women could get an abortion, then they’re no longer responsible if the women decides to have the baby. 

You feminists have to realize that if you’re sexist towards men, generalize men, alienate men, or do the things you resent being done to you towards men, you’re effectively moving backwards. Feminists would be so respected if they didn’t alienate others like they do.",Elharion0202,2019-10-20 12:55:17,2019-10-20 12:55:51,/r/Feminism/comments/dk2tuq/all_woman_spacewalk/f4fzqeu/,t1_f4fbjv6,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-20 12:55:51,0.15384,0.00015,0.00149,0.06547,0.0536,0.00046,0.0157,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

3645,9044,"NASA astronauts, when asked about being the first woman to do ""x"" always seem to be so over it.

They have so much devotion to duty, so many qualifications to get the job, such an awesome mission, so many exacting checklists that everything must be done just so. It almost feels like nothing is serendipitous, nothing is spontaneous or subjective.

Every minor accomplishment is just like ""of course."" There was no other way. It was pre-planned within tolerances.

But then the civilians/non-NASA employees always go nuts about it.

I think NASA (and the military it has been so close to for a while) tries to equalize its people so much, that they see devotion to duty, rather than personal motivation or individuals on their own as the thing that advances the mission. And it's all about the mission.

But really, it means something for the rest of society that there are women in freakin' space. Doing the work. Making space stuff happen.

The symbolism and the gravity (lol) are not lost on the non-NASA folks. That's for sure...

(At the same time I respect that for a NASA astronaut, this is not ""a thing"" -- women have done spacewalks before, and they've done everything else there is to do at the ISS, basically. But to people at home, women just did a whole operation hanging out the side of a vehicle going faster than the speed of sound in a vacuum, and made repairs to said vehicle... There is so much about this that regular women are told they can't do or shouldn't try. And they held court in space with no man. It went from theoretically, since women have done spacewalks, then all EVAs should be doable by women... to ""women have been the sole crew for at least one spacewalk."" It's proven now, and it just feels like whatever it is in space, women can do it. We have the receipts!

I do want to say however, for the benefit of other people reading this, that in the above conversation Pete Buttigieg and Chris Wallace are talking specifically about pregnancies already in the third trimester (28+ weeks). I'm guessing you had yours before then because as far as I know there isn't an abortion clinic or hospital in the country that provides third trimester abortions except in the case of medical emergencies. In the case of a healthy pregnancy, the fetus is viable outside the womb at 28 weeks, which is why abortions at this stage occur most often when the fetus is *not* viable or already dead. Either that or a medical complication arises which puts the mother's life at risk, and even in that case doctors will usually try to save both the mother and the fetus if at all possible, so the popular pro-life talking point that ""thousands of women abort their babies in the the third trimester!"" really needs to be better contextualized, as Pete is doing here.

I'm sorry I really hope this doesn't come across as questioning or disrespecting your experience, because that is absolutely not the intention! Your decision was 100% valid and you make an excellent point about how we talk about late-term abortions in general. But I do want to counter the right wing myth that women with otherwise healthy pregnancies can just decide to get an abortion in their third trimester, because legally and medically that is not the case, nor is it something that most pro-choice advocates are pushing for.",Organic-Tofu,2019-10-23 19:06:55,2019-10-23 19:27:40,/r/Feminism/comments/dll0br/pete_buttigieg_educates_chris_wallace_on_the/f4wmhc6/,t1_f4u6jk5,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-23 19:27:40,0.00173,1e-05,8e-05,0.00072,0.00043,7e-05,0.00027,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Whole systems of land ownership based on arranged marriage and primogeniture inheritance, dynastic alliances secured through marriage, and a military order built around a warrior class who have no job other than fighting (incompatible with carrying children). And of course the pervasive ideological and psychological hegemony of a deeply patriarchal Catholic Church.

3813,9306,"More support systems. Especially for first year students who are rotating. They don't have a formal mentor to check in an catch problems early. As a senior student (defending soon!) I have had weekly meetings with my PI for the past 5 years. Not everyone gets that much support.

My school is also trying to implement a peer mentorship program which a great idea but it's far from useful right now. I hope that they continue to work on it though.

In my program we have been trying to push them to help the students organise routine social events in order to foster more peer community and allow for organic support systems to form. While they liked that idea there has yet to be any follow through on the programs end.

More school wide commitment to diversity groups when I started there was no group for women in STEM  when a colleague and I were working to start one it was more difficult than I should have been to secure the limited amount of finding and support we were seeking.

Then there are logistical things. Non traditional students may need help with financial counseling. They may be burdened from predatory student loans (especially those students who are first gen college students) or supporting other family members. STEM grad student stipends are small and it can be hard to make it work especially in cities.

Also financial benefits that cover more types of students. For example my insurance is great but I cannot buy in my spouse or dependents to the plan. This creates a burden on students who have children or spouses and make too much to qualify for govt insurance assistance or medicaid but too little to comfortably pay for plans for their family (I know many struggling students in this situation).

**AF3IRM Los Angeles**, @AF#IRMLA

It draws a lot from ancient mythology and civilization which shows in the cultural norms of the depicted societies.

That being said, Tolkien did an incredible job in giving everyone a full fledged story. Yes, the Warriors are often at the center, but every main female character is fully fleshed out as a person, with wants and needs of their own. Eowyn is a strong woman, and her wanting to fight and going against her father and that being a good thing and not punished in her story by Tolkien, is as feminist a statement as it gets for the time it was written, and even today. It's authentic. He had no societal pressure to virtue signal in any way. Arwen being heroic and saving frodo from the nazgul, and she certainly isn't just blindly obeying her father. Galadriel. Come on, Galadriel? Name one stronger, more independent and more then equal if not superior to every male coexisting female character.

Aside from this, if you look at all the races and their characters, like the fun little harmless hobbits, the down to earth dwarves, the honourful gondorians and the Noble elves, it paints a pretty diverse picture of masculinity,of humanity, which is far from negative. Everyone is different, has weaknesses and strengths in their personalities, but everyone and their traits are important and worth the same. There isn't one toxic male, if you'd say so, who doesn't get what he deserves in the end. Theoden is proud of his daughter after all.

- Why is it bad that the bride repairs it when she's already had a damaged hymen if it weren't her fault? Shouldn't that be ultra progressive and (empowering)? (it's cheating if she were infidelous, but that's not what you're annoyed about is it?)

- And how is it not a great insult to the bride (and groom) for the mother-in-law to require that? Even according to that culture?

These are the ones I remember reading off the top of my head. You can also introduce him to some fiction like the female of the species. E.t.c

I was like him once, I couldn’t understand or even relate to the feminist cause. That changed after I read these books. I ended up graduating with a double major in physics and math  and a minor in women and gender studies.

Remind him when he’s reading this books that they are not an attack on him, but a critique of the system and patterns of behaviour that men consciously and unconsciously engage in.  The first step to engaging with a problem is to read about it and recognize it.  The most important words a man can say is “I will be better”.  Hopefully he says it when he’s done reading.

Since I have spent a lot of time outside of western countries I have become particularly sensitive to possibilities of latent Christianity and when it comes to the OP, this was more of an intuition. Again, its hard to know what to make of the post due to its vagueness, so I did start to speculate based on that. Perhaps its nothing, perhaps its not.

I'd say the overton window on gender politics is that almost all republicans and those further to the right are biological essencialists, however there is a significant amount of liberals that are also biological essencialists. It's when you start getting into progressivism that people take the constructivist approach.

&gt; To say these are the same is deliberately reductionist 

One of the reductionist statements from the OP was also ""Men on both sides of the political spectrum are completely in defense of it"". In defense of what exactly? Is it in reference to the previous statement about police officers and the UN? It's like every sentence is deliberately vague on purpose to get the reader to take a hyper reductionist stance, which is what leads me to the less charitable interpretations of the post.

&gt; I mean it's a nuclear take to blame terrorism on male-ness. It's also a convenient way to deflect blame from the Western powers. 

Which is very interesting because it also ties into the interpretation that the OP is in fact, steeped in western influence, the potential latent Christianity, and then then diverting attention away from western imperialism.

The thing that equally threw me off was the Left/Right thing. Obviously, the ""Left"" and the Right are—at-bottom—following from the Liberal framework and, thereby, going to correlate on some issues; though it should be apparent gender isn't one of them. The Right has by and large completely decided in favour of biological essentialism. On the other hand, the Left has by and large gone for a Constructivist approach. (By saying ""Left"" I mean to imply I see Liberals as basically on the Right.)

3933,12180,"Let's dive a little deeper here. What is meant by ""male issue""? Are we talking about borrowed original sin, that all humans (in this case males) are born with original sin, a Christian ethic?

Being part of western Christian cultures, and reddit being predominantly white people from the USA it wouldn't surprise me if what we actually are talking about here is latent Christianity. It wouldn't be the first time I have seen so called ""atheists"" so called ""leftists"" and so called ""feminists"" haunted by the ghost of their culture. 

This also brings up the nature vs nurture debate, to what extent are human beings ""blank slates""?

It's rather difficult to understand what the original post is trying to say, is it that males have an immutable characteristic where they are rapists until they are ""trained"" out of it? This is a seriously problematic view, being that although most perpetrators of rape are male, the fact remains that most people in general, do not rape. It's actually an argument typical of reactionaries and Nazis, ""this group of people have immutable characteristics that can not be changed"".

A more charitable interpretation of the original post is that its calling attention that rape is predominantly the result of toxic masculinity; however only the left recognize that toxic masculinity exists. Only the left recognizes that society is a male dominated patriarchy. I can't help but think the original post was written by one of these ""enlightened centrists"" that is trying to muddy the waters.

The problem with saying ""men are the issue"" is that you also need to state why men are the issue. 

It's entirely possible I am in total agreement with the original post, but its difficult for me to ascertain that. If it's something along the lines of:

""We need to stop blaming external factors for why rape occurs, rape is predominantly perpetrated by men and is a male issue. This is due to patriarchy, toxic masculinity and a culture that promotes rape"" then okay.

Overall its just really bad optics, the language used alienates and divides people, it seems deliberately vague on purpose to fuel this division. It definitely hasn't convinced me of anything useful, it's clear to me that leftism is the correct political stance and the real fight against oppression will always be on the left.

I don't think a lot of men really want to even address the facts in OP. A lot of them deny it. 

 That's why I think OP has a point that a lot of people refuse to acknowledge. It's about getting them to realize why toxic masculinity is a problem that requires both naming and resolving. A lot of men refuse to do either.

 Like look at how so many men reacted to the Gillette advertisment. A lot of men do not like to criticise masculinity as a concept at all. They get upset by it, or what I suspect, they misunderstand toxic masculinity and get upset by it. Meanwhile women have been criticizing femininity and have seen feminity mocked, criticized from here to the moon and back for centuries. From a young age, women partake in the mocking of femininity together with the rest of the world. Men who are more feminine are mocked. So we see lots of it, and often curse the burden that it can be to have to play along with the feminine gender role and have actively worked to change it. Women are veterans when it comes to criticizing gender so its really difficult to get the framing right in a way that doesn't make them reject the whole idea, no matter how prettied up the language is. 

Isn't it useful to be like ""here, this is why we need to all discuss what masculinity is and how it can be toxic as fuck, as a concept, that directly influences the upbringing of men?"" to me it just sounds like the same people who get offended by OP also call the whole concept of toxic masculinity the epitome of misandry. 

So, I'm genuinely asking you, how would you pitch any of this and get the kind of man who's offended by the framing in OP on board with toxic masculinity instead. Id love to know how to best frame this in a way that doesn't alienate most men as they currently are today. I just can't think of a way to not offend them and it gets tedious to have to tip toe only to be called a misandrist for criticizing anything about masculinity.

But I'll repeat again because I want to stress that I also would prefer a more nuanced wording of OP, one that brings light to toxic masculinity and doesn't make it seem like we're blaming an immutable condition.",rofl1969,2019-10-02 06:31:29,2019-10-02 06:31:29,/r/Feminism/comments/dc51gu/rape_is_a_male_issue/f268ca7/,t1_f263d8l,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-02 06:31:29,0.01616,0.00016,0.00517,0.00469,0.00228,0.00023,0.00519,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If I'm twisted let me know...initially your thought was that rape committed by males was more severe? If I'm correct...

1. Do you think maybe one reason you thought female rape was...less legitimate or less harmful....was because maybe there is a stronger acknowledgment of male sexual destructive power and an inherent disregard for female sexual desructive power? And in general a disregard for female sexuality being viewed as the same caliber as male sexuality?

2. I'm a bit of a lurker ..and I've seen tons of post on r/sex where dudes are specifically talking about there genitals being bent too far in one direction or another during consensual sex...or they say they can't do certain positions because of how strained it feels for them...like it could break.

There is a big problem also with male victims being told they ""should have just enjoyed it"" when they come forward about a rape, because culturally the idea is that men should always want sex, and therefore it would be impossible for a woman to rape a man. So that is a problem that I believe would be pretty much exclusive to male victims as well. I think the way you worded your original question might leave a few people wondering if you also agree with that, which would get you some downvotes for sure.

If someone is engaging in that kind of rhetoric I'm not going to try and stop them, because I don't engage with fascists, period.

Just replace men with ""Jews"" in the original post, see how comfortable you are with it then. Say everything they said about Jews was ""factually correct"", but you never give the context, you never explain further. ""These are just the facts"" or another example, take a look at race realists and crypto-Nazis, they will say things like ""Black people have on average lower IQ"" ""these are just the facts"" they then leave it to the readers imagination to leap to the conclusion that blacks have ""smaller brains"" of course they never mention the socioeconomic conditions and oppression of black people by white people, they never explicitly mention that racial brain sizes are a complete myth.

Racial supremacy is hyper reductive and its how fascism rises on the right. There are reactionaries on the left though, thats how you get class reductionists and brocialists that ignore the oppression of woman. Reactionary views can pop up in places you would never expect though, thats how we have TERFs and reactionary feminists. 

Feminism to me is about dismantling the patriarchy as this is an oppressive hierarchy of predominantly white men that leads to negative outcomes for everyone (including the men inside the patriarchy). To a liberal feminist this might sound a bit too extreme as they believe in incrementalism and also capitalism. From where I am sitting, liberal feminists have some pretty bad takes. 

So by optics being important, I mean that we want to be a real alternative to the reactionaries. Not engaging in the same rhetoric and merely changing the actors, not being hyper reductionist but being an example of the best humanity has to offer, showing what is possible when hierarchy is eliminated, being inclusive of as many people as possible.

3987,12243,"Let’s consider the perspective of those raped by women. My girlfriend was raped by her sister growing up. Yet people treat it less seriously because rape is seen as heteronormative (penis going into vagina). The people surrounding the crisis see her abuser as a victim. They think there must have been a male abuser who taught her to be bad. My girlfriend is asked questions even in survivors therapy like “what was his name?” In reference to her abuser. She constantly gaslights herself about whether it was rape since it doesn’t involve a penis. Women are abused by women in homosexual relationships at high frequency. So while I agree that there is no virtue in being intentionally moderate to please men, I also think that framing rape as an entirely “male issue” simply excludes certain people from the conversation about rape. 


My point is not that we shouldn’t put pressure on men who instigate the vast majority of violence but that this is a conversation that requires a wholllle lot of nuance.

Your struggle is internal. Perhaps the deeper frustration is the impacts it has on a little girl being called a boy to her face? Perhaps it’s self-condemning to be in charge of dressing your girl, and then it confuse the general public?

I would agree men commit rape more often... that doesn't however give it more power per say in the scope of physical or mental damage. A males physical dominance doesn't render him impervious to date rape drugs, or weapons. Again...kinda my opinion here... sorry if I'm off base...

I tend to think most issues regarding sexism towards men and women goes back to how the sexual nature and validity are often viewed.

 Why does penetrating get viewed as a more powerful than engulfing? Either way...the coin flips both ways...either gender could take from the other. It boils down to how much merit you give both genders..

And I'm bias as is everyone. I tend to think females are more dominate...and that's why there has been such an effort throughout human culture to literally mute any and all forms of female sexuality.

Like the original commenter said; it's a male issue but it's more specifically a ""dominance"" and ""patriarchial"" problem, in which tying all men into that same knot is not helpful at all, and instead sparks anger.

Anger and strangers **never** mix well. That's my personal issue. I'm active in my local Hispanic Community; and I never try to ""passionately"" get a message across to complete strangers, despite other people desperately wanting to. I would hate for someone to be up in my face and say ""this is your people's fault, do something"". It's an extremely easy way to grab your attention, but it rarely ever keeps it. Worse yet, there's a higher risk of the message backfiring, and now you're left with said people mocking the message.

Honestly it just seems like emotion frequently substitutes rationale within certain groups, which is understandable given that people are obviously passionate about righting the many wrongs in society. However just about every male friend of mine that made fun of or didn't take feminism seriously at an earlier point respect it now because we have people in our circles that relay the message effectively, patiently, and without angry outbursts (though a little spice is sometimes nice).

3999,12257,"Calling these a ""male issue"" isn't the best way to phrase it. I get that the OP is trying to say that these are issues rooted in patriarchy and how it leads to toxic ideals of manhood that cause serious issues (ie sexual assault/harassment, gun violence, general violence), but that can be said better than calling it a ""male issue"" as if it is the complete and total fault of men as a single demographic. Men aren't the issue, the culture and upbringing of men is.

I also have a few issues with this post besides that one minor phrase. I am speaking as a leftist and a feminist, but I have not once heard my fellow lefties describe rape culture and the epidemic of sexual assault as a unique example of western culture in some way. We know it's a common worldwide problem, of course we do. We also generally discuss how the issues of patriarchy are made more intense under the current political climate, but we don't dismiss rape in other parts of the world or something like that. I don't know what kind of leftist OP met, but they seem to not grasp what socialist feminism is if they think it is solely the fault of white western society. Can't speak for the right of course as I just don't understand their process on rape.

That point of terrorism being a ""male issue"" however is incredibly reductionist. I'm going to mainly focus on domestic terrorist attacks in North America as that's where I am from. I am assuming OP meant the style of terrorism where the terrorist shoots all the women they could find (L'École Polytechnique shooting immediately comes to mind). That kind of domestic terrorism absolutely has roots in patriarchal politics and how toxic masculinity left unchecked becomes a terrible weapon of hate, and in those types of attacks, the primary motivator of the action. But what of terrorist attacks on synagogues? Is the main player of that act of terrorism the ""male issue"" or anti-Semitism? If a man shoots Muslims in a mosque during prayer, is he a prime example of masculinity run amok, or is it merely one part of the story? Masculinity definitely plays a role in domestic terrorism, but ignoring things like white supremacy, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, homophobia and other such factors of hate as feminists is a dangerous thing.

If we don't look at how other systems work in conjunction with patriarchy than we won't be as effective in dealing with it. Patriarchy exists, and it hurts everyone, especially women.

4001,12261,"I really appreciate your commentary, and I want to add to this point:

&gt;I also would prefer a more nuanced wording 

I'm not sure you meant it this way, but we need *both* nuance and pointed commentary and everything in between. 

People need to be shocked into actually addressing this.  Even ""good"" men need to feel the anger at them as men.  Crappy men might feel anger too, but unless that creates violence in them, who cares. 
We, as an entire society, need to stop coddling men.

Here's why I'm ok with ""good"" men being the target of that anger: no one is exempt from the sexism of society.  So many good men are only ""good"" in their own *overt* behavior.  They wouldn't rape or grab, but they **do** let bad behavior or demeaning commentary go by without any reaction. And they do enjoy inequality without trying to balance the scales. 

How many ""good"" men are just fine with their partner doing more emotional work, child and elder  care,  and physical upkeep?

Almost 100%.

Women are soooo careful not to upset men. But getting angry at them can motivate them to reevaluate what they are thinking, saying, doing.  

Being carefully nuanced lets men stay in stasis, because they won't see their own bias and biased behavior of others unless they are actively paying attention. Being carefully nuanced lets ""good"" men think they aren't jointly responsible for the biased system - they think they can live in neutrality. They think that it is not their problem.

&gt; But you should know that a lot of female-identified folks would also feel that their desires are incredibly invalidated by your comments.

Although, male-identified people will very likely have their thoughts and feelings invalidated by these sort of remarks, making reductive comments will also make many female-identified folks feel invalidated as well. I cannot speak for all female-identified people nor all feminists who embrace sex positivity, but your reductive comments are likely to leave many female-identified folks feeling complicit in misogyny. And that's not acceptable.

If that's not how you feel, then you should be more critical of how you express yourself. If that is how you feel, then I think you need to spend some time actually listening to female-identified people, instead of totally ignoring their (equally-valid) perspectives.

4029,12294,"I agree with you on the optics point. The message should not be watered down as this IS a male issue. However, I think the top commenter was just trying to ascertain whether we are talking about ""immutable male characteristics"" or ""patriarchy and toxic masculinity"". Being that over 300 people upvoted the top commenter, its clearly a concern for many feminists. What's perhaps more concerning is that rather than immediately being answered with ""of course its not about immutable characteristics"" we get this patronizing post about how feminism shouldn't be watered down and accusations of ""tone policing"".

I didn't see any arguments for watering down feminism, I mostly saw everyone (including the top commenter) agreeing with the OP but just like we do not say ""Black people commit most crime"" and then leave the room or worse, say that its a ""black issue"" without explaining the socioeconomic reasons, we do not say ""Men commit most rape"" then leave the room or worse, say that its a ""male issue"" without explaining that patriarchy and toxic masculinity causes this.

Well, I mean, you can, but in my view this is an extremely reactionary take and if I wanted that then I'd just go listen to fascist propaganda.

In fact, fascists use this exact strategy, they never openly say they are racists, they just say ""haven't you noticed Jews occupy these powerful positions?"" or ""Black people have lower IQs, its just science bro, I'm not a racist"".

So yeah, ""rape is a male issue, its cause by patriarchy and toxic masculinity."" is much better than ""rape is a male issue, I'll leave the rest to your imagination."".

As she gets older, share your feelings to normalize this further. Men feel too! Apologize when you’re wrong. You can’t be perfect but you can show her that adults make mistakes too. Explain how anger makes people do things they shouldn’t and teach simple age appropriate coping mechanisms (my 8 year old makes bracelets when she’s upset). Teaching emotional regulation and respectful behaviour to children will allow them to be themselves when they’re older and realize that they deserve respect regardless of their feelings and emotions (which is something that society does not always teach).

Fashion, make up, and hair styling fall victim to the same thing as many other stereotypical ""feminine"" creative pursuits. They're seen as ""frivolous"", silly, pointless, etc. But it's just incredibly human to want to decorate your face and body.

Every choice a woman makes will be dissected and discussed endlessly. Especially by herself. 

Wearing make up is not bad. Judging people for not refusing to wear make up is bad.

I guess my point boils down to the fact that on this specific space, we should assume most posters are good-willed and genuinely want to share these stories to help.

4109,12406,"1. I did not accuse you of condoning Catholicism or any of the other things you believe I accused you of. 

2. Your original post said that the only reason this article was written was because of an irrational hatred towards Muslims.

Now think about that. Think about it. How would the victims feel if you told them that the only reason we’re sharing their stories is because we hate Muslims? 

I think the issue here is that you don’t understand how a lot of Muslim women and Ex-Muslim women feel when they have westerners like you decrying and invalidating any criticism of Islam. We should be able to criticize Islam and when you say things like “the only reason I can possibly think of...” for the article and for Feminists who care about this, you’re essentially telling Muslim women and women who fall victim to parts of institutionalized Islam that they should be quiet because Western people are bad.

Essentially, the subject here, in this particular time shouldn’t be “lets think about how the West sucks”, it should be strictly focused on thinking of ways to combat the issues the women and girls are facing as written in the article.

Even if you don’t mean to, you’re silencing the stories of certain women by applying criticism.

FACT: society was built by men. You and I live in society.

FACT: we sent a MAN to the moon. If women were really equal, then women would have gone to the moon. But they didn't, because they can't.

FACT: women are a biological remnant of inferior genetics. When the y chromosome mutated, it gave rise to superior genes, making men bigger and stronger than women. If women were really equal, they could do sports, open jars unassisted and lift more than one bucket at a time. But they can't.

FACT: whenever women get into a profession, it causes the average salary of that profession to go down. This is because women are objectively less valuable then men.

FACT: Women are more racist. Color blindness is a recessive gene located on the x chromosome. Women have two x chromosomes, meaning they are often just carriers of the gene. Therefore, women are less likely to be color blind, and significantly more likely to SEE COLOR.

FACT: there are men who want sex to pass on their superior genetics are selfishly kept from doing so by women. If women were good people, they would democratize their vaginas, but they aren't. The fact is, the only reason why women still exist is because men would be g*y without them. No homo.

4201,12541,"Vaginal-fluid transplants appeared to successfully treat devastating vaginal conditions that had failed all other treatments options, according to a small pilot study published this week in Nature Medicine.

The study comes amid a gush of enthusiasm for the transplants, often dubbed vaginal microbiota transplants (VMTs). Though researchers are only now getting down to investigating their potential, many are optimistic that the microbe-toting fluid swaps will prove broadly successful at treating swaths of conditions in more rigorous trials.

In a recent conceptual study on screening potential fluid donors, Johns Hopkins researchers suggested that the transplants could “revolutionize the way we view and treat conditions affecting the female reproductive tract.”

With the mood set, a team of Israeli researchers had been working on a first exploratory trial since 2014. The trial included five women (aged 27 to 47), who all suffered from intractable cases of bacterial vaginosis (BV) but were otherwise healthy. BV is a condition marked by alterations to the microbial communities that typically reside in the vagina, which can lead to a range of problems—from malodorous vaginal discharge to increased risks of upper-genital-tract infections and pregnancy complications, as well as greater susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections.

The women had experienced at least four bouts of symptoms from their condition in the previous year and endured repeated antibiotic regimens to try to kick the condition without success. They all reported that their BV had significant effects on their lives, including harming their relationships and self-esteem.

Microbial migration

Those BV patients were treated with microbe-laden vaginal fluids collected from three rigorously screened donors. The three volunteers (aged 35 to 48) submitted extensive medical records, had no history of BV, tested negative for sexually transmitted infections and other conditions, and reported no use of various medications. All reported abstaining from sexual activity for at least a week prior to donating—two reported they had been sexually inactive for eight or more years, and one was in a 25-year monogamous relationship.

Analysis of their vaginal fluids suggested healthy vaginal microbial communities, which are typically dominated by Lactobacillus. In general, vaginal microbiomes are considered less complex and variable than those found in the intestines, despite also playing critical roles in health.

All of the transplant recipients were primed for the donor fluids with an intravaginal antibiotic regimen. The fluids were then transplanted within 60 minutes of collection.

Two of the recipients showed long-term BV remission after just one transplant. They reported improvement in symptoms within one week of the procedure and stayed in remission for their follow-up periods, which lasted up to 11.5 months. Two others ended up undergoing three transplants before achieving complete remission through their follow-up periods, which lasted up to 21 months. Genetic analyses suggested that the recipients’ vaginal microbiomes had shifted to look more like the donor communities.

The last recipient only achieved a partial resolution of BV, but her case was complicated by a throat infection that required her to take oral antibiotics after her first transplant. After that treatment, her BV symptoms returned. She underwent another transplant, which improved her symptoms and clinical signs of BV. But, at 6.5 months of follow-up, her vaginal microbial communities looked like a mix of her original community and the donor community.

“Collectively,” the authors conclude, “we report the feasibility of using VMT as a long-term treatment for recurrent, antibiotics-nonresponsive, and intractable BV.”

Now, with safety and benefits documented, “the efficacy of VMT as a treatment in intractable BV needs to be determined in randomized, placebo-controlled trials.” Currently, there are at least two such trials in the works.

'Protecting women' has often been an excuse to oppress women, and this is no different.

What's more 'protecting cis women' can be used as a wedge to get trans women and cis women on opposite sides.

But, you don't get to deplatform and shout them down for disagreeing, nor can they do that to you.

4286,12675,"Explanation: This phenomenon occurs in the sky over our heads, not the sea. It is a type of lightning known as red sprite, and rarely has it ever been photographed in this detail. Even though sprites have been recorded for over 30 years, their root cause remains unknown. Some thunderstorms have them, but most don't. These mysterious bursts of light in the upper atmosphere momentarily resemble gigantic jellyfish. A few years ago high speed videos were taken detailing how redsprites actually develop. The featured image was captured last month in high definition from Italy. One unusual feature of sprites is that they are relatively cold -- they operate more like long fluorescent light tubesthan hot compact light bulbs. In general, red sprites take only a fraction of a second to occur and are best seen when powerful thunderstorms are visible from the side.(APOD)",MistWeaver80,2019-10-08 13:55:29,2019-10-08 13:55:30,/r/Feminism/comments/df09tm/sprite_lightning_known_as_red_sprite_in_hd_credit/f2zzom9/,t3_df09tm,Feminism,1,0,2019-10-08 13:55:30,0.00054,0.0,3e-05,9e-05,0.00015,2e-05,2e-05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My main point was that mens only organisations and clubs have existed for a long time so there shouldn't be a problem having womens only groups, though I do think that gender is a social construction and that if everyone on the whole cared about gender less then we wouldn't need to split things divided along gender lines any more than we don't need to split things along ethnic or age lines. 

But marginalised groups deserve to have safe spaces where they can have solidarity and talk about problems and not have to worry about being discriminated against in those spaces. This goes for any group like sexual assault victims, elderly people, lgbt people, women, people of colour.

They were though, by trying to downplay Gay Pride.

And I'd completely disagree again. For context, I'm a heterosexual guy, as a kid was bullied and accused of being gay and had ""friends"" who wanted to play ""smear the queer"" with me. Just being labelled as ""gay"" is enough for the victimization of non-LGBT folks as well. And honestly, if the opposition to my voice is, ""It's okay to mistreat others because that's how it's always been done"" then it doesn't have to be heard.

4309,12699,"The problem with things like ""Straight Pride"" or anything else similar is that you do have a very, very long history of homophobia in human history. The fact that homosexuality or being suspected of being a homosexual meant things like being executed or chemically castrated in various points in history means that there was oppression of LGBT folks by bigoted non-LGBT folks. Needless to say, no one is saying it's wrong or disgusting to be heterosexual but you still have people getting attacked for being gay or trans or being asexual or whatever that isn't just cisgendered heterosexual.

To say ""Straight Pride"" even though heterosexuals have never been systemically oppressed on the level that LGBT people have is at best really silly and at worst down right malicious, which trolling usually is. The ""it's just a troll"" defense doesn't work here because people who believe LGBT people are ruining things are going to jump in to and try to ruin things for people who are often marginalized. And it's the same thing when talking about race or gender for that matter.

I already know about MensLib but we need more of that throughout the Internet.

You don't even have buy books or anything special like that, just take advantage of videos like Pop Culture Detective if you just need a basic overview of problematic male behavior and ideals. Ask women in your life about their experiences with men. I learned from my own mom that when she was little, she dealt with a little boy who punched her in the face all the time because ""he liked her"" and her teeth are still a little messed up now, just as an example of what I've done. Learn about women throughout history and take note of how men treated them. Consider current events too, and look at it through the lens of, ""How are the men behaving?"".

We have as much agency as women do to work on our behavior and we have a massive advantage over feminists of the past because they didn't have a massive library of different schools of feminist thought in their (tiny) pockets.

This guy probably doesn’t care that much about most women but I would bet he knows someone who is/was fighting breast cancer and is showing the only version of support he can really understand. Also adding humor to traumatic situations is a very normal coping mechanism that many women also use in this exact circumstance.

Some women I've talked to had them removed with zero fucks given. Others had a much harder time with it. Some women had reconstruction afterwards and everything was fine, some couldn't have reconstruction because of how severely the tissue was damaged.

Fair enough.

To nitpick a little, I'm tired of this narrative. OBVIOUSLY, no one is pro-abortion in the sense that they just want pregnancies aborted whether they're wanted or not, just because they're so in love with aborting. It's ALWAYS only about abortions where they're needed!

The narrative here almost seems to be making it out to be an even *choice* of either having the baby or aborting. Like women just roll the dice. ""Abortion, it is, this time! That's my choice.""

Abortions are done when the pregnancy is *unwanted*. Not unplanned, maybe a little inconvenient but ok, whatever. When they're *unwanted*! It's unconscionable to *force* a woman through pregnancy, so *there is no other choice* but to abort, in these cases. To advocate to make abortion safe, affordable and accessible in these cases, I think, could rightly just be called pro-abortion advocacy. I'm pro-abortion. Shame on anyone who twists this to mean I just want abortions for abortions' sake.

All these people in the comments that feel the need to say ""*Yeah, *I* wouldn't get an abortion (implication: because it's bad and sad to get one and I'm morally a better person than one who would get an abortion?) but others may make that (bad and sad) choice.*"" are still internalizing the anti-abortion narrative that it's practically, kinda sorta, not entirely unlike murder.

It's a medical procedure that concerns women (not potential future babies. Women!) and women shouldn't feel shame for having it done if they need it!

&gt; A place where cowards with cultural authoritarian and pro-censorship leanings go to in order to evade criticism and calling out of whatever absurd ideas they may express, as well as ideas that are even slightly opposed to the safe space dweller's ideas. These are labelled as whatever kind of bigotry would make the safe space dweller look like a victim the most.

&gt; An imaginary place where overly-sensitive twats retreat to, when they are ""assaulted"" with ideas that contradict the narrative that was ingrained into their feeble minds.

&gt; A place where college students can go if they have been subjected to ideas that differ from the progressive narrative. These safe spaces have pillows, soothing music and an understanding, sympathetic staff. Presumably, this allows them to recover from the trauma; free from any lasting damage resulting from exposure to ideas that conflict with their leftist professors.
