I could just assume they'd be respectful, good partners... and they would be.

The only reasons we ever broke up were because we had different goals or just weren't compatible in some *non-abusive* way. Like for instance, in one case one of us wanted children and the other didn't. In another case we realized we had goals that meant we wouldn't ever be able to live in the same place once we both followed our career paths. In another case she was in medical school and we both just realized that she was at a place in her life where romantic relationships were too distracting. 

We *all* still respected each other and had positive feelings about how the relationship went once it was over. 

Whereas with men, to get something like that, you have to ""test them out"" and dump soooo many of them.

Did I end up with a man? Yeah. But that surprises me whenever I really think about it. I always thought every man would fail miserably at some point... I was still willing to give them a chance but... it was very surprising to me when one was able to meet all my standards and expectations.

What I‚Äôve noticed from some women is that they‚Äôve started using birth control as a bargaining chip to get men to commit to them. Dropping hints that they're on birth control in hopes that if he sleeps with them raw, he'll eventually want a relationship. False. Men do not care about their health and safety. They will give you a soft commitment just to be able to have sex without a condom. 

Recently, a friend of mine went on birth control and gave the man she's dating a play-by-play of when she'd be getting on it. 

She told him ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre having sex with other people, please use condoms‚Äù Expecting him to express an interest in committing. 

His response: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sleeping with anyone else right now, but I‚Äôll use condoms if I do. Good point.‚Äù Now she's essentially promised him raw sex and given him the a-okay to sleep with others. But in her mind, this is a good sign.

\- Does your boyfriend accuse you of cheating on him with your friends and you have given him no reason to do so?

\- Is he secretive and accuses you of it?

\- Does he call you out on traits you have never had on your own, but he actually has? My narcissistic ex has always called me out on being cunning and this is the last thing I am, really.

\- Another recent Tinder date told me out of the blue ""be honest with me from the start, it will give you the best results"". Guess what, down the line I found out he was the biggest liar I have ever met on this platform and that probably means something.

Hi everyone, first post here and hope you like it. This is not  really scientific, just musings on social behavior and hormones. I wanted to write this because a lot of people have the misconception that women being ""strong"" means men have to be ""weak."" Sure, people of any gender can choose to be masculine or feminine (you do you!) but I am speaking more of assertiveness and what is described in the definition of a High Value Man post. That post struck me, as it is what I strive to be and what I look for in friends and a man (yes, I treat my best girl friends to dinner sometimes). 

So, this article here gave me some hope because I often encounter men who are aggressive or passive-aggressive but have to dig a bit to find the assertive ones. A lot of people bemoan ""men aren't allowed to be men anymore!"" And ""we are forcing boys to be feminine."" I don't think so. I think men and boys are still aggressive but maybe have adopted more passive-aggressive methods to be more socially acceptable. I think women are also sold a lie that they have to act ""masculine"" to earn respect. Men who are strong will not have to be passive-aggressive or outright aggressive. 

Passive-aggressive is almost worse because the behavior is so weak (won't tell you what they want, won't tell you their opinions, ""yes-dear,"" boring conversation, will not open up and show their opinions, etc.). Then they eventually turn it around and get in little negs/digs because they are grown-ass people who refuse to learn how to communicate. Mind you, I am a very gentle person and years ago tried to build up someone like this. No dice. The self-pitying on their end (for no reason) got old and I felt so tired, like an emotional caretaker. From what I witnessed, such passive-aggressive dudes are often looking for ""a girlfriend"" and don't seem to see YOU as a person. You are in the box of ""this is what a girlfriend is supposed to be like"" and any of your actual opinions are given a ""yes dear"" while being ignored. These dudes might have porn-induced ED in their early 20s and have no desire to correct it, or throw subtle shade at the girlfriend. A passive-aggressive dude can make you feel hurt and disrespected while also guilt-tripping you and making you wonder if you really are the problem. It is not henpecking to say ""please just tell me what you want/have an opinion!."" A guy like this may be unscientifically labeled Low-T, especially if they don't seem to be passionate about anything and life life with the least resistance. 

On the other hand, you have outwardly aggressive dudes. They may tell you their opinions, but often their opinions are shit (e.g. misogynistic, hobby gatekeeping, puts you down, says what you like is stupid). Basically more obvious characteristics of an abusive relationship and thinks similarly to the passive-aggressive guy but is more open about it. The aggressive type may hide behind ""manliness"" or hyper-masculine interests (""I'm just a man, so while I am intellectually superior to you I am also a slave to my penis and all my shit behavior can be excused. Do 2x as more as me and maybe you will be worthy of mildly pleasing me""). It's very unhealthy and probably a recipe for high blood pressure. Such a dude may be armchair diagnosed as high-T. 

Do women do the above behaviors? Yes. But, this sub is aimed at women, hence I am speaking to a heterosexual woman audience. Both types of above behavior are unhealthy and will destroy the person doing the behavior and the people around them. 

So, where does the testosterone fit in? Yes, everyone has it and there are stereotypes. I have caught shit in the past for being into stereotypically ""high-T"" dudes. Those with a personality, values, passion, high sex drive, and protectiveness. Some have told me I am expecting too much for them to act decent, and I need to expect some aggressive behavior. Some have said they are going to act like assholes with high T. Well, voila, the above article says T can act as a protective oxytocin-like factor. A feminine woman like myself LOVES it when a dude is protective like I am over my friends (""they said WHAT to you? You are awesome and they suck""). I have male friends who have ""high T"" behavior and are not afraid to tell me men who have disrespected me don't deserve excuses and trust. They are willing to call out bad behavior when it happens. My ex oozed testosterone and treated me better than anyone else. He never made excuses for dudes who were misogynistic or treated others like shit (the relationship fell apart for other reasons). They are out there, ladies!! 

Thank you for being such a positive community and reinforcing our right to be treated like we treat others. You are enough and deserve everything and more. &lt;3",37914,High-Testosterone Men - Assertive Behavior?,0,,

It is truly a wealth of knowledge. I took WAY too many notes to share here but there was one section in particular I feel is important for everyone to know. The section on what's called survival signals.

These were mostly mentioned in relation to being approached by strangers. Obviously if you're already in the dating stage with someone many of these won't apply but if you're being cold approched these can signal when you might be dealing with a predatory person.

1. Forced teaming: this tactic is used to establish premature trust. Saying 'we' are part of the same team, group, ect. The victim will feel obliged to go along after they feel this phony connection. The best defense: make a clear refusal to the concept of accepting premature partnership. 

2. Charm and niceness: charm is an ability with a motive. To charm is to compel and to control with allure. Charm is a verb not a personality trait. Remember that unsolicited niceness often has a discoverable motive.

3. Too many details: when people are telling the truth they don't feel doubted. Even if it sound credible to you, *it doesn't to them*, so they keep talking. Every type of con relies on distracting us from the obvious. The best thing you can do is occasionally stop and remind yourself of your relationship to the people around you. Bring the context of the situation into conscious thought.

4. Type casting: the book defines this as when ""A man labels a woman in a slightly critical way, hoping she'll feel compelled to prove his opinions not accurate."" It's always a slight insult, usually one that's easy to refute by doing what he wants. This is basically what the manosphere calls ""negging"". It's a straight predator move. They often don't even believe what they say but they believe it will work. Don't let it!

5. Loan sharking: this is when they try to push help onto you in some small way to put you into their debt. This exploits the victims sense of obligation and fairness. Keep in mind that if their help was not asked for explicitly then you owe them nothing. 

6. Unsolicited promise: this is one of the most reliable signals because it's nearly always of questionable motive. Promises are used to convince us of good intentions, but they are not guarantees. They risk nothing by offering empty words. Ask yourself, why does this person need to convince me? 

7. Discounting the word no: I personally think this one is the most important. A person's actions are more important than words. Never let a person negotiate after you say no. That person chooses not to hear it. They are either seeking control or refusing to relinquish it. The worst thing you can do in this situation is give ever weakening refusals and then give in. That's because the predator is ""interviewing"" you too see if you're a good candidate. You're teaching them you'll give in if pressured enough. Having strong boundaries is the most important thing you can do for your safety.",37912,The gift of fear,0,,

I just joined the sub and I‚Äôm LOVING the empowerment I‚Äôm seeing on here. I really wish I had known about you guys during the 8 year relationship I spent with a guy who cheated, lied and took me for granted. 

Right now I‚Äôm looking for advice as I‚Äôm back on the dating scene for the first time since I was just 18 years old. There‚Äôs a man I work with that I have very strong feelings for. He‚Äôs a man of integrity, honest, kind and generous. And we have so much in common and get along so well. But he‚Äôs really wishy-washy about his feelings for me. He‚Äôs a great friend to me but some days he acts like we‚Äôre just buddies, for example, one time he walked me home from the bar (about 45 minute walk) then when I invited him in he said he had an early morning and immediately took a cab home. But then other days we spend hours hanging out and flirting, he puts his arm around me and kisses me on the cheek, texts to say goodnight, etc. 

I‚Äôve been pretty open about my feelings for him, but he seems like a closed book when it comes to romantic stuff. I straight up told him that I have a crush on him and would like to know if I‚Äôm barking up the wrong tree, and he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on‚Äù. So I told him to just let me know if he feels the same way, and he said ‚ÄúGame on.‚Äù

Can you guys please tell me if I‚Äôm wasting my time, or if he‚Äôs wasting mine, or if I should keep trying to open him up? I‚Äôm so confused because I‚Äôve never met someone so intelligent yet so unintelligible!",37882,Really new to FDS and need your advice,0,,

I've been talking to this guy for a couple of months now, he's 36. We first started talking when he was in a different state with plans to move to my state, which he did a few weeks ago. But I work ~70 hours a week and he lives in a cabin in the woods 45 minutes outside of my city but he works in my city.

We haven't met yet for circumstances (I had some health stuff and working a lot, he was trying to get on his feet). He came to my city kind of on the fly with very little savings and made it clear he would be struggling financially for a while, but he's also alluded to constantly struggling financially prior which is a big red flag for me because he has a full time job so I dont get why he would struggle if not for just immaturity and irresponsible spending. I'm extremely frugal and hate wasting money. 

So anyway, he has been offering to make me dinner at his house for our first meeting but I am nervous meeting someone in their home for the first time. Plus it's far and the weather has been really bad and he complains about his commute all the time so idk why he would push me to go out there if it's such a shitty drive. I told him today I could meet up in town after he gets off work, and he said ""I'd like that. But I'll warn ya, I'm dead broke. And I get paid on Friday.""

So basically I either go to his house in the woods 45 minutes out of town, or pay for dinner. I don't know what to do. I don't want to set myself up to always be the financially responsible one because I've done that in the past and was taken advantage of and I truly believe men don't respect women who immasculate them financially. I don't want to invite him to my house because I don't sleep with men on the first (or second or third...) date and I feel like he would expect that. What should I do?",37882,Need advice on a date,0,,

I have seen and heard a lot of dissent as to the standards this sub promotes that essentially comes down to some variation of ‚ÄúIf men have the option not to pay with other women why would they go with a woman who demands it?‚Äù This also applies to our other standards. I have even seem some anxiety over this within our community, so here is a little refresher: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Men like women who have standards.** Having standards demonstrates your worth. You teach people how to treat you. Does your mans dream girl settle for bread crumbs? No, she demands excellence. 
2. **If he genuinely likes you he will want to do things for you.** Today the coworker I sit next to was slack-jawed that the guy I‚Äôve been seeing texted me out of the blue to see if he could book a massage for me. If a man likes someone they will want to do things that make that person happy (shocker).
3. **The value of sex is simply higher for women and should be treated as such.** This is a part of required reading but should be reread often as a reminder: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d22vzv/given\_that\_the\_risks\_of\_sex\_are\_way\_higher\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d22vzv/given_that_the_risks_of_sex_are_way_higher_and/)
4. **Having a mans investment in you will contribute to how much he values you.** Investing includes financially, with his time and with his emotions (which should be translated into actions). You are a lot more likely not to care properly for something that was low-cost than something high-cost. If the expensive ring you bought starts to rust, you‚Äôre more likely to take it to the jeweler and ensure you do not lose it than a cheap ring which you may just as well toss out. I believe this applies even if the items are of similar quality due to the loss aversion principal. Similarly if he has put a lot of time, money and effort into you - he will not be so willing to discard you and the investment he has made. (Additionally, we here pride ourselves on being and becoming quality, high-value women.) 
5. **There are always more men.** Even if you think you are losing out on a great guy you get along with- if he doesn‚Äôt meet your standards, it is a big wide world, there is another great guy you‚Äôll get along with who exceeds your standards.
6. **Most importantly, you are better off alone than with someone who does not meet your standards.** Male/female relationship norms are completely designed to cater to the man's interest. A part of this means that women have been so socialized to see commitment from men as a win that men have gotten away with brining little else to the table, despite the fact that this goes purely against their interest (there are many statistics that point to this fact). It is never worth sacrificing your self-worth to cater to a man‚Äôs comfort or interest. Being un-partnered is not a failure, trashing your self-worth for a man who doesn‚Äôt meet your standards is a failure. 

This sub is meant to be a community to help us counter a system that was very much built against us, a system that was made for the comfort of men largely at our expense. You do not need to feel guilty that you need rules, tactics or a community like this to try to make this largely patriarchal system work for you.",37878,Why having high standards will never work against you! ‚ÄúIf men have the option not to pay with other women why would they go with a woman who demands it?‚ÄùHere is Why.,0,,

And watching her pathetic behavior, while loving her and wishing she wouldn't do it, left a very serious impression on me.

I was in my early twenties and she was in her early thirties. We became friends because we shared a hobby. 

Separate from the hobby, she was very involved in the local music scene - as a groupie.

She viewed men in bands as HVMs for some reason I still don't understand. Bands are fine and all, but simply being in a band doesn't make a guy high value...

Anyway, she slept with a lot of the men in bands, and had been doing so since she was in her early twenties herself. 

One night she told me how cool this made her feel. ""They could take anyone home - all the girls want them - so when they choose me, it really means something.""

It hurt to hear that. It was truly pathetic. I don't mean pathetic like ""haha what a loser."" I mean pathetic like ""I don't even know how to quantify the level of pity I am feeling right now.""

I never, ever wanted to be like her. And yet she always implied that she was prettier, sexier, more appealing than me. (Why did I stay friends with her? Because I was young and dumb and felt sorry for her and loved her.)

Our friendship ultimately dissolved because she tried to get a man I was dating to sleep with her. 

From her side, she would never talk to me again because he rejected her and then immediately came to me and told me, and that was a level of humiliation she couldn't bear. She hadn't been picked, even though she had tried so hard to be sexy. She'd wanted proof that she was better than me. She didn't get it.

From my end - well, obviously I wouldn't stay friends with a friend who tried to convince my boyfriend to cheat. But she didn't make me face that choice, because she was the one who sent me a text saying my boyfriend must have been gay if he didn't fuck her and she felt sorry for me that I had a gay boyfriend and she never wanted to hear from me again.

Though she'd sometimes implied unkind things, she'd never been explicitly mean to me before. So I was a mess over it. It really sucked.

She is, I think, a prime example of the most extreme end of the Pick Me mentality: so desperate to be picked that being picked is all you can think about, since you hate yourself any time you are not being picked, and any time somebody else *is* being picked.",37876,"This sub made me remember a ""pick me"" I used to be friends with",0,,

Despite what all the male lurkers in my inbox said (before they told me to eat glass, get raped and die), I am not a man hater. In fact, I love men. That's the point of FDS, right? To find a high quality man and be a high quality woman? But lately, the more I read, the more I see how extremely sexist and vile and hateful men are, I'm starting to... hate them a little bit. Every time I hear a rapist walks free of get another message of a man telling me to kill myself because I posted a Lizzo meme, I'm just finding myself wanting to be around them less and less. 

I've even had a few date offers from men at my work or friends of friends but in my mind I'm just worried that they're secretly ""one of them"", asshole men with hateful views of women who blame women for everything, are rape apologists and keyboard misogynists. I don't even want to be around them anymore.

I've been raped, molested, hit by men, stalked, assaulted and it never got to me until recently that men just don't care that we go through that. I had it in my mind that most men are ""good"" and the bad ones were rare but I'm starting to feel like the inverse is true. The bad ones are monsters and the ""good"" ones are aware of the problem and just don't care.

You need to LIE, yes LIE and say that you have relatives in your city. Make him think your father, brothers, and/or male cousins are around. Especially your father. 

LVM love hearing that you don't have any platonic male figures in your life that could straighten him out once he starts acting wrong. This is the same reason why LVM like to actively work to destroy your relationships with platonic guy friends and your male work colleagues. The less males in your life who actually care about you, can give you good advice,  and don't want sex from you, the better, for the LVM.

I don't care if you have actually just moved to some place, you need to make it seem like you have a solid support system  already in place.

**Your male family members are the biggest obstacle, in a LVM's head, to go through before ruining your life.**

You absolutely have to tell him that your dad is around, and your brothers, and your male cousins. Talk about them often.

I met this guy. Your intellectual fuckboi, the most dangerous kind, the one you can't recognize right away from appearance or mannerisms.

So I talked to him all night on the phone, first day. Next day I was a bit upset after going to the same event as my ex, got home and he wanted to talk. We met during the night, had a walk, made out, went to my place and had sex.

I got so hooked on him. The sex was way better with him, he was just the second guy I had it with, I thought I would be having it only with my ex so it was like exploring a new world.

He also treated me nicely, when together. He was romantic, touchey, cute, we would hold hands and cuddle after doing it and then sleep together. He would send me cute messages almost daily, wishing me a good day.

So I fell head over heels for him in time. I could only think of him, and i didn't think of my ex anymore, which felt amazing. I sort of tried to be 'better' this time. I didn't want to be the clingy girlfriend anymore, so it didn't bother me when the new guy would take hours and hours to reply. 'oh he is busy, I have my own life I understand'

I tried to play the cool girl who doesn't get upset he takes a lot of time to respond. And I kept hoping he would ask me on dates. But we only had the cute messages, sometimes sext leading to a meeting, sometimes he would call me when he was grocery shopping. After like a month, he startes texting less. Takes a few days to reply to a message. I am getting very upset. I guess in my head I was treating it as a relationship even tho we were not together.

So I confessed. He told me after our first meetings he didn't feel a spark yet, but that I am part of the high value girls, something like that. After confessing he said he liked me and cared about me and I was special, but that he has some insecurities he didn't tell me about to 'protect me' and that he's told me from the start he wasn't looking for a relationship. A month passes by, I don't see him, he doesn't try to see me. He did text me that he dreamt of us together and how he was my boyfriend in that dream and anxious about my father who was driving us...

Now I want to see him and ask him again if he doesn't feel a spark. If he wants me to stay. I would've been willing for an open relationship as well, if I felt like he loved me. But I don't feel that. It hurts me anyway because I feel a friendship between us as well, and I can't get over him without cutting contact.  

He has said he still wants to look for someone better. I should've ended it at that, really. But somehow I can't. And when I'm one foot out the door, he comes back with a cute message. I did tell him to stop doing that and he did, for now...

I'm so stupid, aren't I? Honestly I've been feeling either so happy or so low these few months because of this.. In the first month I was so eager to do stuff, improve myself, I was doing all the right things so next time we talked I could brag about all of the cool stuff I did.. Nowadays I feel so unmotivated.. It doesn't help that my ex came back and I don't know what to do with him as well.

It's too much for me. I'm about to do something stupid and ask this ex-fwb if he wants me to stay. He has said in the past that the way I love is 'cute and pure, like how someone likes a person before they went through stuff in life and still have a pure mind' and that I am very kind and some people might take advantage of that..",37814,I'm a pick me..

But I think most of us know that it's actually hard to *do.*

I don't know if I've ever actually successfully done it - that is, I don't know if I've ever walked away from a breadcrumb-tossing, mind-fucking, bad-for-me fuckboy. I've dumped a couple of pieces of shit, but I came to dislike them, so it was easy. I once got fed up with one and met someone else, fell for the new guy and was cured of the fuckboyitis. 

But I have generally been addicted and unable to walk away so long as I could summon even a sliver of hope. More likely, I'd have to blow shit up so they'd dump me completely (and I'd often grovel for forgiveness just to test it, thus heaping further humiliation upon myself.) Then at least I could go lick my wounds and start to move on.

As I stand right now, I still have about half of my dignity. He's only very recently gone cold on me. I've messaged him (embarrassing!) but at least he replied. But I knew that it was him losing interest. I know exactly how things stand, 48 hours later. I know that the only way I can get back to something like peace and contentment is to get rid. 

I'd like to do that without blowing everything - including my pride - sky high. 

Those of you who have been where I am now and managed to walk away, please tell me exactly how you did it. Don't tell me *why*I should do it. I already know that. Please tell me what you did, yourself and how it went for you.

I knew what the guy was doing but I didn‚Äôt know it was common or not. Here‚Äôs the story:

5 years ago, I was a freshman in uni. I met a guy on tinder who seemed so great and we really clicked. He was a few years older, keep that in mind. We went out three times, third time we were making out at his place and he got hard and wanted to hook up, I didn‚Äôt want to have sex so I literally ran away lol. I think he got really mad because he pretty much ghosted me for a few weeks, and then started making plans with me and then ghosting me the day of! I definitely fell for those ‚Äúdates‚Äù twice. 

Anyways, after two times of him making plans and then ghosting I woke up and stopped talking to him. He would reach out every 3-4 months to say hi and ask to hang out but I stopped responding. Then about a year in he stopped messaging me. 

Fast forward to last year (about 4 years after we initially met) he messaged me on Facebook asking to go for dinner with him. We were never Facebook friends. He never even knew my last name so I have no clue how he found me. At this point he was maybe 27-28 since he‚Äôs older. I told him that he was creepy as hell and to stop messaging me, and he was so offended that HE blocked ME! Lol

That was by far the worst guy I‚Äôve ever met. It definitely seemed like he wanted to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù me or something. Is this breadcrumbing? Is this a guy dealing with his own personal trauma and is a sociopath?",37792,Does anyone have a similar experience of breadcrumbing?,0,,

After stalking this sub for a little bit, I have realized one thing: my dad is a HVM. As children, we learn much of our relationship standards from what we see from our parents, and that's why my standards are so high. My dad treats my mom like the HVW she is. 

My dad is the provider. Even though he works like a dog and puts me through school, when he comes home, he changes into something comfortable and goes to help my mom in the kitchen cooking dinner. He helps set up and clean up - he doesn't pull the old ""I am the MAN and I work, thus you should do all the cooking/cleaning/childcare."" No. He gets his ass up and helps because he is part of the household. My parents strongly emphasize the 'team' mentality. He helps my mom with the shopping, putting the groceries away, etc. When he's not working, he helps with the laundry and the cleaning.  He values her opinion and they share the burden on many things - such as financially, they mutually agree on how to take care of things.  My mom chose to be a homemaker on her own volition- he was supportive of her going back to work AND her staying home. Whatever she wants is what he wants too, he said. Teamwork is key and each partner gives and takes. They respect each other. I've had candid conversations with my mother, and my father has always been beyond respectful of her - never making her do anything she has not wanted to do, etc. 

HVM as a partner also translates to a high value father. Unlike so many other girls my age, my father never told me no 'because something is for boys.' He always supported me, when I was building rockets in middle in high school, he never complained, and drove me 2-3 hours to nearby launches. He helped my mom with childcare. My dad did his best when I was little to change my diapers, to read me to sleep, to give me baths, because he knew how exhausting it was for my mom. When I was older, I could come to him for anything and everything, and he still is my nonjudgemental moral compass. When I was on my period and had terrible cramps, he never made me feel bad or dirty. I could be open with him and say 'hey I need pads' or 'hey I have terrible cramps right now, I'm sorry I can't help mow the lawn.' It shocked me to hear other girls talk about their dads on a high school debate trip - how they made them feel ashamed of their bodies. Ladies, if your man is grossed out by your period, he will shame your daughter too for it. If it destroys your self-esteem, it will crush hers too, a man she is supposed to love and look up to telling her she is disgusting and small for something natural. 

The biggest HVM thing my dad has taught me is that cowardice is not acceptable in a man. I hate to use cliche terms, but men need to 'man up' in the face of struggles. My dad has made some mistakes, and I've seen some of their repercussions. Instead of running away like a coward, he faced them, apologized, said how he was going to fix it, and followed through. He takes no shit and gives none, and I respect that. Any coward can run away from a problem - take all those men who bail the second things get tough (e.g. when their wives have cancer, etc). It takes a true man to tough it out for those he loves and respect us enough to admit fault. 

Sorry for this long ass post, but I'm realizing: ladies, find a HVM like my dad. That's why I'm so picky - I am taking my time. I want a guy who loves and respects me like my dad has toward my mom, who is a real man. Take notes, men. This is how you become a HVM.

I really struggled throughout the relationship because we got along so well and he really cared about me and treated me well, but I never wanted to make out with him or have sex with him. So, I‚Äôve started going out and trying to interact with different people, and I‚Äôve also gone on some OLD Dates.

I didn‚Äôt find a sub until yesterday or the day before. I got on hinge on Saturday, and had a date set up for Saturday night and Sunday. Saturday night dude came out for drinks (I know now that‚Äôs not high effort, but he did drive one hour to see me while I only drove about eight minutes), I was not impressed with the conversation, or his know it all attitude, he paid for my wine and I left. The next day I went on a coffee date with another guy, this one didn‚Äôt even pay for my drink. After I left he tried to get me to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù with him again the same day, and sent me some photos of his ripped body, I guess to try and get me to want to Netflix and chill with him? I said no and the next day when he texted me again I told him I wasn‚Äôt interested in pursuing anything further.

Which brings me to my date last night. After I found the sub I sort of steered the conversation a little bit and we changed the date from drinks only to dinner. So the date was OK, and he paid, was interested in everything I had to say, remembered parts of my profile and things I mentioned in conversation before we met, was polite, paid for dinner, was respectful‚Ä¶ Asked me out again after we parted ways‚Ä¶ And I don‚Äôt know if I really want to? I wasn‚Äôt totally taken with his appearance, he is not in shape, he was wearing a baseball cap because he‚Äôs balding‚Ä¶ And I don‚Äôt know, am I supposed to give him a chance because he‚Äôs nice and respectful? I did that with my ex, and the attraction never came. Should I go out on one more date with him and see what happens? How do you deal with what seem like HVM that you don‚Äôt find physically attractive? 

And as an added note, I was married for 12 years before having to get back into dating again.

Well, the court date came and went. My APs girlfriend had filed a restraining order naming him as included in the order of protection. She falsely claimed I was just an obsessed woman who he didn't want anything to do with and that she believed I was so jealous of her that I was tampering with her car (we're neighbors). AP and I have had daily contact without interruption for more than a year. The past 12 days since I was served, he has pleaded with me to not dispute the order so that she didn't find out the truth. Up until the night before the hearing he was coming up to my house, despite my saying no, to proclaim how much he loved me and just needed time. Well, someone emptied both the oil and the coolant from my truck. Disconnected a bunch of hoses and essentially left me stranded. I couldn't make it to court. I was wrecked. Turns out, he actually drove her there himself. Today, he after a day of complete silence tells me he is pissed off at me and can't talk to me because of some bullshit I can't even remember. I was too stunned.

I'm pretty fucked up over it. And presumably nothing I can do now but learn a lesson. I really fucking loved the fucker, too.

It works well because if I end up not liking them, or awkward things happen, it's a good excuse out.  Other than that, I work nights, I love dancing/clubs/bars (for the intention OF dancing, not to meet people &amp; date or hook up), so I don't mind to meet with people there.  I favor ""chill"" spots so that there's not much expectation from me to have to be done up or hair done etc, and it seems like it would be more relaxing to meet people in this way.  

HOWEVER, I discovered this sub.  (Eventually you'll see more posts from me about my ex lol).  Now I have no idea how to try to get my thinking from how I was- relax, chill, no expectations.  To the dont-pay-for-dinner kind of person.  That idea was a hard one for me.  I am very much a pay my half or reach for the bill person because to me it showed independence.  That I do not need whoever I was going out to eat with, that they are an option and I can do fine without their help.  So I will pay for the food.  I also really am surprised at how much I liked reading through the reasoning behind not paying for the meal or even splitting it on here.  It is a foreign concept to me, but I am slowly understanding the reasons (about 95% there) behind why this is a good strategy to follow.  Now my issue is switching over from my thoughts, which is easier for me because I wake up at 430, can go eat/meet with someone, then head to work.  Or if I have a weekend off, I want to be dancing, so in my mind, I can meet someone there... but I also understand that the whole drinking/dancing/""getting to know each other,"" is probably not the best setting for that unless I don't want anything serious with them.

Anyway, just looking for some WWYD's here.  Also, I'm not closed off to new relationships but in preferences, I'm looking for guys that are more hey-lets-hang-outs rather than let's go on a date and aim for a marriage/relationship.

# How can I continue this relationship while dating other girls?

üì∑

I (24) have been dating her (25) for 6 years For a couple of months it was just sex and then we got together After two years I left her because she was too possessive (and I was too weak and not setting boundaries) but we continued being ‚Äúfriends‚Äù while having sex  
Now we‚Äôve been in that situation for around 3 years and we are really, really good friends. I don‚Äôt see her as a girlfriend. She‚Äôs my best friend She found out I dated other girls and she looked through my phone while I was asleep and saw many flirty messages with other girls and stuff like that The point is that I want her to be with me BUT I also want to have sexual relationships with other women She wants me just for herself... I have become an attractive man over the last few years and I want to enjoy my ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù

So I just found the pink pill after practically becoming a pickme-redpillwoman.
I've been chatting with this red pill guy for months and he even flew up to visit me. He of course expected me to play mother/servant/sex slave even though we barely knew each other. He is also obese but very handsome so I'll give him that. He's been degrading me trying to get me to ""hold myself accountable for being a whore"" because oh my god--I'm 29 and had sex/relationships before I met him...and yes he endlessly declares its the ""harsh truth"" because of ""all the semen in my DNA and pair bonding and evolutionary psychology and blah blah blah""...If I try to point out that I am not a mindless cavegirl and I am still capable of commitment and being healthy he says ""red flag"" and then if I try to be careless and casual he gets all needy and starts mentioning wanting a real relationship with me...yeah I think you all understand what a crazy narc this guy is. He also miraculously has a trail of ""crazy women with BPD"" behind him but apparently he never does anything wrong and is perfectly justified in his actions. His reason ""because most women are whores these days"".
So I open up Facebook today (which I rarely use) and low and behold: there's a message from a male model/bar owner who is probably the most handsome man I've seen irl and we had a friendly chat at his bar over a month ago. He found me on Facebook...sought me out and was offering to take me on a proper date.
And I missed his message (its a week old) and I did get back to him but I know it might be too late. Oh well, I just wanted to share because this is a real life lesson for me.
Don't give into the moids...they really are trying to drag you down and not only keep you away from potential HVM...but also yourself. 
And I don't have BPD but I definitely have PTSD from all this BS. But I can heal. I will be okay. Stay strong everyone.",39527,Lesson üëè Learned--Know Your Worth,0,,

He lives about an hour from me and has a suuuper elderly dog who could pass any day now, so he can't do much during the week. 

We text daily, nothing over the top, just keeping interest in each other. We've also talked on the phone. They're seems to be mutual attraction and we always have a great time. 

I last heard from him 2 dates ago, and it was pretty brief (our last date was Friday night).  I was the last one to text him in the convo, so I don't plan on reaching out until he does.

So what's messing with my mind, is that this is the guy who told me after our first date that he wasn't sure if I had a good time - that it was ""hard to tell"".  I told him that I did, and I was sorry if that wasnt clear, etc. I didn't start kissing his butt or anything either. I felt like maybe he was just a little insecure or nervous. 

Buuut my question is... Do you think he still thinks I'm not interested? To go from daily enthusiastic texting to 2 days of nothing seems odd to me. Is there something I should do to express interest, like a quick text? He's given me no red flags, he seems to be a great guy. I just don't want him to think I'm not interested.

\-we met on hinge. he told me that he doesn't want to dive into anything serious but isn't opposed to seeing where something goes longterm.

\-we texted all day every day for two solid weeks before our first date.

\-first date went insanely well, and i spent the night at his place. i know this might have been a bad idea to do this if i want something longterm with him, but i couldn't help myself. the way we interacted felt like we had been dating for years, and it felt super special and rare (he could be like this with everyone? but he's a pretty quiet, tech-y guy and doesn't seem like a player. then again, i don't trust men to not be fuckboys lmao).

\-he walked me to my subway stop the next morning (the opposite direction of where he was headed) and kissed me goodbye. he texted me immediately after we parted ways. i asked him what his intentions with me are, and **he gave the same answer he gave when we first started talking on the app, but said he wants to keep seeing me.**

\-he still texts me every day, and has asked to see me again this weekend (our first date was this past friday).

i've been waiting for him to text first (i don't double text), and waited for him to initiate making second date plans. he doesn't text me when he's at work, but he always texts me back.

my last relationship started over summer break when we were both students, so it was way easier to dive into something as we were free every day. does this sound normal for a guy with a full time job? does this have potential?",39502,Getting back out there?,0,,

I had no interest in dating after my husband passed away of cancer because he was such a beautiful man (inside and out) and perfect in every way. No man could ever compare to him so I was reluctant to even try to find another man. However, I recently turned 51 and am at that stage in my life where I'm thinking about the future and trying to plan for my retirement and elderly years. I don't want to die alone so I figured I'd finally get back into the market to find a companion. I spent the last year going on dates with LOTS  of losers before finally finding a good man. He is 5 years younger than me, 6'1"", has a full head of hair, has a great career, is a gentleman, and he is a great father who is very dedicated to his children (this is important to me because how involved a man is with his children post-divorce is indicative of what kind of person he is). After only three dates, he told me wanted to be exclusive. I felt like I hit the jackpot. I thought that at my age it would be almost impossible to find a good, attractive, educated, and financially stable man. I thought that I'd have to settle for a deadbeat loser with a lot of baggage. So I was very excited and perhaps a bit too eager to jump into a relationship. 

Anyway, me and this man have been dating for the last three months and things were amazing the first two months. I felt very giddy to be in a new relationship and felt myself falling in love. But by the third month, things started to change. The newness of the relationship started wearing off and I started seeing him for what he really is: a low value male. Don't get me wrong, he is a good man, but he is not a high value male despite his height, good looks, and financial success. He has a small penis (about 4 inches if I had to guess) and he is very vanilla in bed. He's not dominant or interesting at all. In fact, he is very beta behaving and expects me to dominate him and do most of the work. I don't mind doing some work in bed, but I prefer a dominant man who takes charge in the bedroom. I told him I want him to be more dominant in bed, but he's not able to deliver. Even when he tries to behave differently in bed, it feels unnatural and awkward and turns me off. But even if he could act dominant in bed, he would be useless anyway because his penis is so small. So there is nothing that can be done to fix this. 

There are other things I don't like about him. For example, he plays video games which is a loser thing to do. What kind of 46 year old man, especially an educated doctor, wastes his time playing childish games in his spare time? It's a big turn off. Sometimes when I spend the night at his house we will watch a movie, cuddle, have sex, and then he wants to go play videos before coming to bed to sleep. I just don't understand it. He's a manchild. 

Despite being educated, he acts like an uncivilized cowboy. He sometimes eats with his mouth open. On a recent date we went out to get ice cream and while we were sitting down eating our ice cream, we were having a conversation and he was talking with the ice cream melting out of his mouth down his chin. I told him it was disgusting and to close his mouth while he eats. He got a little offended and asked me why I'm being mean. I told him I'm not being mean, but I didn't sign up to date a cowboy. Something else that is trashy behavior is that he doesn't dress very classy. He often takes me on dates wearing extremely casual attire. Sometimes he even wears flip flops which is very nasty because I don't want to see his hairy toes and ugly feet. How can someone think it's acceptable to take a woman on a date dressed like that? He only dressed fancy the first few dates, and then unleashed his real fashion sense which is bad. 

But the FINAL STRAW which made me break up with him two nights ago is when he was staying over at my house and he kicked my Husky out of bed. I have a king sized bed with plenty of room for two people and a dog to sleep in it. I also take my Husky to the groomer once a week and I wash his paws every day before letting him get in bed to make sure he doesn't make my bed dirty.  So there is no reason that my dog would have to sleep on the floor. He has his own bed on the floor, but he prefers to sleep in my bed, and I also prefer to sleep next to him because he is a beautiful and sweet dog. He also loves to cuddle and his fur keeps me warm at night. His presence never affected our sex life so that's not an excuse either. I always kicked the dog out of the room to have sex. But why wouldn't he be allowed to come back after? It's not as if my ex boyfriend is allergic to dogs. He said that I treat my dog like more of a boyfriend than I treat him. But that's not true. He is just insecure and controlling which is evidence of him being a low value male. I will not kick my beautiful boy out of bed for ANY man, especially not a low value one.

Anyway, I kicked him out of bed after that and told him to go home and never contact me again. He got upset and couldn't believe I would make such a big deal out of his distaste for my dog. I explained to him that it's not just the dog, that it's actually a LOT of things, but the dog incident was just my breaking point. He asked me what else is the problem. I told him sex was a BIG problem. He begged me to give him another chance and told me that I can teach him how to be better. I said ""Honey, there is nothing to teach"" implying he has a small penis. He ended up leaving and we haven't spoken since. 

TL;DR - The moral of the story is NEVER LOWER YOUR STANDARDS and NEVER SETTLE even when you are 40+. Just because you're older, doesn't mean you need to be desperate and settle for someone who doesn't tick all your boxes. There's nothing wrong with being alone. I'm actually happier alone. My dog gives me all the company I need. I also have my friends and my adult children. Men, at this point, are just pests. Unless they have something spectacular to offer me, they aren't worth my time.",39494,I refuse to kick my dog out of bed for a low value male (Never settle--even in your 50s!),0,,

You would have invested in him, supported him (either financially and/or emotionally) as he advanced his career just for him to dump you for a woman who never had to work to earn his commitment in the first place. He would basically treat you as a bench warmer. 

There is an additional layer to this if you are a woman of color, whether you're dating someone of your own race or another race.

The amount of men on OLD that try to get you to come to their house or propose a really shitty date like drinks near their house. I honestly think they treat OLD like a sex delivery. They see it as the easiest way to get a lay, and are hoping for as minimal effort as possible. This is why they don't even care whether they like the person that much and ask hardly any questions about personality. They like to start with witty banter, and then think they are so smart by sliding in a little flirty conversation. Sometimes ending with a dick pic as they are so desperate.

I recently came across an psych article about attachment styles and risky sexual behavior that made me reflect on my past. (Link to article at the bottom.)

Last year and for a number of years prior, I exhibited a mix of anxious attachment (demanding, insecure, distrustful, needy) and avoidant (disconnected, emotionally unavailable and shallow). I bounced between the two not knowing where a healthy relationship existed or how to even begin one since I was overall distrustful of dating and men (rightfully so, especially in my industry). 

After over a year of therapy, I‚Äôm no longer engaging in the ‚Äúrisky sexual behavior‚Äù that got me in trouble so many times. I‚Äôve learned to value myself and say ‚Äúno‚Äù to men who raise red flags instead of chasing and trying to change them. 

A lot of the characteristics described in this group as well as ‚ÄòWhy Men Love Bitches‚Äô describe a woman who exhibits secure attachment aka someone who doesn‚Äôt need anyone else to feel whole. 

A securely attached person isn‚Äôt afraid of setting boundaries and walking away if those boundaries are broken because she knows her worth. A securely attached person isn‚Äôt afraid to love or fearful of being heart broken because she knows she‚Äôll always have an endless love for herself. 

It‚Äôs not easy existing in secure attachment, especially if you‚Äôve had so much stimuli confirming that the world sucks and men are horrible, but I think we owe it to ourselves to feel secure and whole so that we don‚Äôt have to exist in a space of constant anxiety or avoidance.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk!

Coming from a traditionally African (üá¨üá≠) family, a lot of emphasis is placed on the women in the house to get married by a certain age and to bear children (because our mothers want grandchildren).

Up until I finished college, my parents never spoke about men. Ever. Now that I‚Äôve finished my Master‚Äôs, my parents, particularly my mother, have been on my case about finding a boyfriend and preparing to settle down.

But that‚Äôs what she doesn‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm not going to just SETTLE with anyone.

&amp;nbsp;

Men want to take ZERO responsibility for controlling your own fertility and then be outraged like you got trapped or tricked if she gets pregnant! How?!

&amp;nbsp;

If you take ZERO responsibility for controlling your fertility then you get to make 0% of the decision if she becomes pregnant,  in addition to the fact that you carry ZERO of the physical risk of pregnancy OR abortion. And since you carry ZERO of the side effects of birth control, you get to make 0% of the decision on what we take!

&amp;nbsp;

Ever since HBC (Hormonal Birth Control) came on the market, men have acted like they‚Äôre stuck on stupid as to how babies were made. 
 I don‚Äôt know why men today think that because of this new option that *just* became available 50 years ago, men are completely absolved of responsibility for controlling their own fertility. 
How do you think your grandfather got laid before HBC (Hormonal Birth Control)?

&amp;nbsp;

Literally for generations men understood they were responsible for where they spread their seed. The Bible is full of stories about this! All of a sudden in 2019 you all are all confused that sperm in vaginas might make a baby? GTFOH. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you‚Äôre too pornsick to orgasm with a condom on - that‚Äôs *your* fucking problem to figure out. There are so many different sizes and materials too choose from - go try a bunch of different kinds JUST LIKE WE HAVE TO DO WITH HBC and see what works! It‚Äôs much easier to purchase and sample, has almost ZERO side effects, and is far fucking cheaper than HBC!

&amp;nbsp;

**You need to budget for condoms like we budget for birth control.**

&amp;nbsp;

Women are tired of bearing the brunt of your laziness, selfishness, complete and total ignorance, and utter lack of fucks to give about our well being. 

&amp;nbsp;

Do you have *ANY* idea how absolutely horrible and painful some of the side effects of birth control are??

I personally had blood clots in my lungs so bad I would wake up in the middle of the night struggling for breath!

I'm 22 and he's 26. The stuff in the spoilers is just me gushing about him, you could read or not read those.


Positives
* He's clean
* Super independent
* He's really fit, and I find him incredibly attractive. He really takes care of himself in all aspects.
* He loves to cook and is a state fair chili cook off champion
* He seems very intelligent
* He donated $10 to Bernie Sanders in 2016 (my candidate of choice)
* He's great at initiation and hasn't had me plan or pay for so far five dates, he texts first but not too often
* He's very tender and gentle when we cuddle
* He cares about his family and friends, he's been very close to three male friends since grade school, he appears to have platonic female friends
* He makes $100k+ a year but still seems very frugal (dented car and modest apartment) (also he didn't tell me his salary, his position is on his LinkedIn and I looked at his company's glassdoor)

Did I mention he's attractive? And SO clean. His hygiene, his apartment, and his car are consistently impeccable. He put up a tiny Christmas tree on a table.

&gt;!I showed him my Instagram where I have my dad posted with the caption ""Look how handsome he looks!"" and he said ""He does look handsome"" very matter-of-factly. I don't know many men like him who would say something like that.!&lt;

&gt;!He also seems to really like me and I can tell he actually listens to me. He started watching an anime I recommended. He belly laughs at the things I say and seems to really enjoy my company, while also doing small things like putting his hand on my waist while we walk around, holding my hand (and his got sweaty aww), and gently putting his hand on my leg while we make a puzzle together, saying I look beautiful.!&lt;

He invited me back to his place again after our third date, and I said I don't know if I feel comfortable because I don't hook up. He got nervous and began almost stuttering. He said there was no expectation and he just wanted to hang out with me. So far, he's kept true to that.

We had a nice time getting to know each other over a puzzle, and then cuddled and made out until 2 am with no sex whatsoever. The next date, I actually slept over, and that was just as nice with no sex.

Longer version lol:&gt;!I agreed and we just made a puzzle and talked and looked through his yearbooks at my request. He was definitely an ugly duckling and had a great glo up, and he wasn't social in school like he is now, which I found so darling. I loved the music playlist he showed me.  It was so pleasant and relaxing. We started cuddling on the couch, not even making out, and he was stroking my hair and my arms and my back and kissing my forehead. We weren't talking and he just seemed happy to be laying there with me. At some point, he moved off of the couch and I accidentally sort of touched his boner. He seemed horrified and immediately apologized, and then when he was walking away he looked down at his pants disappointingly lol. He took off his shirt at my request and we went to his bed and I straddled him while he was on his stomach and gently tickled his back. He really seemed to enjoy it, and called it ""life-changing"". He didn't ask for ANYTHING more, not even for me to take off my shirt as well. He tried to reciprocate the back tickling, but it wasn't as good bc my shirt was on. He still didn't take that opportunity to ask me to remove my shirt. We just cuddled and kissed until 2 am when I asked him to take me home. We had our fourth date that weekend, where we made lasagna from scratch at his apartment and continued the puzzle we started.  Again, it was so relaxing and pleasant. We moved to the bed again, and made out and cuddled and tenderly touched each other's skin, but again no sex. At one point in the night, his hand started wandering downwards, and I just brought it back up again and he made no fuss and continued as we were. I slept over and we spent 24 hours straight together, until I went home at 3 pm.  !&lt;

So why am I here you ask?

I know most of you aren't here to read a whole ass diary entry play-by-play of this relationship, but I don't have any friends with FDS values, and I've already been with 2 LVM. I would really value the opinion of other FDS women. I'm only 22 and I don't want to make more mistakes.

Some questionable (but not necessarily negative) things about him:

1. He invited me back to his place on our first date. I said no, he didn't seem phased. Later on our fourth date while we were sleeping in his bed, I brought this up to him as a reason he almost didn't make the cut and he said he has had sex on the first date before.
2. He's tried a bit of coke¬†lol
3. He drinks a lot. Like, most weekends, with his friends. Has blacked out a number of times. His dad was an emotionally abusive alcoholic druggie. This red flag stands out the most to me.........
4. He likes butt stuff.
5. I had my period during said fourth date, and since I hadn't been planning on sleeping over, I didn't come prepared. When I told him this, he became the same kind of quiet and reserved that he'd been on our first date, when he was nervous. He drove me all over at 2 am to find somewhere that sold tampons, at his own offering. **However**, he didn't get out of the car to check if a certain place was open, I had to do it. And then when we arrived at an open gas station, he had me go in alone (with his card after I told him I forgot my wallet) to buy the tampons while he waited in the car. I don't really like this but he reacted okay in every other way.THEN I bled on his bathmat while changing it out.... lol officially the worst thing that's ever happened to me on a date. I got back into bed and I told him. Again, he reacted with the same kind of quiet and reserved I'd already seen in him, and he told me it's okay and one day I'll laugh about it. The rest of our night and morning continued as normal and I had an amazing time.
6. He's really attractive and has a lot of female friends. His handsomeness+his preferred environment (bars and clubs)+his very apparent sweet and gentle nature has probably resulted in a LOT of beautiful women throwing themselves at him.

Writing this out makes me think there's a lot more positives to the negatives, and everyone has their flaws. But I have a history of downplaying red flags. What do you think?",41603,I would love some perspective from you all right now,0,,

I'm in my own little world 95% of the time, so I don't really pay attention to it. All men do is stare, they rarely approach, and the ones that do obviously have screws loose (e.g. guy followed me around Target, random guy on the street asked me for a hug, guy staring at me and then following me out of Starbucks, etc). I didn't get why on dating apps I'd get thousands of likes and messages, but in real life, crickets. Turns out, OLD helps them grow a pair. I've since axed OLD as I don't think it's for me. Men who are forced to interact with me in real life (e.g. cashiers) stutter and end up asking/saying/doing really stupid/weird things. I have stories for days lol. I should mention that I don't see men I consider attractive all too often, I couldn't tell you the last time.

**So, to my fellow intimidating ladies, how do you approach dating?** I know FDS promotes not approaching men. I'm reformed, I (stupidly) took other advice in the past about intimidating women needing to ""take initiative"" and ""give his personality a chance"" or we'll end up alone. I did that one time and he was an ogling LVM with, you guessed it, self-esteem issues, who didn't know if his unappealing, boring, ass wanted *me* or not. I ended that real quick and I'm never doing that again. I've also been told that I need to ""look more approachable."" People make smiling seem like the magic cure for approachability, but no one goes through their day to day tasks smiling the whole time...and for a lot of women, smiling attracts weirdos. I know a lot of you will say, ""any man who is intimidated by you is someone you don't want to be with anyway"" which I agree with, but I'm still struggling to navigate. Male friends have told me that tall, attractive, well dressed women intimidate the shit out of men, and that my confidence is obvious by how I dress, and carry myself. ""You look like you know you're the shit and don't have time for bullshit."" True. They've told me that if they didn't know me they wouldn't approach me either. Guys on dating apps have told me that if we hadn't matched, they would never have approached me out and about. 

I spent my early and mid twenties focusing on my professional life, cultivating my hobbies, doing a lot of self reflection, digging deep. I finally feel ready to date, but I'm really disappointed in, and bored with, the options. I know I'm kind, empathetic, personable, so much so that I've turned it into a career, but I also have no patience for bullshit. I enjoy my own company so much, and I know what I want in a partner, so I'm not desperately looking to date, I never have been. I get out, I take classes (yoga and painting), I spend time in coffee shops working on projects, take weekend trips to museums, etc, but again, it's just me being stared at by men I don't find attractive lol.

**I want to go into 2020 armed with knowledge from you lovely ladies! So, how do you more intimidating lot get men to approach you?** I'm going to try the five second flirt technique, but I want to know what you all do! **For those of you who have also axed online dating, where do you meet your prospects?** (work is not an option, I don't date men in my field; friends are all dating/married to LVM).",41581,"Fellow Intimidating Women, How Do You Navigate?",0,,

They claim that average looking and below average looking women should not chase after ""Chads"" and should instead date their looksmatches. The thing is, however, that a looksmatch does not exist!

A large percentage of men are genetic garbage that should NEVER pass on their genes. I know that sounds harsh, but don't blame me, blame mother nature! In nature, only a small percentage of males get to pass on their genes. This can be examined throughout most species of animals, and humans are no exception. Women are biologically programmed to only be attracted to a small percentage of men. Meanwhile, men are biologically programmed to be attracted to most women.

Different studies confirm this. Women rate 80% of men as being below average looking, while men rate about 60% of women as attractive. Therefore, men and women can never be truly looksmatched. Men and women cannot be compared by their 1-10 ratings since a low rated woman will always have a higher SMV than a low rated man. Men and women can only be compared by their SMVs. Since 60% of women are considered attractive by most men, this means that they can be compared to the top 20% of men that women find attractive. 

This is why it's not uncommon to see ""Chads"" dating women that are less attractive than them. This is because men are attracted to most women and are therefore likely to rate women higher than we rate them. For example, I've had many male friends rate completely average looking women as being 9's or 10's. Most men have no idea what a true ""10"" is. A 6/10 woman who is relatively young, fit, and well put together will get a man's dick just as hard as a 10/10 woman. So in the Chad's eyes, a 6/10 woman has just as much value as a more attractive woman. 

Because of this, there is nothing wrong with women being hypergamous and trying to date better looking men. If an average looking woman can get a good looking man aroused, then they are compatible. If an average or ugly male cannot get an average looking woman aroused, they are incompatible. It's that simple. 

Now what does this mean? Should women never give average or below average looking males a chance? Not necessarily. Looks aren't the only thing that matters. More important factors also come into play such as personality, common interests, intelligence, financial success, etc. Whether a woman decides to give a less attractive man a chance, however, is entirely up to her. If a woman chooses to lower her physical standards, it should be because she likes a man's personality and feels he has other good traits that make up for his looks. It shouldn't be because she was shamed or guilted into it. It shouldn't be because she has low self esteem and thinks that's the best she can do. It shouldn't be because she feels bad for a man and wants to be charitable. 

If you're going to give an average or ugly man a chance, do it because YOU WANT TO and because he is a HIGH VALUE MALE who has everything else going for him besides his looks. 

But always remember: your standards are valid and you are entitled to them! Never feel obligated to give a man a chance for any reason!",41562,"There's no such thing as a ""looksmatch"". Don't let ugly men make you feel bad about your high standards or shame you into dating them!",0,,

Nurses in my state make a solid $60-80k a year after graduation, and can easily make $80-110k with experience if they work in a high paying environment and even more if they work a lot of overtime or go back to school. 

This is the perfect recipe for finding a man who uses you for your money. 

First off, nursing is often not prestigious enough to attract top high value providers. The days of the young at nurse meeting a handsome provider surgeon while working at the icu, securing her future as an upper middle class SAHM died like 25 years ago. That handsome surgeon? He wants a female doctor, maybe an internist or something. He‚Äôs not going to provide for a SAHM. He has like $300k in student loans to pay off. Lastly, a lot of doctors are from cultures that expect their sons to marry women from equally prestigious careers and/ or get arranged marriages. 

Secondly, nursing doesn‚Äôt pay enough to raise a family in an comfortable middle class environment. It makes enough money for a family to not starve, but you won‚Äôt be making enough money to buy a house and pay for your kids‚Äô college on that one income alone. So you can‚Äôt say ‚Äúoh but she makes enough money to support the whole family, so it‚Äôs ok‚Äù the way you would with a female doctor pulling $200k+ a year. 

Third, nursing work sucks. It‚Äôs dirty. It‚Äôs very very very stressful and busy. In the hospital, you‚Äôre on your feet for 12+ hours a day dealing with shit charting systems, families who may be upset, doctors who are pompous and rude, protocols that can be confusing, no breaks, holding your pee in, wiping poop, taking orders, etc. In the nursing home you‚Äôre balancing a deadly caseload and putting your license on the line. In psych/ jail/ ER you‚Äôre at constant risk for being assaulted. AND YOURE EXHAUSTING YOURSELF AND DESTROYING YOUR BODY MUCH OF THE TIME BY WORKING NIGHTS.  And weekends. 

Combine all those things and you become a magnet for low value men who see that you‚Äôre a nurse and with baited breath wait for you to maintain a relationship with them where your $100k a a year ass is supporting their $50k a year ass. 

You get into a situation where you can‚Äôt get out. You can‚Äôt step down into a specialty with less stress but less money because your husband and kids depend on you financially. You can‚Äôt switch to days because your husband and kids needs the $2 more an hour and you have to watch the kids in the day anyways. You can‚Äôt go part time because you‚Äôre the breadwinner. You can‚Äôt switch careers because everyone depends on you. 

Oh and at the same time ‚Äúyou only work 3 days a week so you should do all the housework‚Äù. 

99% of men who marry nurses wouldn‚Äôt marry them if they were pursuing their dreams in a lower paying but more pleasant career. Why? Because they want their wives for the money.",41547,Nurses being used for money,0,,

Last week was more my usual and comfortable dating pace, work was insane with the business changes happening and I made sure not to overextend myself like the week before. Had two dates (originally three before cancelling one for Sunday) and another chopping and changing of the man-roster. 

I‚Äôm also feeling very worn down and exhausted from work so I‚Äôm not putting myself out there as much this week.

___

**The suitors** 

Who I‚Äôm still talking to from the last recap: 

-	Tim - still talking almost daily and he‚Äôll call me after work several times a week to see how my day has been and catch up. He was off to a music festival on the weekend, so no plans for a second date set up yet.  

People who have left the rotation: 

-	Ken, 33, professional removalist- He‚Äôs out of hospital and healing up well after the skin graft was successful. We had a date on Saturday (see below).
-	Jeremy, 36, the self confessed dork - He bored me and he requested twice that I travel an hour to go to a cafe near his house so I stopped responding and unmatched. 
-	Josh, 30, the sports guy. He stopped initiating contact so I unmatched with him. 

New additions 

-	Carlos, 41, marketing executive. Matched on Hinge, so much in common and moved from texting to phone calls quickly as we had so many things to talk about. Extremely attractive, very passionate about his career and working for a major corporation with more career growth potential as well. Went out for dinner on Friday night (see below) 
-	Eduardo, 40, sommelier. Matched on Hinge and he asked me out pretty much straight away. Chatted on the phone a few times to set up plans and turns out he‚Äôs the sommelier at the restaurant Carlos and I had dinner at the other night. Awkward... My work and family life is going to be insane the next two weeks so we have in-person plans tentatively set for second week of January after I cancelled a Sunday lunch date. 
-	5 or so other guys I‚Äôve matched with on Hinge. Honestly not one of them stand out enough to write out their details and I‚Äôm not putting in a whole lot of effort there as I‚Äôm not physically available the next few weeks anyway. I‚Äôve told all of them I don‚Äôt have time to meet at the moment with very varying responses to my putting them in a holding pattern. 

___

**The dates** 

-	Friday - Met Carlos at an Argentinian restaurant a few suburbs away from me. He set up all the plans well in advance and we spoke on the phone a couple of times coming up to the date where he expressed how much he was looking forward to it. The date itself was a lovely night and we ended up spending six hours eating and talking and getting to know each other. He asked to set up two more dates including taking me out for my birthday. He picked up the tab for both locations we spent time at and he spent the entirety of the night actually being interested in me and who I am - one of the only dates where I haven‚Äôt felt like a sounding board for the guy to talk at. I left the date very much looking forward to the seeing him again and he rang me when he got home to thank me for the wonderful time he had with me. 
-	Saturday - Ken invited me out to my favourite burger restaurant (that he had made a note of me mentioning in one of our first conversations). We met at midday and my first impression was that he was dressed very slovenly - T-shirt was very worn and threadbare and his hoodie was dirty - and his clothes smelled musty. He had just gotten out of hospital the day before finally, so I mentally clocked it as a problem and moved on for the time being. The problem here however when it became apparent his life is full of drama; work problems, family problems (he called his mother a cunt), ex problems, ex-and-Mother-of-his-child problems. At that point I was mentally checked out as none of that is appealing at all. He also made me pay for my own meal when we ordered by announcing ‚ÄòLadies first!‚Äô and standing about five metres behind me until I had ordered and paid for myself. He asked for a second date and I said no. 
-	Sunday - I cancelled this one a few days before we were due to go out. I was weirded out by him working at the restaurant I just had a date at and I also wasn‚Äôt feeling like I had the mental and emotional energy to do three dates in a row again. We put a pin in it for now, but he also hasn‚Äôt contacted me as much after I cancelled so he might not be interested anymore. 

___

**Insights** 

-	Why would you go to a date if you weren‚Äôt prepared for it and then turn up in dirty and disheveled clothes? I feel like Ken had all his priorities wrong and should have been at home relaxing after leaving hospital. The whole date was a shambles.
-	I am mentally and physically exhausted this week and I am just not checking or answering matches from today onwards. I don‚Äôt want to be the low effort partner so I‚Äôm removing myself from dating apps until after the holiday period. 
-	Men are getting really desperate now with Xmas and NY in the next two weeks - the number of matches I‚Äôve gotten and then five minutes later the pressure to meet up immediately has risen exponentially. Everyone is in a rush to meet up, hook up, couple up. 
-	I enjoy Hinge as a dating platform as it‚Äôs faster to sort and discard potentials and matches, but I am still flabbergasted by the number of people who can‚Äôt be bothered filling out a dating profile with any real effort. Writing ‚ÄòAsk me‚Äô after a profile prompt shows you are lazy as fuck, probably in all aspects of your life.",41527,"Dating Report: W/E 15th December, 2019",0,,

It‚Äôs around this time that a lot of assholes realize the value of treating people like human beings. Once they go over to their moms place and go get their obligatory plate of Christmas food, they find themselves sitting in their apartment alone bored with nothing to do. All the men who actually know how to treat people like human beings were invited to friendly gatherings and parties. They‚Äôre with their buddies or their girlfriends and they‚Äôre enjoying the holiday season.

Manipulative narcissistic assholes repel friendships like oil and water around the holidays though. Nobody actually likes them and it will show. Out of desperation to not be alone around Christmas they think *ill reach out to what‚Äôs her name and see if she‚Äôll answer. Maybe she‚Äôll feel bad for me and hang out with me. *

Don‚Äôt. Ignore and block.

This just happened to me this morning. Every year during the holiday season and around his birthday, my ex boyfriend uses one of those apps to create a new phone number to text me from. He always makes sure to sound desperate and *reeaaally in need of a friend right now*. He‚Äôll text me some dramatic story about he‚Äôs so sorry for saying and doing whatever he did to me but hes just sooo worried about his sick family member or he‚Äôs sooo depressed.

I know nothing about this man is different and his problems are his to deal with, not mine. 

So once again -

These men have not changed. The holiday season has not made them ‚Äúsee the light‚Äù.  This is more manipulation. Once the balls drops they‚Äôll go back to being an asshole and you‚Äôll be caught right back in the cycle you worked so hard to break.

The last guy I was hooking up with had a dog. My apartment doesn't let me have pets so I also avoid having them as guests to protect my carpet. Because of the dog I went to his place, but he drove us everywhere, cooked for me, etc. I've known the guy for years and the dog since she was a puppy, so this arrangement was okay because he treated me well in other ways and I got to see the dog.

But now I'm starting to see other people that I don't have the same history with them/the dog, and I'm wondering how to navigate this issue because I don't have a pet-friendly space. A lot of people have dogs in my city, and I love animals so I don't want to avoid them!

In the beginning it makes sense to date as normal (going out for meals or activities, no ""dates"" at home or sleepovers) but once I become exclusive with someone (e.g. start having sex and sleeping over), what happens? How can I keep a relationship FDS with someone who probably can't sleep at my place?

&amp;#x200B;

**5** **Texting signs that he's not actually interested in you:**

**1.** **Slow texting**

Yes, i know some people are busy and lead on a very busy life, but how come the man you're talking to *always* takes hours or days to respond? you've been talking for let's say 2 weeks and you text him during the day, does he never pick up his phone 5-15 minutes after you texted? why does it always have to be 4-8 hours or 2 business days yet he's active/online on social media? he's too busy to text you but not too busy to be active on IG for 40 minutes straight? he's just texting someone else while letting you wait 5 hours.

The answer is he simply does not care. He sees your text and thinks to himself ""I'll just get back to her later"" and forgets or does not care enough to actually text. If he actually cared he would shoot you a text saying ""Hey i'm very busy right now/at work, can we talk later"" or ""I'd love to answer your question but i'm not home right now. I'll text you when i'll get home/i'll be free"".   


**2.** **You're in the blue** 

To those who don't know what it means: you're mainly the one texting them. Your messages are blue on imessage. Some of us are so 'desperate' for romance and love that we think if someone messages us back even a little message it's a confirmation that they're interested in us but it is not true. It's about the ratio investment (in this case: the amount of texts) and clearly you are more invested than he is.

It should not happen, it shows lack of interest while you're the one double texting or 'spamming' them and they throw you a sentence or a few words on every 3 texts of yours. This is not a healthy ratio and it shows the person is not interested. In his mind he has better things to do than answer your texts and the more texts you send and the longer they are, they least likely he is to read them all. That's why we keep seeing women complain about how their boyfriends only answered to the last part of the paragraph, sweetie he simply didn't read it except for the first sentence and the last one.

That's also why we don't send men long paragraphs about how they've hurt us or played us or what they did wrong. Block him and let him wonder.

I found random pictures of texts on google and censored the texts themselves just to show the ratios:

'Healthy' ratio: [http://prntscr.com/qdlygg](http://prntscr.com/qdlygg)   [http://prntscr.com/qdm36g](http://prntscr.com/qdm36g)

'Unhealthy' ratio: [http://prntscr.com/qdlyli](http://prntscr.com/qdlyli)   [http://prntscr.com/qdm2ib](http://prntscr.com/qdm2ib)

&amp;#x200B;

**3.** **Late night texting**

If he only texts you after 10PM or when he's drunk he's just looking for the easiest way to have a good night and sometimes it's validation from you. He never gets in touch with you at any other time. He's not that interested.

Thats why we set the rule to no texting after a specific night time, mine is 11PM. Just like you wouldn't respond to a text from your boss at 3AM asking you to come in early tomorrow even though you're awake at 3AM and seen the message - do the same to men. If he texted you after the time you set you just text back in the morning.

This can prevent cases like sexting (or him trying to sext you) or the conversation 'somehow' going sexual because the boundaries are less clear the later it gets. It's easier to get you talking at 2AM when you're alone in bed than at 3PM when you're at work.

&amp;#x200B;

**4.** **Platform downgrade** 

If he cares enough to like your IG pictures and be the first ones to view your story or like your Facebook posts but doesn't care enough to text you he's not that interested.

Ever wondered why a man won't text back for 2-3 days yet like your pictures or only message when you post pictures? he's just keeping you hanging on with some little interaction so when he finally decides to text you - you will respond and not ignore/ghost. It creates kind of a 'closure' and a feeling that you guys are still in contact with each other when the truth is you're not. If he stops texting you unfollow him on social media or block him if needed.

&amp;#x200B;

**5.** **No plans made**

If he's dropping hints that he wants to meet up and it's been a week (or two, depends on how long you let him waste your time) and he hasn't met up with you yet it's because he doesn't want to. It's that simple!

If i like a guy i want to see him and have him ask me out to dinner while talking about our hobbies, careers and interests on that dinner date. I want to get to know him and see if it can work out. When a man likes me he wants to see me as fast as possible, not after a month of talking.

 If he's just texting you without actually making plans to meet he's:

1. Taken and has a girlfriend or a wife
2. Wants you to be his therapist/emotional support pet and keep his ego high
3. Not interested in you/doesn't like you

If you keep texting him back with no plans or arrangements made you're wasting your time. Give him a week and don't ask him out yourself because then you'll end up being the planner and it will feel very forced and he will most likely ghost you or cancel on you last minute (while he keeps liking your IG photos, of course!). If he drops hints about how he wants to take you out just say ""Wow! so where are you taking me?"" and he will either:

1. Take that chance to ask you out and have a dinner date 
2. Backpaddle and not know what to say or make up an excuse because he doesn't want to actually meet

It will most likely be the second option so don't expect much. The first option will only happen if he's very socially awkward and didn't know how to ask you out (and if that's what you want in a man..go for it).

Don't let men waste your time and make you play his little therapist friend. Ghost and block him today!",41451,5 Texting signs that he's not actually interested in you,0,,

90% of us will encounter this type of man. He‚Äôs not a LVM - as far as you know -  but he‚Äôs making a solid effort not to be a HVM either.

He says he‚Äôs an open book and you‚Äôre confident he‚Äôll still pay for the date. He‚Äôs attractive and attracted to you. And you want to give him the benefit of the doubt because you are still fresh in your FDS mindset and you don‚Äôt want to jump the gun before you can even test your new philosophy, right?

His catch phrases are:

‚ÄúIce cream in the park?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you wanna do?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm easygoing‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to you‚Äù

In other words: this man THINKS he wants to be led and courted. Dropping a handkerchief around this kind of man wouldn‚Äôt have worked in the 1800s because he‚Äôs plain lazy. 


Solution: Put his male privilege and higher earning potential to YOUR use. He pays, you go everywhere you want in this world on his dime. Eat tempura and drink those espresso martinis like his life depends on it. 

He forfeited his right to have a say so now the ball is truly in your court. Why should he have a say?

Know a play you‚Äôd enjoy but your friends wouldn‚Äôt? Tell Mr Open Book to take you. 

Having troubles with your hair or outfit? Vent to Mr Newly in The Friendzone.

Got hit on by a creep? Let that man-size Mooncup soak up all your bad emotions. 

Anytime I‚Äôve been disrespectfully friendly to a man, they‚Äôve always snapped out of being so open minded. They don‚Äôt actually enjoy being led. They don‚Äôt like it when you briefly mention other guys. They hate feeling like an afterthought.

The smarter ones will try to upgrade themselves to being a priority. The dumber ones will just be blocked a little later than they would have been initially. If he doesn‚Äôt like you, he‚Äôll bow out very quickly anyway saving you a lot of overanalysing. So you have nothing to lose by centering yourself.

flashback to fall 2018: imagine dumping a tall handsome guy from your hometown who takes accountability, puts family first, works on himself, reads, works hard, plays college sports, doesn't drink or do drugs and goes to the gym on a regular basis and then thinking u would somehow find better. my first love. i played myself and i've been so depressed reflecting on my mistakes and this loss for a year now. i was young inexperienced and dumb and i've been paying the price ever since because these guys just do not seem to exist in the dating pool anymore. and it makes me miss my ex even more. 

fast forward to the present day, i can't seem to find luck on these dating apps, i've been on a few dates with guys from these apps but the vast majority either expose such glaring red flags before i even meet up with them or the conversation just fizzles out. i've been told my standards are too high, and that i need to lower them, but how can i when in the past I was with someone who met all of these and more?
red flags are so rampant i want to cry when i compare my options to the dream guy i loved and lost. feels like i'll never get over this. i go to a college that has been a complete mismatch for me academically and socially for purely financial affordability reasons and i have not had any luck meeting guys there either, compounding my struggle to find meaningful connection. i watch my friends enjoying their college experience and finding connection or continuing relationships from high school, which is becoming more common where i live nowadays even in a major city. i haven't found any guys in any places i've been- clubs, work, gym, recreational sports, mutual friends- and i am fully aware my attitude on the past is fueling my pessimism in the present. it's a huge problem but i struggle to not feel hopeless. i know i am no saint- i've made a ton of mistakes in my previous relationship and beaten myself up for them. Self reflection has brought me so low, i will admit it still hurts so bad that I got the death penalty but i know understandably it was too late to fix my mistakes. i was the bad guy, now it feels like i won't find love again. i've been working in therapy, focusing on school, going to the gym, writing it out, trying to work on my hobbies, working more, seeking to meet more people, putting myself out there, etc. but have not met anyone. this obviously can't only be external- i must be projecting vibes that are reflecting back to me, and i am aware people can sense if you  moved on / are still hung-up on someone from the past but it feels like my environment is perpetuating this issue. 

any advice on how to move forward from this is greatly appreciated. open to any and all opinions even if it is hard to swallow. if

I wasn‚Äôt very experienced sexually or with dating and made things too easy and myself too available. Things ultimately didn‚Äôt work out. Oh well. You live and learn. I did some time on OLD apps after that and got frustrated with filtering through fuckboys
and took a break. I just recently got back on them.

I met someone that I felt I hit it off with immediately. We had our first date on Saturday and had decided to walk around downtown and get dinner. Because he lives right there and parking is always a nightmare, he suggested that I park at his place and we walk there together. 

So things started off well. The conversation was flowing organically, he wasn‚Äôt too forward, he paid the fat tab, opened the door for me, pulled out my chair, even put his arm out for me to hold while we walked around downtown. He was very well-mannered and sweet. 

Eventually, we wound up back at his place and he invited me in. I thought it would be nice to keep getting to know each other, so I followed him in. Then things took a turn and I played myself. 

We were sitting next to each other, then started cuddling and eventually got into a heavy makeout session. I stopped myself and told him I didn‚Äôt wanna have sex. He said he respected that and was fine with it. Great! I thought we were going to stop, but he kept kissing me so I just went along with it. 

At one point, I pulled back and told him we should stop before he got too hot and bothered and had to resort to taking care of himself. I didn‚Äôt do a good job at standing by my boundaries. He proceeded to put my hand on his pants and the way he was touching me and guiding my hand sort of put me in this submissive headspace. 

I felt pressured and ended up giving him two blowjobs. Not just that, but I suggested he get rough with me and he ended up slapping me, choking me, pulling my hair, holding my head down, holding my hands behind me, making me gag on his cock, rubbed it all over my face, came on my face, and really got into it in general. In the moment, I liked it because of the sensory stimulation, but I have to admit that it makes me uneasy that I respond with arousal to that stuff. 

He went back to being sweet and caring after that. Helped me wipe my face clean, kissed me softly, cuddled with me, asked if I was okay. I told him I really had to go home, he walked me to my car, and we agreed to see each other again. 

He texted me on Sunday to see if I wanted to come over and ‚Äúhang out‚Äù and I turned him down and said I had plans. He didn‚Äôt suggest any other date ideas. He‚Äôs texted me a couple of times to make casual conversation today. 

I‚Äôm mad at myself for not acting in my best interest on our first date. I‚Äôm disturbed by the fact that I introduced the idea that treating me the way he did was not only acceptable but encouraged. When it comes to long-term goals, we want the same things. But I don‚Äôt know that I can recover from how badly I broke my frame, so maybe I should just suck it up and cut my losses. 

I‚Äôm posting on FDS to sort of reflect on this experience and to see if anyone has tips/advice/words of encouragement to help me learn to be a respectable, confident, high-value woman.",43282,I thought I was over my pickmeisha tendencies but went right back to acting a fool.,0,,

I didn‚Äôt want to waste my time reading PUA garbage, so I skimmed this [helpful summary](https://thepowermoves.com/the-book-of-pook/). Much of it is the typical TRP nonsense of men convincing themselves that they‚Äôre somehow superior to and more important than women. You know, that ridiculous chest-beating, then whistling past the graveyard self-soothing that they typically do.

Some of the advice in the *Pook* summary is actually decent for general self-improvement‚Äîalbeit clich√©d and a bit trite. I took the liberty of converting the sexist stuff that‚Äôs directed toward insecure men, and I rewrote it for women from an FDS perspective. (Also, my version is better because the original is so poorly written.) Perhaps you might find the entire list to be helpful with your attitude and goals. #LevelUp2020, ladies!

**Summary:**

* Focus on yourself and the life you want instead of on the advice of those around you.
* With regard to the high standards that you‚Äôve set for others, meet them first yourself.
* Never be ashamed of being a woman. And never be ashamed of your relationship needs or your sexuality.

**Approach:**

* Make it fun for yourself! Treat dating like an interesting pastime, nothing more.
* Don‚Äôt make him the object of your desire before getting to know him for at least several months. Otherwise, interacting with him will induce anxiety.
* If you see him every day, be calm and self-focused rather than concerned with what‚Äôs on his mind.
* A new mantra to practice: *Self-respect is better than regret.*

**Mindsets:**

* As you think, you shall become.
* The greatest risk is betraying yourself.
* Learn to tolerate loneliness‚Äîdon‚Äôt try to avoid it at all costs, as pickmeishas do.
* Keep an air of mystery. Don‚Äôt reveal too much of yourself too soon. This may be easier for those who are introverted.
* The high standard you have for a partner must first be applied to yourself.
* Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket‚Äîalways have a back up!
* Success is a habit.
* Don‚Äôt think that ‚Äúgetting‚Äù a man equates to success. Conversely, being rejected‚Äîdisrespected, faded, breadcrumbed, used, ghosted, discarded, and so on‚Äîdoes not equate to failure.

**Relationship management:**

* Accept, embrace, live, and enjoy your femininity and your full humanity.
* Let him show that he enjoys and respects your humanity.
* If he is indifferent, even sometimes, accept it and return his indifference. Refocus your attention onto yourself and onto those who value and appreciate you.
* Give respect for respect. Respond to disrespect with self-respect and with distance.

**In the male mindset, men:**

* Love being treated as though they‚Äôre important and interesting‚Äîand they love feeling as though they‚Äôre engaging with someone who is also important and interesting.
* Love a challenge and love (intermittent) attention from women they‚Äôre attracted to.
* Don‚Äôt care about stuff they dismiss as ‚Äúfeminine,‚Äù even if it‚Äôs important (like feelings, stories, aesthetics, domesticity, or caretaking).
* Use meaningless words. Judge them by their actions instead. Their actions should match their words.
* *High-quality men only:* Love sex when you have your *own* pleasure in mind (instead of *his*).

**Rules of being a woman:**

* Make your dreams and passions your priority.
* Don‚Äôt walk on eggshells. Never apologize for being a woman with her own feelings, tastes, desires, needs, standards, requirements, and boundaries.
* Strive to excel at what you do.
* Hold others responsible for their behavior‚Äîand then work to solve your own problems.
* You only need to prove yourself to yourself.

**Other rules:**

* Respect is all. Walk away at any signs of disrespect.
* Immediately distance yourself from any man who inappropriately sexualizes a conversation or situation if you‚Äôre not fully comfortable. Immediately distance yourself from any man who treats you like a caretaker or therapist. No apology or explanation is necessary.
* Trust your gut.
* Always believe and act as though you are worthy of kindness, respect, and love.
* Believing that you‚Äôre worthy cures neediness and desperation.
* Focus on improving yourself, not on getting the guy.
* Improvise and adapt; don‚Äôt be constrained by formulas and routines, especially if they don‚Äôt serve you.
* Elevate your thoughts in order to ascend and level up.
* Make it fun with men. Don‚Äôt take them too seriously. There's no need to put on a show or prove yourself.
* Imitating someone else‚Äôs behavior probably won‚Äôt work for you. Get comfortable with yourself, improve yourself, and be yourself.
* Take care of yourself. Exercise regularly, eat nutritiously, get enough sleep, take care of business, tidy your home, wear flattering clothes, and take care of your skin and hair.
* Don‚Äôt give him too much attention. Don‚Äôt chase, don‚Äôt always be available, expect him to schedule plans ahead of time, and don‚Äôt double-text. If he flakes, drop him. Let the pickmeishas waste their time on him.
* Learn and adopt confident body language. Weight-lifting, dance (especially ballet), yoga, pilates, and martial arts are all effective at teaching body confidence.
* Be ambitious and build your ideal life. Your life is a garden; nurture it lovingly before attending to anything or anyone else.

I mentioned a couple of places that I heard might still have availability, and sent him a link to one of the places. He asked me to make a reservation. 

I refuse to make the reservations. Why? Because HE asked ME to dinner. When you ask a woman to dinner, you make the arrangements. You are the host. She is your guest. This is also why men pay: They asked you; they are the host. 

Ladies, do not be lured into ""over-functioning"" in your relationships with men. Rather, lean back and see what he does. Does he take the lead, make timely reservations to ensure your comfort, or does he wait until the last minute, and then ask you to take over? If so, consider if you want to spend the rest of your time with him -- possibly your life -- taking care of everything because he won't.

I'm disappointed in this man, but it's better to know this sort of thing sooner rather than later. 

If a man won't make timely plans, and needs me to ""rescue"" him, this is merely the beginning of a relationship that is going to be me planning everything and dragging him along once he gets truly comfortable. And that's a ""no"" for me.

Honestly? I'm just as happy spending NYE at home, in my own company. That's what I was planning on doing before he asked me out. So if he can't get us a table, I'm staying home.",43199,"Ladies, If you ""overfunction"" in your interactions with men, you never find out if he's a LVM",0,,

During my late teens and early 20's I was enthralled with Spirituality‚Ñ¢. I thought I was a special snowflake for liking things like that or gravitating towards the local crystal shop and being a fake reader of osho. Since then I have realized my former special snowflake syndrome and other pickme tendencies but I now do genuinely enjoy spirituality in a more authentic way and have been journaling and repeating affirmations lots, using candles of certain fragrances and colors to make my atmosphere more feminine and to meditate and do mantra rituals with. I got a few crystals of different qualities for calming and meditation purposes too, (I even got a yoni egg). I had a friend in the past that was heavy into tarot but I just did not gravitate towards that specific type of spirituality. I had another friend who I recently cut off for being wishy washy and unavailable , she quit her job and as from what I recently saw, she tarted doing tarot reading videos on YouTube in the meantime. I tried to be supportive but its an interesting coincodence that these two former friends and their interest in tarot and them just being different levels of LV to me, something about the recent friend being into tarot sounded an alarm and I recalled all the times I reached out and she entertained me and many other patterns of her treating me like an option when I blatantly told her I was interested in garnering more serious and authentic lady friendships, so I without warning cut her iff and blocked her. 

Anyway I kind of started ranting there, I digress though.

My question is, are there any ladies into to this kind of stuff? How do you incorporate it into your FDS self care and self love wise? 

I find that when I was most calm and zen by doing spiritual things like that in my downtime for at least an hour a day, I was HV af along with other self care things but that was a big one for me. Since getting out of the LV relationship I was in, I have been doing these things again and am starting to feel powerful again because Im consistently doing something that calms me daily and am not fitting it in around that LVM schedule that I worked around!",43137,"Any Spiritual FDS ladies?

I'm kinda confused on this tbh.

1) this is important for later: I was a UI designer/software engineer. he was a elementary school teacher with a degree in american literature and wrote poetry. So I would call him a poet. You write poetry, you‚Äôre an artist and a poet is how I see it and I don‚Äôt care how much of an amateur you consider yourself. I told him, I had two degrees and was working on my Masters. One BA was in graphic design. I also informed him how I was an artist since childhood and that I wrote romance and fantasy stories for years. Therefore, I call myself an artist and a writer. 

During our second date, he felt the need to be proud of our differences and this opposites attract bullshit. I looked at him funny before he started firing off his reasons cause he was white and I‚Äôm not lol. I was the first black woman he‚Äôd dated. Ugh. He pointed it out anyways :/ but didn‚Äôt linger on it. Instead, he ended up saying one of the most insulting things I had ever heard in my life:

As he looks away with stars in his eyes, he gushes, ‚Äú...I‚Äôm an artist and you‚Äôre... a tech person.‚Äù Eh?!

Because two out of my three degrees were in IT and my title at work???? I was a ‚ÄúUI DESIGNER‚Äù and even explained on the first date, in simple terms, how I was basically a digital artist and that everyone in the office came to me for artistic direction which was one reason I was hired lol. Graphic Design?!! Idk why I didn‚Äôt just end the date there.

2) The next day after this second date (that was admittedly fun after that aforementioned nonsense) he calls me on the phone to break things off . HE ASKS,  ‚Äúyou‚Äôre strong right?‚Äù I say yes but I didn‚Äôt understand what he meant so I asked him to clarify. He merely repeated himself to then emphasize that him cutting things off with me will then hurt me less than it‚Äôs hurting him. Lol okay. Ever been so confused you‚Äôre rendered speechless? 

3) After he is freaking out about telling me he doesn‚Äôt think we should see each other anymore, he (I‚Äôm legit laughing as I type this shit out) asks me another question: ‚ÄúIs there anything you can say to me to help me get through THIS?‚Äù

Now, I‚Äôm extremely maternal despite having no children. I‚Äôm one of the pillars of my family and ppl come to me for advice all the time/I get punished for being honest or repeateding exactly what was said to me back to them so they can hear themselves. I‚Äôm that person. So I‚Äôve made too many mistakes of having little to no boundaries throughout my life (I‚Äôm sure you already picked that up) ... until this man-child asked me that VERY question. 

I remember so clearly how I wasn‚Äôt angry. I was suspiciously calm and I surprised myself when I replied softly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt know what to say to you.‚Äù 

It was amazing because I knew myself to always find something to say to comfort someone who is in pain. Even if it was pain they shared with me before but didn‚Äôt want to learn their lesson yet. But I felt supported by idk the universe and I immediately took away MY LESSON from his antics and it was that I AM CAPABLE of lettingmy guard down with someone. Despite the predatory circumstances, I emotionally upgraded, right then and there! I didn‚Äôt know I could, and even though he was a piece of shit since the beginning, I knew our short interaction was for me at that moment more than for him. 

That man-child had soooooo many other issues that I would never tolerate now. Eg: putting his coat on the caf√© floor. Not on the back of his chair... the floor.

Anyways, it took me months to finally reveal anger towards him. I don‚Äôt think I could afford to feel anymore pain without suffering really bad consequences health-wise. 2016 was a tough fucking year. My ex boss of was a bully and I was still working through that trauma despite finally quitting, at the beginning of the year a child I knew died a day before their birthday and they were my first funeral, and another man-child (just before this LVM) I was confiding treated me so poorly for 10 months while I was so vulnerable from work and that death.

I‚Äôve been working on myself so much and though I went through more ridiculous encounters (I even saw him
later at a mutual friends bday party but we didn‚Äôt speak) I kept learning how all these losses are massive gains. I have an autoimmune disease that I needed to get under control so if I wanted to literally survive I had to start identifying why I would let any LV PERSON come into my life and abuse any resources or gifts I have. I attracted a LOT of broken folks who wanted someone else to fix them instead of taking a deep dive into their projections for themselves. Still attract them. Back then I was soooo willing to heal everybody else but me! Ew!

Instead of being accessible at all times, I religiously use ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù as a complete sentence. 

For him to believe he could step on my neck and ask me to breathe life into him at the same time let me know that I was extremely powerful. The unmitigated gall. Think about all the times people have done this to you. Probably happened 10 minutes ago because women are groomed to always create space for others even if it requires erasing yourself entirely. That‚Äôs a lot of reprogramming of the mind to work through but it‚Äôs worth every effort. To tell that idiot I would not provide for him felt like the most amazing feeling in the world. I charged up vs experiencing that sacrificial drain. I put up a boundary and sort of have to thank that LVM for how badly he treated me. I wish it didn‚Äôt take that moment to shamelessly confirm I‚Äôm worth way more than that, but it is what it is.

Need some encouragements? Here you go: 

-Not long after, I stopped identifying as an empath and started calling myself a ‚Äúpathfinder‚Äù because you can exercise the choice to let someone tap into what you have to offer. ‚ÄúI choose which way I will go in this moment.‚Äù

-Preservation is a key survival trait!
(I‚Äôve been on an incredible upswing in the last few months, I am happy with who I‚Äôve become and chuckle at the fact that his now girlfriend looks almost identical to me even down to my hairstyle he spoke negatively of I had when I met him.)

-2020 is going to be cute for all of us who have been doing and are willing to do more of that ugly, uncomfortable internal work. Beauty is one of our only commodities, huh? Well, get ugly ladies! You‚Äôre valuable regardless of what you find or how the world treats you. 

-Don‚Äôt be afraid to lose friends, lovers, or even family over setting standards for yourself, and practice confirming what is true about you. Phew! 

-Once you learn how people react to you knowing what you won‚Äôt stand for, they start shaking. Let ‚Äòem quake! *stay safe tho*

-History is a great teacher, but don‚Äôt be a habitual time traveler! Being present is important for your health! Don‚Äôt bleed all over people who didn‚Äôt cut you.

-As habitual creatures we are capable of breaking old patterns to create new ones. You can do it, and you can‚Äôt convince me otherwise. ;)

-No more of ‚ÄúI wish‚Äù/‚ÄúI hope‚Äù. Know what you ARE and know the sold as the impossible IS POSSIBLE. Speak on it as though it is already in your life such as love. Fall in love with yourself and learn what your daily balances of give and take can feel like. Try to stop saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äù towards the things you dream of. 

-Listen to your needs, and learn how to listen to your fears because you can‚Äôt be brave unless you know fear. 

-Be a fool, take a leap and make mistakes. And distinguish between ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù and ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù.

-see a therapist/professional if you can because lemme tell you... when a professional spells YOU out, the wheels really start turning as do your fortunes. Knowledge is powah!

-if possible, be vulnerable with trusted comrades because despite the level you‚Äôre at on your healing journey, you still have to deal with this world as a human lol

-empty and fill your cup when you want to and be a cheerleader for the deserving!

I have more, but maybe I‚Äôll do a different cheerleading post elsewhere. I‚Äôm excited for 2020, and I hope any of what I said was able to help or remind someone of their personal strengths.

However, I had a really toxic relationship before meeting him where we would both sleuth each others social media trying to catch each other out. I don‚Äôt know why, but I looked on who has followed him on Instagram since me - and there are SO MANY girls, many who he has followed back.

I was in environment where it‚Äôs mostly female and since I was new to the states I barely had friends. So I met my ex on online, and one of the thing with toxic guys I noticed is they heavily rely or project their identity over social media like Instagram. 

If a guy you‚Äôre with is using Instagram a lot and likes every one of his female friends, you gotta watch out for those two. 

Also don‚Äôt date a guy who thinks he‚Äôs worth is determined by his career. 

Also this might be controversial after going through emotional abuse from my narc ex, I definitely despise dating a guy who‚Äôs been abused by their parents when young. Or any kind or abuse such as being bullied in school a lot . Because when one goes through that when their thinking isn‚Äôt fully developed and not fully self aware, it influences hugely on your subconsciousness and influences it throughout your adulthood. There‚Äôs s chance that he‚Äôll become just like his parents or have avoidant attachment personality. 
So for me,  no matter how rich or good looking the guy is, if a guy have this past, i drop them like a bomb.

Why? Well, the state wanted to uproot the so-called bourgeoise ""poison"" that was marriage. In a flurry of laws, the concept of illegimate children was vanquished...women aged 17 to 32 declared the State's property (lol yeah that sounds like a great idea). 

Well. To begin with I always hear from modern day men about how ""unconditional"" their love is and how ""free"" - hhem, *loose* \- their love is...yup. ""Love"" that is, apparently, not actual love but simply a law forcing them to stay with their wives. 

Let's take a look at some passages I selected. 

&gt;  
'Some men have twenty wives, living a week with one, a month with another,' asserted an indignant woman delegate during the sessions of the Tzik. 'They have children with all of them, and **these children are thrown on the street for lack of support!   (There are three hundred thousand** ***bezprizorni*** **or shelterless children in Russia to-day, who are literally turned out on the streets. They are one of the greatest social dangers of the present time, because they are developing into professional criminals. More than half of them are drug addicts and sex perverts.** It is claimed by many Communists that the break-up of the family is responsible for a large percentage of these children.)   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Peasants with a respectable married life of forty years and more behind them suddenly decided to leave their wives and remarry.**    
&gt;  
&gt;**'Many husbands who lived peacefully with their wives for twenty years suddenly begin to cry: ""We have freedom now. Give me a divorce.""** 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Every divorce in the villages brings with it family discords, feuds, trials, revenge, murder, and ruin. One must take into consideration the backwardness of the village population, which feels that the new law will bring polygamy, grief, demoralization, and the dying out of the race.'   
&gt;  
&gt;Tears filled her eyes as she told me that she still loved her nineteen-year-old husband, but that he had forced her to ask for a divorce only two months after they had been married. He now thought he loved another girl in the village and threatened to kill his wife if she did not leave him voluntarily.  
&gt;  
&gt; **Communist women have been known to commit suicide because their husbands' attentions were diverted elsewhere.** 

Oh...and something I find key to learn from: 

&gt; **As long as a young man doesn't participate in public activities he respects his wife. But as soon as he moves up a little, gets a little more education, something comes between them. He leaves his wife with a child, lives with another woman, and brings poverty and misery to both. I ask the working women to pass a law that will stop the practice of having many husbands and many wives.'** 

Yup. It is necessary to get a man that's complete, not a work in progress. This sounds a bit bad but it feels like it has more credibility coming from that long ago in a time that wasn't heavily flavored by concepts like political correctness or feminism (which did exist, just in another form; women are instruments of labor too!). Even back then it's obvious:

**Men are more opportunistic than women.** I find it funny that it's claimed that it's the opposite. What keeps cheating rates between men and women relatively similar is that women have far more opportunities on average, and reject them far more proportional than men would on average. That's that. 

Oh. Other topic. There was an interesting group of Soviet Union women that took advantage, smartly, of the situation and played these awful men for monetary gain--using blackmail to get back at frivolous and slutty rich men. LOL, I bet you guys would find this cool. Moreover, apparently, incidences of jealous violence shot up from women, unsurprising. That isn't laudable. The actions of women weren't always virtuous here, but comparatively to men, their actions weren't what drove the collapse of society or marriage. 

A lot of the ""criminal"", spurned children were from marriages before this BS law...**so many of these were long-lasting marriages with faithful wives**. Lots of these women weren't chasing after the best man or anything. They stayed dedicated to one man clearly, as the pain and angst of having the intimate connection they used to have clear--even when monetary gain is impossible due to the system of laws. 

It shook me, and also pretty much proved that a good family and support network for a child *is* what keeps them a good citizen, also supports that monogamy and deep, long-lasting love is more of a woman's thing. Give men the tools, and they're simply much likelier to monkey branch off than the average woman in long-term relationships--even in cases where the woman seems to have just as much leverage. 

When men complain about women being after money, even now, it's always important to remember that delightful 1926 Sovient Union law; *in which 10000s+ of children that were unable to be supported were forced into being criminals due to no support network.*

There's a lot of men that would whine and bitch about less women being SAHM and how they should be one, who cannot even begin to comprehend the true reality: this is a world where men can't be trusted to be good husbands and fathers, and women do have to deal with the fact that many men straight up do not value at all the experiences and years they share with their wives--hence is why many end up treating their wives like shit. 

It's clear; women were actually *incredibly emotional and reacted often explosively and in heartbreak to being abandoned* (i.e., revenge, still trying to be with peasant lovers, etc.). It wasn't all about alimony or money. But, in this case, men were overwhelmingly acting callously and distant, pursuing brief highs and pleasure. There's not one reference to men suffering over this. 

This also parallels with modern day Russia. It's actually pretty normal for men to have affairs, and for the families to EVEN KNOW about them. However, it's also regular for men to lie about being married to potential affairs and many women end up buying into it. ""Marriage"" is a bargaining chip in which those men used to keep those women, even if they never intended it. I'm guessing this was what drove a huge amount of women in the 1920s to be convinced hooking up with men would go somewhere. 

Mens' relative unwillingness to desire simply one special person lead to a massive societal crisis and that society figured out the traditional family unit has value and goodness. Fantastic. And you can bet if something similar happened now, both young and old women would suffer more for it on average no matter how faithful and good they are, or how much, or how little accountability they take (funnily enough the f'ed up if cool blackmailing women took the most accountability for their lives and happiness)--the ending is still the same. 

I think what's sobering here is the idea that men actually genuinely can't be pursued with a innocent, benefit-of-the-doubt giving lens in most cases...proof that FDS actually makes a lot of sense, *because the supposed* *things we complain about on here that have men claiming that aren't an issue at all--was what made society literally blow up, become extremely degenerate and boom with criminals, and make men act like monkeys keeping barns full of wives*

That the only way to get ahead is to choose wisely.

As someone who‚Äôs fallen victim to the trap of ‚Äúselective commitment‚Äù, I‚Äôd like to share what that can look like.

Commitment is relative - it‚Äôs an all or nothing concept that has to be weighed and measured against what matters to the man you‚Äôre expecting commitment from. 

Being introduced to his parents means nothing if he values his friends more. Being introduced to his friends means nothing if he values his parents more. 

Being sent a raunchy snap that says ‚Äújust for you xx‚Äù should mean nothing if it doesn‚Äôt have your name on it - he‚Äôs probably picked ‚Äúsend to all‚Äù. Sharing insta stories of you together should mean nothing if they don‚Äôt have your face in them - why doesn‚Äôt he want to identify you on his page? Calling you his girlfriend to the Airbnb host means nothing if no one else in his life knows you exist - this is a no-risk situation that‚Äôs designed to make **you** feel validated while allowing **him** to make no tangible commitment. 

He doesn‚Äôt invite you to his functions because he doesn‚Äôt want you there. Because he‚Äôs keeping his options open. Because he hates to be held to a standard or accountable. Not because he ‚Äúcares about your feelings‚Äù.  If he cared about *you*, he'd want to be around you - he'd measure up at every opportunity.

They know what they're doing and the meaning of it, they know what not paying means.

Men know that if they won't pay for a date, the chance of them seeing that girl ever again is at least 20% lower if not more, if they liked her enough they wouldn't risk not seeing her again just to keep those extra 30$ in their wallet. If he doesn't pay he just didn't like you that much (which is not your fault, not everyone are bound to like us) or sees a lot of women so he doesn't see it as a 'financially' smart decision, he does not want to invest in you means he's not worth your time.

**The type of men who won't pay:**

\- The broke boy, he most likely spends 3/4 paycheck on weed and alcohol. Always wants netflix and weed dates. Another good reason not to date him. He cannot give you what you want and it will most likely not change.

\- ""Women are gold diggers"" guy, he will whine about women taking advantage of men and how it's easier/more fun to be a woman. I noticed these men are often bound to rape-culture and keep talking about false assault reports. Will call you offensive names if you reject him.

\- The fuckboy, never intended on getting to know you and sees paying for dinner as a waste of money. ""Just come to my place, i got netflix"" he says, as he eats dinner at 3pm and that's why he can't take you out. Will always ask ""why are you saving the chats"" while texting you on snapchat and overuse the 'horny' winking emojis.

\- The desperate, he's most likely seeing 3 other women besides you this week so he cannot afford to pay for your food or theirs. He complains to his friends about how he went on 20 dates in 1 month and couldn't get laid. He's using the numbers tactic, if he does it long enough eventually some pickmeisha will sleep with him, after going on his 78th first date and splitting the bill. He will most likely send you a copy-paste message to start the convo and it'll go like ""Hey you're cute, can i take you out sometime?"" without reading your bio/profile.

\- ""Let's see where this goes"" guy, he won't pay for your food because he wants to see where this goes first. Or in other words ""lemme fuck so i can test drive you first"" and he does this for 2-3 months until you realize he been wasting your time. You're not the first girl he does it to and not the last, when he does find out where this goes it's usually going to him not being able to date as he's still stuck on his kindergarten girlfriend whom he dated for 6 days.

Honestly i can't find a 'good' reason for men not to pay for dates.

# I treat women like objects.

üì∑

I am insensitive and I attract women who are into misogyny, women who are damaged goods and the occasional woman who puts on the appearance that she has her shit together.

I started exploring the depths of these damaged women and I discovered common attributes they all shared.

It gave me colorful insight into manipulating them emotionally and getting what I want from them while assuring a safe exit for myself.

The sex is hard, brutal, violent, degrading...

And fulfilling.

When they cry, I get off harder.

Feminists love degradation sex.

Conservative women like domination sex.

Liberal women like anal and slaps.

All 3 categories love to be treated like objects.

I met this dude a couple of times, socially. I thought we clicked, but wanted to air him out a little, didn't tell him I liked him or give anything away. 

So, after we'd met a few times, he asked for my number. I thought OK, still played it cool. He was thirsty AF after we'd had a night out, wanted to come to mine and fuck. I said no, but he could come to my work's Xmas party, which would require a financial investment for a ticket. He was initially up for it, kept messaging that he was looking forward to it, and could we exchange some pictures. I said no to the pictures, said I'd much rather leave things to imagination and do an old fashioned reveal live.

Well, he was asking if we'd be official, I said no to that too. I honestly don't want official or exclusivity, I've not long separated from my husband, so I'm not interested in running into another relationship. 

Now, he can't make the party, surprise surprise. I'm convinced because I wasn't giving in to what he wanted. If I'd fucked him right when he wanted, I'd have been ghosted after, I'm sure. If I'd sent pictures, that probably would've been worse. Post nut clarity and all that. 

But once he realised he'd have to make an effort, spend some cash and impress me, it was too much effort. 

Bullet. Dodged.

I have been in numerous relationships one lasted as long as 5 years and was always pressured to have sex but I never gave in.

After reading this sub I am convinced the best strategy for me is to never have sex. Here are my  reasons: 

1) I saw a post that says a man will never treat me as well as when he hasn't had sex with me yet. This has been true in my experience. I  won't give them the satisfaction that they have conquered me plus I have them on their best behavior. 

2) I have come to the conclusion that no man in this world no matter how handsome, successful, talented, kind etc. is worth tearing up my body or orifices for. 

3) I don't plan on getting married. To me a wife sounds like a free prostitute that a man can get free sex from on tap. I am not interested in lowering myself to that level. 

4) Less emotional trauma. When the relationship ends or turns sour as most of them usually do I gain satisfaction in the fact that I didn't let him have his way with me. His betrayal stings a little less as a result. 

5) I don't plan on having kids. I don't want my kids to suffer thru 40 years as corporate slave so that the CEO can make his millions. 

6) I feel like a dignified and respectable woman being a virgin knowing that I have never allowed a man to use my body for his pleasure. It also gives me a sense of purity and holiness in the spiritual sense. 

I want to thank this sub for solidifying my decision. I have got all sorts of pressure from men ranging from ""if you want to be my gf we need to have sex "" or "" being a virgin is not attractive after you are 25"". I tell them that a tight unused vagina is in demand in the dating world and I am an attractive and accomplished woman so I should have no problem finding someone else.",37703,I plan to be a virgin for the rest of my life,0,,

# AITA for proposing to my boyfriend as a woman?

üì∑

So my boyfriend(now fianc√©) and I have been together for 5 years. He‚Äôs great, and I love him. We had discussed getting married before a little bit and both said we wanted to, but didn‚Äôt really say when.

Both our families were away for thanksgiving so we decided to take a little vacation, we went to sequoia national park and I thought that it would be the perfect place to propose. I already bought him a really nice watch (he wears one but it‚Äôs sort of cheap), and when we were in this beautiful little clearing with the huge trees and no one was around I popped the question, got down on one knee and all.

He was really surprised and didn‚Äôt exactly react the way I expected, he seemed sort of annoyed and upset but eventually said yes. On the drive home he said that it made him upset that I would just propose and that it was ‚Äúa mans part of a marriage‚Äù and ‚Äúsomething he was looking forward to his whole life‚Äù. So now I feel really awful because I thought it would be really sweet if we reversed the roles because he‚Äôs always doing romantic things for me.

Anyway he was sort of cold when we got home, not outwardly aggressive but now I‚Äôm just sitting here worried if I did something horribly wrong.

AITA?

Edit: Jesus I didn‚Äôt expect this many comments. I see a bunch of people talking about how he lost his chance when he waited 5 years, but I‚Äôm only 27 and he‚Äôs 28, so we were in college and grad school for much of the relationship. He was getting his PhD and was busy and I got my masters and started my job and he was still in school. We had this conversation maybe 4 months ago? So it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs had years.

I‚Äôm planning on talking to him about it when he wakes up. But I don‚Äôt really appreciate the ‚Äúyour marriage is doomed‚Äù comments

Update: I figured I‚Äôd update since some of the comments were actually very helpful, despite a few suspect pms. I talked to him earlier, and he apologized for getting upset, I apologized for making him upset and we made up, and then he pulled out an engagement ring for me and proposed back. So all is well, and I still feel a little bad for stealing his thunder, but these things happen I suppose. But I‚Äôm getting married!

Here are my steps:

1. Feel somber for a day or so. Reflect a little but don‚Äôt get too lost.

2. Talk to some friends who can help you understand the process better with an external view so you can do better next time.

3. Spend time on side projects and with friends! This is important as you want your excitement to still be sparked! 

4. Focus on what makes you feel empowered ‚Äî painting, work, learning something new, etc. 

5. Look happy every where you go and don‚Äôt post sappy shit online :) 

6. Start flirting with the idea of dating (if you have time). If you don‚Äôt care, then don‚Äôt. But if you‚Äôre not dating because you‚Äôre still in love with the ex, I think you should go on a few dates (with no expectations of course). It is a good boost of confidence.

He cheated and abused me physically ‚Äî kicking, choking, etc. it took years, but now I am over it.

As someone who is social and deeply empathetic, I try to maintain a certain level of distance yet closeness. It‚Äôs hard to explain. 

I didn‚Äôt date for five years after that relationship. 

About a year ago I told myself I needed to face dating so I could learn more about myself and what I need. I learned from a friend years ago that the most efficiently way to find ‚Äúthe one‚Äù is to go on a bunch of dates with a bunch of people, say 20. Then to not take them seriously but to find the minimum three traits you desire the most and learn how to end things when needed. After that, you date intentionally for the longterm, and the person who solidly has all of those traits is the one you date longterm and ‚Äúmarry.‚Äù 

In the last year, I had about 6 short intense relationships and additionally went on dates with ~12 different people. I don‚Äôt use dating apps, and have never had a problem with guys asking me out in person (I promise this can happen to you too if you ditch the dating apps and learn to flirt organically with elegance). I had never dated this much and I learned a lot with each person. 

I knew I never wanted anything serious, while those I dated were wanting more. Maybe I was being a ‚Äúfuckgirl‚Äù but I was very clear about my desire of pace. When I began to feel the pressure, it lead to abrupt endings and lots of anger on both ends. I learned a lot about myself from those endings. I am actually glad none of those became longterm. 

*I encourage you to try this.* Choose the number of people you plan to date ( ~20-30 ) and date without the intention of longterm. Figure out at least 3 must traits. After that, date until you find the person who had all those 3 traits. Hopefully that is your one.

The 3 traits I really need/like from my experience:

1. Compassion. I need someone who is understanding and not judgmental of the things I open up about. 

2. Integrity. I really need someone who is open, honest and follows-through. That makes me respect a person, and I want to respect the person I date. I noticed I have not respected anyone I‚Äôve dated because they lack this trait, being fickle. (Trying to figure out why I date fickle people...maybe it‚Äôs my previous lack of care/commitment?‚Äù

3. Goofy. I need someone who doesn‚Äôt take life too seriously and can laugh with me til our stomachs hurt. I tend to be the only one laughing at myself. I want someone to laugh with me!!

These are things I could have noted before I went through this experience, but consciously experiencing these traits in my dating experience helped me find strong intuition for it and understand the genuine feeling.",37678,Dating Algorithmically,0,,

I somehow stumbled across this sub and started reading because I found nuggets that are being helpful in regards to an affair I've been in with a married man. I have reached the point where I can see that trying to cobble together an aggregate of happiness from various relationships isn't working.

I've been married for 14 years to a man I don't respect or like. I married him out of desperation and I did try to be a good and loving wife. But when we had kids he started to seem like a man child - another child needing taking care of. He supported us when the kids were small but has been unemployed for the last six years and I have been working to support the family. At first, I was happy to get out of the house, get away from him, and work. But I now feel trapped and resentful because he does absolutely fuck all. (He literally spends all day sat in a chair, surfing the net and watching reruns on the telly. He does very little housework, has terrible hygiene, and is morbidly obese.) 

Around the same time I took over the breadearner role, I told him that I wanted to separate. My idea was to each get a small studio or bedsit to live in, and keep the children at the same house, taking turns on alternate weeks being with the kids. (I didn't think we could afford two residence big enough for 3 kids plus us and I didn't think it would be good to move the kids.) He begged me to not do it, basically refused to budge. I did tell him that there would never be a sexual relationship between us, again and we have never slept in the same bed, since. I also made it clear that I considered myself free to do what I wanted. I don't rub his nose in it, but he knows. Trust me on this - it was explicitly stated that he would not object to me being with other men, so long as I didn't make him leave. 

My work requires near constant travel. I'm in a hotel more than I'm home. This is good in terms of avoiding my husband, but bad because I don't see my kids much and I don't see friends much - I don't have a steady social life or community involvement. 

I was doing OK with this, for the most part, until I started an affair with a friend. We've been friends for several years but only started ""with benefits"" a few months ago. I initially thought that it would be a good idea because he's also unhappily married and lives a couple of hours away. But it has just opened up a wound in my heart and I now feel utterly lonely. We chat a lot online and we have hooked up 3x over the last six months. He has a sort of compulsive need to womanise and fill what he describes as a void. He also pushes away anyone who tries to get emotionally attached. I know this because he tells me so - he's always told me that he is like that. Just why I thought things would be different for me, I can't say.

The affair has been pretty one-sided. I have spent a lot of time listening to him moan, being sympathetic, flattering him and even helping him deal with the fallout of a previous affair. I wanted to be important to him, to be special. He has never given me any verbal assurance that I am valuable to him, other than saying that I am his  closest friend, because I'm the only person he's ever told about how he's empty and uses affairs to fill his void. 

Sexually, he's very different - I think he uses sex to connect emotionally and then he withdraws, again. I have a hard time dealing with the intensity of his affection and passion because he just shuts down, afterwards and goes sort of quiet on me. I was looking for something more meaningful than the hookups I usually have and thought that perhaps it would be good with a friend that I knew well. I definitely feel more comfortable and open with him, but the withdrawal is brutal and makes me feel just how lonely I am. 

I do think he will miss me when I'm gone but I don't expect him to ever express it to me. I am trying to get to the point of not caring. I have blocked him, before, and gone back. So I don't want to block him again just to embarrass myself, again. I want to stop caring at all!

I wish I'd never started up with him because I was sort of comfortable in a routine, before. I was sober for over two years, didn't really have much of a libido, didn't want much. Now I've relapsed, I'm obsessed, and I can't focus on work.

I'm perhaps not as ashamed as I ought to be on account of his wife. I do feel bad for the woman married to a man who despises her and lies to her. I certainly feel bad for his kids, who I gather are living in a very unhappy home. (I feel bad for some of the other women he's been involved with, too, for that matter.) But I am just one of the many women he's had affairs with over the years and I'm not even the only one he's had affairs with in the past six months. I used to think ""eh, so long as nobody gets hurt, does it really matter?"" But I will say that I don't like playing a role in his shit and enabling him. Maybe he's trapped like I am and just trying to get by, but I got involved with rescuing him from the fallout of a previous affair and I somehow came to feel bad for his wife. 

I don't know if I want to return to the dull routine or if I want to try and find happiness. I don't know if I can do that unless I'm actually single and available. I don't know if I can leave my husband. I barely cover the bills as it is. If I can't travel then I can't earn enough money, and if my husband isn't home with the kids then I can't travel to work.

Our rent is really expensive. We have a lot of debt. Even if I just move out, I will still have to pay for everything. I am not optimistic that my husband will find a job at all, and certainly not a well-paying one.

Perhaps I have to settle for the old routine. I should start by getting that other man out of my head.

I don't know if anyone can understand either of my issues. I know that a lot of you will be angry at me for the affairs but I do want to get to a better path.",37678,"Married to a LVM, in an affair, and want to get out. Can I end both relationships?",0,,

I‚Äôm new here. This is an introductory post to share my story and why I will never go back to the life I had before.

I‚Äôve been raped by long-term partners and strangers alike, denied relationships by time wasting ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù looking for a quick lay, and abused for almost 30 years at the hands of childish, almost 40 and still living with his parents, poorly-adjusted, selfish, brings-nothing-to-the-table-but-expects-to-eat-like-a-king, men.

I‚Äôve been pathetic. I‚Äôve been tricked by unfuckable fake male allies and sExUaL LiBeRaTion into believing that the more of myself I allow a man to take, the more worthy I am of love. I have had a man utter the words ‚Äúthank god for 3rd wave feminism‚Äù as I took my clothes off and allowed him to degrade me. I have had a man invite me to an expensive sushi restaurant on the first date and then expect me to pay most of the tab (and then slept with him afterward). I have driven two hours to meet a fuck buddy, and then -when he didn‚Äôt have a plan for where we could go to be alone- paid for a hotel room out of my own pocket to flex my financial independence.

Fuck all of that. The reality of the situation is that men will drink from your emotional cup until it is empty, and then once it‚Äôs drained they‚Äôll steal it and sell it for scrap. The bar for men is so low, it‚Äôs on the ground.

I have identified as a feminist for years, and am slowly coming around to the idea that so many points in the ideology of the LibFem movement are absolute trash that see women shouldering the burden of social expectations of both men AND women. We‚Äôre diminishing our value, increasing the amount of distress in our daily lives, and rewarding weak men for their refusal to keep up their end of the bargain in maintaining civilized order. 

I have found a HVM after quite awhile of being convinced that it couldn‚Äôt be done. I almost let him go, because I was uncomfortable with the idea of letting him pay for things for me. I couldn‚Äôt understand that his constant attention and affection was his way of trying to protect me. The emotional fulfillment I‚Äôve had up to this point in my life has been licked off of knives; to be handed a silver spoon and told to dive right in was both terrifying and confusing. 

And all I did was make him wait. 

I‚Äôm not giving him the benefit of the doubt. I‚Äôm not going to sit around like a lovesick fool and let him wrap me up in his world, before he drops some kind of bomb on me and I figure out just what his problem actually is. I‚Äôm going to be shrewd, calculating, and smart. But also loving, as he deserves to be loved for the love that he himself provides. Strategic.

Thank you for all that you do here.

It starts with the story of Jason‚Äôs father, the king of Iolcus, murdered by his brother Pelias who usurps the throne (think Mufasa, Scar, Simba). Jason is smuggled away from the palace by his mother and spends his youth being raised by the centaur Chiron, the famed teacher of the greatest heroes of Greek mythology.

When Jason returns to the palace and demands his rightful throne, Pelias sends him on a dangerous mission to the city of Colchis to retrieve the Golden Fleece, figuring this dangerous mission would kill his errant nephew. Jason summons a crew of greats, named the Argonauts, and sail across the Black Sea in search of the Fleece.

In Colchis, the princess Medea (gifted with magical powers; some sources say she is related to the enchantress Circe) falls in love with Jason and promises Jason to help him retrieve the fleece, which is guarded by a dragon that never sleeps. If Medea helps him, Jason must bring her back with him and marry her. Jason promises this. Medea then uses her power to make the dragon fall asleep, and Jason successfully steals the fleece. 

Medea, Jason and the Argonauts sail back to Iolcus (look up the story to read of how she used her brother to distract her father), but not without subsequent adventures where Medea freely uses her powers to aid Jason in any way she can. When they finally reach Iolcus, Jason takes the throne(again, with Medea‚Äôs help), they get married, and the two of them reign as king and queen and have children.

Jason, who of course never really loved her but used her for gain, falls in love with a young woman named Glauce. After he abandons his wife, the scorned Medea sends Glauce a coronet and dress, both covered in poison. Glauce delightedly wears the dress, the poison takes it effect, and she dies a pained and horrible death.

Medea then takes a step further by murdering her children. As Jason appears in a panic and fury, Medea rises up in a storm of clouds, curses him, and disappears from him forever.

The moral of this story: never, EVER help a man who has not proven himself worthy of your assistance. He will take your love and years of sacrifice with empty words and not give a second thought when he discards you for the first young, nubile dumb chick he can find.",38453,The Story of Jason and Medea,0,,

I haven't given a blowjob in years. I didn't give any to my last boyfriend, and I gave two to the one before that (one was out of spontaneity, and the other was for his birthday... lol he could tell I wasn't into the birthday one and made it very clear that he doesn't need that). No HVM will ever complain about a lack of blowjobs. No HVM will ever leave you because of it. He will understand that the affections you give to him freely are invaluable and irreplaceable. He will not want to convince you to do something sexual that you wouldn't do anyway, out of your own sincere will and desire.

You can still expect cunnilingus. Here's why: Pretty much every healthy man on the planet will ejaculate during intercourse. He will almost definitely have an orgasm when you have intercourse with him. You...  not so much. That's where his tongue comes in. Cunnilingus is/should be part of the ""standard procedure"" for getting it on.

*What if he eats me out but I don't feel ready to have intercourse?* You are not obligated. YOU ARE NOT OBLIGATED. Just like he wasn't obligated. If you feel more comfortable letting him know up front that you're not going to blow him or let him inside you tonight, that's fine. ""Just so you know I'm not going to reciprocate."" Or say it however you want. Nine times out of ten he will still do it, for two reasons: He doesn't want it to look like he was just doing it to get something in return, and guys actually love eating pussy. They want everything to do with your vagina, I swear to god. Any chance they get to touch it or be near it, they will take. (Guys who don't want to eat pussy are denying themselves because they are misogynists who believe that giving head is a feminine, servile, degrading act).

Men have convinced us all that sucking dick is standard, and that's completely wrong and backwards. The social norm that all oral sex must be reciprocated is based on a myth.

I [32F] met a guy [31] on Hinge a month ago. We saw one another three times in one week, then the next week I saw him and he was behaving strangely and distantly. Now he said he needs space. Does anyone have insight or opinions on this?

u/[deleted]5h

""I met a guy on Hinge a month ago. I was coming out of a bad situation with someone I had a few dates with, and he seemed really nice. We chatted a little bit on the app and texted, and he asked me if I wanted to have coffee or just come over and drink tea. I was feeling a little sad and it was cold out, so I just went directly over there. We watched a romantic comedy, kissed, cuddled, and ended up messing around but not having sex. His apartment wasn't clean, basically his kitchen and bathroom looked as though he rarely if ever swept, cleaned the toilet/sink, wiped the counters. His pots and pans were on the stove and weren't clean, so I wasn't comfortable eating the canned soup I brought and had to order takeout. He made a comment that I felt like his place wasn't clean enough, and I told him outright it wasn't but didn't bring it up ever again. I liked him a lot and didn't want to make a huge deal. He was so cute and nice, a good kisser, and made me feel good. I liked talking to him.
It turns out he was really sick. He had cancelled on me before due to this, but he was coughing a lot and just seemed very unwell. I stayed and held him because I felt bad for him, but declined spending the night or having sex.

   He asked me to come back the next night, so I did. He was still sick. I went down on him. I enjoyed that and didn't want to do more than that. Two days later he asked me to go to the movies with him. He was resting his head on my shoulder and holding my hand, and coughing a lot. He had to get up several times, I guess due to his coughing and he said his stomach was hurting. I went home with him and we almost had sex, but I didn't feel right with him being sick and his apartment not being clean. Other than this, he was a really nice, cute guy and I felt flattered that he wanted to see me multiple times that week.

    The following week I asked if I could see him again, and he said okay but only to hook up because he really just wanted to play video games. I said fine, but it was pretty bad because he didn't seem like he wanted me there and only talked to me out of guilt. I did go down on him a couple times and I left. I enjoyed doing it, but not how he was acting.

    Since then, he has said he needs space and doesn't know what he wants. I haven't seen him in two weeks, only talk via text sprodically. He said we can talk again in a few weeks over the holidays and maybe text here and there, but not see one another. Last night he said he wants to be friends and even asked me if I wanted a sleepover sometime, to which I said yes, then he blocked me on Whatsapp the next day. I sent him a text message asking him what was wrong, why he blocked me on there, and he said I didn't do anything wrong, but he didn't like me asking him questions and he just wanted space. HE said he was not in a relationship and that he thinks I am kind and interesting, he likes me, wants me for more than sex, but he can't deal with all the emotions of our interactions and needs a break. I never had sex with him and wonder if that's all he wanted.

   Does anyone have any insight on this? I feel lost. Why would he keep asking to see me then just act like this?""

Typical teenager, bullied, no confidence or esteem and struggled for over 10 years with health problems. From winning awards to graduating university I never felt any accomplishment, only numbness. 

I hit an incredibly low point in July and have been commissioned out of work since. I spent a couple months wollowing in self-pity before stumbling on this thread. Seeing all these incredibly confident women was a slap in the face.

Most of the time I still feel like crap, and it didn't help because I also gave others a pass for treating me that way. I've been trying since November to change my outlook and I decided to do this through hobbies, but instead of piling everything on at once I'd start off simply with exercise. 

I've been doing yoga for just under a month, started applying for jobs again yesterday (I got an interview ü§ûüèª). I'm not happy still, but I am getting better, so much that I've signed myself up for a trial fitness class.

This can be a danger later on, even *after* you've met them and established a relationship.

Suddenly you are seeing him less and less, even though he lives close by, ""because you are both sooo busy"". Somehow you are not sure of your label anymore but he is *still* texting you daily. (And if you think you can't get or stay attached via daily text, think again. Humans are creatures of habit, routine soothes us, and [text messages trigger the same hormonal release you get during orgasm](https://drdanielleforshee.com/dopamine-loop-sex-texting/).)

**What does he gain from this?**

Breaking up can be a pretty final thing. What if he can't find a sex replacement straight away? What if he needs you some day? Many women don't like FWBs or avoid sex with their ex. Moving a relationship on to the fantasy realm means no hard feelings and it keeps you warm and toasty with expectations, so you will be there for him when required.

**What do you gain from this?**

Emotionally unavailable types generally attract equally emotionally unavailable women. A real relationship requires energy, effort and is always a risk. In a fantasy relationship you risk nothing and you avoid working on your fear of commitment or intimacy issues. 

It feels like you have everything under control, until he stops texting one day and you suddenly wonder why you are struggling to get over him and how you ended up spending years pining for someone you rarely see.

**So why should you stop doing it?**

Because like a bag of Cheetos, it's empty calories. It kills your appetite for a connection but it doesn't satisfy it. It enables you to stay put and not make necessary changes to improve your life. But at the end of the day you still feel depressed, unloved and alone, and even *more* than you would without this illusion.

**Some signs you are in a fantasy relationship:**

He actually lives close but you rarely see him. There is *always* a legitimate reason for that.

He often says things like, *I'd totally come over and see you but I'm just so tired from work.* 

There are no calls, only messages. 

You are on the ""good morning babe/wyd/good night"" rotation. Your name is never mentioned in those texts. (Those guys never have just one fantasy relationship.)

The conversation is mostly superficial. There are some short lived romantic phases. Will sometimes send horny texts around midnight. 

Lots of future-faking about all the things you'll do when you finally both have the time but no actual relationship progression.

**What to do about it?**

Just stop reaching out and block him.

She raised me as a single mom, dated who she wanted, received MANY marriage proposals and had men basically falling all over themselves her entire life, until she finally settled down with a super high value, wealthy, hard-working, adventurous guy who spoils her rotten at the age of 48. 

Any time I'm having guy troubles, I always call my mom and she tells me the same thing: ""Liz, **don't waste your pretty years**"".

Not in some fake-ass Red Pilled ""The Wall"" kind of way (the wall doesn't exist, at least not for women, and *especially* not if we're taking care of ourselves). She means it in a, ""why are you settling for this bum ass loser?"" kind of way.

Being single in our 20s, 30s and 40s is the time to fucking ***have fun.*** Hustling, learning, creating, traveling, growing. Building those strong female friendships that will outlast most relationships with men you'll have. Go on **lots** of dates, meet **lots** of people. 99.9% of the dates you go on won't be your person, and that's more than okay. You aren't trapped in your geographical location, maybe your dude is in Morocco? Maybe he's in Australia? Limiting your experiences and your life to a 10-mile radius is *so* 20th century. We have the internet, my dudes.

If you're obsessing about not getting a text back or mulling over some dumb shit your stupid boyfriend just said, **stop that.** Don't waste your pretty years. Don't settle for a relationship that won't work because you're afraid of being alone with your own thoughts. Become a person who is the life of her own party, and eventually you'll find that person that enhances your own good time. If you feel like less than a whole person, you're not ready for a relationship, particularly not in the current OLD landscape where modern  dating threatens to eviscerate your self-esteem at any second, ***AMIRIGHT?***

Ladies. Listen to my mom. Don't waste your pretty years. If your friends are telling you that your dude is trash, let him go. If your dude is giving you mixed signals, those aren't mixed. Those are red flags. One of my favorite quotes and the inspiration I've had to end various toxic relationships in my life goes like this: **""Don't keep making a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it.""** This applies to everything: 

* Having sex with fuck boys to get a hit of validation even though you KNOW you'll feel like shit for days after
* Staying in a bad, toxic, go-nowhere relationship with someone you don't respect
* Agreeing to ""hang outs"" with men you can tell wouldn't make a good spouse or father
* Prioritizing everyone elses' needs over your own, being guilted or shamed into sex or intimacy
* Not taking the absolute best care of yourself possible

Life is short. If you're not working on your goals and yourself, it'll pass you by before you had a chance to shape it how you want it to go. Don't let shitty relationships and shitty men distract you from you who want to become and the life you want to live.",38334,Don't Waste Your Pretty Years,0,,

Hmm. This is a tough one. There are a lot of traits that make someone desirable in some stereotypical way, and I think most of us here know what they are. When you get down to it with the very most desirable women though, it becomes difficult to describe their traits very well.

I'll try to though. And, below, when I use the word ""you"", I mean you in the general sense (y'all), not you specifically.

**Being An Immovable Mover**

Okay, so everybody here realizes the woman should be the one in charge of how things go. We also realize the woman should not be parenting the man. 

*However*...

There is one thing the woman should have in common with good parents:

She is ""the immovable mover."" Or ""that which moves without being moved."" She seems trustworthy and reliable because you know she is how she is, and she won't be any other way, and you understand precisely what to expect from her. This makes children feel safe when their parents are immovable. It makes men feel safe (in a good way) too - if you can direct things while seeming to stay still yourself, you are a calming and safe presence while also seeming adoration-worthy. After all, the two phrases above are *religious*. They're about God. Nobody says, ""Man, God is so boring since he's immovable."" Rather, the immovable nature is part of what's so awe-inspiring, because humans aren't used to that. But humans also have complex dynamics in which one human can symbolize a greater power to another human. The most desirable women are immovable movers. 

Note: being an immovable mover doesn't mean you can never admit when you were wrong. An immovable mover who's done a wrong thing at some point is SO immovable that saying, ""Sorry I did that,"" doesn't threaten their position.

Also, being an immovable mover obviously does not mean you are doing what the other person wants. It means that they know when to expect that you will be pleased with them or not, and that they know what the results will be, and that they never wonder, ""Well, how will she respond if I do x?"" They fucking know how she'll respond if they do x. And if she is doing what the other person wants, it's clear to them that it's because it suits her immovable self.

Being an Immovable Mover is, from everything I've seen and experienced in my entire life, the most important thing. All other rules can be skillfully bended if you have your own immovable mover reasons (ie ones the man could never touch or influence) for doing so, whereas no amount of rules work if a man understands that you are not immovable... since you'll break the rules anyway as soon as he moves you.

*

In relation to being an immovable mover: it's clear at all times that she is the one who wants to be doing whatever she is doing. Nobody ever wonders, ""Is she doing this to please some other person?"" We all know it's because it's what pleases her; if it pleases others, that is a pleasant side effect.

**Character**

She has character and benevolence even while ""staying still"" in who she is. She respects service professionals; she is kind to animals; she doesn't make fun of the unfortunate. You know that if she were in a tough situation she would do the right thing. Though she prioritizes herself in all *normal* life situations, you suspect she'd save a kid from a burning building or take a bullet for somebody weak and defenseless. (I believe women find this valuable for obvious reasons, and men find it valuable for similar reasons: it doesn't matter if a woman pops out his babies if she won't also protect them.) When she doesn't have a solid reason to hurt someone, she does not hurt them just for kicks. 

**Listening style**

A Becky listens, but a dreamgirl has gravitas. When a man tells a Becky his deepest secrets she's sympathetic; when he tells a dreamgirl his deepest secrets she is silent for a bit and then says, ""Thank you for telling me that,"" before either saying she needs to think about that more or making a serious obvservation. She may offer a hug, but it's not an empathetic hug (empathy is when you express ,""I am currently feeling what you feel."") but rather a compassioante hug (compassion is when you express, ""I understand that what you are feeling is difficult for you."")

*

Then all the other stuff we all know. Taking care of their health, taking care of hygeine, all that stuff that is great but isn't good enough to move someone up from ""Becky"" category. A desirable woman - a dreamgirl, according to some other post I saw - is an immovable mover who always seems to be doing precisely what she wants to be doing, who prioritizes herself in all normal situations but who you're sure has iron-clad enough character to take a bullet if some shooter is pointing their gun at a child, who listens carefully and then responds carefully instead of reacting with syrupy sympathy. 

Oh. And last of all, something I ignored: a dreamgirl isn't crazy. If she has mental health issues, they are well-managed through therapy and medication, and have been well-managed for years. 

So - there are tons of other good traits specific men will love, and other specific men will find ""meh."" But none of those rise to the level of being thematic. I think that what I have written above covers the entire theme of the **very most desirable women** - the ones at the very highest end of the bell curve, the ones who can barely avoid tons of men wanting to commit to them forever.",38329,Traits of the very most desirable women,0,,

My apps get hit with men insisting on their stellar hookup performances- totally ignoring my personal experience, those of women I know, and hard stats.

Don‚Äôt trust her?

A decent Times article is imbedded in this one, that further verifies this premise (ignore the biz at the end of the NYT one with the woman who‚Äôs like, so proud of her performance or something...those of us with experience don‚Äôt need that validation with a fuckboy). This article also reminds us of the imbalanced risk/reward ratio in hooking up with men. Women who hook up all the time aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsluts‚Äù, but unless they‚Äôre getting paid real big bucks, I‚Äôm certainly scratching my head over the ROI.

# WIBTA if I reported this guy to the gym staff for creeping out my girlfriend?

üì∑

There is a guy who just started showing up at the gym I go to. He seems relatively fit but nothing impressive. He may have gone in the past to this gym, but I've been going off and on for the past 5 years or so and never have seen him.

When he first started showing up, he introduced himself to lots of people usually interrupting their workouts. ""Hi, I'm Shane.""

Anyway, my girlfriend and I usually work out at slightly different times and usually are at different sides of the gym when we're working out together. Numerous times when my GF has had her headphones in, Shane has gone up to her to ask her stuff. This one day while she was benching with headphones in, he went up to her and asked her if she needed a spot. She clearly did not need a spot.

The other day, Shane very loudly burped and said ""Fuck that was disgusting!""The whole gym went quiet for a moment. Last night he showed up and went over to the hack squat machine (which is near a main walkway). He put no weight on it but stood up on it and was just talking to people who walked by. Some dudes actually talk to him and some people look really annoyed when he interacts with them. A really attractive lady walked past him while he was just standing on the hack squat machine and he STARED at her until she got close to the machine and then said something like ""what's up? How are you?"" She said something quietly and briefly and kept walking. He. Kept. Staring.

Personally, he annoys me. He's very obnoxious and he annoys my girlfriend. I don't think she'll file a complaint against him because she's just not that type. WIBTA if I report him to the gym staff? Or should I just ignore him and wait until someone else does it?

Update: General consensus seems to be that I am NTA. There has been much conflicting advice with what I should do. Some of the gym staff knows me so I'll casually talk to them about this dude instead of 'reporting' him to see if they have noticed his behavior or if they know if he's autistic. For the people saying that I am the asshole, I appreciate the response and see where you're coming from. I am fine with being an asshole.

Another update: I'm reading all of these responses even if I'm not responding. There's a lot of them and some of you are asking/saying the same things and I just don't feel like putting in the effort to respond. This gym is not in Baltimore or Indiana or where you are from. It's not your gym, I almost guarantee it. I included the statement ""He seems relatively fit but nothing impressive"" not to be rude but to say that he clearly knows what he's doing but he's not a gym rat.

Because the Psych Today article seemed controversial, I wanted to point out the broader tendency of men to overestimate across multiple areas. I posted some additional studies on men overestimating their own attractiveness elsewhere, so I won't revisit the old material.

There is mixed research on the Dunning-Kruger effect and its relationship to gender. Thus, I don't think it boils down to that, but is largely subject-specific. That said, it's a consistent outcome across subjects:

Men like to switch from dating apps to texting when they begin to seriously consider dating you. Unfortunately, some of these men will end up wasting your time with useless banter that leads to no date. How do we circumvent this issue? Easy! **Ignore him.**

If it has been more than 2 days of back and forth texting and he hasn't asked you out on a date, then **ignore him**. Some men get pissed when you give them less attention - these are low-value males that would shrivel up at the thought of competing with any other suitors. Let their true colors show and subsequently weed them out of your rotation.

Why should a man be understanding when you begin to ignore his texts? Simple - you have a life and are sought after by other men. A high-value man will recognize that he is most likely not the only suitor trying to win your affection. He will instead proceed to multi-text you until you respond. He doesn't get mad at you or demand answers when you *finally* get back to him. Instead, he is happy to hear from you and quickly asks you out on a date within a few text exchanges.

# Normal to not get hard if she's bad in bed?

Just trying to get a check here.

Been on a few dates with this girl. Tried having sex this time and last. We are on completely different speeds and I cannot stay hard for the life of me. Like she'll go down on me and I'll lose the erection. It's just so fucking boring bland, unexciting, horrible blowjob. Like I'd rather just do it myself. I try to get into it, and grab her hair and treat her like a submissive, which she claims she likes to be, but she just has no idea how to be sexy and it honestly feels like work, like I'm babysitting. I just lose all interest.

Is this a me thing or a her thing?

Thnx

First of all, what kind of respectable 37-year-old man runs to his little online portal after a date to cry about how much of a Nice Guy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è he is using shit like ‚ÄúOMG WTF??!‚Äù

Secondly, instead of looking inward, he goes to a bunch of online anonymous strangers who are pretty much ‚Äúin the same boat‚Äú as him to help patch up his fragile ego. He would rather do that instead of reflecting on what parts of him or his behavior caused there to be a lack of sexual chemistry or -gasp- maybe he just isn‚Äôt up to par?

By your mid 30s, it‚Äôs not uncommon to meet people of the opposite sex who you hit it off with as friends. Actually, it happens quite often and I 35F have curated an amazing friend group this way. Clearly this man thought he could just put his Nice Guy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è tokens in and he would be rewarded with love and sex LOL. Clearly, there is nothing else of value he could have gotten from connecting with a feeeeemale for 6 hrs. Hell, maybe if he wasn‚Äôt so low value, she could potentially hook him up with a friend. I wish I could send her a link to his pathetic post in case she tries to make the mistake of befriending this man or recommending him to anyone else. 

They simply can‚Äôt fathom creating a friendship with a woman who knows her worth ‚Äì instead, they are blatantly flocking to a pathetic weak man who is victimizing himself for being low value while making brazen assumptions about a woman they know nothing about.

There are word choices that we absorb and internalize that are primarily used by guys, words that illicit cringe and disgust by high level individuals. Words like 'session' when talking about sexual activity. I thought it over and realized that 'session' probably started as a description of time purchased with a sex worker or time spent watching porn and fapping.

I‚Äôve posted on here a couple times about my situation with a guy, who is now my boyfriend. I‚Äôm having trouble dealing with the disparity between our attractiveness. I‚Äôm Hispanic but I‚Äôm white and on the chubbier side. I‚Äôm currently working on improving that by going to the gym.So yeah I look like an egg almost. My boyfriend is fit and athletic and just not my looksmatch at all. Literally all his friends are more attractive than me. It kind of drives me crazy. I trust him and i care about him, and I believe he feels the same. However, I‚Äôm just being really insecure rn.

I try to be a strong woman. I‚Äôve always used makeup, and I‚Äôm trying to improve. I desperately want to be confident. How do you guys deal with this? It probably sounds like I‚Äôm whining but I‚Äôm just unattractive. Literally the other day, I was sitting with him and we were greeted by a college girl he knows. She was just super feminine, attractive, just everything I want to be. It appears like he‚Äôs staying close to home since he‚Äôs a senior going to college next year. The school he‚Äôs going to is a party school with lots of pretty girls of course. I‚Äôm kinda scared he won‚Äôt want to be with me after seeing all the women over there.I just feel like he‚Äôs too good to me and this is too good to be true. He hasn‚Äôt shown any red flags but I feel like any day he‚Äôll break up with me after realizing that almost all women are more attractive than me. He can probably get with and date even the most attractive woman I bet.

I try to not be so insecure with him obviously. Like I said, I try to act confident. But this faking it till you make it just doesn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôm super awkward around people and it just bothers me.

I work hard in school, improving myself, actually started socializing with people. But these insecurities from the past always get to me. It still feels like I‚Äôm the same insecure girl from the past and nothing has improved even though I objectively have.",39223,Dealing with insecurities,0,,

So nice to see this community growing.

As someone who values my time and does not want to waste it on useless dates (probably relevant for most of us), I would like to know if you have some tips to identify a guy met online is a HVM. Or, since it is not so straightforward, to at least weed out LVM without having to see them in person. Obviously, disrespectful and misogynistic comments, sexual undertones and pathetic coffee/drink ""dates"" are surefire ways not to hear from me again. 

In particular, it would for example be useful to figure out if a guy is planning to go Dutch. This guy I met online says where we go to eat is entirely up to me. Does it mean he expects me to pay for myself? Something I previously used is saying I can't go on a date, since I can afford it at the moment, and they say either that of course they'll pay or ask if we can just take a walk then ü§£ But I understand it is not ideal to present myself as someone who is struggling financially, so looking for other ways to check their intentions! Alternatively, I ask them to choose a restaurant, and if it is an expensive one, they are most likely not expecting me to pay. Then again, I want to be the one to choose sometimes :)

I have these feelings going through my heart and this is the only community I can share it with. This might be long to read and am sorry about it.
I come from a 3rd world country and I have always been taught since childhood that studying hard would be the key to success. So that's all I able to do... My father sent me to a 1rst world country to get an education, a couple years ago, but unfortunately he cut all the financial help in the middle of my studies.
So I was a broke international student and no amount of job could have helped me pay the 9000$ fees per semester.
Fortunately I was dating a citizen guy during that time and when my dad cut all the help, he proposed to move in together in order to help me face the situation. We loved each other so I accepted coz it felt logical and natural.
To sum it up I had to stop school and fix my status in the country.he gave me the papers so that I can  stay and not get deported. Unfortunately the school banned me for not attending for 3 semesters and and I was devastated.
Luckily after getting the papers I started a new program in a different school this semester.
While all that was happening, our bedroom became dead and he stopped trying to make efforts in the relationship. Talking didn't change anything. I feel like he is ashamed of me as he shows no affection in public and treat me like a friend on the rare occasions we go out...
I feel trapped coz everything was perfect in the beginning and I thought I was lucky to get a HVM. But now all am good for is to split expenses in the relationship. He always lies that he will make efforts but nothing changes and he smokes weed and watch porn.
Now that I have the papers, I have government's small help (655$/ month) to go to school and I work retail on weekends. The school fees have dropped to 200$ a semester. 
I  can't afford to live alone coz everything is expensive and am giving my all to get the education to work in the health industry. I might be set by 2022. I feel guilty of thinking about leaving after all the help he gave me but at the same time am so sad and broken from getting pity sex once a year.
What would you do in my situation? Thanks for reading",39124,Trapped,0,,

I found this sub just maybe a week ago and have been inspired by how strong and in charge of life so many of you other women are. Recently I have been noticing a lot of problems in my own relationship that were honestly probably there from the beginning, but I was completely blind to. I know this is usually for ""dating,"" so let me know if I'm posting in the wrong sub..

So to start off, I am 27 and my husband is 26. We have been together for almost 10 years now, always had each other's backs, we were the very best friends, even shared a bank account since we were 19. My mother always gave me the advice ""marry your best friend,"" and that's what I did.. or I tried to do..

I happily volunteered to keep working the retail and fast food jobs and put my own education on hold so that my husband could finish up college without having to juggle having a job as well. College still took time as he was going for his bachelors in engineering at a university, and money was tight even with the help of loans. We were determined though because at the end he would graduate as a fancy engineer and we would make more than enough money to get back on track. He eventually was hired on at the place he had an internship with, and I went back to school.

About a year into working, he snapped. He started drinking heavily, smoking weed on the regular, got really depressed and once put a shotgun in his mouth. Depression and anxiety are not new to us, and have both battled similar demons throughout our lives. He started to never go to work, and this resulted in him losing his job. I had just finished up my associates degree and had to get my old fast food job back to help try and make ends meet, but in the end we were unable to afford rent, food, and we reluctantly moved back home and into the guest bedroom my parents graciously offered to us.

My parents never really liked him from the moment they met him, but they have gotten better about my husband over the years. As soon as we had a moment where we didn't feel like we were drowning I was applying like a madwoman to any and every job related to my degree. I even worked at McDonalds initially for a bit before I finally landed my first ""adult"" job, related to my degree, actually doing something I was passionate about. During this time, it was like pulling teeth to get my husband to apply anywhere, and when he did and it didn't work out his depression only spiraled and intensified. My parents aren't the most patient people in the world, and it was already so nice of them to let us stay with them, but I was trying my hardest to get us out of there and back into our own place. My husband would spend days in the guest bedroom, never leaving, always feeling on edge when he saw/heard/interacted with my parents.

Fast forward 6 months (yes, 6 months) and my husband still hadn't found a job, and was reluctant to work any retail/fast food not because he felt they were beneath him, but because he felt physically unable to work them (he's out of shape and overweight due to depression and anxiety). So one night my father, who of course wants his daughter to be taken care of and feels like my husband hasn't really been putting forth effort to do so, gets assertive with him. He tells him he needs to work harder and get a job, and how he feels he is being taken advantage of by letting my husband and I stay in their house when it doesn't seem like he is trying to do anything to get us back on our feet. This of course made my husband's anxiety and depression worse, and he managed to convince his well off dad to buy a house for us to rent to get us out of my parents' house and to retain a healthy mentality. I expressed my concerns, because at this point I am so tired of having to ask everyone for help when we should be able to take it from here. I didn't want my FiL to buy a house for us, but that's what happened anyways.

It was a rundown place, but we were to supply the labour to fix it up in exchange for considerably low rent and my FiL would pay for the tools/supplies necessary to get the job done. The place needed new flooring, lots of yard work, new paint, and a good scrub down. I thought ""okay, this is what he needs, we're somewhere he can feel safe and get better mentally and everything is going to be okay now,"" and honestly, I feel like things have only gotten WORSE and he can't even see that. I had to cut the grass/yard work and he still hasn't gotten around to painting anything and we've lived here for months now.

We're going on over a year now of him being unemployed. Due to circumstances he was unable to obtain unemployment, so it's been just me struggling with fast food jobs and now a lower paid entry level position. He buys alcohol and weed on my dime, and despite the multiple fights and his sorrys and empty promises to get sober he STILL does it. He then says I owe him for when I went through my depression and anxiety, even though through all that I STILL WENT TO WORK. Sure I had panic attacks and cried like a baby in the car some days, but I just left early so I could get that shit out in the parking lot before clocking in. He makes me feel like I have done absolutely nothing for him or us, and every time I try to stand up for myself or point any of this out, he turns it around and plays the victim. He's told me I've changed and how I'm not patient or understanding of his situation, and he's told me multiple times that I should just go find someone else and be happy with them while at the same time telling me he'd just die if he didn't have me. I've threatened to separate our bank accounts so he can't access my money and have even said it would be beneficial for us to start being more financially independent because then we are more aware of where our money is going. He says it's ""going backwards"" and threw a tantrum. He's supposed to be starting a temp job soon and I came home to him having gotten more weed. I say ""well you can pay for it with your own money then,"" and he proceeds to tell me that I can't have any then because it's HIS he bought with HIS MONEY. I point out he's been using MY MONEY for the past year+ to get weed, and he says back it isn't the same because then it was ""OUR MONEY.""

I feel so broken and numb and lost. I know so much is wrong, but I love him so much. I just want the respect and effort I deserve from a partner, but instead I get my efforts belittled, my past thrown back in my face, and manipulated to the point where I don't even know what's right or not anymore.

Is there anything I can do to fix this? I'm scared to death of what this all means, but I can't just pretend it isn't happening to me anymore. I just wanted a marriage like my parents have, but I feel like a stupid little girl who watched way too many Disney movies growing up. How do I become stronger than this? I've never been the strong type, always a doormat, but I don't want to be like that anymore. And. My. Husband. HATES. THAT!!

My Husband's family are aware of just how bad this has gotten, and seem at this point almost more concerned about me than him because he does very little to nothing to help himself. Something doesn't go his way? ""I should just kill myself"" Someone said something you didn't want to hear? ""I wish I would've just died before you knew me."" I am so tired of hearing this. My Step MiL who is Catholic has even told me ""you two only got married legally for the health insurance, even the church would understand and support an annulment/divorce.""

I'm scared and not ready to give up on someone I've spent the last almost 10 years of my life with, but I also know this isn't healthy for me. I just know that I need help and I need to start reaching out instead of sitting by and pretending everything is okay.",40466,"New here, and I need help..",0,,

For as long as I can remember.  I've wanted someone to find me worthy of being loved, cherished, cared for even. As a foster child I learned to shrink myself and as an adopted child I learned that in order to be loved, I needed to prove I was worthy.  This isn't a sob story though, its a tale of enlightenment and a hard journey of self discovery. 

One year ago I found myself once again, in a relationship with a man twice my age, trying to prove to him that I was worth be treated properly. I saw the many red flags but figured I wasn't worth more than he was willing to give. Even after I was isolated, criticized daily, told that no one else would  want me, gave in to sexual acts I knew I didn't want to do, listening to him complain about all of his crazy exes etc., all for his ""love"".  It wasn't until January of last year I started therapy that things started to change for me.  I knew I needed something but I wasn't sure where to start. My life was in shambles, I was unemployed and miserable. I had a boyfriend of 1 year who favorite pastime was judging me.  We started slow, I was diagnosed with PTSD and it opened my eyes to so much.  I was worth more than judgement, broken promises, mediocre/shitty relationships, so I broke up with my shitty boyfriend.

After that I started doing sooooo much better. I realized my worth wasn't based on a mans judgment on whether I was worthy of it. I was born worthy. I came into this world deserving of every good thing I can even conceive. I found this sub, and have been lurking, and learning. I've found new hobbies, and a new social group. Its not an overnight process, there have been many tears and lots of grieving the fact that I've accepted such bullshit in the past. I am now past the grief and have accepted that I now know my worth and will never settle again, for anything. I am currently reading The Gift of Fear, which  

I now have a great job, that actually appreciates my skills and talents. I have been single, celibate and happy. I date here and there, but at theeee first sign of red flag, I run far far away. No more benefit of the doubt, No more pacifying grown men, coddling them, and concealing my beauty to suit there needs and wants. My needs, wants and desires come first ALWAYS.

I don‚Äôt know how or why the myth that older men are ‚Äúmore mature‚Äù or more likely to treat young women well keeps getting repeated but from my personal and observational experience that is absolute horseshit.  

Manipulative, completely and totally disrespectful of our boundaries, condescending, spiteful, gaslighting, all of the toxic traits you can think of. 

The difference between them and men our age is that they had the good sense to try and hide their bullshit up front a lot better and they had a bit of expendable cash to sell us on a fairytale life during the ‚Äúcourting‚Äù phase. They know all the right behaviors to display to make it seem like they‚Äôre a dream come true. Of course, once they lock you down, the possessiveness and controlling behavior appears. 

And when you‚Äôre young and naive, you blame yourself for their bait and switch because you don‚Äôt have enough life experience to know better. They‚Äôre able to convince you their ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù life experience gave them some special insight on how relationships work that you don‚Äôt know.

Like for real, what does it add to our lives as women? making it easier for men to pump and dump? increasing our n count?

**How does hookup add to our lives?** 

It dehumanizes us in front of the man and makes it easier for him to think of us as an object and less of a wifey-material. Nearly every man suffers from the madonna-whore complex. They are taught as kids and learn from their friends and co-workers, we all had the girl in middle school or high school that kissed 2 or 3 guys in the same year and people started making up rumors about her and call her names. Don't be that girl.

What do you think he does after you leave? he does not keep it to himself. He texts his friends about it and sometimes even calls you names. Especially when he's in his early-mid 20s. It's better to be called a prude and a nun than a whore and a slut.

**The famous madonna-whore complex**

I'm sure many of you have heard about it but it is actually true and most men suffer from it and even when they say they don't, they do. It's just so deep inside they barely notice it but the second you say your n count - the look on his face will say it all, even if he slept with double the amount of women. It makes it easier for them to put you in the 'slut' category while putting other women in 'girlfriend' and 'wife' categories, when you sleep with him fast it basically tells him ""I do it with everyone"". He wants to feel special and feel like he's one of a kind that got to achieve that while other men didn't.

**Stay away from mama's boys** \- they are known to be deeply stuck in the complex but for them it is worse. Every woman except for their own mother, of course - is a whore. You will never be good enough for his mother or him. You will always be dirty to him while she'll be holy and pure, regardless of how many men you slept with. Even if your n count is 1.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen a girl post on Facebook about how she stopped counting after her n count hit 50 (she turned 19 recently) and she was serious about it. Someone asked her how many of them truly dated her and she said 2. It broke my heart and i felt so bad for her because she complained about how she doesn't know why they leave her and how so many men are not ready for a relationship yet then get into a relationship 2 weeks to one month after hooking up with her.

Do not hookup with men you aren't in a relationship with. If you're feeling horny and don't want a relationship get a trustworthy FWB or a vibrator. That simple. Trust me the vibrator will not tell his electric friends about what a 'slut' you are, unlike men.

**trustworthy FWB** \- make sure he doesn't use you and if you know you get attached easily don't do it. You will catch feelings for a man who is not interested in anything beyond sex and fun.",40310,The word 'hookup' is made out of the word 'hooker',0,,

And this song is supposed to be a female empowerment anthem!

Women (and men!) are brainwashed by pop culture into believing that a woman's natural role is to be a smiling, uncomplaining, submissive sex doll/mommy/servant to her man. She performs all the emotional labor in the relationship. She puts up with all the shit he chooses to throw at her, and never asks for anything in return. She always goes halfsies on dates because she doesn't want to seem like a user.

And any woman who rejects this model of womanhood is obviously a ballbreaking, conniving, evil bitch who's losing her looks and will die alone.

You're  the brand new mother of a bouncing baby boy. Your lower boby feels like a disaster area but as you gaze at his sleeping angel face there's one thing you already know. You would *die* for that child.

And perhaps not consciously, there is thing you already hope. That he won't grow up to be like other men.

So  you put in the time. To feed him, keep him healthy, teach him to use the potty, make sure he does his homework, while showing him how to be a decent human being and clean up after himself. You put in the worry and  the sleepless nights while he's sick or away or in trouble.

18 years later, you hear him talk about ""divorce ra.pe"" with his friends and refer to female office workers as *office s.l.u.t.s*.

You're pretty sure he didn't learn that from you. **WTF happened?**

What happened is other men.

Primarily his father.

If you want to know who a man is, take a close look at his father.

A  man can have a close and loving relationship with his mother and it  will mean nothing if his father is a a$$. Because you can teach your baby a lot of things but only one person can teach him how to love  women.

In fact, I once heard an old rabby say (20 years too late) that **if your man doesn't have a good relationship with his father, don't marry him.**  He might be wonderful right now but the wounds of childhood (and the  personality of the father) have a strange way of asserting themselves through the son, if he lacks self-awareness.

One time I asked my mother in law, why did she marry such a terrible person. She looked at me sadly and said, **he wasn't always that way.**

My own husband was a generous, hardworking man, kind to animals and kids and good to the earth. That sounded well enough to me and I was willing  to ignore his familial situation. Now I'm the one looking at you sadly saying, *he wasn't always that way.*

But what if he doesn't have a father or never knew him?

No  worries. The other men are here to pick up the slack. Grandfathers,  uncles, neighbors, stepfathers, even the co-workers at your kid's first  job at a fast-food joint...Starting from kindergarten, at the latest,  there's always that one boy eager to enlighten your kid about how the world works. And of course once your man gets unfettered access online  (earlier and earlier these days), the outcome is completely out of your  hands.

Either way: Find out who the main male figure in his life was and make sure you learn *everything* about that person.

Yes,  there are men who hate women because of actual negative experiences.  But this specific sense of entitlement, looking down at women as the weaker, more worthless sex and treating them like crap in every turn?  This is taught through merciless socialization in a patriarchy from day  one.

It's probably safe to assume  that every man has some kind of degree of misogyny within him, so the  goal when dating is basically to find the one with the least amount  possible.

Now he takes care of himself and has proper hygiene.

He is amazing at his job, motivated and respected by everyone at work. (we work together)

He puts his money aside and saves it for me, to take me on dates.

Brings me flowers every time, bought me gifts. 

Is willing to go travel and talk to my parents if I decide I want us back together. (to reassure them he has released he loves me)

I've told him things I dislike and he listens and changes them.

He is finally thinking of moving away from his parents into his own apartment, and wants a car.

He has become really kind to others and his views have changed.

He had troubles with his studies because of memorizing, since he is more creative than focused on memorizing. I saw that in him so at some point I have applied on his behalf on a bunch of jobs, when he was at his low, feeling useless because he was repeating his year in college and all that. He got hired, finished uni, a bit later than the usual, but in one year has learned much more than others do in a few years. As I said, he's off on a great road.

We were always fighting. Didn't feel like we matched. But the truth was he wasn't making any effort to change while I always made the effort. At some point we went to a party of my nephew where my family was and he realized where we were heading to and got scared. Also he's had narcissistic tendencies in the past and went from love bombing to being cold when I couldn't measure up to his ideal. Dumped me saying he didn't love me after three years.

While apart, he realized he wants to spend his life doing things by my side and that he is now convinced he loves me. And that he is trying to change on all plans and treat me the best, to make up for what he didn't do in the past. I've been testing him for three months now, being afraid he is love bombing me again.

He's had asthma and schizophrenia in the past and somehow by will he has cured them, so it's believable that maybe he has cured whatever narcissistic tendencies he used to have (which were born in high school, when he got his heart broken etc) and now claims he's become like he used to be before high school and won't change.

He treats me like a queen and I have specified that I will leave the second he becomes even a bit like before. I don't know if I should get back, as I got hurt really badly by him leaving. He doesn't deserves, but I gave him a chance anyway because he is acting like I always somehow knew he is on the inside and hoped. 

He told me 'I deserve a guy who would treat me better and he is sure I will find him', but now he wants to try and be that guy.

What do you think? I know the easy way is just to not give him a chance after all, but maybe sometimes people do actually change if they have that much will?",40245,Is my ex becoming a HVM? Should I give him another chance?,0,,

A little backstory: my grandparents are of a ""different generation"". My grandpa used to be, let's say, problematic. He's loving at heart but he could fly off the handle at the slightest provocation. Angry, raging temper for most of his life. My grandma has always been strong in her own way, but always deferred to my grandpa and put up with his shit, probably for too long. Every time he would blow up, she would shrink and do whatever she could to make him happy. I hated to see it, but it was their dynamic.

However this all changed in the last few years. My grandma's perspective shifted and she no longer puts up with my grandpa's shit. She expects flowers and gifts (which he dutifully and frequently provides), goes on vacations with her friends without him, and calls him on his grumpy toxic bullshit. We live far apart so I didn't see this transformation, but they recently came to visit me and I got to see it in all its glory.

At one point we were all sitting on the train and he started up again: he became incensed about something trivia, and he started to let his anger take over. My blood pressure started to rise as I prepared for the next few hours of anger, like it was when I was a kid. I looked to my grandma for her reaction and to take my cue from her. My grandma finished the sentence she was silently reading in her book, calmly looked up, caught him dead in the eye, and said firmly, ""No. I'm not dealing with your shit. \*Journal about it.\*"" and went back to her book. 

My grandpa's anger was completely dissipated. When my grandma didn't feed into his bullshit and validate his poor emotional control, it deflated. He looked at me and I looked at him and we both laughed, the tension completely neutralized. It was then that I realized, my meek little grandma at some point had become an absolute badass. 

It's not our responsibility to take on the emotional burden of men. In fact, my grandma should have left my grandpa long ago. But it's nice to see even the older generations of women picking up on pink pill shit and not taking their fuckery anymore.",40193,A Story of My Based Grandma,0,,

The basic premise is this: if a guy is treating you like trash, breadcrumbing you, putting you on the backburner, being low effort or blowing hot and cold, it must be because he just isn't that in to you! And if you follow  that train of thought, the fundamental takeaway is this: you must not be good enough, because if he WAS into you, then he would treat you properly. It's YOUR fault. Maybe if you were better, men wouldn't treat you like shit! Maybe if you were good enough, you wouldn't be used, lied to, manipulated, cheated on or strung along. 

Well I've got some news for you:

THIS IS A LIE. 

Like other women I internalised this mantra many years ago. Every time I ended it with another loser who wasn't treating me right, my self-esteem took another hit... if I'm not good enough for these guys to treat me properly, am I good enough for anyone?  I felt on some level that it was my fault, or I was somehow inferior. That they were going to move on to someone else who they WOULD treat right. What is wrong with me?

NOTHING is wrong is the answer. These are LVM who treat every woman this way - they don't magically become decent human beings because a 'good enough' woman comes into their life. Or if they do, the facade doesn't last long.  

High value human beings NEVER treat other people this way. They act with integrity. 

How do you know if a HVM man just 'isn't that into you'? 

HE'LL TELL YOU. With integrity. And kindness. Because he knows what he wants, he doesn't string people along, he treats women with dignity and he approaches dating conscientiously. You'll break up, you'll feel sad, you'll need time to heal but your self worth won't be in tatters because he will have treated you with integrity. 

**Unlearn 'he's just not that into you'.** It has NOTHING to do with you. There is no magical right woman who will make them behave with decency towards other people. The right woman for them isn't a person who they'll suddenly change for - the 'right woman' is the one who'll put up with their bullshit and allow themselves to be treated poorly.

I'm going to share an embarrassing story, and I'm already tidying up my inbox to get a bunch of hateful messages from a bunch of hateful men. But I'm going to share anyway.

A few months ago, before I found FDS and embrace its tenants, I had recently broken up with my boyfriend of two years and was, let's say, feeling pretty shitty. About myself, about life. I wasn't  looking for a ""relationship"" necessarily, but I wasn't *not* looking for that, either. I started talking to this guy on an app. He was exceptionally average. Not attractive, but not unattractive (and definitely not the ""Chad"" that incels constantly think we fawn over). Not interesting, but not uninteresting. Distinctly and forgettably average. 

We didn't talk long before he mentioned feeling lonely and wanted to ""cuddle"". Having been out of my relationship for a couple months at this point and feeling decently lonely myself, I let him come over. Mind you, I didn't realize that ""cuddle"" was Man Language for ""fuck"" (**Girls, this is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS TRUE. MEN DON'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK ABOUT CUDDLING\*\***). So I let him come over. Of course, several *minutes* into ""cuddling"", this fucking stranger started getting handsy and ""omg I'm so sorry I didn't mean to you just turn me on"" blah blah blah bullshit. We've all heard it. We could all write a fucking dissertation on the ""uwu I didn't mean to"" lies men tell. 

So me, being the PickMe little bitch I was with no backbone and even less self-esteem, hooked up with him. It was dreadful, and a complete waste of my time. And ***guess what fucking happened!*** He left immediately after, saying he had ""a family emergency"" (lol), and then unmatched and blocked me within minutes of leaving my house. So not only did I feel used, I felt used **and** rejected **and** disgusting. It's embarrassing, but I doubt I'm the only one who has ever felt this way. The worst part was, I thought this might happen but my need for approval and my fear of rejection was more important than my emotional and physical wellbeing. 

And that was a major turning point for me. I realized that *most men* *are fucking opportunists*. They may be ""good"" to their friends and family (even their female friends and family) but that does not mean he is good to the women he wants to ***take*** from. I'm sure this normal, average man was a great son and a good friend. But he's still fucking awful to women he doesn't care about. Behind every ""good man"" is a string of women he used and discarded when they didn't benefit him. Oh, a guy is being SOOO nice to you? How does he treat people (specifically women) he doesn't want something from? Is he a good person, or is he just horny?

We can't control what men do and how they are, but we can control how we let them treat us. We can say ""no"" and not play their little evil games. We can protect ourselves and protect our hearts and bodies from men who haven't earned them. We can grow into women who love our own company enough that we can say ""no thanks"" to low effort, stinky-balled, ratty-ass, porn sick sofa sloths. Block. Delete.

When men (and even other women) say our standards are too high, we should think to all those times when our standards were basically non-existent, and meditate on the gross, disgusting, used, discarded feeling we felt. **And then we should laugh at them.** Laugh at the people who say we're ""picky"" or ""unrealistic"". Laugh at the people who say we should ""settle"". Laugh until we're literally crying from laughing, and then mop our laughter-tears with our degrees and our money and our plane tickets to beautiful remote beaches with our girlfriends that we can afford because we didn't settle for losers. And nobody on those beaches will tell us to settle.

We had an incredible date the other night but at the end of the night I was sad because I felt like we didn‚Äôt progress romantically. We‚Äôre taking a road trip after my exams are done and I‚Äôm thinking about breaking up with him if it doesn‚Äôt happen during the road trip. Does that sound reasonable or should I give him more time? This really is the only issue I have and he‚Äôs definitely HV in every other way. I‚Äôd feel sad letting him go but recently this has been making me feel insecure in our relationship and that‚Äôs not a way I will accept feeling.

And that's a FUCK of a lot of women.

3 of my closest friends are single (all in their 30s like myself) and using OLD right now. Over the last few weeks, they would tell me about their dates, and I would casually respond with FDS methods and ideas. They got excited pretty quickly and just kept asking questions and I just kept laying down facts - I can confidently say they have all adopted the methods. My one friend told off a guys she had been dating for around 2 months pretty much right after I explained how to spot a LVM and asked her why she was accepting such low effort bullshit. My other pal has started to finally question her shit marriage and has started making some absolutely *ruthless* decisions. She has been a Pickmeisha for YEARS, probably one of the worst ones I have ever met. And I wondered why, sitting with one of my worst Pickmeisha girlfriends, I could convince her to try something else so quickly. Why she immediately and without much explanation, understood the concept and could predict the actions of a LVM.

And I realized that while FDS seems ""controversial"" in writing and on Reddit (of all places /s), this is NOT that controversial in your living room, sitting with one of your girlfriends over a glass of wine. They might hesitate at first and ask some questions but deep down, most women are just so so SICK of men's shit. Even the women who don't act like it. Even the women who pretend that everything is good. Most women have had *extremely* similar experiences with men's bullshit - so much so that when we share our stories with each other, we all nod. Have you ever noticed that? No woman ever seems overly surprised to hear about a man's depravity. Because we have ALL been there: cheated on, gaslighted, fucked over, used for sex, lied to, raped, molested, beat. On a fundamental, cellular level, *ALL WOMEN are connected through the pain we carry that has been caused by men* 

But a lot of women have never been given permission to acknowledge their pain, to feel it, to talk about it with anyone else. We are told that it's just the way men are, that we have to be understanding, forgiving, chill, sexy and fun but not too fun, and emotional but not too serious, dont be clingy, dOnT bE lIkE oThEr GirLs. So we don't talk about it with each other, not in a real way. We will tell one another about the shitty thing after it's over, but we don't tell one another about the pathetic Pickmeisha shit we do, like triple texting, paying for all of your dates, getting negged and sleeping with him anyways - and then feeling really devastated when surprise, surprise, he doesn't call. 

   We look to one another for validation that men were shit after they're gone - but we don't talk to one another nearly as much about how our own behaviours are bringing LVM in, and allowing them to stick around. 

  So start having those conversations with the women in your lives. Start slow and gentle with the really entrenched Pick-Me's. Start building your friends up and reminding them that they deserve better. IF YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS IN A SITUATIONSHIP WITH A LVM, START MONOPOLIZING HER TIME. Start asking her to hang out more often and boost that girls self esteem every time you see her. Point out when other men are checking her out and giving her eyes. Get the women you love away from LVM!

&amp;nbsp;

So basically they take advantage of women engaging them in good faith and taking them at their word, and then absolve themselves of responsibility for misleading her later. 

&amp;nbsp;

If women just flat out stop engaging men in good faith, and only entertain men who put up real value upfront, who will be left? 


&amp;nbsp;

They can only wield this fuckery so long as they convince women that being tied to one of them is better than being single. Is it? Has it ever been?

&amp;nbsp;

They‚Äôre convinced this is all biological and innate for us to be attracted to ‚Äúalpha‚Äù type behaviors and even if we were aware of TRP or the true nature of men we‚Äôd still go primarily for fuckboys but I‚Äôm not buying it. 

&amp;nbsp;

Fuckboys are really nothing special and they‚Äôre a dime a dozen - they‚Äôre just manipulative douchebags. 

From personal experience, some of the men who turned out to be fuckboys weren‚Äôt even on my radar that they would do that, and that‚Äôs how I got blindsided. I truly thought we were friends. 

&amp;nbsp;

Sad part is they weren‚Äôt even the hottest or most successful guys I‚Äôd been with so then I just felt doubly stupid getting played by a guy who wasn‚Äôt all that great. So I wasn‚Äôt attracted to their ‚Äúalpha‚Äù - I thought I met men with normal levels of confidence who I could engage with as a friend who was really just there to bag me so he could brag about it and feed his own ego. 

 I think fuckboys are thriving from women‚Äôs ignorance of men‚Äôs emotional abuse then some kind of biological drive for us to  entertain their nonsense.

I view these as two sides of the same coin, a fine line, and the difference is intention. One example given is about calling a guy 'intern' and if your first impression was that he really isn't secure in his career yada yada then you wouldn't use that. If a HVM is dressed in a tailored suit looking like a snack and he knows and you know that he's got it going on then its light hearted because he already knows, and its seen as flirting.  It's about intention: you are attracted to this man and giving him a compliment at the same time. 

Personal example: When I first met my bf it was through a mutual friend, we were all going to a bday party together and waiting for him to arrive at her place after he had taken forever to find parking and was late etc. As soon as he walked in the very first thing I said to him was ""nice fuckboy haircut"". It was saying to him that I noticed it, but also teasing and being a bit of a challenge. It wasn't insulting pointing out an insecurity because my intention was to flirt and that I liked it. If on the other hand I wanted to be insulting and neg him which people CAN AND DO use as a manipulation tactic, you point out something that most likely that person is actually insecure about. I would have said something about his clothes being too big for him when he's a little overweight. I don't want to do that because it would be hurtful, but if someone is that desperate for attention/validation it might work \*if that is the kind of person you are looking for\*. Its weeding the people out that don't respond well to it, kind of like how those Nigerian scammers send outrageous emails, because only the people who reply are desperate enough to do so (PickMeisha).

So monumentally important! They simply can't truly evaluate you as a potential girlfriend without you giving it up.

Bullshit. Let's look at all the ways that in-person dates assess sexual compatability which have NOTHING to do with you getting naked:

- Conversational chemistry, banter, and playfulness. Everyone's sex styles differ, but for many people being able to be cheeky and play off each other's words is paramount. You also get a feel for how well they state and respect boundaries.

- Chemistry chemistry. Eye contact, scent, body language, body shape and size, and up-close vetting of hygienic standards. This is the way humans have fallen in love/lust since the beginning of time. Ever had a conversation with a person who just smells fundamentally *wrong* to you? Not because of obvious body odour, but just something about it is telling you no? That's our basic olfactory vetting for chemistry at work. There are people who have fallen in love from a distance who know upon the first in-person meeting, in one devastating heartbeat, that themselves and the person they're convinced they love are completely sexually/physically incompatible, by pure instinct. Can you imagine?

- Finally, humans evolved to kiss in order to taste one another and assess genetic compatibility. This is not strictly necessary, but it's a good assessor if everything else seems great. I'm aware of no FDS stance on the first kiss, but it stands to reason to do it only when you feel like it, and keep it chaste (in public on a date is a good spot as he will naturally have to behave).

So there you have it. There is NO reason whatsoever to ''assess sexual compatibility'' with actual sex, early on dating. A woman who smells good, looks good, talks good, and kisses well (if she chooses) has given *every* assurance that she is going to be a pleasing partner. If this isn't enough, what could they actually mean?

It is my assertion that a man who pushes the issue is more interested in what he can manipulate or force you to do during sex with him when he talks ''compatibility''. It has earned its spot as a blaring red flag. Dump that trash out the instant he starts pressuring you for sex, especially if he uses flowery language about feelings, compatibility, ''connection'', and other fuckboy buzzwords.",41333,"''Sexual compatibility'' - for the purposes of early dating, he has ENOUGH information!",0,,

I was like fine, although it did hurt as it came out of nowhere, we were together for 2 years and I had started to open up about my needs. But we never really broke up as he wanted to stay friends immediately after the break up.

But he always becomes more attentive. Tells me his schedule for the day, texts more, says he misses me more. 

Is that just him being sensitive and attentive to cheer me up? Or is it some kind of low value reaction to me?

Because sometimes it feels like when I‚Äôm in a good mood, he‚Äôs less attentive. He doesn‚Äôt preemptively tell me he‚Äôs busy at a certain time when we usually talk. He doesn‚Äôt always say he misses me (although saying it all the time becomes meaningless anyway). He typically takes longer to text. 

He sent me a selfie today which he doesn‚Äôt do often. 

Idk. I prob act differently toward him when I notice he‚Äôs in a bad mood or not. So it‚Äôs hard for me to tell.

After years of dating LVMs and being a pickmeisha I finally found what I would call an HVM. We've been dating for 3 years and we've had our ups and downs but he is always very respectful. We always talk out our problems and he treats me like a queen. He pays the bills and is working toward finding his dream job whilst working his current job to pay the bills and his student debt. We've been living together for the last year and a bit and we do spend a lot of quality time together (date nights, long drives, spending the night in sometimes etc).  

Lately (the last 4 months) have been kind of tough, as we haven't been having sex often. When we do he either can't finish or loses his boner during. I have sexy lingerie and toys that I've tried to entice him with but didnt work. We've talked about it and at first he said it's just a regular turn of events, i.e. we've been dating for a while so we're not dying for sexual affection and therefore have sex less, and that he's fine with that. He claims that he's just comfortable and we don't have to be so hot and heavy all the time. 

After a couple of months of having sex once a month though, I brought it up again and this time he claimed its depression/anxiety that's causing him to limp. I'm not sure if this is the case as he still watches porn and masturbates. I know according to FDS porn isn't acceptable but we've generally had a pretty good sex life (i.e. he's not into hard sex or any domination kinks even when I've suggested it). Our sex life was very loving and he was very generous (always goes down on me etc) and seemed to enjoy it. I know porn is harmful but I've snooped around his phone and computer and the porn links I found were mostly 1-1 regular sex or sensual lesbian porn, also didn't find any alarming conversations with girls that would indicate cheating or anything. 

Doing a bit of research it seems ED is pretty common among guys and we've discussed getting some help from a psychologist. Our appointment is in a month but meanwhile I feel very rejected and anxious. We still spend a lot of time together in terms of date night or long drives but it never concludes with sex anymore &amp; it's making me feel really awful. 

I guess I should also disclose that I'm an a recovering addict and therefore cut off all the 'friends' I had before so I dont feel like I have anyone to talk to about this stuff. Is this a 'rough patch' in our relationship or are these behaviours of a LVM and I should end things?",41268,Need some advice,0,,

Anyway, I was here a few days ago asking for advice on how to forgive myself after breaking no contact and texting my ex absolute pathetic nonsense. He finally replied five days later and I just want to shout out to you ladies for your support in helping me frame my position in a HV way, and not talk myself out of having made the right decision for breaking up.

Here‚Äôs the update (paraphrasing):

Context: my ex and I had a bunch of drama over an almost month long period over his refusal to stop following random local women on IG, whom he wasn‚Äôt even acquainted with. We we together 11 months at that point and he ended up blocking me so I wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúcause drama‚Äù with my stalking his followers and ‚Äúobsessing‚Äù over social media. In addition, he refused to post a picture of us despite the fact that we were coming on one year. He made a whole attack on me about my word being worthless on account of in ~February we had agreed to not post about each other, and here I was in ~November/December trying to change the rules. Basically, he stood his ground in every possible way to make me feel most insecure.

My HV breakup text: a couple of days of si lance after I requested space after he called me untrustworthy and stood his ground, I simply wrote him that I had thought things over and the relationship wasn‚Äôt where I needed it  to be by more and I didn‚Äôt want to date him anymore. He wrote back that no worries and wished me all the best.

My panic: I came to believe he had taken up again with an old, old ex of his and panicked that I had driven  him to that (I know) with all the ‚Äúfighting‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt want to leave an open road for this person to - whatever.

Breaking NC: jfc I wrote him we could maybe fix things, that I loved him and knew he loved me and we could find a solution. That if he was with her and it wasn‚Äôt just a rebound well... ü§¢ you get the picture. This was 9 days por breakup. Damn. No reply.

Came here for advice, y‚Äôall talked some sense into me to basically forgive myself and move on. And told me that I was not out of line at all with my social media demands (ie. It‚Äôs not like I was asking for his password, or for him to not add people he actually knew in real life)

Response from idiot: 5 days after my message. Basically that he loved me too, but that he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt with my games‚Äù, with the accusations and the jealousy and that he thought I would never be able to have self control over it. But that he would always remember what he had.

My response (maybe I should have but whatever): I agree, a lot of things weren‚Äôt working. I could never fully cope with you SM behavior (following exes, their relatives, women you don‚Äôt know or barely know). A HVM doesn‚Äôt add randoms on the internet and in addition to being disrespectful and embarrassing, it was highly unattractive. I reflected and you‚Äôre right, it will never work. You want to look for/talk to breaks new women, on an app with no trace of me. Given how you highly pursued me on IG, I realized who I am to stand in the way of your happiness and tell you what to do or not? You know me by now and I would never want to be with a guy who has even the smallest doubt about me, so I wish you luck finding the right person for you because obviously I wasn‚Äôt what you needed and for that reason alone you are not the man for me. Take care. 

I know super long..... but I couldn‚Äôt not. Ugh. I just didn‚Äôt want to be gaslit on record to the fact that my relationship ended because of my ‚Äújealousy‚Äù, when an average  human being with become insecure in those circumstances. 


I‚Äôve seen him typo by a few times but he doesn‚Äôt send me anything. Not that I give a single f.

I‚Äôd rather be single than deluded thinking this guy was committed/serious about me if on top of can‚Äôt be arsed to post a damn picture. Oh, and he‚Äôs followed like 10 women in the two weeks since we split. He‚Äôs 39 - Cringe.



I promise I won‚Äôt reply again, and if he writes anything I will block.

Thank you for the clarity and not letting me backtrack on my own damn self!",41234,UPDATE: Im the girl beating myself up for breaking NC with bf whom I dumped after going refusing to either stop following randoms on IG/post about us!,0,,

Women are constantly self-aware and self-critiquing, modifying our appearance, voice, tone, and attitudes to placate the men in our lives.  We think that if we could just be prettier, chiller, more spontaneous, more exciting (the list goes on), then we will be protected from all the horrible things that we fear -- being cheated on, being told we're too boring, being told we're not attractive anymore to our boyfriends/husbands.  If we just tweek this physical characteristic and that personality trait we'll *finally* get it right.  

But it's not a game we can win.  Men have a variety of words ready in the chamber for when we get out of line.  Bitch, cunt, whore, prude, hoe, thot, slut -- all words that are used to maintain the status quo and make sure women aren't truly free to act and say what they want.

It's easier said than done, but truly removing males' opinions of you is a necessary step toward actual freedom and happiness.  The sting of being called a ""bitch"" is lessened when you realize there's a million different ways to lose this game and if you avoid being called a ""bitch"" they'll just call you something else, eventually.

You can't win the game.  The only winning move is not to play.",41234,It's a Losing Game,0,,

Men can and do fall in love. It‚Äôs quite possible that a man who genuinely is in love with you could also treat you like shit. Love is not the be all end all. In fact, loving is probably the *easiest* part of a relationship. Falling in love is out of your hands, it‚Äôs instinctual, based on chemistry, what have you. But the real value of a person comes from them being able to honor you out of the love they have for you. Not everyone can do this.

Some men genuinely love their woman so much, they feel threatened by other men and become extremely controlling of you. Dump him.

Some men genuinely love their woman so much, they become complacent because they think they‚Äôve nailed their soulmate already. Dump him.

Some men genuinely love their woman, and are willing to go to the ends of the earth for her... until they‚Äôve been married for awhile, the monotony of every day life sets in, and he leaves you for the newer, bouncier, cool girl.

I believe falling in love is one of the most beautiful things that someone can experience, but many people become blinded by it and don‚Äôt realize that the work they put into the relationship is just as important, if not more important than the honest emotion they may harbor inside.

So the next time you‚Äôre dealing with a man that you know *loves* you, ask yourself if there‚Äôs more behind him than his love that is benefiting you. **SIMPLY LOVING IS NOT ENOUGH.**",41229,"Remember ladies, he can genuinely be in love with you, but still treat you like shit.

&amp;#x200B;

* Most men will not even consider marriage before they reach the age of commitment. For 80 percent of high school graduates, the minimum age of commitment is 23, whereas for 80 percent of college graduates, it‚Äôs 26.
* The high-commitment period for most college-educated men is from ages 28 to 33.
* For men who go to graduate school-doctors, lawyers, and the like-the high-commitment period runs from 30 to 36.
* After age 37 or 38, the chance that a man will commit diminishes. After 43, it diminishes even more.
* Most men think sowing their wild oats is a rite of passage and will not even contemplate marriage until they have been working and living as independent adults for several years.
* Men are most likely to marry after they become uncomfortable with the singles scene.
* Men have biological clocks. They want to be young enough to teach their sons to fish and play ball, and to do the male-bonding thing.
* Men who look at marriage as a financial arrangement in which women have the most to gain are not likely to marry-nor are they good prospects. Run... Fast. Men whose parents divorced when they were young are often gun-shy about marrying.
* Men often marry women whose backgrounds ‚Äî religion, politics, values, socioeconomic status matches theirs.
* Men who have their own places and have lived as independent, self-supporting adults are more likely to marry.
* Men whose friends and siblings are married are more likely to marry.
* If a man over the age of 40 has been married before, he is more likely to marry than a 40-year-old man who has never been married.
* If you wish to facilitate a trip to the altar, meet and date only the marrying kind!

I might have to cut my losses though. Maybe he is not able to go beyond. Ugh, sometimes I have this scarcity mentality like when will such a great catch come around again, but if he's not willing to pursue me, wtf can I do? I have to keep the faith that if this was my ideal man, I wouldn't have to chase him or make him see me more as just then how I look.

I see it so often on Reddit, but please add any ‚Äúadvice‚Äù from friends, family, online sources, the general cultural milieu etc. and WHY this advice is totally shit. 

The big Reddit ‚Äúwinner‚Äù is that women should pursue men, and be sexually forward while doing so, and that men love it but they are ‚Äújust shy‚Äù. Before FDS I would feel really conflicted, because of course I‚Äôm a feminist who believes in equality so ON PAPER this seems fair. But I knew in reality every time I tried this, I‚Äôd get rejected or strung along because they made it clear I wasn‚Äôt their dream girl, or the worst of all, a lukewarm ex husband that just went along with what I wanted but never really loved me. And I‚Äôm even a so-called ‚Äúgeek girl‚Äù that these guys swear up and down they would LOVE to be pursed by. My current husband is literally the only man who 100% pursued me and made it crystal clear, I never had to ask where I stood. 

If I countered any of these Reddit dudes with my life experience they‚Äôd just accuse me of wanting all the power, and say men get strung along TOO and how shy and nervous they were and how dare women make them take the risk. They‚Äôd use feminism against me too, or say I was just picking the wrong men or whatever. Thank sweet baby Jesus for this sub, it confirmed what I had always known.

After finishing, I entered this programme for a month. Within 3 days I had a crush on a guy, I liked his personality not looks. Fast forward, I confessed my feelings and rejected me because he didn‚Äôt feel the same. I am totally fine with that. I have moved on and always hoped he would find the one. He had a crush on my friend at that time and she didn‚Äôt pursue it for my sake. I didn‚Äôt ask her to, she chose to herself. 

A month later, I liked a guy for his looks on the first day. He treated me like crap for 2 years. He now has a GF and I am not a fan of both of them because he would verbally harass me and laugh at me without her telling him off. I became emotionally unstable to the point I would cry in the middle of the night and I had a panic attack on the train because of him. I would even physically shake and feel uncomfortable because of the way he would treat me. 

I am fine now. I have spoken to someone for counselling.  

However, during those 2 years, he had a friend who would stare at me, like I meant something. 

I developed feelings for 6 months and had everything planned out. I had written a message to ask him out however, I checked his IG and he follows a lot of girls despite his close friends saying he is ‚Äúlovely‚Äù. I can‚Äôt get him out of my mind. His friends make me uncomfortable. 

I clearly need help because all I think about is guys. I have had people say that I am an ‚Äúeasy target‚Äù, ‚Äúall I think about is guys‚Äù, to the point I feel as if I need a guy.

Never tried dating because we were in other relationships, living in different cities, etc. Now those barriers are gone so we went on a date and we have even more in common than I thought. He's so damn sweet, too. Since I've known him for years and we know mutual people, I can safely say he's an HVM in every respect - his career, finances, values, manners, personality, etc are all what I want in an HVM. 

There's just one problem...he's not physically my type. He's a bit ""husky"". I wouldn't call him fat, husky is honestly the right word for it - he's about 6'3"" so it's fits him better than someone half a foot shorter. You don't look at him and think ""ew""...he's just a bigger dude. Very handsome face so he would be sooo hot if he lost some weight. I'm a petite girl and very into fitness, so have always dated guys who are physically similar. I don't need to date someone who is ripped or even athletic, but I don't know if I can be physically attracted to someone who is on the bigger, softer side. 

What can I do??? Ideally he'd just address it on his own, but that seems unlikely since he's always looked like this (at least in the time I've known him). If we spent more time together and started actually dating, I'd be able to gently push some of my dietary and fitness habits on him, but I know this is something I need to address upfront. I should add that I wouldn't even be wasting my time if I didn't really like him in every other respect and think he's a bonafide HVM. I'm not in the business of attempting to change men with toxic personalities etc, but this man is quite non-toxic and just has one physical trait that I take issue with.

So I have a long history of being a doormat and not only that but being gullible and jumping back into the arms of abusers when they apologize after I find it in me to leave, this last time happened several months ago but thought I'd share. 
I got back with an ex of mine from highschool he was shitty, condescending, rude, manipulative, and just overall gross but we both have the same hobbies and sense of humor and I had low standards. I thought he changed and matured since we'd parted several years ago, at first he talked very differently and he even had a job! But he hadn't changed for the better he actually got WORSE! I left this time when he sexually assaulted me he even knew I had been abused like that before. 
After a while for some stupid reason I still can't figure out I considered giving him yet another chance and trying to work it out. So I wrote down all the awful things he said to me, all his hurtful words, every instance of negging, public embarrassment, jabs at my appearance, picking at known insecurities, degrading requests, and physical and sexual assault, and how I felt every time it happened and how he would just give me some half-assed apology and ""I didn't mean to hurt you"". I didn't run back to him. After writing that list I finally got angry and now I feel like I'm not gonna take shit like that anymore from anybody. I deserve better and nobody deserves to feel worthless or hate themselves because of what some nasty LVM thinks. They feed off of you like leeches. So yeah writing it down might hurt or even seem silly but it's just different having it right there in front of you, running back for more is always so much worse than just getting rid of them. I'm still learning but its a start!

TL;DR Write shit down when he hurts you, don't just keep accepting shitty apologies, don't take him back because he probably hasn't changed, if he hurt you once he will hurt you again.",41977,"Finally decided to help myself, don't just accept I'm sorry repeatedly",0,,

One of the things PickMeisha does is wait for a man if not the man to come along and do the things she wants or says things like ""when x happens then I'll do this"". Queens know the time is now, if we want something we can go do it ourselves and even times have a better experience alone otherwise. It can be scary at first but becomes empowering realizing that the ultimate love is the one you give yourself and MUST before a man. 

Whether you're single or in a relationship always make sure you have your meantime and you are treating YOURSELF as the first soulmate and love of yourself.  If you're single its an amazing opportunity to get to know yourself and what you like/dislike so you can be a more well rounded person. If you're dating or in a ltr/marriage you get to know yourself in a different way, but you must always be aware of the balance and loving yourself 51% more as they say. 

I personally keep lists of ideas and then it also works because when I do want to hang out with someone too that's the beauty of it if I want company I can but if not that's ok too. It's also about being confident and comfortable in your own skin which is very attractive but first and foremost for you.  

&amp;#x200B;

My regrets have always been not doing things I wanted bc I didn't want to go alone. I don't want to experience life this way. Ever since I started doing this I have had some amazing times such as going to pride alone, the movies, restaurants I want to try, shops, parks, museums, touristy things in my city, etc. It's been so much fun and you never know who you will meet. Take stock of your current comfort zone and just push the boundaries a little. 

&amp;#x200B;

For me going to the movies is easy alone because you don't have to talk to anyone but restaurants where I'm just sitting there talking to the staff etc. were so awkward at first, now it's getting better and I'm learning to enjoy myself. This is in addition to being taken out! And it also helps if you are stuck on one person and want to start feeling like you're getting a roster but aren't yet for whatever reason. You literally are busy because you are courting yourself. I also do things like groupons for beauty treatments, meetup, learning new things all the time, reading, general self improvement. Lets make 2020 our best year ever!

I‚Äôm honestly not confident enough in my looks at all, so I was using OLD because it‚Äôs easy. Honestly, I‚Äôm tired of guys only wanting sex from me. I gave myself away to 8 different guys this year since losing my virginity and I‚Äôm ashamed, but sick of this lifestyle. I was naive and got into an abusive relationship with my ex because I didn‚Äôt feel like I deserved more. I fell for a guy who lied to me and said he was looking for a relationship, so I slept with him. And he strung me along as a fuck buddy. I was head over heels for him and finally got over him a month later. I went on 3 dates with an ugly guy who was shorter than me because he was into me and I thought I couldn‚Äôt do any better. Of course I slept with him because I couldn‚Äôt say no. But once I found FDS, I decided to stop settling and have standards. So I kindly rejected him, but then he started threatening to stalk me and show up at my apartment... I wanted to stop finding these LVM, so I decided to have higher standards with the guys J found off OLD (oxymoron I know).


Recently I was chatting with a guy from Tinder who was looking for language exchange friends (common in Japan). I want friends and was taking a break from serious dating to work on myself. He called me to schedule a date later that week. But he flaked and we rescheduled the next day. He then tried to pull a bait and switch and get me to meet at his apartment and stay overnight (because he lives far away). I told him I would be able to stay from 7:00-11:30pm but not overnight because I was uncomfortable... He said it wasn‚Äôt enough time to talk. That seemed like plenty of time to me... My spidey senses were tingling, but since this guy called me to set up a date and told me he wanted to meet jn the afternoon to talk more, I gave him the benefit of doubt. We scheduled a meetup next week. Then he suddenly said he could only meet in the evening. At this point I was sick of always being lied to just to get sex, so I outright asked him if he only wanted sex and told him that I wasn‚Äôt looking for sex. Then he burst out at me and told me I was being rude and that he only wanted friends. He then told me to find someone else and he didn‚Äôt want to have sex with me. 


I know I stuck to my boundaries back then but I felt so bad. I immediately apologized over and over again because I really did want friends and I hate having other people mad at me. He blocked my number and removed me from Tinder. My friends think he was overreacting because he really did just want sex. But I think I overstepped his boundaries and feel really shitty for establishing my own boundaries. I feel like lost what could have been a really good friend. I really liked that he called me before the date...  I‚Äôm afraid that this will discourage me from establishing my boundaries in the future. Do you think I was being rude? Do you think he overreacted or actually did want sex?


How do I stick to my boundaries even when people react this terribly? I‚Äôm a very low-conflict type of person, so I don‚Äôt like to stand up for myself.",41960,I need help sticking to my boundaries and feeling like I deserve to have standards,0,,

I asked advice to my therapist who told me to be patient, to not cut him off and see how it goes. I asked plenty of advice everywhere and people always give me mixed opinions, I was confused af but deep down I knew it wasn't right.
Thank god I didn't fall in love lmao

I met this guy (20 yo) 4 months and a half ago through Reddit. We lived close to each other so we decided to meet up for dinner. It wasn't clear if it was a date or just a friendly dinner but he went near my place to pick me up and drove me back home and we were alone.
As soon as I jumped into the car I immediately felt comfortable with him despite being a socially awkward person in general.

Long story short I had a great time and I got the vibe he was attracted and interested but afterwards no texts so I texted him and immediately asked me out again.

The second time was long and we only talked because the cinema was closed. When I came home I had a weird gut feeling that we weren't a match romantically because we were different on some things.

I had social issues in the past, anxiety and depression and I ended up being kinda isolated (for a combination of things) but he was the opposite and he is indeed a very social guy.

I went on holiday and we regularly talked on Whatsapp but when I came home he was a bit flaky so I thought he wasn't that attracted. 

At some point he randomly suggested a movie night at my place and I was happy, I didn't feel a strong romantic connection but I felt attracted to him physically and wanted to make out etc

That night it was evident he was attracted to me physically but he made a move halfway then regretted it then started with a dramatic monologue about not wanting to use me for sex (he had read a post about me not being into casual sex before) because a romantic relationship would have been forced (I felt the same at that point) but he was into me physically and liked my personality despite not being his type.

He was very interested in me and pushed me to talk about personal stuff and suffering which led me to nearly crying. He wanted to make a move again to do sexual stuff and acted weird but the sexual tension was so great and I just wanted to go for it.

Afterwards we talked about it on Whatsapp and it was all so unnecessary and dramatic. Initially he said he considered staying friends but why the hell did you express your attraction? He could have played cool since we never kissed and they were not official dates. It made things awkward and made us frustrated. 

I suggested being friends with benefits and I was really into the idea for some reason but he said it wasn't a good idea for my mental health and didn't want to date casually.

Later on he wasn't clearly confused and I was too. I gave him some options; stay friends, be fwb or date without any big expectations.

We decided to just see each other and see how it went naturally without a real purpose.

I didn't really want to date and I felt ambivalent tbh but went for it because I didn't want to lose him.

Later on it was a mess, for 2 months we saw each other once a month. If I didn't text him he didn't either for over a week and I was sure he wasn't interested anymore at that point. Also my anxiety made it very bad to deal.
He asked me out then changed plans more than once.

Since he had some excuses I confronted him about it and said that if he wasn't interested then he could just say it bla bla bla
He dismissed it and said he wouldn't have bothered if he wasn't, it wasn't really true etc and he was just busy. (I kinda gave him the chance to back off and he didn't).

I thought I misunderstood so I told him it was my B-day on the 27th of September so I invited him for dinner and cinema. He accepted and the night was fine aside from the fact that he was constantly asking me about my social issues and what I was doing about it. It made me uneasy and he realized so he apologized etc. I asked him if he wanted to be friends and he said he didn't really know in that moment.

Later on I still didn't initiate many texts etc because I felt ambivalent and I wanted him to do¬† it because guys generally initiate etc

We began talking more often and he seemed more into it. He hinted at dinner so a few days later I asked him out (he complained I never initiated and we didn't see each other much for that reason) he said he has his mom's birthday and other stuff. I was like wtf and I felt defensive because it wasn't the first time but he gave me proof and apparently it was true that he has other things planned for a specific day (Sunday I think).
I asked him if maybe I wasn't his type but he said he didn't know etc

We actually went for dinner and that night he was all nice. He hugged me, asked me questions and seemed more into it. I asked him to go at my place and there we kissed for the first time. 

It wasn't that great but I still felt attracted to him and enjoyed his company, it was my first kiss and I got anxious because he went too strong and it was leading to foreplay.
I stopped him and he apologized etc, he was very nice about it so it wasn't a problem.

He was considerate afterwards and asked me about it, he initiated the idea of going for a trip for a day in a nearby city etc

Things were fine but I didn't really feel a spark but I didn't want to end it too.

I wondered how much time it takes to fall in love (I don't really believe in love at first sight and immediate in love feels) and decided to give it time.

He began texting me 2-3 times a week, asking me out more frequently and wanted to see me more often. I enjoyed his company and started being more into it (dating etc).

Long story short I started liking him more and I also went to my other apartament near where he lives so he could visit.

There we kissed again and did some foreplay. This time I was more comfortable and I enjoyed it..
We were supposed to see each other again the day after but he bailed because his mother was sick. I gave it the benefit of the doubt since after what he has been through he wouldn't have lied about something like that (his father died of cancer when he was 16). Then he bailed again with another excuse but through the day he texted me and said he wanted to come visit to make up for it.

I was confused because he was distant later on and he told me he was going through an hard time and feeling depressed for no reason. He never gave me the vibe of being a liar but I still felt paranoic and anxious a lot because it was a constant game of hot and cold.

I asked him if he liked the encounter but tried to avoid talking about it. The second time he said it was fine and very natural but he had an hard time having an emotional involvement.
He wasn't in love and it was more physical than emotional even though he had an emotional involvement for a while.

I got angry and felt stupid because he had a change of attitude lately and I thought the pursuing meant he was interested.

He still acted interested and said he wanted to continue seeing each other to see if it could evolve. Last time it took 6 months to fall for a girl he had known forever so I considered waiting.

We saw each other and talked for an hour and he said he wanted to be honest etc. We talked about relationships etc and later on we held hands and kissed.

We texted me again a lot, every 2 or 3 days then like 3 times in the span of two days.

I came back home happy from the night out but then I realized it was NOT a good sign and I was in¬† a bad mood. I wanted to avoid him and at the same time continue..
I tried to see him to see him for sushi but he said no because he didn't want to eat it then we went to Mcdonald's because he asked me out .

He seemed to act normal and he began to ask again about my social issues but then it escalated quickly and shit went south real quick.

He clearly didn't understand my issues and he clearly said he didn't but it made me uneasy again.
He mentioned another girl (the best friend of his best friend) who was going through an hard time, how great she is and she was pretty bla bla bla

It pissed me off and kinda asked him why tf he was talking about another girl with me. He dismissed it and said he wasn't interested in her because she was a close friend of a friend, he was not her type and mostly she was involved another dude etc

Later on he told it pissed him off¬† because it was innocent and petty and I got jealous.
We prolonged the date and talked for at least an hour and half and two more.
I was about to jump out of the car and he put his hand on my leg and we kissed quickly. I impulsively asked how things are between us and he said sometimes good and sometimes bad.

I wondered what was bad and he said I didn't seem ready for a relationship, there are some things about me he doesn't like and he is trying to figure it if there is potential.

I didn't want excuses and BS so I clearly asked if my personality was the issue. Turns out he thinks we don't have intimacy, we have different lifestyles and interests and he is not sure if there is a future because he doesn't have feelings.
I never hid my interests and I don't understand how it took him over FOUR months to realize.
I kinda pushed him to say those things and I wondered why tf he dragged it and he said he wanted to find stuff in common etc

Long story short one thing led to another and we were not just friends anymore at some point and he changed his mind quickly from the last time we saw each other.

I got very angry and said he was constanly changing his mind etc, he didn't want to talk about it that night bla bla bla. I was like ""then you aren't interested romantically anymore?"" And he said no because being interested doesn't mean necessarily in a romantic sense.
He wondered if I don't want to continue because it may seem ambiguous etc (wtf) but he cares a lot about me.

I called him out and he yelled at me that I have toxic beliefs and he wasn't just sure but what if I didn't bring it up?

I got out of the car without even saying bye, I blocked him for two days on Whatsapp then unblocked him. I also deleted his phone number and the old chats (over 7k messages! It hurt to see).

After 10 days I felt better and wanted to recover the connection and stay at least friends since we talked about personal stuff, he always said he liked my company and dates were very great etc

I texted him and he was so salty, he said he didn't want to be friends because of my bad vibes and it was hurting him. I didn't just started annoying him but it has been continuing for a while and he cared more about his mental health. He said he cared about me a lot and that the last time he saw each other was a BEAUTIFUL night and that I  ruined it with my questions about dating, he even got angry and yelled at me etc

I replied with FACTS since he has always said he enjoyed my company, the past weeks were very good even though he was not in love, he never said I was annoying and said this was a problem at all. Also it's not that I talked about my issues all time, it happened maybr 2 or 3 times, also I did it because I trusted him...I didn't want to seem nagging so I asked him too once or twice.

We were not official and didn't have labels so it wasn't  a official breakup. He blocked me everywhere and put his IG on private. 

He seemed salty and unfriendly when all I did was trying to be friends after he said he didn't feel a romantic connection. I wouldn't asked if he said he was in love because it would have been cruel. He talked as if having me around killed him or something.

He contradicted himself like 10 times and it's so annoying, I feel like I wasted nearly 5 months for nothing.
He did everything by himself. He contacted me and decided to date me even though I was problematic for him (depression and anxiety issues) and now suddenly he acts like I stabbed his dog.


I feel salty about I wasted nearly 5 months. I didn't get a boyfriend nor a friend, not even sex so wtf

I discovered this sub in September I think but I wasn't sure about it because it has a bad rep and it was often compared to incel subs.

I just don't understand what the fuck was even point he could get sex by being fwb so why bother with all this shit? I was into it because I clearly didn't see as bf material. It didn't bother me that much.

I know I need to move on etc but it just happened and it was shitty because I thought we had a connection that wasn't necessarily romantic.

He may be hurt or dealing with his BS but fuck try to be more decent at least, he didn't even respond and blocked me everywhere.

I know a fellow med student who work at a hospital and he admited while joking that when he want to sleep with a nurse he‚Äôs straight forward and ask her if she want to go to his apartment but when it‚Äôs with a doctor woman he invite her to a dinner first and is more lovey dovey and romantic with her!

It‚Äôs honestly bug me how a successful man is seen as more attractive and is praised for being accomplished but a woman is never valued for that while it‚Äôs a requirement if she want to level up and have higher standards, which mean that she‚Äôs expected to be successful but also prettier, caring and feminine!! This hypocrisy is killing me!

He started off by saying he likes how I carry myself in a presentable way (whatever that means), how I have a nice demeanor (no shit I do, I work in customer service, it‚Äôs kind of my job to be nice?) and then asked me out to dinner. I pretty much just ignored him and told him to ‚Äúhave a nice day‚Äù and luckily it didn‚Äôt escalate any further.

Whereas on FDS, the most common advice I see is always some variation of ""don't put up with abuse and bullshit"" - speak up for yourself, next him, leave him if he can't treat you right, don't waste energy on assholes, etc. etc.  It seems to me that FDS generally advocates being truthful - being upfront with what you expect rather than pretending that you're okay with less. The exceptions are things like not disclosing your sexual history, but the reason behind that is mainly to protect yourself from harm and abuse from insecure men as we've seen in recent examples.

Another thing is how the men on these subs view women as a whole - we're all goldiggers, hoes, only good for sex, brainless, without morals, subhuman.  But on FDS, all the strategies point to the fact that indeed NOT ALL MEN, because we are looking for the HVM we know exist.

All my life I've been told by society that I need attention and validation from a man to be happy so a few months ago I decided to flip the script. Right now I have two guys I'm seeing as well as a couple others I rotate from time to time so I don't get too attached. Each of these guys is cute enough and well off enough to be a decent match for me but I treat them all like I'm doing them a favor whenever I spend time with them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Each of these guys is expected to take me out to decent places and to pay whenever we go out. If he's cheap or doesn't want to cover the check, then I kick him to the curb. Each of these guys knows that I'm seeing other people and is expected to be okay with it while still putting time and effort into treating me like a prize and not a booty call. No fuckboys allowed. Each of these guys is expected to go down on me every time we hook up before, if I feel like it (usually like a quarter of the time), I let him get his dick wet.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

These are the baseline expectations I've started having for every guy I'm seeing, I don't give them any special attention or gratitude beyond a curt ""thank you"" for doing what they're expected to do. If they want more attention and validation from me they'll only get it if and when they go above and beyond.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The results were genuinely shocking to me. Not only did it work, it worked with flying colors. I got far more attention and effort from every guy I've been seeing casually these past few months then I normally do in the first year of a committed relationship. I've had guys text me nonstop, go the extra mile whenever we go out, and outright ignore flirting from other girls because they're so desperate to win my approval. Plenty of these guys are hot enough that they could easily go on tinder and find some PMAB willing to put out on the first date and yet they're still desperate for every scrap of attention that I give them. I've even had the two guys I've been spending the most time with both practically \*beg\* me to commit to them, which I politely refused because I'm not ready for another long term relationship yet and am pretty happy with the way things are right now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still pretty new to FDS and this has only been a few months of me doing this. I've definitely had my share of setbacks and I obviously still have a lot to learn, but I'm genuinely surprised by how different I was able to make my dating life once I realized my own value and started flipping the script. The idea that we need guys more than they need us is a load of shit. Make a guy need you and make him beg for every scrap of attention and validation and he'll treat you like a queen.",41921,For the last several months I've tried making guys crave my attention and validation.

Think of a man you dated that you thought was high value that wasn't. Someone who appeared put together and seemed to be exactly what you wanted- until the moment his mask slips and reveals the low value trash he was all along. Then write a completely honest dating profile for him in the comments. Have fun with the username too! 

If you've never dated a man like that, write a profile for the so-called male friend who proved he wasn't actually interested in your friendship, just your body. Do it for the skeeze that broke one of your friends hearts. Do it for the male relative who you know is never going to marry any girl. The married teacher who was far too fond of underage girls but avoided all consequences. We all know a man who pretends to be gold when he's trash. 

I'm hoping that these examples will illustrate the ways men lie, and we can use these examples as red flags to watch out for while employing FDS in our dating lives. Some of these might be a little graphic. My example is about a physically abusive ex who raped me, so proceed with caution.

Me first:

USERNAME: YourBiggestRegret

Looking for a pseudo-mommy, not an actual relationship. I don't want kids, which is great for you because you'll spend all your time raising me- not because my mom was terrible (she's actually going to be the one good point of dating me, tbh. You'll actually miss her when you inevitably come to your senses and dump me), but because I refused to learn from her example. It's far easier to convince women that I'm just useless than bother to put in any sort of effort in to improving as a person. 

I'm also not much to look at- we met through a friend when you were feeling weak and believed that maybe you were just being shallow when you wanted a man to be attractive to you, and I made a point to pretend to be kind and generous in the beginning. I pretended to be politically similar to you (men can't be feminists, silly, it was a tactic to get laid) and asked you about your interests, which is better than like half the men you deal with on a regular basis, so ha- I'm in. I'm capable of basic hygeine (3 in 1 bottles line my bathroom, and I shower- though yiu wouldn't be able to tell because I haven't learned to shower before sex or at least run a washcloth over basic parts), but it's offset by my Hitler Youth haircut and Shaggy-inspired pube beard. My mom buys my clothes, and aside from scrubs (don't get too excited, I'm a medical assistant not a nurse or surgical tech, and I'll get fired from that job in less than a year for fucking up patients medical charts and getting caught) I wear a five pack of white t-shirts from Walmart with cargo shorts and a black hoodie as a uniform. I'm so pale I'm translucent, and that little extra weight I marked off on the profile was a lie- I'm over double your weight. You can fit two of you in my jeans, but I lied and said I was only forty pounds heavier than you, until you caught me on the scale. I then blamed you for breaking it, and I'm a champion gaslighter- you're going to cringe later on when you realize how far you went to lie to yourself in order to give me the benefit of the doubt.

While we're on the topic of my lies: I lied about having OCD. It's just an excuse I use so I can pretend to have a mental breakdown and get scot-free away from verbally abusing you and get you to feel guilty for expecting me to be a functioning adult- after all, if you just cleaned everything perfectly while holding down a job and going to school and mommying me, I would have no reason to be angry... oh, I'm lying again here. I don't need a reason to be angry or abuse you, I'll just make up something anyway. My mom will tell you to leave me when she finds out from you that I was lying about my mental health.

On top of all this: I suck in the sack. I'm one of those men who cope with the fact that they broke their dick from watching porn and giving themselves a fetish by pretending it actually makes me good in bed, and that men who can actually get off without scarring their own dick are vanilla and boring. I need you to tell me how much you want another man instead of me, because if you aren't constantly dirty talking me and humiliating me, my dick will soften immediately and i'll blame you for my erectile dysfunction. I'll do that anyway, because even though it's me that needs the same stimulation every time, everyone knows its the women's fault for everything, ever. I also worship my own cock, and occasionally other men- but I keep that quiet, because you wanted monogamy. Never mind that you don't care about me being bisexual- I'm going to pretend you were only upset about me being with men and ignore that you would have been just as upset about me cheating with women, because it's more conveinant to pretend you were homophobic than admit I fucked up. If I were born hundreds of years ago, I would have settled for writing an ode to my masculine superiority and pointificated about my penis with fellow intellectuals who read Freud, but alas I was born in the modern age, so here- here's a dick pic. LOOK AT MY PENIS!!! LOOK AT IT!!! It's spectacularly average, with bonus scars! I demand you worship it as much as I do. I demand you find me appealing even after I consistently act like a small child that you need to mother, and being my pseudo mom doesn't get you out of duty sex. I will badger you, coerce you, pout, sob, whine, and gnash my teeth. I will melt down and beg, and when I rape you, I will criticize your performance, because even though I'm holding you down and you're crying, starfishing is unacceptable. Porn stars pretend to enjoy rape, why can't you?

I'm going to be your biggest regret. Message me pls!

I didn't like him that much at first sight but I quickly fell for it after we kissed. He knew how to seduce.

He would send me cute morning messages and excuse himself for being so busy and taking too long to reply.

He would call me when he was grocery shopping, once a week maybe, then end the call when he got back home.

He didn't even pay my uber when I once went to his house.

He paid for like a few coffees on the times we went out. Next day we stopped at a store and he couldn't even offer to pay for my bagel.

Never bought me a single thing. Never. No flowers, no presents

Was enthusiastic to suggest to meet in the beginning, but then slowed down.

Never called me on a proper date. Out of all of the times we met, he initialized maybe 2 or 3.

At some point he ignored a message for days. Would leave me without reply a lot.

After I told him I was trying to get over him and hurting and him rejecting to be in a relationship, he told me he dreamed of us being a couple

He told me 'I think I can do better' (than me) and he wants to keep searching. ""But please don't feel insecure"" yada yada.

He has setting so you can't see the last time he was online or if he's read your messages.

He probably blocked me for a day or two at some point, probably a new girl.

I can count on my fingers the times he asked about my day.

He rarely asks me questions about myself, and when he does, he doesn't seem to be actively listening and quickly changes the subject.

He even suggested to be in an affair with be if I get into a relationship.

He tried to open to me about his past and how he just has a lot of things on his mind and relationships comes last.

He told me he fell only a few times. I'm not one of those few times.

He told me from the start he doesn't feel a spark, but 'he didn't believe in choosing someone based on it'

He doesn't believe in missing someone and is too concentrated on other tasks and on himself.

He said my way of loving was 'cute', like a girl who has not had her heart broken, one without much experience.

I left him a long message and two weeks later he is still putting off to read it.

He even tried to seduce me into staying fwb with him.

I put up with all of this wanting to not be clingy, wanting to impress him, I may have taken the challenge when he said he was not looking for a relationship from day one. In the middle of this journey I found this sub. I'm ready to kick him out!

I'm here with another set of OLD questions. I've been OLD on and off for about a decade but I want to do it right by FDS this time. 


I know coffee/drink dates are generally regarded as a ""no,"" but is it possible to do one then wait for a more elaborate date (dinner/museum/bowling etc)? 


Pros of a coffee date: I want to vet a guy's personal hygiene and if we click, hence the appeal of a coffee date. If it is just coffee or drinks, I can ""nope"" out of there sooner. And if the coffee is nearby other places, the date can be extended. 


Or, should I just video chat with him at some point and wait for him to ask me out on a more elaborate date? 


I got a Google Voice number in case a guy wants to take communication off an app (and I can actually talk to him prior to the date). I know a previous post said 2 days max for a guy to ask you out if you take communication off the app. If you keep communicating with a guy off the app, how long is a reasonable time to wait for him to ask you out? 


I live in west bumblef***, so how long of a distance is reasonable for a guy to travel to me? In the past, I have met guys halfway (often driving 45 to 75 mins) and it was frankly exhausting to primp, drive, have a date where a guy treats for expenses but kind of treats you like a male buddy, then you go home and have him ghost you. Are there any circumstances I should meet someone halfway? 


Also, I realize the issue of safety first, so I will insist on meeting a guy somewhere rather than him picking me up and be sure to mention the important male family figures in my life. I will try to do a background check when I get a guy's first and last name but will wait the longest time possible to give my name.

If a man does not like animals and especially cats then he is a LVM. I know many people are just more into dogs but hear me out. I'm not talking about those who feel bad for birds sitting in a cage at home or feel bad for cows or horses and believe they should be free in the wild. I'm talking about those who can't stand animals and especially dislike or hate cats.

Imagine it, if a person cannot like anything outside of his specie is he really a human? because for years human were always friendly with dogs, cats, cattle, chickens, goats. We always had a way with animals and it's easy to connect with them. If a person cannot like anything outside of his specie then he is egoistic and lacks empathy. How can one look at a puppy and not like it or find it adorable? 

They don't like animals because animals need to be taken care of. Therefore he will most likely not like kids either. Kids are more responsibility and care and for a person who simply cannot feed a cat it will be too much. Babies cry and sometimes they're very loud, if a person hates a quiet animal how would he deal with a loud baby? will most likely stay away from it or not know how to deal with a baby or a young child.

And last, men who hate cats because they're 'dog people' - it means they don't like cats because a cat will not like you if you don't like him and a cat has his own personality and he knows what he likes and what he doesn't like. A dog would be the opposite, he has unconditional love regardless of what you do, they want their women to be obedient, love them 24/7 and do everything the man says like their dogs. If you don't like a cat because of a trauma as a child it's normal you'd be scared of them or try to stay away from them but most of the people who consider themselves a 'dog person' would not like cats because they are not obedient.",42878,Men who dislike animals and especially cats are a red flag,0,,

Everyone knows that to some extent. However, I never stopped to reflect on why this culture is so pervasive until I realized one thing: All my heartbroken friends come crying to me, asking for advice about the EXACT SAME THINGS yet NEVER hold their men accountable or leave

What do they complain about you ask? It always boils down to the fact that boyfriends are shit stains who add ZERO value to their lives. Obviously they don't say that. They just say ""he doesn't listen"", ""he is talking to his ex"", ""he only hits me up for sex"", or insert more bullshit. Lots of talk of video games and night out drinking (and all the ""accidental"" drunk horny behavior with other girls that comes with it of course). Tried and true low-effort behavior. People come crying to me because they think I'm so strong and brave because I immediately break things off with worthless men. They seem to value my advice so you think they'd evaluate how I approach dating but nope. They just want to vent to me and have me make excuses as to why they should stay with their scum boyfriends. So basically they want me to validate their delusions. Obviously I'm not going to do that, and obviously I'm not convinced that whatever occurred was a one-time thing for which the boyfriend is extremely repentant. Whatever, but it pisses me off that I give advice that people ASK for but I end up being that bad guy because apparently I'm ""taking his behavior out of context"" and ""too harsh"" on men that wouldn't visit these girls in the hospital if they fell ill on the spot. 

I had a friend complain to me about her boyfriend texting exes and downloading Tinder while drunk at frat parties. However, she had no intention of breaking up with him because he got no matches and the exes weren't interested in him. She loved going on about how nothing happened, but didn't think about the INTENT or the DISRESPECT. She ignored my advice to dump him and he ended up cheating. Wow no one saw that coming. She didn't come to me for that heartbreak!

I have had multiple friends complain about their boyfriends canceling plans and only making time for sex. However, they believe their boyfriends when they say they're ""busy"" and ""overwhelmed"" with work when in reality they all smoke weed every night and play video games. Of course I tell these girls they're being used, but they don't want to hear it. I had one friend tell me how her boyfriend made her pay for both of them during their mcdonald's date because he was feminist (lol I know the guy and he complains about college sluts and gold diggers) 

No matter what low-effort behavior these women are faced with, they shift blame away from their boyfriends and make excuse after excuse. Nothing changes and resentment grows. My advice goes unheeded. This is why college relationships are mostly jokes. I just want to show all these women this sub to cast away the yoke of pickmeitis. I want them to recognize these men's tactics and understand FDS terms that benefit them.",42837,This sub explains EVERYTHING,0,,

He asked to meet up for lunch on the Saturday (see recap below) and I almost didn‚Äôt go as the plans seemed fuzzy even up to the actual day.
2.	Peter - 48, creative designer with a big corporation, also a hobby painter (very talented too!). He had messaged me directly on OKCupid before I came across his profile months later. I matched with him as I wanted to ask about his age discrepancy (profile set at 38, text in bio said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not actually 42‚Äô....) he admitted he‚Äôs 48 but feels young at heart. We kept chatting over time and he asked me out for the Sunday date (recap below).
3.	Damien - 38, Sous chef and recently divorced. Met through friends, as nerdy and obsessed with pop culture and sci-fi as I am and the person I most enjoy talking to. Way too busy with work and family (four year old child, shared custody) for anything to develop at the moment but makes sure to reach out daily and communicates that he wants to get to know me better. 
4.	Ken - 33, professional removalist. Laid up in hospital the entire time we‚Äôve been talking (three weeks) with a major foot injury incurred on his job.  Managing his expectations atm, feels like his cabin fever of being stuck in a hospital bed has put too much pressure on a connection here. He bought me a present of some kind online and talks about how he wakes up thinking of me - all after only texting during this time. He‚Äôs out of hospital on Sunday and I want to see how the energy changes as he gets back to normal life. 
5.	Michael - 42, financial... something? He doesn‚Äôt like to talk about work and he‚Äôs on probation for taking about sex and ‚Äòsnuggling‚Äô twice. Continually tells me how gorgeous I am when he ‚Äògoes back to look at my profile‚Äô, but insists he‚Äôs looking for a relationship and not a hookup. Against my better judgement I have agreed to go out to dinner tonight after work, making him drive across the city to see me and I picked the venue to fit into my schedule easily. 
6.	Cameron - 38, motoring safety coordinator. Hottest guy of the lot, so friendly and of the bunch feels like the most HVM purely at face value. Went out for dinner last night, recap on the way. 
7.	Richard - 44, mechanic. Not a lot in common, bit of a ‚Äòdad‚Äô energy going on and feels like he might be too old for me but chatting and phone calls so far, taking it slowly as I don‚Äôt know if I want to meet up yet. Literally feels like talking to my father. 
8.	Tim, 40 - chef/construction labourer. We ‚Äòmet‚Äô on okcupid last year and started talking again when I redownloaded last month. I cancelled a date last week when he refused to send through a recent selfie (his OLD profile hasn‚Äôt been updated and it‚Äôs a single headshot). He‚Äôs since apologised profusely and sent photos to make amends, and I‚Äôve learned why there are no pics - grossly overweight even though his profile says ‚Äòaverage‚Äô body. He wants to arrange another date however and keeps calling and chasing. Not convinced. 

**The dates** 

* Saturday - Met Simon in the city, as I was already going in to do some clothes shopping for work. First impression was that he was shorter that his bio says (about 5‚Äô5 compared to the 5‚Äô9 he listed), but well dressed and very handsome. Headed down to the river and then he could not decide where to eat and was being really picky with cuisine and food dislikes. Shits me to tears - make a damn decision! Finally picked a place, food was great and he picked up the tab. Sat in a park near the water for a while and learnt more about each other. Our schedules don‚Äôt match and he lives with his parents at the moment to save money so would make it harder to connect regularly if we ever progressed to the sleepover or lazy house chill stage. Totally not what I‚Äôm looking for in a partner atm. He‚Äôs messaged a few times afterwards to check in, but no plans to meet up again. 
* Sunday - Peter suggested we ‚Äògo for a walk‚Äô for our first date and I said no and that I needed to meet in public and would prefer to have a meal together. While he pulled his finger out and booked a restaurant when pushed, he drove me completely up the wall in person with his inability to function as a normal human being. Complained about not understanding Melbourne‚Äôs dining culture - apparently he goes out for dinner once every six months or so so he thinks it‚Äôs a waste of time and money. He also only talked about himself the entire time, I felt like I was holding a job interview. Finally, he denigrated my career choice and achievements and all the while I was just marvelling at how absurd he was being for someone trying to make a good dating first impression. He picked up the tab, we parted ways at the door and I unmatched him and deleted his number when I got home. He messaged later that he had a good time and I thanked him for the day out and haven‚Äôt heard from him again. 

**Insights** 
* Nothing annoys me more than indecisiveness, pick a date, a time,  a place and meet me there ready for the experience. Don‚Äôt faff around deciding what to eat or drink. Have a plan üëè Stick to the plan üëè Don‚Äôt waste my time üëè Both these dudes this week need to work on their organisational skills, stat! 
* I don‚Äôt want to date men who are living with their family, I don‚Äôt want to hang out with your parents every time I come visit you if we are dating. Save that for Sunday dinners and special occasions. If you live with your folks and you are &gt;35, nothing it going to happen between us. 
* If you don‚Äôt like the processes of dating (actually going out on dates to eat food and drink)... don‚Äôt put yourself out there to date people? Or if you do dust yourself off to go out to eat and drink don‚Äôt then complain about having to do it, it makes you a tedious bore.
* It‚Äôs getting closer to the holiday season and the men are thirsty, clingy and needy. There is a lot of love-bombing and future-planning going on with some of these guys and if I was a weaker person I would be totally swayed by their platitudes. Instead I keep reminding the offenders that it‚Äôs too early to be making those kind of big statements and I prefer to take it slow. There‚Äôs a general wave of desperation coming off all the single guys atm as they try to lock someone down for the holidays. Be wary ladies.",38221,"Dating Report - W/E 1st Dec, 2019",0,,

That's bullshit.

(Designer shoes are cool - but that's not why we want a man who makes money and manages it well.)

It's good if you make money yourself as well, of course - but that doesn't mean anything if you then choose a man who makes none. He will drain you.

So I'll just explain why **I** am extremely fucking happy I chose a man who makes money and manages it well. If you ever feel like, ""Oh no, maybe I'm being too shallow,"" when refusing to date men who don't make, and competently manage, money, think about this:

My fifteen-year-old daughter needs a therapist. She has been experiencing extreme anxiety and panic attacks. People do not typically seek out therapists when they're feeling fine - they seek out therapists when they don't know what else to do. So she needs one now.

Do you know how many therapists there are for children and adolescents? 

Answer: not many. (And there are even fewer psychiatrists for children.) As I discovered, every goddamn therapist who treats children *and who took our insurance* had a waitlist. A waitlist so long that it would at least take months for her to get off it, and maybe years. There is apparently a massive shortage of mental health treatment providers for children and adolescents. I didn't know that before - it's the kind of thing you don't learn until it's too late.

Because my husband makes a significant amount of money, we were able to go outside of our insurance. I found a therapist for her who does not accept our insurance, but that's okay because we can pay for it. That therapist has referred us to a particular adolescent psychiatrist a month from now - one who doesn't take any insurance at all, and who charges 200 dollars per appointment. That may sound like bank robbery, but it fucking thrilled me since it's apparently impossible to find a psychiatrist who will treat adolescents and who doesn't have a waitlist the length of the universe. 

That's not shallow, is it? 

That's why you should only date men with money. Because someday it will be very, very important.",38223,Why it's not shallow to insist a man be financially capable,0,,

Or ‚Äúthere was no spark, I just wasn't feeling it, sorry‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe spark‚Äù can come from 3 different places... good, bad and behaviour.

A good spark can be instant, mutual sexual attraction. Your body has decided ‚Äúwe gonna bang‚Äù and make pretty babies. They smell good, they have a nice body shape, they move well, their eyes crinkle just right when they smile.

A good spark can also take time to build. If your libido is based on trust, safety and security, it will take over a month of consistently kind, trustworthy interactions with someone to start warming up to them. This kind of healthy spark will deepen into a different kind of love.

A bad spark can be from an attempt to recreate whatever went wrong with your childhood. Yes, Daddy issues. Usually an absent, selfish, narcissistic, emotionally unavailable, defective or disordered parent. The same behaviour on a date triggers your survival mechanisms and a sense of familiarity. The anxiety of needing to earn love and approval feels like ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù and a ‚Äúgood match‚Äù. It's not good. It's trauma. It's a dysfunctional dynamic.

If you meet a healthy man who's consistent and gives his love freely, it doesn't cause anxiety, so it feels ‚Äúboring‚Äù.

The same is true for men who had a borderline or otherwise inconsistent, unavailable mother. Why do men keep sticking their dick in crazy? Because women with no impulse control and unpredictable mood swings, who fear abandonment and make huge romantic gestures, keep men on their toes, and the sex is exciting.

Another bad spark could be your attachment style. Anxious/obsessive are very attracted to dismissive/avoidant. The avoidant thinks they're ready for a relationship and starts dating, then realises they feel smothered and pull back. This activates the anxiety and obsession, which feels like a spark.

A more malignant and deliberate spark could be TRP/PUA tactics, which mimic narcissism and the push/pull of anxious/avoidant. They use the creation of anxiety and the relief to keep you on a rollercoaster. Emotional manipulation to create drama and feels, and to keep you confused and guessing. Fear, Obligation and Guilt to coerce you into sex.

Finally, a not-so-bad lack of spark could be that the dude just has no game. No seduction skills, an unwillingness to escalate both physically and conversationally. He doesn't know how or when to slip in some light teasing or innuendo. He doesn't know how to display his sexual interest at an appropriate level. Either he never learned, or he's well aware of his sexual feelings and is keeping himself tightly wound so as to not scare off the lady.

It's a huge range of behaviours between appearing bland like Mr Rogers, and being a grabby creeper on the first date, and some men just can't manage it. So they pick one extreme.

This is why getting to know someone before dating them is becoming important. Meeting strangers off dating apps is just going to get you men who expect sex by the 3rd date, where you have no time to gauge his character, which type of spark it is, or if you can build a spark.

A healthy man with the possibility to build a spark will consistently treat you well.

A bad spark will have elements of anxiety, confusion, doubt and even fear.

# My boyfriend's ex is getting married in a week and I'm excited

üì∑

So my boyfriend has this ex that he was with when he was 16. She became somewhat of a 'one that got away' for him for many years. As they broke up because she cheated on him a year into dating but over the course of the next 6/7 years they would meet up on occasion. It seemed to be a cycle of whenever he was single again after dating someone, she'd magically appear in his life, get his hopes up that they were getting back together only to eventually leave again. We're 23 years old now. I have been in a relationship with him for about 9 months now and I really like him, I like him a whole lot actually. He's the first guy I've ever seen a real future with, I love his family and really want to become a part of it one day.His ex got engaged about a year ago to a guy in America that she'd been dating for about 3 months. My boyfriend was quite upset I think when he found out (I wasn't with him at the time nor knew him but I can only assume considering he was obsessed with her for 6 years)I feel so pathetic how excited I am about her wedding finally coming in just a weeks time. She'll finally, 100% be out of his life for good and it'll never play on my mind whether they will get back 'together' again. He has told me her no longer has feelings or thinks about her anymore as he has found what he has been wanting all those years (I am that apparently) I believe and trust him fully because I believe he is a very genuine person and only says what he means. Anyway, the reason I'm posting this is because there's not really anyone I can tell of my excitement for this. My mum died recently and she was always my go to person for any nonsense gossip and my dad is the absolute worst because he just gives a guy response and doesn't understand and my female friends live miles away so stupid girly gossip is hard.I fully realise how sad and pathetic it is to be so excited about your bf's ex getting married because she's out there in America living her best life getting married lmao and I'm here sat in my shitty apartment probably more excited about it than she is lol.

# I [22/f] let my bf [21/m] know of my past and he immediate ended it

üì∑[**/r/all**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/search?q=flair_name%3A%22%2Fr%2Fall%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)

I'm so devastated. I was dating this guy for 5 months, and honestly was starting to fall pretty hard for him. I found myself telling him things I couldn't even tell my therapist, let alone a partner. However, after drinking one night in and fooling around we started talking about past relationships. I had confessed that my ex, a year ago, had cheated on me. The night I found out, I went out and cheated out of revenge before ending it. I know it wasn't right, and it honestly only made me feel more disgusting about the whole situation.

Essentially he just went silent for a second, got up and explained that ""He doesn't date people who cheat, or help others cheat"" and that it's best if we just end it now."" Then left. I tried explaining more but he just shut me down and left and now doesn't really want to talk. He will respond, but it's clear hes only doing the bare minimum to not hurt my feelings.

Is there any chance I can repair this? I know my past was wrong, but honestly I just finally felt open enough with someone to let it out for once.

tl;dr: Cheated in past relationship and finally confessed to bf, he left immediately. I am at a loss. I called in sick to my morning job today and have basically just cried all day and I don't know what I'm going to do. I want to convince him that it was the past and that he means so much to me I would never.

Edit: This blew up while I was at work so I'll fill in a few gaps I have seen. I summarized ""it's best we end it"" when I should have put, ""it's best we end it now, rather than in a year when I resent you like hell.""

I know I'm degrading myself, but I was open because he is actually the most amazing man I have ever met. I know everyone will say ""you're 22, what do you know"" but I have been dating since I was a young teenager. I have met all kinds of boys and men in my life, and I can with certainty he is one of the best. I want him back and would be willing to do anything, but most of all I just want him to be happy. With, or without me.

   *  The goal for 2020 is to be an entire year of non-stop leveling up, and an entire year of entertaining ZERO fuckboys. 

I am deleting my OLD apps, upping my self-care routine, committing to reading more, focusing on my personal and professional goals, and carving out a lot more me-time this month.

* You know you are the one who shapes your dating life. 
   * You are not at the mercy of LVM who keep you guessing or play hot and cold anymore.
   * You actively vet, cut off LVM, and stay true to your principles and standards.

Take the same principles and apply them to every area of your life. 

Is your boss assuming you'll work overtime? Make it clear you won't. You need have boundaries and standards about what you will tolerate in every area of your life, or you will be taken advantage of.

Women are often socialized to people-please and put ourselves last. Try putting yourself first, second, and third, from now on. No one is ever going to look out for you the way you do.

# Prob gonna delete this idk. shitty rant.

üì∑

I broke up with her 4 months ago. I broke up with her even though I loved her. Her mom kept getting involved and we got into this big fight and I couldn't handle it. I had had enough. I felt abused and used. I just wanted to stop thinking about our issues. i wanted to feel free from the family craziness. I broke up with her and told myself I'd never look back, even though I couldn't admit to myself I still loved her. Part of me hoped she would call my bluff, that she would return and love me even more fiercely and our relationship would only strengthen as it had many times in the past when we had gotten into arguments and I always tried to apologize and appease. Part of me hoped that she would return and affirm her love for me was above any fight, no matter what. But 2 days passed. 3 days. A week. nothing. This took place at the end of the summer of my senior year in high school. I was going to a big shot college and in my mind, it was a way for me to find a fresh start, to move on, to bury myself in work and not think of her. And for 4 months it worked more or less. I was extremely busy with school and work, and supporting my family. Our 1 year anniversary would have passed in October and I started thinking of her more, started to remember what we had. The college I was at has so many beautiful girls, brilliant and successful. But anytime I started talking to one girl, I would push away, she wasn't the one. She wasn't good enough. I couldn't trust her. How could I? How could I trust anything they say? And tonight I finally snapped. Im so overloaded on work, at a certain point in the night I just stopped and my stomach lurched and I just felt totally lost and alone and I missed her so damn bad. I miss her encouraging me whenever I felt like I was on the verge of collapse, or praising me for doing little things like buying her ferrero rochers or winning a scholarship. I missed her reassuring voice, her amazing singing. She's a good person. Even if she has faults she was a good human being. I wish she had been mature and realized her mistake. I was so tired of being walked over. I miss her playing her favorite songs and us making playlists while talking about the future. Her favorite song just started to play right now ""Drop the world by lil Wayne"" as I type this, as if God is mocking me. Oh the effing irony. Double irony. Whatever. We went through so much, I had never been with anyone before her. We were so close. I don't even know if I'm going to post this if I do then I've lost it I want her back I want her to come back, I miss her so much. I can't even get into contact with her if I wanted to. I can't speak about this to anyone. I have to act like I moved on in front of my family. She's probably moved on by now. And here I am like a pathetic fuck writing this out because I truly don't know what else to do or who to talk to. And the worst part? I don't think I have the guts to even contact her if I could. I'm too afraid. I don't wanna love anyone else ever again. i just want the right person to love me, to make me feel wanted. and she was the right person. fuck. My Life. I wish i could get amnesia and forget it all happened.

The question is....does the size of a man's dick matter to the woman in terms of sexual pleasure she receives? 

My anecdotal experience suggests that it can. My 2nd ex husband has a 8.25 cock, and assuming i was worked up enough, I could ride his dick and the combination of his large cock hitting my ""g spot"" and my clit rubbing up against his stomach would SEND ME TO THE MOON. Honestly, orgasming like that is incredible. Better than straight oral IMO. 

All the other other men i have been with were of average size. A guy i slept with over the summer...i attempted to do that, but he just wasn't big enough to hit that spot inside me. Boo. And he was probably bout 6 inches, so above average. 

The drawback of a large cock, is that there are a lot of sex position that just won't work because it bangs into the cervix. No legs on the shoulders, have to be careful with rear entry, etc etc. So fucking with wild abandon, if your are into that thing, is not possible with an 8.25 inch cock (only in porn). Also, you are prone to UTI with a large penis. I believe its from the the cock shoving your natural vaginal flora into the urethra. I had 5 UTI in the 7 years i was with him. The last one showed that the pathogen was my own flora!  My first husband, who was very average, i had only 1 in he 17 years we were together.

I'm so horribly confused still. 

A few months ago, a very good friend (35M) of mine(28F) of a couple of years, started giving me distinct signs that he was interested in being more than friends. He was one of the few people who'd known me throughout my horrible breakup two years ago, and  my next attempt at dating again. which had ended after the person beat and molested me. Through everything, my friend was a good friend, and supported and encouraged me far more than I'd have expected of him. When he started clearly showing me that he was interested in more, I went along with it because he was one of the most stable-to-the-point-of-being-boring people I knew. Dependable, honest, reliable, and a good friend. I saw it as a very promising start to a relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Except a couple of days later, he broke down and told me that he was sorry, but he still wasn't ready for a relationship. Even though he owned up to initiating and pushing everything between us in this direction, he didn't feel 'over' the damage his ex had done yet, and therefore wanted to call everything off.  Or at least take the promise of a future off the table, because he knew he wanted to try things out with me, but had no clue if he wanted to take things further. And being the idiot that I am, I figured that since we were compatible in every damn way, and had had clearly sizzling chemistry so far, there really was only one place this was heading. We were basically in a relationship already, as far as affection and emotional support were concerned. I'd assumed that adding flirty talk and sexting to this mix would only finish an already closed circle. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I hadn't accounted for was how quickly he changed. The person I knew as a friend vanished behind this new horndog persona. Sexting quickly replaced any meaningful conversation we were having, and all other themes and topics vanished. He then proceeded to ignore me clearly not responding to his increasingly sex starved behavior. I had gone along with things in the beginning, but there were certain lines the entire time, that he simply ignored, after a point. The entire thing ended with him sending me a completely unexpected dick pic while I was on the bus with a freakin two year old kid in my lap. Luckily, luckily I don't download pictures automatically to my phone, which saved me a massive amount of embarrassment.  Not to mention disgusted me thoroughly. In the aftermath of being molested and mistreated by someone I'D trusted against my own better judgement, I had and have been feeling increasingly cautious and wary about perceived disrespect. And then, to be at the receiving end of something like this from not just a friend but one of my closest friends, someone I had seen myself maybe developing deeper feelings for thn just affection... it was too much. I gave no response at all and stopped replying, except for very stunted messages. 

the immediate response was an apology for recent horndog behavior, and some nonsense about knowing that I appreciate his body, but that he'd be more careful about when he'd send me things like that. I COULD NOT bring myself to give him the dressing down I so severely wanted to. I wanted to gather my thoughts first, so I did just that, over the next few days. And the more I read back and recollected, the more I saw in black and white in our messages, that had been making me progressively more and more uneasy over the last few weeks, without being able to pinpoint what. 

After the next few days of minimal responses from my side, he started pressing for conversation a  little more. I decided to steel myself and put an end to this nonsense. I'd been disrespected, I still felt horribly disrespected, and I'd be damned if I didn't say as much, especially to someone who should have remembered that we were friends. So I did. I had a short conversation with him, in which I brought the topic up, after several attempts at small talk on his side. And the whole time, all I could think about was: I couldn't bring myself to even see his face anymore. I felt and feel so let down, so completely, severely disappointed in everything he did. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the shallow apologies he's given me have done nothing to soothe my rage, either. Some nonsense about not being able to control himself. Some nonsense about not knowing he had this side in himself. The stuff he said made me realize that even if in retrospect, he knew exactly what he had done wrong. So he was very self aware of it all. And apparently too horny to have understood what he was doing wrong. He apologized for initiating the relationship-like aspect of things. For playing the horny boyfriend, so to speak. And I ran out of patience, and told him a couple of days ago, in a message, after almost a week of no conversation (the longest we've gone without speaking in some way since we've known each other=., that I still haven'T forgiven him, and really don't feel like talking to him face to face. So if he wants to say something to me, we stick to messages. 

But I don't know anymore. I've seen the other, almost predatory side of him too clearly to want to trust him again. And I'm torn between putting this mutilated mess of a friendship to rest, or giving him a last chance to remain a distant, platonic friend. I'm just... sad.",38108,"FDS was the first place to tell me to remove him from my dating pool, and it was completely the right choice. Now I‚Äôm debating whether we should even stay friends.",0,,

But she was savvy enough to make some investments with the money she saved while she worked before having children and to have a husband, my dad, as a reliable hardworking breadwinner.

Everytime I dated, both in Europe and East Asia, when asked about ""what do your parents do""? I have replied that my mom was a proud housewife who became a SAHM after having children. And if the date replied things like ""how did she manage with not earning, it is not the norm here"". I felt sick and never met again. Why shouldn't it be the norm that a woman is cared by her husband after giving him children? If he replied ""that's good if it is what she wanted"" I kept dating (still, ended up meeting LVM anyway lol.)

Now many men are LVM. Some are LVM because they are losers with no job, others because they have the means (high or medium earner) but are very cheapskate (like my ex) and believe that everything must be split 50/50 even if the woman suffers much more from childbirth, menstrual pain, risk of sexual assault etc.

Because of these , LVM pushed society to frown upon SAHM. Saying they are gold-diggers, lazy and so on. This way their hate/non-support of SAHM is unfortunately justified by society.

Personally, if I ever got married, I would stop working until the children are young, and then work ONLY part time (while keeping savings and investments). 

Because I see many of my mom's friends or my friends's moms who kept working full time even after having children. Well, they look 10+ years older than my mom's and still could not build a high earning career because even if they worked full time, they could not accept relocation or overseas trips due to having a family/husband not agreeing. And many of them ended up being divorced because they were ""too tired and not giving enough attention to the poor husband""..

Background;
- We broke up like 2-3 months ago, still living together (lease until March, also I have a cat and it‚Äôs hard to find a place that accepts them). We mostly ignored eachother lately, which was good.
- I have a pursuer, a handsome guy I met almost right after we broke up. This guy knows the whole situation and still courts me, which is nice. I still don‚Äôt trust men though so I‚Äôm vary.

The pursuer came up to my city for a date, which was absolutely lovely. We have good chemistry and banter and after a couple of drinks he kissed my neck and left a tiny little mark saying ‚Äúdo you think he‚Äôll be mad?‚Äù My response was ‚Äúdefinitely, do another one!‚Äù. It was fun. 

Yesterday I was at the gym, ex was there and he sent a friend to come up to me and look at my neck. I found it funny but played along.

After the gym, two friends came over to drop off my pet carrier. I asked my ex if that was ok, he said yea, on a very aggressive tone. I even clarified and he seemed even angrier.

After my friends left, I was chatting to mama.

ACTUAL BIT THAT IS RELEVANT:
He knocked on my door and after I opened, he was laying into me, raising his voice that I deceived him, that he misunderstood and he wasn‚Äôt expecting people coming over.

I told him that I asked him straight and he said yes. That he was the one who misunderstood and that is his responsibility, not mine. He kept yelling so I closed the door of MY ROOM. He swung it open, hurting me in the process, saying that I am to never dare close a door in his face ever again. He was literally in the way and I was actually so scared. My mom (on the phone, she lives in a different country) kept yelling at me to call the police.

He finally left me but I am still shaken. I don‚Äôt know if it could constitute as harassment or not. I know I need to move but it‚Äôs just not possible now. At least I am going home for the whole holiday period...

And people will say he should have ""asked first"". Just the same as we see now over on the relationship and dating advice subs.

Sadly the same thing has happened with groping and touching by strange man in public. Everyone keeps whining that it was ""without her permission"". As if there would be any meaningful way a man could get consent by going up to a woman that he doesn't know in public and asking her if he can grope her? Apparently they think that men *should* be able to go up to a strange woman in public and ask to grope her and that's not seen already as an assault? And a fearful position he put her in where she would have to say yes anyway? Men can't ask to violate someone. You can't get permission for violation. Just like you can't get permission for assault.

Consent ends when a man starts choking you out of the blue. It ends if he slaps you. It ends if he spits on you. Everything that takes place sexually after that is rape because the man has just assaulted you and put you in a fearful position where no meaningful consent can be given.

* You should not know **anything** about his most recent ex. Her name, her job, her age, her face, **anything about her.** If he is going into gratuitous detail talking about this woman, it means **he is not into you and doesn't respect you.**

Trust me, when you meet someone new, who is better than your ex, you don't mention that ex, right? There's no need to, **you've got the improvement in front of you.** Unless they briefly ask you, and you give a vague, ladylike, coy, answer, ""we decided to go our separate ways"".  There's no need for further comment.

All of you know by now to **never** reveal your past, so do not give him a free pass to talk about an ex either. Why?

Talking about the past/his exes **is a huge red flag** overlooked by women who think it's normal to talk about the past. It's not normal or productive to bring up past lovers.

**He ain't over it!** *Nothing* will get him over it. You can't do it. You can't sex/cook/pickmeisha your way into getting him over it. 

He needs to come into a new relationship **without past women in his mind whatsoever,** or else you will be constantly compared, belittled, and triangulated.

A **healthy** single man **does not** have past resentment **nor** past love/pining for his exes. He should be indifferent to them and *excited* about his future, with you. 

**Both positive and negative talk** about the past are **red flags.** If he is calling his exes crazy, that's a red flag. If he is constantly praising his last ex, and you feel like he doesn't speak about you with the same reverence, that is another **major red flag** and sign of narcissism. 

# The healthy man will not tell you anything about his past and make it known you are the only apple of his eye.

**Kick him to the curb the moment you feel he has given you TMI** about his past. **It never gets better.** He will continue with the comparisons and making you feel awkward about it.

# When you have the queen sitting in front of you, you don't tell her about your ex. You tell her how great she is and how thankful you are to have met her. 

Trust me, ladies. Do not write this red flag off. **It is a progressive red flag that will escalate. You will be two years into your marriage and he will still be talking about his brilliant, beautiful, funny ex while you seethe inside and wonder why he never lavishes the same praise on you.** It is a manipulation tactic to positively talk about his exes so that you feel like you have to measure up.

You should know close to nothing about his dating past. If you decide to ask him the reason behind his last breakup (for vetting purposes/to make sure he's not psycho), or how many LTRs he's had, ok,  fine, but he should not have verbal diarrhea and keep giving you TMI or specifics about the women.

This is an **emotional intelligence (EQ)** thing. If he can't see how his comparisons and talking about his ex in a wistful manner is harmful, is he really the man for you? You want to be with a man who has some social graces and some common sense. 

If you know how old his ex was, how long he was with her, her ethnicity, her job, her name, you already know too much. 

I see that some of you regularly like to dig into his past and make sure he wasn't a player/promiscuous/man-hoe. I urge you to stop that Private Investigator BS today, and get comfortable not asking for excessive details or encouraging ANY talk about his exes. It is just you and him moving forward. **It reeks PICKMEISHA when you are prying about his past,** the same way he shouldn't be prying about yours. 

Worried about STDs? Demand a test. Worried he is a player? Don't have sex until commitment and investment have been demonstrated. Worried he acted dishonorably in past relationships? Vet properly, don't stay if he stops acting right.

Notice that **none of these solutions** to quelling your anxieties have anything to do with prying and digging about his past or talking about his exes to him. **It is up to you to do your vetting.** **The information you obtain by observing how he treats in the first three months will tell you all you need to know anyway.** 

Discourage ex talk, today. Do not fall for positive, raving reviews of his exes either. That is narcissistic triangulation. 

You come first. You don't need a lovesick, heartbroken, manipulative, constantly-comparing man in your life. **You know her name? You know too much.**

SAME GOES FOR YOU, SIS. Do not speak about your exes. Do not share if they've been abusive or trash. **Keep it vague and positive, ""we decided that it wasn't working, wished each other the best, and that's it"".** Never speak your ex's name or offer details about his job or age.  Your potential partner doesn't need to feel like you're still obsessed with John, the 33 year old financial analyst who would take you out four times a week and lived in Connecticut. You can bet if your man has any feelings for you, he will feel pangs of jealousy every time the name John is mentioned, every time Connecticut is brought up, or when he meets a financial analyst. Don't do it. Keep the past in the past.

If you are desperate to get info, google it.  Better yet, use your good judgement and see how well he is treating you for three months. Talking about a guy's exes to a guy is the most Pickemeisha thing you can ever do.",38865,Do not stay with a man who talks about his ex or his past,0,,

My perception of her is as a prominent cheater apologist so I went into this episode ready to roll my eyes right out of their sockets. And I was pleasantly surprised! It was gratifying to hear a therapist call bullshit throughout this whole episode - on both of them! Perel sly as a fox calls him a sociopath towards the end! 

Here's the episode overview:

*In this episode of Where Should We Begin with Esther Perel, we meet a couple whose relational foundation is built upon adultery. Unable to stay apart, the two have cheated on and with each other. The pair‚Äôs family histories are also woven with infidelities. As a girl, she witnessed her dad‚Äôs serial cheating. As a boy, he viewed his philandering grandfather with awe defining him as a ‚Äòreal man.‚Äô For him, affairs continue accompanied by consistent and reflexive lies. Inexplicably drawn to his duplicitousness, she continues to question if she‚Äôll ever fully trust him. In Small Town Affair, the two come together in a final push to discover what‚Äôs left of their relationship.* 

I thought about you all as I was listening to this FDS affirming episode. And I wanted to hear you alls thoughts if you get a chance to listen to it. A few things that really stood out to me:

1. The LVM was bullied in school (through college) for his size and he admits that he is a compulsive liar. He admits that he has low self-esteem, low level depression, self-loathing, and no empathy. And mostly no remorse. He has no friends except for the pick-meisha and his daughter. He lies in order to make himself out to be something that he is not because he hates who he is. So the lying is a way to puff himself up. To be taller!
2. The LVM says that no one in his life holds him accountable except for the pick-meisha he's with now. His ex-wife didn't either. He says people allowed him to cheat on his ex-wife in front of them and they didn't say anything to him. (My read of this is that he was subtly passing the responsibility of being a decent human being on to others and evading self-accountability.) He goes on like this for a bit (and he's somewhat boasting about it) and then Perel stops him dead in his tracks and says that another way of looking at it is that: ***it's not that he's so amazing, it's that people don't expect more from him and don't respect him and that's why they don't bother!*** Boom!! A lot of times these fools think they're just so slick and people are just taken in with them, but the reality is that most people see right through them and just don't want to BOTHER so they let them THINK they are so slick! Most of the time their desperation and insecurity is painfully obvious to anyone with a pulse. 
3. The LVM acknowledges that even though he's grateful for the compassion and kindness of the pick-meisha he looks down on her for it. He looks down on her because he thinks if she was stronger and better she'd have left him a long time ago. He acknowledges that she doesn't set limits and he knows he can push and get away with it and that's why he does what he does. 
4. Perel completely unravels the pick-meishas psychology, and it's everything FDS says it is. She thinks she's special and the one that is going to change him. She's defiant and thinks she knows better than everyone else. She has become isolated from her family and friends and still she perseveres with this relationship. She is proud of the fact that she's a human lie detector in the relationship and feels vindicated when she catches him in his lies. My take is that she enjoys the drama on some level. She's got narcissistic tendencies herself and seems to lack empathy for the people in her life that are sad about the situation she's in. For eg., she lets out a chuckle as she says that her mom is sad about the whole situation and blames herself! 
5. When the pick-meisha was dating another man the LVM promised he'd change and begged her to take him back. Once she took him back, he started to resent her trying to get him to change. He saw it as she just wants him to change for selfish reasons and she doesn't really see him for who he is or love him. He acknowledged that the other guy she was dating was HVM, he was a musician and had lots of friends and that's why he felt like he wanted to change to win her back but once he got her back he didn't' feel that way anymore!",38788,Sociopathic LVM &amp; Pick-Meisha go to therapy: Where Should We Begin? with Esther Perel,0,,

""Older"" is subjective, but for this purpose we will say 8+ years older, and this post is specific to younger women (teens, twenties). Why? Because they realistically tend to be the most vulnerable and most likely to be targeted by abusive or exploitative males? Don't agree with that? I don't care.

**Is dating an older man okay?**

While it's not *bad* per se, it is a yellow flag at best. When I was 21, a guy started chatting with me at a Starbucks. He was 37, very charming and super interesting. We ended up dating for about 6 months, but it would have been much shorter had I realized that he was a loser, perpetual victim, and had a hard time keeping the attention (and **respect**) of women his own age. He knew my bullshit-o-meter was less finely tuned, and that appealed to him. I'm now 30 (a grandma to a lot of you) and I personally would never date someone who was 25 much less even younger, so you have to ask: **what is** ***he*** **getting out of it?**

If you find a guy who is older, don't necessarily write him off. But keep your head on a swivel. Don't collect red flags. Constantly be asking yourself, ""why?"" Is he an arrested development type who doesn't want to settle down? Is he irresponsible and immature? Is he ""plating"" or using you while dating more *ahem* age appropriate women for an actual relationship? 

**AND THEN THROW ALL OF THIS IN THE TRASH** if you are under 18. No man worth anything, **EVER** would date someone who is dubiously legal (idgaf about your local municipal laws, **FUCK** that) if he's a good person. You know what man in his 20s dates teenagers? Fucking pedophiles. *""But he LOVES me!!""* Child, he loves your vulnerability and lack of defined personality. He loves what he can take from you. I don't care if you listen to Hall and Oates and have an ""old soul"", you are a child and he is grown. 

**What should I look out for with an older man?**

How's his job? His finances? Someone in their 30s should have a career and legitimate savings. This isn't a money thing, it's a responsibility thing. If he's fucking off to go waste all his money in New Orleans every year at 35, that's not a person that's going to be relationship material (unless he has a respectable 401k AND the money to travel). Does he drink a lot? Is he still doing a ton of recreational drugs? Is he a stoner? What's his living situation (roommates/living in a basement/or **GOD FORBID** with his **PARENTS**) are all huge blood-red flags.

When dating an older man, make sure you are the exception to his lifestyle because of your emotional connection, not a continuation of a person who refuses to grow up. We look for what we value in our partners, and if he's looking for younger women he likely values optics or ***fun*** over substance. Does that sounds condescending? Welcome to the mind of a man. 

Extra factor: If you meet on OLD, why is he looking for women 10+ years younger than him? That's not a default setting, girl. Just sayin'. 

**What other considerations should I factor in?**

Do you want kids? Do you want marriage and a family? Will he be young enough by the time you're ready to have kids to be an equal partner in the child-rearing? If you're 22 and he's 35, he will be 43 by the time you're 30. Does a 43 year old want to stay up all night with a screaming baby? Think about the biological logistics. Your timeline may not work with his. I've also found that older men are less interested in even *having* children, so make sure you communicate the things that you value before your heart is invested and you've wasted a bunch of time for nothing. I'm not saying ask him on the first date, but I am saying don't wait as long as you would if you were dating another 20-year-old.

Just keep the logistics in the back of your head. Men hit a wall in their 30s and 40s if they haven't taken good care of themselves, so he may seem attractive when you're 20 and he's 30, but when you're 30 and he's 40? Girl, you better hope he works out because that shit can hit **hard**.

**Why am I having to pay extra attention to all this stuff? Isn't age just a number?**

No offense but that's how stupid people get hurt. Assuming the best, especially with men, is how women get their hearts damaged over and over again. Age is about **power dynamics**. Someone who is older has more experience, resources, and baggage. Ignoring that fact is foolish and setting yourself up to fail. Your guy may be fantastic, or he may be well versed in being charming. Being charming and being good are different. Like any imbalance of power, you need to make sure you protect yourself. 

**A final word**

It's a well-known fact that men view their relationships as status symbols and reflections of themselves. Make damn sure he's interested in ***you*** and not just using you as a positive reflection of himself.  Is he a thoughtful man of character, does he care for and about others (not just people he wants to sleep with), is he responsible and mature? Then by all means, have fun! But keep your eyes peeled for those red flags.

I‚Äôve been seeing a guy for 5ish dates now and FDS standards are working! We are not exclusive and he is always asking for more time while I stay busy with other dates or activities. I refuse to do anything more than kissing, but he knows that I know how to kiss and can bring sexual chemistry when the time is right. I‚Äôm a bit younger so he must have initially thought I would be an easy going gal- do not let that shit fly. When he tried to kiss too much on the first date, I let him know that I was not a trashy young thing and that I thought he was too immature to date me. He quickly fixed himself, which is why I agreed to a second date. I have never pulled my card out to pay for anything. All our dates are a nice sit-down dinner plus drinks plus an activity (and usually a paid coat check), so it‚Äôs not cheap Netflix shit. And you know what, he takes pride in it. I once suggested we stop by a more casual place since it looked new and innovative. He agreed but suggested also getting a proper dinner or dessert at a nicer place because he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to look cheap.‚Äù Grown men don‚Äôt mind spending money on women that they perceive as valuable, in fact they‚Äôre afraid of looking cheap and stupid.

He reads the top news stories before meeting me because he knows I‚Äôm well read and wants to impress me with his knowledge. I‚Äôm not afraid to put him in his place if he gets the facts wrong and like a HVM, he will acknowledge that he is not an expert in something. 

He‚Äôs dropped hints about getting me earrings for Christmas after I casually mentioned that I might get a Tiffany‚Äôs bracelet for my sister. He expressed surprise ( such a gift will likely cost a pretty penny given my age and earning potential) but I explained that we take Christmas seriously- I said I‚Äôve received Dior perfume, plus a necklace, plus high end makeup from her. This is all true, but she regifted the perfume and necklace to me because she gets these things for free sometimes. 

Don‚Äôt be afraid to drop hints about your high end taste. Don‚Äôt be afraid to create competition between what your friends and family do for you vs what he does for you. Any HVM knows that the bar for a bf is to treat the gf better than friends and family, and he will take great joy and pride in spoiling you. 

Though he is far classier, educated and generous than my other exes, I‚Äôm not about to let him know that. Keep your standards sky high, drop hints about your taste, and men that care will rise to the occasion in order to impress you.

I have a friend, we will call Lacy, who is a work in progress. She‚Äôs trying y‚Äôall, but has a lot of qualities of a LVW, including her taste in LVM. Most of us have been there, we are all in different places in our journey. She engages in things like cheating, manipulation, and other toxic relationship behavior (going through each other‚Äôs phones/sharing passwords) with her now ex-boyfriend who she is getting back together with. I think my relationship with my HVM is slightly affected by spending time with Lacy because my boyfriend knows of her antics. She overshares on social media. 

I‚Äôve worked really hard to level up and become a HVW. I have a stable career I‚Äôm passionate about, hobbies, a cute apartment, a good support system, I take really good care of my appearance and my soul, and this year has been the best of my life. I also have a small but close group of girlfriends I‚Äôve been friends with almost 10 years. 

I have my dream relationship. It‚Äôs healthy and passionate. I truly believe he‚Äôs my soul mate. He spoils me, inspires me, challenges me, and loves me for who I am, and I love him. He recently bought an engagement ring and things are going great. 

HOWEVER... I‚Äôm considering dumping Lacy! I care deeply about her, but she never takes my advice. For example, I tell her it‚Äôs not a good idea to talk to her ex, then she goes and has sex with two exes in one week, with the intention of getting back with one. She consistently fishes for attention on social media by posting that she‚Äôs depressed. She can be blatantly manipulative to men in her life. She has several mental illnesses and I do feel for her and care about her. I try really hard to always boost her up but she does the exact opposite of what is healthy for herself in regards to men. 

My boyfriend thinks she‚Äôs a terrible person. He hasn‚Äôt told me to stop hanging out with her of course, but he has explicitly told me he thinks she has the potential to turn her destructive behavior towards me. I‚Äôm a bit worried that it could lower his perception of my value though. 

You are who you spend time with. So I think it‚Äôs time to end my friendship with her. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to do it gracefully, but I‚Äôll figure something out.",38743,Can a LVW friend lower your HVM‚Äôs perception of your value?,0,,

I matched with a guy on bumble a few days ago. His profile looked vaguely familiar so I think I may have seen him on OKC before I made the switch to bumble about a month ago. After we matched and talked for a bit I only then realized he had selected ‚ÄúNot Sure‚Äù as his answer for what he was looking for. So I started digging.

Found out that he was in a relationship as of October at the very least according to FB. From what I can tell it wasn‚Äôt a casual relationship either, they had been together for at least 2~4 years. Her Pinterest also had a board for wedding stuff that was created about a year ago and stopped being updated shortly after its‚Äô creation. 

What makes this all the more suspect is that I can‚Äôt remember when I first saw his profile on OLD. It could be anywhere from November to when he was still actively in this relationship. Coupled with the fact he selected ‚Äúnot sure‚Äù for what he was looking for makes it safe to assume for me that I am nothing more than a potential rebound. Thanks, no thanks, bye.

Several, in fact.  My most notable polyamorous relationship was a male-female-female triad which lasted for just under 3 years.  We all lived together, and it was hell.  I was also once involved in a large (2000+ member) polyamorous community, which, of course, heavily overlapped with the BDSM community (so you can imagine what kind of absolute charmers are involved).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


Ladies, when he says ""polyamorous,"" you block his number and you run like hell.  I am 100% confident in saying that polyamory is completely antithetical to the goals of Female Dating Strategy. Sure, it may seem like the new ""woke"" relationship style and he may lull you in with pleasant sounding things like a jealousy-free relationship, sexual ""freedom,"" and this fairytale land where love is infinite and each person loves and is loved completely different, but I implore you to look beyond these promises and see them for what they truly are: empty promises.  Here are some of the reasons why polyamory is complete bullshit, and the reason why literally no HVW should be participating in it:

**Polyamory only works if you're PickMeisha**

I can confidently say that the traits of a high value woman are completely incompatible with the goals of polyamory.  This is due to the fact that polyamory relies heavily on negotiation, fidelity and loyalty to the ""polycule"" above all, and a simultaneous paradox of non-possessiveness but discouragement behaviors which compromise the integrity of the polyamorous relationship(s).  In other words, do what you want and we don't care unless it upsets the relationship.

At first glance, a reader unfamiliar with FDS is probably thinking ""that sounds awesome!  I get to do whatever I want!""  Make no mistake: *no you cannot*.  In fact, by entering in one of these complex, overly-egalitarian arrangements, you have **significantly** reduced your ability to compromise to your benefit.  Instead of compromising with a HVM, who always has your best interests in mind and treats you like the Queen you are, you are left compromising with *everyone* who touches the polycule.  Should you have inserted yourself into a relationship where the construct needs a whiteboard to delineate, you could possibly find yourself negotiation with your husband's girlfriend's second boyfriend's girlfriend on whether or not you should move away to get that lucrative degree.  Instead of being a primary focus in a marriage or otherwise committed, long term relationship, you are now 33% or less of a bargaining power.

In order to cope with this, women involved have to egregously compromise in order to serve the polycule.  *No one* gets the freedom to chart their own destiny.  These relationships are a perfect recipe for complacency: they cannot adapt well to change and they do not foster an environment of growth.  You are stuck where you are, because in order to satisfy everyone, all of you must give up pieces of yourselves for the relationship's survival.  Say goodbye to your dream wedding and starting a family: all of these things now are able to be changed and compromised upon by whoever in the polycule (or their ""met amours"")  can guilt you the hardest.  The only kind of woman who can survive this kind of lifestyle is the one who would ride or die for a man: you have to be PickMeisha to survive compromising your soul away.

**Compersion, or, Pavloving yourself into feeling happiness when he sticks his dick in Karen**

It's exactly what it sounds like.  ""Compersion"" is effectively the opposite of jealousy, and in polyamory it is described as a sense of happiness when your partner is experiencing happiness in a relationship that's not your own.  Feeling happy when your partner is happy is, of course, not anything new and honestly should be expected in any relationship, monogamous or not.  Your HVM should be experiencing happiness when you get that promotion or when you set a new PR at the gym.  

The massive problem with compersion is that it simultaneously eliminates the incentive for HV male behaviors and guilt trips women into celebrating it in lieu of condemning it.  In FDS, we are very well aware of male sexual nature: competition is at its heart and is the main driver of high value male behavior.  Everything we do and teach in this subreddit is to activate the desire to compete.  The tactics explained in this subreddit do not work for polyamorous men.  This is because they have been reinforced that their women are *happy* for them when they sleep around and dote on other women.  There is no need to compete, there is no need to better themselves, there is no need to provide value, comfort, safety, or prove that he can provide.  *Every behavior, good or bad, is rewarded.* 

Compersion especially sucks for women because in polyamorous communities, you are expected to feel happiness when men sleep around and you are supposed to question any jealousy you feel. As you can probably imagine, combined with the hyper egalitarian negotiations going on, women in polyamorous relationship are encouraged to erode boundaries.  You are supposed to feel happiness for whatever your partner does, and you are never to feel any jealousy.  While jealousy, indeed, is the green eyed monster and is generally a negative reaction, a little bit of jealousy is a good thing.  Jealousy, again, is what pushes men to demonstrate that they can provide.  Jealousy can move a woman into establishing healthy personal autonomy and healthy boundaries.  HVM are a bit jealous by nature: they SHOULD be feeling threatened at the thought of losing a Queen.

**Gaslighting your way into unequal domestic contribution**

Women generally get the short straw in polyamorous relationships.  This is because, get this, sexism is alive and well, and the problems that we all know and love in traditional monogamous relationships are only exacerbated in polyamorous ones.  I lived this firsthand for years: as I was the most ""together"" out of anyone in the immediate household or their tangential partners, I was the one consistently saddled with the housework, home repairs, car repairs, and other menial tasks.   I've seen this play out time and time again in the multitudes of polyamorous relationships I've encountered: a very familiar labor division happens, where the women are (surprise, surprise) taking care of the men.  Sometimes it's one particularly brainwashed woman into taking care of a household of grown ass adults.  It's *sad*.

I told myself time and time again that love was infinite, that my partners loved me and cared about my needs, and I tried my hardest to feel happiness when my boyfriend was out at a swingers party with his other girlfriend without me while I caught up on laundry.  Yes, I was this low-value once.  

**Increased risk of sexual abuse, trauma, disease, mental illness and unwanted pregnancy** 

It seemed like every few weeks another man would be ""outed"" as a rapist or abuser within the polyamorous community.  The lifestyle, especially with its close proximity to the BDSM and swinger communities, attracts the lowest of low value men in search of infinite threesomes and no strings attached sex.  And, of course, with the increased amount of sex comes the statistical increase of rape, STIs, and pregnancies.  Polyamorous relationships exaggerate biological risk for women.

I witnessed firsthand what happens when a polyamorous woman accidentally gets pregnant.  Here's a hint: it's not great.  All of that compromising, hyper-egalitarianism, boundary eroding bullshit gets applied directly to the woman's pregnancy.  It becomes all about poly co-parenting and inevitably results in the maternal and paternal relationships being compromised in favor of the relationship with the rest of the adults in the polycule.

Existing children didn't seem to fare so well either when polyamorous relationships became blended.  Another polycule I was vaguely involved with (everybody has fucked everybody, I swear to god) started as a man and his wife and their biological kids. Now, the husband's girlfriend and her toddler from an ex-marriage have moved in, and at least one of the wife's boyfriend's have moved in.  How are the original biological kids faring?  There were four: all of the girls now identify as transgender, one of them has tried to commit suicide, and the boy is now seriously acting up.

**An unexpected positive: the normalization of rotational dating**

There is one sole positive that I can identify with the polyamorous relationship trend: they have established a bit of normalization for non-monogamy.  I don't refer to the kind of non-monogamy that polyamorous people practice, or to the kind where previously agreed-upon monogamists are cheating on eachother.  I'm talking about the extremely high value female behavior of rotational dating.

I'm 99% sure there's some resources on the side bar that explain this, but **not all non-monogamy is bad.**  Keeping up a rotation of men while dating is *EXTREMELY* effective at eliciting high value behavior from men and ultimately finding a man worthy of marriage.  I personally practiced this and experienced absolutely outrageous success: a post topic for another time.  Having this behavior be a bit less stigmatized will help HVW in the long run.

**TLDR - polyamory elicits and REQUIRES low value behavior from both men and women to work, will expose you to all sorts of risks, and will make you compromise away your life and dreams and potentially your children's life and dreams.  So when Mr. Woke slides into your DMs and asks you about how you feel about ""ethical non-monogamy,"" you tell that shitstain to take a hike.**",38732,"FDS Strategy: when he asks for polyamory, you kick him to the curb",0,,

The first date flowed well, although I was nervous. The second date was absolutely amaaaazing - he did research to find a place that has activities that I love, then went to eat afterwards and secretly asked them to do the ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù thing (my birthday was 4 days ago), and then because it was late - he was adamant about staying on the phone and talking to me as I drove until he knew I got home safe, even though he got home much earlier than me. He is such a gentleman, so chivalrous, and he paid for everything without hesitation. He‚Äôs so easy to talk to and is so respectful, he really listens to me and is invested in what I have to say. Has his own place, a great job, his own car...he‚Äôs great.

But I‚Äôm unsure of how to navigate dating him, because I‚Äôve never dated someone this good. He seems like a pursuer and has been the one to call me and set up dates. I do believe that men should pursue. But now, especially after that awesome second date, I feel like I should be doing more to make sure he knows that I‚Äôm also interested and invested...or is that not my place? 

I guess what has me a little nervous is that I can see that he‚Äôs online/active on the dating site we met on. That in itself isn‚Äôt a big deal, we‚Äôre not exclusive and I‚Äôm also talking to other guys on there (though he‚Äôs the only one I actually want). The date happened only yesterday and he hasn‚Äôt called yet, which is fine and understandable, but should I be the one to call/text him? I‚Äôm not sure. 

Like...how do you show a HVM that you are interested and invested while still remaining in the feminine role and letting him pursue?

What keeps you motivated? If you're willing, what does your daily schedule/routine look like (wake up, exercise, skin care routine, etc)? I know myself well enough to know that having a daily, weekly, and monthly schedule to stick to would benefit me greatly, so I am very very very curious, open, and interested in what you ladies do.

This is because many LVM convince women to get pregnant before marriage, living together with them yet asking 50/50 and not marrying (""marriage is just a piece of paper""). 

After a while, these couples inevitabily break up because the LVM does not want to deal with his """"fat post wall partner"""", """"crying baby"""", and do his provider role. They cheats with a younger, childless woman and so on.   
Welfare does not basically exist in my country. Also, if you are not married you get only child support who is getting always lower. Alimony is only for divorced women... so most single moms end up in poverty. 

Only older single moms with a decent career and middle/upper middle class grandparents manage to secure a good future to children even if single.

Unless you are upper middle class/have enough money to raise a kid alone, I think that if you girls wanna have kids, you should wait to have a decent career (not rich but at least good enough) + find a good HMV husband who is wanna have a provider role which allows you to work part time until the kids go to school. I think it is important not to quit working completely because even if he is rich and you prefer not working, if he dies or leaves you for a younger model, you need to be able to support yourself.

I had a beautiful female friend who i was so jealous of and she had many men chase her and give her gifts, flowers and everything she wanted in order to impress her. She never slept with any of them until they gave her commitment and even then it only happened after a few months. She would hop from one date to another, never paying for her own food until she found the man she was looking for, and he still takes her on vacations and pays for everything. I would dye my hair like hers, wear clothes similar to hers, do my makeup like she did and talk in a softer voice so it will sound like hers. I thought if i looked like her, i'd get treated like her. Honestly i did resemble her a lot but something was missing. FDS was missing. 

Some of the men who liked her eventually contacted me and flirted with me and i liked it...it made me feel like i'm worth it, like i'm better than her. I did meet up with 3 of them...none took me on a dinner date or a date at all. Just meet me on a park bench or try to convince me to meet up at their place. \*All\* of them stopped talking to me the moment they realized i will not sleep with them, all of them did not want a relationship unless it was with her and i was wondering, what does she have that i don't? self respect. I would go out of my way to entertain them or prove myself worthy, prove that i am better than her while she had them all wrapped around her fingertips and they would come to her if she called them, i was always the second option.

Ever since i found FDS i stopped giving men the benefit of the doubt and stopped thinking i deserve less. If they wanna see me they would ask me out, if they want to date me they would put in effort. No more ""netflix &amp; chill?"" or ""Let's hang out sometime"". If they want to see me they would text me or call, when they ask me on those cheap and disrespectful 'dates' they're testing my standards, testing how insecure and how attention-hungry i am. 

Now it's easier to weed out LVM, block and ghost them. They wouldn't think twice if they were to ghost me, why should i think twice or feel sorry for them? In my relationships i always felt like i was the one planning everything. If i got flowers it's because i asked, if i got taken out to eat it's because i asked. Even if they paid for everything it still felt like something was missing. I changed my attitude and behavior, how you treat me is how you'll get treated. I met a HVM not too long ago and i told him i'm going to get a surgery soon so i won't be able to see him, one day after the surgery he sent me flowers with a cute note saying he can't wait to see me again. I did not ask for those flowers and honestly i was shocked and happy, FDS does work. I will not let my guard down, he might not be the one i'll get married to or get into a LTR with, but it just proved that men do care and men will put the effort if they like someone. The men i've dated before just didn't like me, they saw me as an easier cheaper version of my friend.",38630,"You're not asking for too much, you're just asking the wrong person",0,,

Newbie here; I found this sub a couple of weeks ago and it has already brought me so much strength and hope.

I come from a very dysfunctional (and overbearing) family and it takes a toll on me. The family situation has only worsened as I grew up - now in my mid twenties. I am still involved with them, and currently financially dependent on my parents (but will become independent within a year when I finish my degree and start working in my field) though I keep as much emotional and physical distance as I can. I plan to maintain this distance - I could never completely cut them off. I have started therapy recently to try to work through a variety of issues, including family-related ones. I was broken up with recently by a man who I believe was not quite, but close, to a HVM. Though he didn't voice it, I think my family may have contributed to his decision to break up with me. 

I want to know going forward, is this sort of background generally a dealbreaker for HVM? Or if he loves you enough, is it not a problem?

I know in the earlier stages of dating to keep my business private, but when a relationship turns serious and a certain amount trust is built, how should I handle talking about family? Should I always hold back? He'll have to meet them eventually.",40031,How to find a HVM when you have a dysfunctional family background?,0,,

How to be an asshole:

be fun 
be interesting
be challenging - sometimes just for the hell of it
be bitchy and witty
be unpredictable - lean into your crazy bitch side
have a backbone thats rock solid, and impenetrable standards


Women are socialized to ALWAYS inflate a man's ego, to the point where it's almost force of habit. On some level, men come to depend on this socially. Of course, when it comes to more serious relationships, deep down most of them know they are garbage, no matter what a show they put on or how much they delude themselves or how much Pick-Me women prop them up. They dislike themselves by default, and usually for good reason. You cannot and should not try to change this, as you will fail and be worse off in the end.

Here is why being kind of a dick (aka treating men exactly how they deserve) is a good way to deal with men you may actually be interested in dating:  the simple reason that he isn't burdened with having to live up to the expectations that a woman's ego boosting implies. Do this with EVERY man you meet regardless of how much you like them. In my experience, the more I like a guy, the easier this has been, and has had a decent success rate.  When done in a correct, lighthearted way (I have been known to be TOO mean - you live, you learn), it'll make him relax, open up, and want to be more himself. And because of how you make him feel, he'll want to be a BETTER version of himself, for you. NOT because you've trashed his self esteem and now he feels like he has to prove something, but because you've given him room to feel comfortable. 

Another upside of this is that men love a woman who doesn't take any shit because he knows she won't be taking other men's shit. His baser instincts will be angling for him to be the only guy she does take shit from but of course that won't be happening.


This will NOT work on fragile, volatile nut jobs (LVMs) - so make sure the dude is normal first. This is a good way of checking for that as well, if you're up for that.

I spent most of my teen years until early twenties struggling with all kinds of self-esteem issues because I believed them. I believed that there was something wrong with me because I'd rarely attract boys my age. I believed my worth was tied to male attention. I believed I should go out of way to prove I deserve their time. I believed I should compromise my expectations and all the important things I look for because I couldn't be picky. 

Well, screw'em all!!! 

There was absolutely nothing wrong with me. I was just an introverted young girl. I preferred to stay home practicing my hobbies than going out. I spent most of that time developing my intellect and soft skills. I learned English, went to college, watched my beloved nieces grow up, made genuine friendships. And in the midst of all of that, I was fighting my inferiority complex (defeated by now) and anxiety (still working on that).

So when I reached my early twenties I was graduated, bilingual, working on a very demanding field, finally coming to terms with my femininity. I was blossoming. Long term friends would come to me and tell me how much I glew up. But I wasn't aware of my value because, then again, I was single. So when I met all those HVM, hit the wall time and time again, and people told me I deserved better, I could not believe that -- they told me otherwise for years!

The hardest part of the healing process is to unlearn all the bullshit you absorbed through the years. These past two years or so I've been literally rewiring my brain and cleaning my heart off of the all garbage I had taken as advice. So, in case you're a recovery pickmeisha and making smart decisions make you feel like shit, that's the reason why.

As i got older i set higher standards (must be educated, must have a job, must be tall) but i was still loose on the personality and looks. I thought i could convince myself that someone is attractive and personality is something you can change (Fun fact: no, it is not).

I went on dates with chubby men, ugly men, rude and sexist men, you name it. I always excused their behavior and thought i can build them but i got tired of being Bob the Builder. But i feel like i was at my lowest when i went on my most recent date 3 months ago, before FDS of course. 

He lied about his height saying he's 5'10 (i told him i don't meet with short men, my standard was 5'11 &amp; taller but i kind of bent it over for him), we meet and he's 5'6.5 and i'm 5'4. I was devastated but i thought i could look past that and we went on 3  more dates and that's when i realized i just can't get attracted to him. He did look better on pictures but in real life he was 3/10 at best. He had any unattractive feature possible. He was chubby, short, thin lips, crooked yellow teeth, very bad bone structure (face), his face shape was very round with no jawline or shape, like a basketball. His nose and eyes were also bad and he had such a bad hairline and he was about 23, not even 50. I couldn't name a single thing attractive about him.

Did he think i wouldn't notice that he's short? fall in love with him regardless of height (and looks)? never. He tried holding my hand in public and i felt like i'm out with Shrek but hey, at least Shrek is tall. 

Funny thing is, he has very very high standards. Must be porcelain white with shiny clear skin, must have straight hair, light eyes and light hair, must be very very skinny and very busty (like anime girls, lol), must be a virgin (probably so she couldn't tell he had a tiny dick), must be under 5'3, must have a 35-36 shoe size (4 US, 2-3 UK). He was honest and said he would date any woman ranged from 14 to 25. When i heard 14 i wanted to punch him, that Quasimodo looking guy is straight up a pedophile. Honestly i did not meet half of those requirements and i wanted to take the piss so i said i'm a virgin when he asked (yeah sure, after dating 2 men for two years each? lmao).

When i told him this is not going to work out he was very upset and said i should 'overlook' his height if a man was perfect other than that. Perfect? lol, this guy was straight up an ogre with a bad personality. He then proceeded to tell me ""too bad Hitler didn't kill all of you"" (I'm 1/8 Jewish) and that's when i blocked him everywhere.

After FDS i would not date someone who is not a 7/10 (at least) and tall. I'm not looking for the most attractive man, i'm looking for someone i'll be attracted to and treat me with respect, kindness and be generous and giving.",39726,Higher standards,0,,

I personally expected this to be an easy question; all men had to do was just tell us all the positive traits about themselves that a woman would find attractive.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/e8vehu/open_qa_thread_for_men_of_what_use_is_a_man_to_a/

I was honestly SHOCKED to find it wasn‚Äôt.  Truly. A lot of men have clearly *never in their life* thought about what value they actually have to give a woman. 

Let‚Äôs first consider the fact that if you ask a woman what her value is, we can usually break ourselves down to a science:

**Physical**: ‚ÄúI have big boobs/pretty face/fat ass/‚Äú

**Emotional**: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm supportive/good listener/...‚Äù

**Community**: ‚ÄúI take care of my grandma, volunteer at the animal shelter‚Äù

**Sexual**: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve practiced  ___ sexual act or wear this because my SO likes it‚Äù

**Domestic**: I keep a clean home, 



....etc!! We have been groomed to be of value to men and see ourselves in relation to how we benefit men from *DAY ONE*! 

These are all tangible concrete things women do to bring value to men and to their community. 

But men. Men have no goddamn idea and it‚Äôs sending me right now. We got 100s of comments, and a clear minority of men actually successfully completed this exercise. 

- Many were just using the fact that we deal with them at all as evidence they have value. Complete tautology that boils down to ‚Äúwe have value because you value us‚Äù. 

- Very few had concrete and tangible things to describe to us other than sex (which most of them actually suck at! Ha!)

- Others flat out tried to reverse the question 

- Many pointed to things *other* men have built as evidence of *their* value even though they had nothing to do with it. 


The best answers we got out of hundreds boiled down to:

1) Protect us from shittier men
2) Financial contributions
3) Odd Jobs around the house
4) True Friendship and support (rare)

....but these men were in the clear minority! 

It was very frustrating to read comment after comment of men having absolutely no clue why women should even be bothered with them. 

Well if *you* don‚Äôt know Breh, then **We here at FDS don‚Äôt either**!!! After this discussion I honestly want to change our slogan to say ‚ÄúDick is abundant and literally **ZERO** value‚Äù!!! 

It confirms to me that most men get women coasting on the groundwork of patriarchy, which has historically disenfranchised women legally, socially, economically, etc so that we are literally *forced* to seek value through men.  

Men use emotional abuse tactics designed to undermine our self worth so severely that we would look at any raggedy scrap of man as better than nothing, and then convince ourselves we can do without.  This is how TRP operates. This is quite possibly the greatest swindle of all time. 

&amp;nbsp;

Ladies, look at these men with a ruthlessly discerning eye, because if he is not actively contributing to your life, he is actually literally robbing you via opportunity cost. 

This is why FDS does not advocate monogamy unless you are headed toward marriage, there is usually very little benefit other than you feel falsely ‚Äúvalidated‚Äù because a man committed to you, a man who may very well be completely worthless and a drain on your time and energy. 

You have a finite fertility window and a finite amount of time on this earth, don‚Äôt waste a second on men who do not actively make you ecstatically blissfully happy 90% of the time. 

You win literally nothing by tying yourselves to the vast majority of men. This is the definition of playing a stupid game and winning a stupid prize. And honestly, they think you‚Äôre stupid for dealing with them because even they have no idea why you bother.",39713,[RECAP] What I Learned From Asking Men About Their Value: THEY HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE.,0,,

I thought of trying to explain to him, that it's not fair to hole yourself up in your man cave for hours and hours, when you proposed to someone. I thought of saying, ""Everyone needs time to decompress, but you can't disappear in the basement.""

And then I thought.. what's the point? It's not like he doesn't know that 2+2=4. Why should I tell him no shit Sherlock information that anyone without a mental disability would understand? Why should I waste my words?

Especially since this is not something he did when we were not engaged and living together. He started doing it when he felt more comfortable, and like he for sure cuffed me. 

Instead, I enrolled in a silversmithing class, oil painting class, and I booked my schedule with a Class Pass fitness class almost everyday of the week. This in addition to work and going to the gym. This resulted in me not being home every single evening. I also started spending more time with my girlfriends, and booked my weekends with activities and events that I went to with my friends.  Meanwhile, my fiancee was texting me ""When are you coming home? Where are you?"" One time I was with my girlfriends, drunk, and I started laughing uncontrollably when I got the ""when r u coming h0me?"" text. 

He started to shape up-- stopped spending so much time in his man cave, and he didn't take me being at home and wanting to spend time with him for granted. He agreed to do activities that he isn't normally into-- going to the zoo, going on a picnic. He just appreciated spending time with me at that point. 

I feel like even decent men will take you for granted, and slowly but surely, treat you less than-- if you don't constantly remind them (through actions) that they ain't shit.",39713,"FDS in relationships. Men don't respond to words, they respond only to mirrored actions and absence.",0,,

Days pass between my message and his response. So Im already forgetting him, assuming he's not interested. He finally responds, and by then I've decided its time to ask him if he's single. Because you know what, the friend who introduced me to him and kept trying to get me to talk to him, I question if she even knows if he's available. We're (me and the guy) from the same African country, and I normally don't even bother w those men because they are messy. 

Anyway. When he finally texts me, I ask him what's his status. He says ""there's someone. There are complications"".

The thing I love about FDS is 3 months ago, I would have been DEVASTATED. A year ago, I would have been angry. Today I am just amused because you all have enlightened me to how a lot of men think. 

Now, here's my thing. I know there will be a few people in my life (like that ""friend"") who would say don't cut him off completely, let him know he can talk to you once he uncomplicates himself... etc. My thing is, I don't do platonic male friends. And I certainly don't like men who claim ""complications"". I don't like drama in my life. So  wondering how to deal w this. Do I straight up tell him we can't be ""friends"" until he's free and clear? Do I block him? 

What do you ladies think? Im in my mid 30s, if it matters. I suspect he is either my age or older.",39688,I am learning so much from you all. How do I handle such foolishness?,0,,

&amp;nbsp;

I know we‚Äôre trying to spare their feelings but we need to stop telling men this lie because they‚Äôre really out here believing it.

&amp;nbsp;

Then they‚Äôll be on all the men‚Äôs forums talking bout how we only like ‚Äúthugs‚Äù and ‚ÄúAssholes‚Äù and ‚ÄúChads‚Äù and what have you. 

&amp;nbsp;

Terry Crews, Jason Momoa, Keanu Reeves are some of the nicest and most feminist guys out there and they have absolutely no problem getting women because it‚Äôs not about that.

&amp;nbsp;

Here‚Äôs a list of reasons why I rejected ‚ÄúNice Guys‚Äù.

- Facially Clapped
- Their clothes never fit right
- Their clothes never match
- They don‚Äôt know how to use an iron
- Their beard grows in patchy 
- Their fade never looks crisp
- Fat / Out of Shape
- Bad Breath
- Skinny Chicken Chest 
- Hair Never Brushed like Kevin Durant
- Their Hairline is receding but they won‚Äôt accept it like Lebron James
- Their skin is ashy
- Their lips are crustier than pre - jail Gucci Mane
- Teeth yellow
- Teeth Crooked
- Teeth crooked AND yellow like James Harden

As far as the personality stuff:

- They don‚Äôt know who they are as a person 
- Emotionally needy
- Boring AF with no skills or interest
- They‚Äôre just as misogynist and entitled as far more attractive men therefore not worth it
-Angry at the world
-Always Playing the Victim
-No personal drive or discipline
-Lazy
-CHEAP

&amp;nbsp;

So basically 9/10 these ‚ÄúNice Guys‚Äù have poor grooming and negative social skills and it has nothing to do with them being nice or women preferring ‚ÄúAssholes‚Äù.

Bunch of backstory: I had been single for over 5 years before I met him because I learned some harsh lessons about how most men are LVM and will suck the life out of you. 
When I met him, he was so different. He brought me flowers and gifts every time we spent time together, always planned the dates, never had a issue with my busy schedule and would always make time, always paid etc. 
He has always had a high paying job since he was in his 20s and is used to having a certain level of money on hand vs me who has worked hard, saved, and had multiple shitty jobs at some points. I have excellent credit and he has absolutely terrible credit.
After looking into it, I found it is because he just doesn‚Äôt pay anything until they call or garnish his wages. I told him that is not a adult way to deal with finances and he was so casual and said ‚Äúoh I can pay it anytime‚Äù I wanted to freak out and scream but I just left it alone. 
Last month he got informed by the IRS that they would be garnishing his wages to the tune of 1600 a month because of a tax issue he was well aware of and did nothing to fix. 
He has a degree in criminal justice and is now in school full time for nursing( I swear he gets degrees when he gets bored) so he his now in school and working full time but school cuts his hours in half at work so now his income is cut down significantly and he is mad that his complacency towards money is coming to bite him in the ass. 
I have created a good life for myself now and am comfortable financially to a point where I can splurge on myself. 
In November I flew to Miami for plastic surgery and he proposed the day before I left saying ‚Äúbecause I didn‚Äôt want you to think I only want you for your body‚Äù I felt like a bad person because the first thing I thought was ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt let you near me financially or all my years of work will be ruined‚Äù and then the ring. No diamond and it looked like it had been bought from one of those 25 cent vending machines. I immediately felt the urge to buy myself one that I wouldn‚Äôt feel embarrassed wearing. I felt almost insulted that apparently that is how valuable I am to him. I know he‚Äôs going thru money issues so I said I would consider it, and I wore the ring for a bit but didn‚Äôt show anyone. It turned my gloves at work green! 
I feel so stupid and now he keeps asking to spend time together and I keep making excuses why I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm mad at myself. I feel like I have wasted my own time but also, terrible that I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the money side of things. 
I don‚Äôt want to be the person who jumps ship when things get rough but I trust my instincts enough to listen to them telling me there are red flags. 
You ladies always give the best advice so any regarding this would be very appreciated. 

TLDR: I‚Äôm good with money, bf is awful with money, proposed with cheap ring right before a surgery, now I want to run.",41103,Am I or did I waste my own time?,0,,

He's honestly a fascinating guy, but there was one thing in particular that I noticed. This guy got married and then divorced from his wife, and was made to pay a huge settlement. Honestly, reading those numbers, it was definitely excessive, but it made me think of ""divorce rape"" as a concept.

What exactly is it? Is it any time a woman gets something from a man after divorce? Is it a woman getting kids/house? Is it just the concept of divorce lest initiated by their unwashed asses? I'm not saying people don't get screwed over. John Frusciante had to pay 50k+ a month to an already well-off fellow musician, women lose their livelihoods and have to work upwards of three jobs to support families while the fathers do jack shit but how is it ""rape""? 

Are they just using the concept of sexual assault as a cheap way to increase the impact? Are they saying bad divorces are men's equivalent to getting raped (it's not, men's equivalent of getting raped is getting raped). Are they just trivializing it to piss off feminists? 

Sorry if this is jumbled up. I am sleep-deprived and pissed over this concept so I'll try sum it up. What makes a ""divorce rape"" to these scrotoids? Why use the word rape at all? Does it apply to women who get fucked over in divorces?

Not sure if I should post this here but I don‚Äôt know where else to turn. It‚Äôs really long, so I‚Äôm sorry - if it‚Äôs not the right place for this then the mods are more than welcome to delete. I love you all and this is my all-time favourite subreddit. 

First up - the mods have already flagged me once as a potentially dodgy character (a man lol) as I have a blank profile but I swear I‚Äôm legit. I deleted everything a while back because I used to be the world‚Äôs worst pick-me and my post history was mainly me asking for advice about how to better entertain idiot men. It was embarrassing af so I deleted it. I swear I‚Äôm a single 27 yo woman and not a male lurker. 

Onto my point. Basically, as I said, I used to be a horrendous pick-me and was relentlessly shit on by guys romantically and sexually. Degrading BDSM-type ‚Äúkinky‚Äù sex with a man in an ‚Äúopen‚Äù relationship (bullying his gf into letting him cheat basically), buying tickets to travel across the country to see a man who refused to commit, sex on first date, emotional and somewhat physical affair with a coworker in a relationship, sex without commitment, not-needing-to-label-the-relationship so he doesn‚Äôt feel trapped by my ‚Äúneediness‚Äù - honestly, I‚ÄôVE DONE IT ALL. 

Fortunately, I‚Äôm not that woman any more. I have only found FDS very recently but before I did, I at least had the self awareness to realise I needed some serious help and so started seeing a therapist. At the time, I opted to see a man because I suck with men (I‚Äôd choose to see a woman now but what‚Äôs done is done). 

I‚Äôve been seeing him about a year and he has helped me in ways I didn‚Äôt anticipate. I learned that my childhood was abusive (Sounds mad but I honestly had no idea- I‚Äôd never experienced any other way) and that my mother is a bully and a controlling narcissist. So I can now see why I am attracted to men who won‚Äôt love me or will straight up beat me (with my ‚Äúconsent‚Äù lol). It‚Äôs been tough but I am feeling better. This therapist was the one to help me with that and I‚Äôll always be grateful for that. I do feel that connection and loyalty to him. 

The thing is, despite his patient work in that regard, he is so hard on me when we talk about my dates/interactions with men. It‚Äôs hard to reconcile his insistence that the way I was treated as a kid was wrong with his insistence that my new ways to move through life are also wrong. How tf am I supposed to act?

For example, before I found this sub, I would read other dating advice and a lot of it was still good even if it didn‚Äôt quite hit the spot like FDS. As a result, I did sort out a lot of my pick-me behaviour (even if inside I still felt wobbly) before finding this sub. I would go into therapy sessions feeling proud of the way I‚Äôd handled a situation with a man only to come out feeling that, yet again, I was wrong. 

A few examples: I have a male friend who used to constantly badger me for sex. I have not obliged him. After a few months of this, he resorted to offering to buy my nudes (LOL). Before I‚Äôd just flatly refused to sleep with him but at this point I flipped out and he apologised and said he knew he was ‚Äúbeing cheeky‚Äù, wouldn‚Äôt do it again or ask me for any more sex. 

I proudly told the therapist this, intending for it to be read as an example of me putting my interests first and not agreeing to be a FWB or some sort of nude-prostitute for an idiot fuckboy. I also told the therapist I was considering dropping him as a friend as he clearly just saw me as a potential shag. The therapist said dropping him was ‚Äúextreme‚Äù, implied my response to him was rude and asked me to consider that he had asked for my nudes ‚Äúto boost my self esteem‚Äù. Say what? 

When I was hung up on my colleague who persued me despite having a gf, I said that, while I was enjoying his attention as he was gorgeous, I wanted to stop the situation from escalating further so I didn‚Äôt get hurt. The therapist told me I might as well ‚Äúuse him if he‚Äôs going to use me‚Äù. But, like, I had feelings for this man? And I felt guilty about the whole fiasco for obvious reasons. And he acknowledged the guy was using me! 

I also once dated an unattractive guy who constantly made negative comments about my weight, despite being objectively uglier than me and the fact that I‚Äôm not overweight. Therapist was incredulous when I used the word ‚Äúugly‚Äù to describe him, told me I was super rude and that my ex-bf could obviously sense that I thought he was unattractive and that resentment had to come out somehow. Fine, I get that, but there was no talk about why I felt I only deserved to date someone unattractive to me - only coming down on me for my rudeness. 

As a result I‚Äôve never been able to open up to him about the physical kinky stuff because the memory brings me so much pain and I can‚Äôt bear to hear him tell me what I did to bring it upon myself. I already know that. I already feel degraded enough. 

there are more anecdotes but you get the idea. Recently there‚Äôs been an abrupt suspension of my therapy while my therapist deals with some personal stuff. In the meantime, I found this subreddit and feel more validated then I ever have with him, tbf. Sessions aren‚Äôt picking back up til the new year so I‚Äôll have had just over a month off til then. 

But after finding FDS, I‚Äôm not sure how to proceed. It‚Äôs complicated by the fact that I can‚Äôt afford ‚Äúproper‚Äù therapy so I‚Äôm seeing a low-cost therapist which limits my options - I can‚Äôt really afford to just switch and I feel like I‚Äôm lucky to have the opportunity to see anyone. I think I need the help and, despite feeling validated by lots of the stuff I read here, I‚Äôm just not sure what to do. 

What do you think? Am I just being an arse and complaining that my bad behaviour is being called out? I‚Äôve also never done therapy before - is it normal to be challenged like this and should I lean more into the process rather than away? Do you think I should bring this up with my therapist? If so, HOW? Has this ever happened to any of you? 

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on how I should proceed and I know you‚Äôll tell me straight.",41038,Therapist seems to hate FDS methods - what should I do?,0,,

This year I have been getting over three assaults for the main part and unfortunately fell into the hands of of LVM. Long story short, because of my emotional and mental situation I was very weak and got inextricably attached to this LVM, I'll call him Tom. Tom ended up lying to me about where he was and I uncannily ran into him. He walks in with three or four beautiful chicks, I am burning with embarassment. He apologises (because he was caught duh) but never owns up that he lied, but made excuses. I blocked his ass then. But I was a weak bitch and tried to smooth it over, I missed him so much and it was so sudden. So I have been shamefully on and off contact, and I feel I just lost respect for myself and he probably can't talk me seriously now either. Everytime I went NC and said it was the last time, he had the ""We'll see"" attitude. 

I am NC again since mid November. How do I get my power back? When I started with him I very unknowingly was a FDS chick in most ways, and he was around my finger. And I feel incredibly lame and weak now. How do I get the upper hand and the respect again? You know where he looks at me and forgets the weak bitch and tries to get my attention?",40989,How to get your power back from a LVM?,0,,

We started having sex immediately, and it was pretty good. It annoyed me that I had to teach a thirty five year old man how to kiss,  it whatever. Over all it was decent. Afterwards,I would throw my clothes on, throw him some deuces, and piece the fuck out of there.                                                               One night, while I was getting ready to leave, he said, ‚Äú You know, you don‚Äôt always have to run out of here so fast. Maybe we can do things with our clothes on too‚Äù... ‚Äú Uh okay‚Äù, he started to want to actually talk about more than pleasantries. I started thinking to myself, ‚Äú Gee, this guy is starting to fall for me. ‚Äú.  So it went for months. We became closer. I started to spend nights, or come over just to ‚Äú hang out‚Äù.

My aunts on my mom's side are pickmeishas, so these quotes are from aunts all on my dad's side. The great aunt is from my mom's side though. 

**""The easiest thing to do in the world is to make a man fall in love with you.""** 

My great aunt would say this with disdain, like men are so dumb that getting them to fall in love with you is child's play.

**""Men will say anything just to sleep with you, to get attention from you. They will lie, lie and lie to get what they want.""** 

One my aunts told me this repeatedly when I was a teenager. 

**""Stop looking at that boy. His eyes are too open. He's looking at every girl in this store. Stop looking at your feet and at him, but look around the store, look at who he is looking at.""** 

My uncle's wife (consider her an aunt). She was trying to tell me that he was a fuckboy, and to not fall for him/those like him.

**""Look at the way these old men stare at young girls, like they are hungry dogs staring at food. I want to shoot them in the face.""**

My uncle's wife again.

**""Don't show a man that you can do everything. He will come to expect you to do everything, and he won't appreciate anything.""** 

**""Look good and if he says let's go here, you say ""No I don't want to go there, I want to go here"". Don't say yes, yes yes and smile like a fool, because you will be taken for a fool.""**

**""Don't smile too much. Men will think you're feeble minded.""** 

**""Give an ugly boy a chance, but only if he knows he is ugly and he tries hard to make you happy. He will grow to be handsome if he makes you happy. I thought your uncle was so ugly when I first met him.""**

I fucking hate these passive aggressive articles or statements about women aging or not accepting their age.

My mom bought this magazine today so I decided to give it a look. I shit you not 60% is pics of models, ads of clothes/perfumes/makeup/beauty products/purses etc

In the middle of this there was this ""story"" about this 35 yo woman who feels like an hag on a bad work day because of her age, her supposed role that was given to her as a mentor to train someone younger etc but in the end she ""recognized her beauty again"" after  a man asked her out.

I don't know why exactly why but it made so viscerally angry. I couldn't relate because I am not currently in  a stage of life where I am ""supposed"" to worry about my age but I swear it made me so uncomfortable.

Is this some sneaky way to sell more beauty products? Make women insecure so they will keep buying things to reassure themselves they will be fine?

Also it was written by a man.

35 yo is when fertility decreases but fuck our worth isn't based on how many babies we push out or how much attention men give us.
Considering modern lifestyles and medecine thst age is barely the half of human lifespan FFS

Anyways, I broke it off with my ex for many reasons, but ultimately because of his controlling behavior and his scary behavior during sex. I also think he had a porn addiction. 

He choked me without warning during sex. He wanted to piss on me, and he wanted to piss in my mouth. He was really into ""DDLG."" He liked referring to my body as his. He liked biting me and leaving marks on me. He wanted to ejaculate on my face and he asked me to do things as if I was performing for an audience. He was into deepthroating and specifically wanted to ""throatfuck"" me (it's disturbing to me, if you are not familiar then just look it up), and even confessed fantasies of hurting me. You get the picture.

My point with telling you this, am I ""kink-shaming"" by saying none of those behaviors or desires are normal?? EVER. I think they are NEVER normal. I was confiding in my sister about it, and a male relative butted into our conversation. He said that it's normal to explore kinks and some people are into domination, and that plenty of women enjoy those activities I listed.

Call me a shamer but I don't see how any woman could ENJOY those activities. Am I really being judgmental? I just find it disgusting. Is kink shaming real?",41780,"When is it okay to ""kink-shame""? Why do guys insist that these are normal desires to have?",0,,

At the end of the day, if they guy you want to be with is 100% content not defining the relationship:

1) He‚Äôs not that into you
2) He‚Äôs thinking ‚Äúwhy buy the cow when you can get the milk for free‚Äù
3) He is overly comfortable because you‚Äôve made it clear through your actions that you are monogamous with him, even if you‚Äôre not. 

**Men become monogamous with women they love and women they are not willing to risk losing**

STRATEGY
- Obviously, keep your social life stacked with shit he‚Äôs not apart of. 
-Continue to go out without him on the weekends and be honest about it
- **For the jugular** Plan a girls trip out of town, look hot and GO

And it‚Äôs not just dating strategy. It‚Äôs life strategy. We are women, we are intelligent, we are fun and we are gorgeous! I‚Äôve been with my partner for 3 years and in this year alone have been on 5 girls trips having an absolute blast around the country (and this summer Europe aye! But he‚Äôs coming with me lol). 

For the single ladies: Do NOT rub the fact that you‚Äôre still dating in his face. But DO make it clear your social life does not slow down for him. 

If I was super into a man who I was regularly dating for 3+ months that didn‚Äôt care if I went out and got whisked away by the man of my dreams, I would have to drop him. Call it pride I guess. But that‚Äôs unattractive to me. 

A man asking a woman to be exclusive is not some sacrifice women should be desperately waiting on. It‚Äôs an honor for a woman to accept such a proposition and deny all of her potential suitors to be monogamous with you.

Wouldn't a man appreciate a woman who who will graciously accept I'd he offers to pay for the date, but is still willing to be fair/equal and help pay for outings?

Is it really ok to demand free meals, because we believe it will set up a precedence for better treatment from the man in the long haul, as opposed to them giving us their bare minimum because we're communicating, it doesn't take much effort for them to treat us well after all?

Maybe I‚Äôm being self-deprecating in that first sentence, but I have to laugh the closer it gets the Xmas as the most ridiculous dude-behaviour starts to appear. 

___

**The suitors** 

**Who I‚Äôm still talking to from the last recap** 

-	Tim - Good ol‚Äô Tim, he called me after he got back from the music festival and we caught up. Haven‚Äôt spoken since Wednesday but I did give him a heads up that I don‚Äôt have a lot of free time at the moment so he‚Äôs giving me a bit of space. 
-	Eduardo, 40, sommelier. He‚Äôs been sick with a summer flu, popped up late in the week to touch base, no plans to meet up atm and I think I
-	The Hinge Collective - there‚Äôs like 8 or so who are all really interchangeable still and haven‚Äôt put enough effort in to actually be real contenders. I figure the next two weeks on OLD are a hopeless free-for-all and I‚Äôll wait for the serious contenders to put some effort in. I‚Äôm at the point that Hough where I have to unmatch the ones who said hello and then asked for a date two minutes later, that just shows they want a warm body and not to get to know me at all. 

**People who have left the rotation** 

-	Carlos, 41, marketing executive. Alas we didn‚Äôt get to see if we had ‚Äòsexual compatibility‚Äô üò° 

**Men on Replay**

-	Ken, 33, professional removalist. Texted me and asked to talk about how the date went. Had a lot of self insight to acknowledge it didn‚Äôt go great and he could tell I wasn‚Äôt interested romantically. Asked instead if we could pursue a friendship and sincerely thanked and complimented me and how I had been so supportive while he was in hospital. He‚Äôs gone away for the holidays and asked to take me to the local aquarium in a couple of months time after the dust has settled from out date completely.
-	Seamus, 39, neuroscience researcher. The last man I dated seriously; we broke up around four months ago. The split was amicable and obvious that it was on the way as it was becoming very obvious he wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship. Recently divorced after immediately leaving his partner after she cheated, he started to get extreme anxiety during our relationship about trusting and opening up emotionally. He immediately entered therapy after we split, which was a decision I supported completely. We spoke once since the breakup and it was cordial well-wishing but cold. He‚Äôs now texted to ask if we can get dinner sometime in the next few weeks and I‚Äôve asked for a phone call to talk to me properly about it before I agree. 
-	Mark, 33, network manager. Had one date with him months and months ago that go anywhere. didn‚Äôt pass the porn-user test so I dropped him immediately. He texted me from a new phone number, so I had to go through the preamble of ‚Äòwho dis?‚Äô and he asked if I would be interested in trying a first date again after he apologised for not trying harder the first time around. I honestly don‚Äôt remember much about the guy, I‚Äôll feel it out but I don‚Äôt have much hope for it. I know that people can have a change of heart ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but let‚Äôs see if the contact stays up for two weeks and then I‚Äôll let him take me out. 
-	Justin, 31, social worker. Justin is an OLD match-and-flake. He has contacted me on three seperate OLD apps in two years. And I‚Äôve had to spell out to him this week why we haven‚Äôt met when he feigned interest again. Justin doesn‚Äôt want to actually date anyone, he just wants the initial attention and validation of being wanted by strangers and then he gets bored. He does the ‚Äòoh hey, I found you on here now! We should meet finally!‚Äô... and then nothing. Justin has been blocked on every platform so far, now including Hinge. Goodbye Justin. 

**New additions** 

-	Ryan, 33, electrician. Completely opposite to me in just about every way - hobbies, passions, background but my goodness he‚Äôs good fun to hang out with. We have absolutely nothing in common but he‚Äôs a larger than life personality that just makes me smile and laugh more than I have on a date in forever. Our height difference is also laughable (5‚Äô0 me vs 6‚Äô3 him) and I found myself actually saying ‚Äòsorry‚Äô jokingly the other day when we hugged as it was awkward AF.  We had two dates in one week and another one organised just after NYs. 

___

**The dates** 
It was a two-dates-one-person situation this week!

-	Wednesday - Ryan invited me out to a hotel bar down the coast after work one day. I got there before him and requested a table for two as it was too hot to wait outside. They were totally booked out and I knew he hadn‚Äôt made a booking - which I warned him about. I was sent to the back courtyard and texted him that we were on a table waitlist and needed a new venue if we wanted to eat immediately. He arrived shortly after and got us both a glass of wine while we waited for a table to open up. That table never came and while I was enjoying his company I was also annoyed as this was not the date I initially agreed to. I had to sit on my wine all night as I can‚Äôt drink and not eat and I went home hungry. I was about to block him when he rang to say what a lovely night he had and I was extremely blunt in response - I told him that I was annoyed the table wasn‚Äôt booked in the middle of socialising season and it was poor planning. He then asked for a redo for two days time as a clean slate as he hadn‚Äôt meant for it to be such a let down. 
-	Friday - This time Ryan suggested we go to my favourite Mexican restaurant in the area and sent me all the booking details immediately, showing that he took me feedback seriously. What followed was two and a bit hours of delicious food and sangria where it just felt like we unwound and relaxed completely in the summer warmth. I found it intriguing that he copied me in everything I ordered (appetiser, main and dessert) and I honestly felt completely at ease from having met him a few days ago for the first date. When we got to the bill he took his time fumbling around in his wallet and going over the bill, so I whipped out the cash I had for my portion and handed it to the hostess as she was getting very impatient with us. He walked me to my bus stop and kissed me with my permission but I didn‚Äôt feel anything. He asked for another date after he‚Äôs back from holidays (3-4 weeks time) and I said I would think about it.

**Insights** 

-	I don‚Äôt want to hear or read the words ‚Äòsexual compatibility‚Äô again, piss off with your pressure and your dick-centric dating approach. I don‚Äôt want to find out the weird fetishes you probably need to check that I‚Äôm compatible with. Just no. 
-	Men - if you‚Äôre setting up a date, book the damn venue. Don‚Äôt just make a guestimate of a walk-in time. Show that you‚Äôre an organised and productive human being and plan properly. Save walk in dates for your mates where you don‚Äôt care what dive or takeout place you eat from. 
-	The new OLD opener is apparently now ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs on for your Xmas?‚Äô and ‚ÄòHow‚Äôs your holidays looking?‚Äô. Seeing as I‚Äôm working all the way through and have zero time off I think I would actually prefer ‚ÄòHey, how are you?‚Äô in terms of unoriginal greetings. 
-	I‚Äôve been asked twice this week for a late night first date on NYE - but that‚Äôs not an offer I can accept as it would most certainly would end in too much party drinking and sexual expectations with what would be a complete stranger. I‚Äôd rather count down the seconds on the couch with the dogs when I‚Äôm safe and comfortable - which is precisely what I‚Äôm planning to do! 
-	I‚Äôve said a few weeks ago that the exes were going to start popping up in his time of year. I do wonder why Seamus wants to meet up. I genuinely care for him as a person but am unsure if the door is open for anything else. He‚Äôs definitely a man I compare others to as why he was having problems with his own health and well-being, he treated me like a queen when we were together briefly. No matter what, I wish him well.",41745,"Dating Recap: W/E 22nd December, 2019",0,,

Women have our pick, even as we age, even if we are fat, even if we are mean, even if we are ugly.

Men who have failed to live up to the most basic standards are denied by women universally (though I'm sure many of them *could* get laid if they actually tried, especially since many women are sex slaves)

The truth is that many men don't deserve to reproduce. They offer nothing to the equation beyond some simple mediocre sperm. Patriarchy has forced women to breed with low quality men, but that is all going to change. Men are going to have to level up or simply deal with their incel lives. HVM see this as a challenge to live up to.... LVM whine.

The part that is not really discussed is that having your pick isn't a field of roses. It's a field of weeds and land mines with the occasional flower. Most men will waste your time, use you for sex, and ruin your confidence.

Having to sort through these men is frustrating. Picking wrong is frustrating. Holding off on sex because you want to make sure he's not a piece of shit is difficult at times. 

I would love to be able to be careless. But as a woman I can't be. I might step on a land mine. I might get an STD. I might end up financially ruined as a single mom on welfare.

These are the risks we take. These are the responsibilities we deal with, without complaint, and men think it's all fun and games to be a woman. They just have no idea.

Men can complain all they want about their lack of a sex life, and project onto us and say we are incels even as we date and get married. It doesn't really matter. Someday they will have to face reality.",41745,Women Can't Be Incels,0,,

Before the arrival of Tinder, OLD was not as commonly used. Therefore, the pool of dating was bit smaller, but the options were better in terms of finding LTRs. 

Since the arrival of the swiping apps (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, etc), I've been left wondering why I keep having the same experience with men that I thought had very high potential to be long term partners. It usually goes like this with guys that seem highly compatible before we meet:

* Lots of bantering and flirtations before first date
* The first date is always very fun
* Quick follow-up for a second date
* Quick follow-up for a third date (4th or 5th)
* Drop off point around 2 months 

I'm usually left feeling very confused and sometimes having a bruised ego considering that I thought I had potential with these men. 

Then, I read this article about attachment types: [https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a27665884/attachment-theory-dating/](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a27665884/attachment-theory-dating/)

Now, the title of this article could be better, but the insights are very useful. 

A few of my favorite lines: 

* Avoidant attachers tend to end their relationships more quickly and cycle back into the dating pool.
* Avoidants don‚Äôt date other avoidants, research has found, because they don‚Äôt have enough ‚Äúemotional glue‚Äù keeping their relationships together; they are too independent for a relationship with each other.
* So what does that mean? ‚ÄúWhen you meet someone new, the probability that they have an avoidant attachment style is high‚Äîmuch higher than their relative size in the population‚Äî25 percent,‚Äù writes the *Attached* authors. ‚ÄúNot only are they recycled back into the dating pool more quickly, but they are not dating one another (at least not for long).‚Äù In fact, they‚Äôre more likely to be calling up anxious attachers.
* There‚Äôs just one problem: Avoidant and anxious types are often drawn to each other. Superficially speaking, they often seem to have the very thing the other wants. ‚ÄúThe avoidant person doesn‚Äôt want to be controlled, so they might find someone who needs them appealing,‚Äù says Cohen. ‚ÄúThe anxiously attached person needs to feel cared for and may not try to jockey for top position, which is viewed positively by the avoidant person.‚Äù

This article really spells out the state of OLD (and most likely meeting IRL dating). It really helped put into perspective what I should look out for when meeting someone for the first time. It also alleviates the ""woe is me?"" feeling after a stint ends with someone new from OLD. I just keep shaking it off until I find someone who is also a secure attachment. I hope you will find this article helpful as I did which leads me to my next point. Now that I am more secure with myself, I have evolved from being the anxious attachment type. I abide by this recommendation:

* The lack of crazy emotion is good. Yes: It‚Äôs *good* if you obsess less about your partner. Levine suggests the acronym **CARRP** for those who tend to overanalyze and worry. **‚ÄúYou need someone consistent, available, reliable, responsive, and predictable,‚Äù** he says. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give up immediately if that person isn‚Äôt meeting your needs, but state them clearly early on: ‚ÄòMaybe we can find a way to be a little more in touch.‚Äô‚Äù",41749,This article opened my eyes about OLD,0,,

So quick background story before I ask for advice! Let's call the guy im seeing ""Bob"". So bob and I so far at this point have been talking for a 4 months now. By month 3 I was realizing that I was actually really starting to like him instead of just casually dating him. So I asked him if he was even interested in the idea of a relationship since I wasn't into the whole ""casual dating"" idea. Just not that type of person. He then told me he wasn't. It's ok I don't blame him he has his own viewpoints and so do i. So we stopped talking for maybe just 2 weeks and he texts me just casually asking me how everything was going blah blah and we texted for the night. The next morning I told him I don't want my time wasted since my view point still hasn't changed. He informs me that he changed HIS view point and says he would like to try to start dating one another. He said he wanted to wait until the New Years to have a clean slate. We agreed we wouldn't be talking to other people . Been on 2 dates since and both times were great. 

SO. Now that we are up to speed, I feel beyond dating him. I want to trust him but my last relationship really took affect on me. But he isn't my ex so im trying to be open. However ever since we stopped talking during that duration I felt like I was doing great independent and now he is back. Why? Do I believe what he is telling me? There's no reason for him to lie.

I decided to proceed as FWBs, as there was a chemistry with him that was seriously intoxicating. I know, I know, chemistry is a lie lol! I was able to cut off countless other LVM but he was a constant. 

We developed a really close relationship (I'd call it friendship but now I'm reconsidering that term). We had deep discussions, we'd go on dates (he would usually pay), we'd cuddle, I met his friends, etc. We didn't have an understanding of exclusivity, but we fell into a pattern of seeing each other so often that there wasn't much room to see other people even if we wanted to. I'm sure he went on dates occasionally, and I did as well.  He'd go in waves of drinking excessively, and I'd avoid him during those times because I didn't need the drama.  But in general, we were always there for each other and I could rely on him when I needed him. We had so much fun together.

He moved into a new place, and I helped him with packing, and gave him some extras I didn't need to help him get settled, as he has lived with a roommate before and didn't have stuff like towels, silverware, etc. We got closer during this process, and I was staying over more often than not, going to work from his place instead of driving home.  Things were comfortable, and though I knew that there would come a time when our situation wouldn't be enough for me, I was happy and things were casual and easy. 

Then this weekend I caught him in a couple lies that made me suspect that he was talking to his ex. It pissed me off that he wasn't straight with me, so I told him that it upset me - but then I blew it off since things had been going well - and this was FWB after all.  However...  tonight I went over there (he invited me) and he was more wasted than I have ever seen him. I was so angry that I immediately went to leave, but then realized that he was in really bad shape. Being a decent human, I made him drink lots of water and got him tucked in on the couch. He was barely able to talk, but he said that he didn't mean to get that drunk, and that he just got back home a little bit before I got there. I said, ""From doing laundry??"" Because that's what he was going to do earlier when I talked to him. And he said, ""no I went somewhere else...""

Then he started being evasive so I knew he had been with his ex or another chick, who knows. Just then, his phone went off and he picked it up clumsily and I saw he had a bunch of notifications.  He passed out shortly after that so I grabbed his phone and saw he was talking to 3 or 4 girls from Plenty of Fish. I could see one of the messages was a text, and it was more than just dating app banter. It was clear they had been talking for awhile. Her name in his phone was ""Youngin"", which made me want to freaking puke. 

At that point I went around his apartment and collected every fucking item I had given him and tossed it in my car and left.  Done.  I was crushed, but this is what I needed.  I got home and realized that in my rage, I forgot to grab my overnight bag which had all my toiletries and makeup in it.  I'm so effing pissed!!! I'm going to have to leave an hour early for work tomorrow to get it back, and I'll probably have to see his stupid ass.

So I'm absolutely furious right now, with bouts of being sad and disappointed. I just keep thinking that the universe had tried to show me how he was, but finally had to beat me over the head with the facts. I feel like an idiot, but thankful that I only wasted 5-6 months on him.  This was a learning experience - I only wish I would have known about FDS months ago and I might have saved myself the pain of all of this. Oh well - I'll take a couple days to boo-hoo over it, hopefully be distracted with the holidays, then start fresh in 2020 without his toxic shit.  BOY BYE!",41744,This one hurt - long standing FWB is no more. #kickhimout2020,0,,

It‚Äôs my favorite quote from the movie Elizabeth The Golden Age. 

It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve know for a long time but could never have worded so succinctly. 

They ‚Äúdesire‚Äù all women. If you ever were, don‚Äôt be flattered. It doesn‚Äôt mean anything to be desired by men. Be on your guard, you have so much more they want to take from you than just sex. 

For men, women are a numbers game. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the women are interested in them, it doesn‚Äôt matter if they are available, it doesn‚Äôt matter even if they are attractive. They try with ALL the women that come in their path. 

We are easily interchangeable for their intents and purposes, which is to take from us, be it sexually, emotionally, mentally or financially.  There really are so many ways to exploit us. 

I used to wonder at all the men that flirt with me. From corporate types at the building where I work to the different handyman and trade guys that I hire to work on my house and randos in the street. And I would wonder. Why do they give it a shot with me? Why do they think they have a shot? Why be turned down over and over in some cases? Why? Because they have nothing to lose. Because it works ... once in a while anyway. They are playing a numbers game. Who knows, they might catch me vulnerable or needy and score a fuck and all they had to do was give it a lazy half assed try! 

Until I came to FDS I never realized how men take all kinds of non obvious things from us. One of the things my ex exploited the most was the feeling of peace and well being he got from me. He told me so many times in those exact words how much he loved how relaxed and good he felt when he was with me. And like an idiot I took it as a compliment and a good sign ... a sign of love and affection and of a true relationship. He‚Äôd message me when he was stressed and would ask me to come over, and sometimes even though I wanted sex he didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôd just want me to cuddle him and run my hands over him and hold him. He would even call when he couldn‚Äôt sleep so I‚Äôd come over and spoon with him so he could sleep. He got everything and anything he wanted from me but it didn‚Äôt mean anything. It didn‚Äôt mean he loved me or that I had a special touch or was a special relationship. He was exploiting my love, he got all this affection and worked for none of it. Deserved none of it. In turn I was always afraid to ask for comfort from him because he denied it so many times until eventually I gave up asking. 

Sex is not the only thing men want from you. The emotional and mental things LVM take from us are even more damaging for us to give than sex/time/money.

I have undoubtedly been ‚Äúburned‚Äù ... possibly to a crisp. Now that I‚Äôve looked back on my experiences through the FDS lens I realize that even the men I had previously thought good guys were LVM, takers, exploiters that didn‚Äôt give even the bare minimum without putting up a fight.",41747,‚ÄúMale desire confers no distinction.‚Äú,0,,

While growing up, I remember having very little male attention. I was taller than most of the guys in my class so that did not help. All this caused me to have low self-esteem. In college, I went for one of the first guys to give me attention- a tall attractive fuckboy. I wasted a year of him stringing me along and playing games till I had enough. A few weeks ago I realized I had no more fucks to give thanks to this sub! I texted him to leave me alone and then blocked his number and all social media. There is no looking back, Ladies! 

This sub has given me so much confidence and self-worth. I no longer obsess over trying to impress guys and now they sense that and literally flock towards me! I have leveled up in terms of my mentality and my fashion/make up. For the first time in my life- I FEEL WORTHY. Ladies, once you block and ghost the fuckboy, the universe makes it SO EASY for you to move on. I blocked the fuckboy on Friday and met a HVM 4 days later! This guy is a super smart, top ranked D1 athlete I met in the library and is very attractive. I never in a million years would have thought someone like this would be interested in me. MY SECRET: know you are the prize, maintain eye contact with him and smile, and show you are not willing to settle for anything less than what you deserve. Men like this are used to getting whatever they want and are used to pickmeishas fawning over them. They don't want to date a ""fan"", act like his equal and make him prove his worth to you. They want a challenge and by maintaining your standards, they know they have to put in the work.

The main lesson I learned from my journey is that YOU dictate how your dating life goes. I used to get upset seeing all my friends find boyfriends while I was all alone/dealing with fuckboys. But that's because I did not put in the work to level up mentally/physically, had no standards, and allowed fuckboys to keep coming back. Sis, If he's not blocked, you are allowing him to come back! Remember: You are worthy of EVERYTHING in this life- never put anything or anyone on a pedestal.

Once you realize your worth and come into your QUEEN energy, you will be irresistible my darling. Thank you to all the beautiful women on this sub, see y'all in fuckboy free 2020!",41742,My Journey - From Pickmeisha to Queen,0,,

I need to vent for a second so here we go.

We dated for 2 years and I broke up with him in September. He is emotionally unavailable, apathetic, and selfish as fuck. Serious childhood baggage with his mom and a dad who has been married like 3 or 4x and is not exactly a positive relationship role model. My ex was in a shitty spot when we started dating but of course I treated him like a project and encouraged him to go to college and he did. Magically as soon as his first semester rolled around, he never had time for me anymore and would lie to get out of spending time with me. Would cancel on me 10 mins before I was supposed to go get him (bc he doesn't have a car either). For the last year of our relationship we maybe saw each other 1 or 2x a week but it wasn't totally unusual to go weeks without spending time together. For my birthday this year, all I wanted was him to spend the night with me... guess what I got instead? Arguing and crying all fucking day then when he finally conceded to seeing me, I had to pay for my own froyo and he didn't even spend the night. Wanna know what I did for his birthday? Threw him a bday party with just me, him, and my 3 pets, got all 5 of us matching party hats, got him a specially made bakery cake, baked his favorite cookies (white macadamia nut so expensive as fuck too), and got his fav ice cream, decorated my apartment, and got him like 2 different expensive gifts. Including a golf gift card so he could have a boys day with his friends. In return, I got 2 hours with him that evening before he went to go drink with his buddies, and one of those hours he was fucking asleep. His bday was on a Wednesday. Said he wanted to hang with his friends Wed but would spend the night Thurs. Thursday rolled around and he cancelled, said he'd spend the night Friday. Friday rolled around and he cancelled so he could play poker with his friends and stayed up until 4 am drinking with them. I got super upset and we had a big blow up and I told him I was backing off until he made me feel special... he showed me where I stood with him by not talking to me for a week because he needed ""time and space"" to process things. I broke up with him the next Friday over the phone because I was sick of playing on his terms, then immediately went out with my friends that night.

Since then, I have dated and hooked up with multiple people and my social life is vibrant. I used my ex as an excuse to never go out, but this semester I've made lots of new connections and I constantly have plans. I also did very well for myself academically, killed it at my internship, am on a rec sports team, and just secured an internship with the fucking federal government for next summer. I'm beautiful, I'm thin, I'm funny as fuck and smart as hell. I'm great in bed and generally very charming. I know I am going to have a great and fulfilling life and eventually meet an incredible man. But why am I still so hung up on this guy? 

I find myself frequently wondering why he didn't love me more/ enough/ at all. When we were together, I had confessed to him a few times that I felt like if I were more beautiful, smart, intelligent, etc that he would love me more and that I never felt like the woman he was going to marry. Now I know that the latter was my intuition telling me to gtf out of Dodge. But why does it make me sad? Why can't I just let go? He doesn't care. I texted him today asking why things happened the way that they did and he said, ""They just did. Why are you thinking that hard about it"" ummmm because we dated for 2 fucking years you emotionless fucking robot???? I blocked him after that.

In some ways it comforts me knowing that I came out on top. He is fundamentally broken inside and it will take an act of God and intense therapy for him to repair whatever it is inside of himself that needs fixing. And I am glad he isn't my problem anymore. I realized last night that for the first time since I can remember (this year at least), I've been sleeping through the nights and not waking up 1-3x anymore. I'm in a good ass spot and I'm doing really well for myself. But why did he not love me enough to try, literally at all?

My bf is quite literally perfect for me. We do not argue, because there is nothing to argue about. We agree politically, he respects me, he respects women in general. He treats me like a queen. If I ask for anything - affection or attention - I get it. We work together on housework, he eats what I cook (and praises it!) and he does the dishes since I hate that chore and love cooking. We spend quality time together. Sex life is amazing. He gets along with my crazy ass family, and supports me seeing them whenever I like. I get chronic migraines and he rubs my neck, bought us a new mattress to help with that pain, takes me to the er when I need it, researches things for me to try so I can stop the migraines. He outright paid for me to have a surgery recently, and has taken care of me expertly since. We laugh together every day. He adds value to my life, and there is *almost* nothing I want different in our life. 

And the almost...

He plays video games a bit too much. Like 6 hours a day, too much, when he has free time or days off. He's been playing the same mmrpg since he was in the seventh grade, he has raid nights scheduled...he loves this game. He does everything else perfectly and I don't even know why it bothers me. I'm normally busy when he's playing. I had an abusive ex who would play his games, spend time with friends, and ignore me constantly. It's like I associate anything to do with that ex with a negative trait and it repulses me. 

My ex was a classic love-bomber turned negging enthusiast and became abusive after I moved in with him, verbally and emotionally abusing me and ended up becoming physically abusive and trying to kill me at the end of our relationship. I have done everything I can to get over the trauma, obviously including therapy. I spent years single and only started dating the FDS way about three years ago, which is when I met my bf. But for some reason my bf playing games for hours seems to trigger extreme anxiety and I don't know how to stop that or even if i should?

If the relationship is perfect besides one flaw...what do you do? Especially when your reasons for hating the flaw are more related to past trauma than to current bf?

I know the principles on here help to get respect from men and also books (I put many of them into my to read list) but I have just discovered all this stuff and it isn't very popular in general.
The most mainstream dating advice seems to stay the opposite things and it is confusing sometimes.

I am young (20yo) but I have already experienced a great amount of distress, most of it was caused by my own stupidity and stubborness.

I keep seeking validation from guys and in the end I don't get anything out of this. I broke my own heart 3 or 4 times in one year or 2 without even trying to date in an active manner.

I thought for a while that love would solve my issues and compensate for my lack of social life etc but now I am sick of it.

I keep chasing breadcrumbs of attention even though I know it is bad for me.

The fact that I have to do x and y to turn ""high value"" is so depressed. Humans surely make me misanthopic but I guess it is life.

I am into therapy and working on it but sometimes I can't deal with all the rejection anymore. Circumstances also played a role etc and it is my own fault for building my hopes up in the past but I cannot accept that they didn't/don't want me even if maybe they liked me or respected me.

I never had a guy being crazy for me, I know women don't exist for men and their bullshit but it hurts and it is human nature I guess. They are attracted to me, like me or my company or respect me but nothing else. Also those cases were separated because I hardly get the chance to meet people irl but I don't want to throw myself into dating and meeting guys.

I feel like finding someone you click with and are in love is too hard and I don't want to go on dozen of dates or waste time. 

I need to work on my social skills and life in general but I have an hard time relating to people. 

I get compliments on my looks, intelligence or character but I feel rather insignificant. People get into relationships all the time without being exceptional or anything (men and women included). You don't need to be 8+/10, earn 500k per year, be extremely popular or a celebrity or have an 145 IQ.

I get tons of compliments on my intelligence etc but many say smart women are a turn off to men. Please don't call me a pickmeisha, I am just saying that some say it is not as attractive to men as looks or other personality traits.

Not saying I am Einstein or similar, but many guys don't like intellectual convo and for me it is vital for a possible relationship.",42367,"I am not an ""High Value Woman""",0,,

This obviously means cooking is a daily thing for us. We aim to eat healthy and also to save our dollars by not eating out every day. 

Most HVM are this way as well. When not dating and in a LTR cooking can be a fun thing to do together. BUT save that shit for a real LTR leading to marriage. If you start cooking FOR him not with him, you‚Äôre setting yourself up to be used in the long term.

F all the ‚Äúthe way to a mans heart is through his stomach‚Äù. What that really means is the way to get love is to be a grown ass mans mommy. HV or not, a man will allow you to cook for him and eventually will expect it if you don‚Äôt play your cards right and never ever slip on it.

Here‚Äôs when and how I approach cooking.

When dating in the very early stages, it isn‚Äôt out of the ordinary for any human to want to move from spending $ on dinner 1-2 times a week on you and probably others as well. To doing home dates where HE cooks. Don‚Äôt do it! For atleast 2-3 months. 

When you feel comfortable allowing some dates to be at one of your homes, do not cook for him. He may cook for you. And if dinners out become a thing of the past, that‚Äôs a red flag. He doesn‚Äôt get to all of the sudden have what he‚Äôd have in a wife. Enjoying each other‚Äôs company at home is what we do in relationships. And you should expect to be taken out atleast once a week when it‚Äôs relationship time.

When i feel secure that he isn‚Äôt slipping into comfortable, low effort land, I will participate in the cooking intermittently. I love cooking and I also like things a certain way. This is a good way to gage his expectations of you. If you decide to not help him cook, how does he react? Was he happy doing it until you helped one time &amp; now he‚Äôs pissy he has to do it all on his own? Red flag. This will show people who are waiting with baited breath on the moment they can drop the effort to zero.

Always be prepared to eat nuts, avocado &amp; a hand full of spinach before you ever find yourself with some dude looking at you asking if there‚Äôs anything to eat. That means cook for me. I will survive off pecans even if I‚Äôd love to make myself a lovely meal. I‚Äôll do it when he goes home. 

In a LTR where we live together I will usually pick a meal a day that I‚Äôd like to cook. It‚Äôs usually breakfast because I am starving in the morning. They will cook dinner. Or we will cook dinner together and I won‚Äôt make breakfast. There always must be a give and take when it comes to cooking because everyone eats a few times a day. Never be the one to always do the dishes, never cook twice in a row. 

If dinner out begins to slip in a LTR I stop cooking entirely and go to dinner with friends often. I spend less time at home and give less treats. He will get the picture that if he‚Äôd like to spend time with me he can never stop dating me. It‚Äôs hard to keep boundaries up when you settle in with someone. But once you slip it‚Äôs hard to get the balance back. Stay on your toes forever.

I live in a relatively small city where the pool of men to date has grown due to people moving to the area, but I have had no luck finding a HVM. I'd like to expose some fallacies.

1. **Some dating apps are for hook-ups, others have better quality men, paid apps are better than free ones** \- Completely false. An acquaintance of mine conducted an experiment. She joined all of the major dating sights that existed at the time and took copious notes and screenshots. Guess what? All of the same men are on multiple apps, both those deemed for hook-ups and those for relationships - like eHarmony. There was zero difference in the men out there.
2. **You will meet better quality men IRL through meet-up groups and activities.** Wrong. Men who are on the prowl will be just as deceitful and manipulative IRL as they are online. In fact even if you meet IRL it is likely he has an online profile, although you won't know that unless you do too and see him there or a friend tells you.
3. **It's better to be introduced by friends** \- Not always. Remember, your friends only know this man in the context of friend, acquaintance or family member. They do not know how he behaves in intimate relationships. Men are very good at hiding psychological and emotional abuse behind closed doors. They don't tell their friends or family they are an abuser.

In my 9 years of singlehood as a mature woman I have used OLD off and on. In that time I've noticed the SAME men have been on there for YEARS. The same men are ALWAYS there. This is because they are not looking for a relationship - only sex. If you always see the same guy on there - steer clear.

I have had terrible experiences with men I met IRL, even when we had a large network of common friends and colleagues. People didn't tell me what they knew about him until after the damage was inflicted. They didn't want to ""gossip."" Only later did I find out he had a pattern of treating women poorly, but he is fun and charming so most people like him anyway.

Remember, there is not some mysterious pool of HVM out there that you have failed to stumble across. What you see is what is out there. The only way to go about this is through extreme vetting and using FDS methods. Also, the older you get the harder it will be. Not because you are less attractive as an older woman, but because the men in your age group that are single are single for very good reasons.

Stay safe ladies.",42272,OLD or IRL - basically no difference - here's why,0,,

so soon I [26F] will graduate from my university but unfortunately I chose a field that won't pay well. and I'm not even sure if I want to work in that field but that's another story. my field is art history but I will probably end up in a simple 9-5 office job in the beginning bc I need stability, a routine and time to figure myself out and heal from the stress caused by university.

so the thing is I won't earn much. I will probably earn about 200.000 HUF/month which is not bad money but not much either in my country. our currency is really weak compared to other currencies such as USD so there's no point in comparing the 2 hahaha.

I plan to either educate myself in another field next to work so I could find a better paying job or just work a lot to gain experience and apply for better positions. but in the mean time, currently I'm working on my looks and mentality to be more attractive.

so my question is; if I don't earn much but I'm high value in other aspects (looks and personality wise) can I still be a HVW?

edit: also bc of the money I will probably still live with my parents for some time. unfortunately in my country it's not unusual to live with your parents until your late 20s, early 30s.",42262,[SEEKING ADVICE] can you be a HVW if you don't earn much?,0,,

But this whole notion that men were doing manual labor while their wives watched the kids is a concept that really only applied to the upper classes of society.

Most women throughout history were slaves, maids to rich people, factory workers in shit conditions, servants, etc. A few were nuns. The whole housewife concept was only for men who made good money. 

If you read the jungle by Upton Sinclair, most poor immigrant women worked in shit factories where they were abused. 


Yes, men were dramatically more likely to fight in wars  and I guess you could argue that being able to be a prostitute to survive is a ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù.

When a man you're seeing does something that actually deserves praise (paying for a nice dinner, doing something genuinely thoughtful), let him know you are pleased. Smile, say you appreciate it and thank you. Be genuine.

A LVM will both love this and panic a bit. He will love knowing that he's possibly ''got you'' where he wants you, but more than this be smitten by the fear that he has possibly given you more than he needed to, and could possibly get away with less. As a result, you will see de-escalation, withdrawal, or other bullshit. LVM are ALWAYS thinking of how to ''protect'' themselves from ''being used'', and will cut any corners if he gets to thinking you're a bit too pleased with him. If you're happy with this, you'll be *satisfied* with less, and that's his important takeaway. 

A HVM? Different story. This man will be positively delighted, and keep all that nice shit coming. Your smile, laugh, and words of appreciation are like crack that keep him coming back for another hit. You will see him keep it up, and possibly try to outdo himself to see just how beautiful you look when you're even happier. Accept enough investment, and he will be at your service for life, without mind games or feigning being unimpressed. All to see you smile.

Two important reminders: 1) Reign in your inner pickmeisha and don't over-fawn or blow smoke up his butt about his generousity. Just accept his gifts with pleasure. 2) Keep it under your hat. Don't let on that you're watching how he reacts to your gratitude (or indeed, any other standard of behaviour you're watching for), just sit back, observe, and quietly work it in to your vetting.",42210,"Gratitude - reason to continue and escalate for HVM, reason to withdraw for LVM.",0,,

4. Nails? Should I go to a salon every time? I am not that good at doing them myself, I get bored of one nail polish. They also break really easily and it's quite annoying.
5. What books should I read, as a woman in my twenties? (I'm 21) How to learn more about finances and other adult-ish stuff as well?
6. What has been life changing for you? How did you change your attitude and negative thoughts? How do you manage being a bit too emotional sometimes?
7. What do you read/listen to during your commute? I travel 1.5h to work. 1.5h back from work (by bus + subway, don't ask, it's horrible)
8. Have you found your passion? I've only found something I like and can be better at, but I don't feel that intense drive to become the best, or to spend hours learning it (IT related) I am still not sure I am on the right path
9. How do you nurture your friendships? Also, how do you make new friends? I love my friends, but sometimes I would love to go to nice places and they're not into that, like I wanted to go with them to an luxurious restaurant ""in the sky"" because of the wow view, I feel like I need some friends who are into more luxurious things.

Any other advice is welcomed. Thank you!",42183,How do you improve yourself as a HVW?,0,,

I never posted earlier but I make it a point to read this subreddit religiously lol. I have had a history of being a terrible pickmeisha (once waited on a guy I NEVER EVEN MET for almost 2 years). But since I became more independent, career-wise, I realised I did not really NEED a man so much. However, I do want love, marriage, and kids sooo much. 

I had been talking to what I thought was an HVM since early November. We ""met"" through OLD but we are literally on opposite sides of the world so a real life meeting will take time. He was the one who approached me first. It is crystal clear that both of us are seeking marriage. We've talked about serious topics and I've even told him that I'm online so that I can find someone and hopefully be married within a year - so he knows I'm not gonna be around forever or wait for him. The only relationship he had been in ended in her cheating on him and he's not very social and does not even have female friends.

Our text interactions have been fairly healthy with equal texting from both sides. When we spoke over the phone (Skype) he was a bit of the quieter type and I was more talkative, which was fine for us. During our last phone call on Sunday I told him that the next time we talk we need to video call since we haven't really seen each other yet and he agreed that we'd do it once he returned after New Year's Eve.

However, he last messaged me 'good night' on Sunday, before he left his city to meet his family for Christmas/NYE. I had felt that he wasn't showing enough direct interest so I made a vow to not text him until he texts me. It is now Thursday and he has not sent me a message. Should I text him and tell him that his low effort and lack of initiation is off-putting and that we should end this thing if this is how he's gonna be? He has been online on the OLD app MANY times AND has been active on Skype as well (which by the way he didn't even use before I asked him to get it so we could chat and call instead of writing 3 page letters by email...so was he waiting for a text?). He really is the shy type but maybe I'm just making excuses for him. I've talked to enough men to know that guys who really want you will pester you. In fact I have two other men doing the same thing right now. I liked this one though cause he seemed like an HVM and will be a bit sad if this ends. What do?

I'm annoyed at him because he's not exactly conventionally attractive or manly and he's short as well and he's even admitted indirectly that he does not have many prospects. But in this case, he ought to be grateful that I'm communicating with him...and he does not appear to be.",42116,Slap some sense into me: should I (25F) text him (26M)? 4 days with no communication from either side.,0,,

But here's the thing -

A year and a half ago a very tall, very popular, very not emotionally well ""bad boy"" type love bombed me when he was 31 and I was a lonely, naive 22. We immediately move in together (mind you, he didn't pay rent). I was so insecure and so depressed that I felt like a human for the first time in months when we first got together. When he started to get shakey, I loved him so much that I told him to move back to California to sort his shit out. He moves to California, and we go back and forth a bit. He gets a girlfriend, but keeps in contact with me.

Now that we're both single (I think), we've been talking again. However, the truth is that I don't trust him anymore. I think he pulls the sensitive card but like, doesnt care about hurting anyone elses feelings. When we first dated, he would sometimes treat me with contempt, or just disappear. I get that it was him being also super depressed, but there were a lot of boundary crossing emotionally that I wasn't down with.

The point I want to make is this - the fact that he immediately began dating his ex worried me that he overlaps women + betrays trust - and more importantly - when I began asking about him around town I heard way too many stories about him cheating on women/ghosting women/being a dick to them. I couldn't deal. I literally love women, I defend us, advocate for us, protect us with no questions asked. I even feel and have acted protective over his ex girlfriend because I understand whatever ""faults"" he's whined to me about. While I feel like he and I could work out some stuff in the second paragraph, ultimately, we are NOT exceptions to anyone's rule. Men who are high quality show UP as high quality - in every facet of their lives. When their actions fall into a gray area, it's with integrity and honesty. Only men who show UP as high quality CONSISTENTLY and are UNCOMPROMISING with it are worth being vulnerable and soft with. The patriarchy literally conditions men to take advantage of nurturing women, and without severe self analysis/growth or a proper childhood these men don't escape it. You gotta protect yourself, and you HAVE to keep an eye out to protect others as well.

I'm probably always going to love him as that's just a testament to my own capacity to love and forgive, and I find that to be an incredible strength, but its over between us. I can't willingly sleep with someone knowing he's dogged other women for a near decade. I'll pass.

Edit: Also, thank you to this subreddit for, just, existing. I've been lurking for forever, and it's taken me so long to ice him out. I've been able to start being super honest with myself about pick me behavior, and its been game changing. Thank you &lt;3",42756,there's no such thing as an exception to someone's rule,0,,

But at the same time, I‚Äôve somehow managed not to trash single dads. I don‚Äôt know their situation and I don‚Äôt believe they should be shamed or humiliated for being single dads. 

But somehow, men go out of their way to say God awful things about single moms on Reddit. Calling them whores, easy, etc. 

And now I understand why. 

Having a kid shrinks your dating pool because a lot of people don‚Äôt want to have kids. You also become more picky because you don‚Äôt want your kid to have a step parent who is trash. 

By the Reddit logic, a woman who is a single mom should be grateful for whatever attention she can get because her kid shrinks her dating pool. 

NOT JUST THAT. They expect the single mom to be an ‚Äúeasy charity case‚Äù where they can just pump and dump with zero consequences and she will be grateful for whatever crumbs of attention she can get. 

When they realize that she is more likely to be looking for something serious and is not a free for all for casual sex, they get mad. Very mad.

During this past spring break while on vacation with my family, my first love broke things off with me after more than 2 years together. I felt a lot of things, hurt, anger, embarrassment.

I wanted to move on from him, so I downloaded bumble and started meeting new people. I got lots of matches and subsequent Snapchats, and started going on dates with whatever guy was within a 2 hour drive who wasn't busy that weekend. I met a couple shy guys, even though they were smart/clever and a little nerdy (my type) they were too shy and hesitant, I didn't want someone who was scared to touch me. I matched with a military guy [M22] in my area, we talked for weeks over Snapchat because he was away for his job, but finally he had a weekend free and we decided to meet up.

We met in a touristy place that was in the middle for both of us and had dinner. I thought he was extremely attractive and we had a good meal. I was forward with him, I ordered for us. He was kind of quiet at first so I was afraid I'd found another shy guy and was trying to pick up the slack. (Later that night, he told me he was put off by my confidence, how forward I was and almost ended dinner, but he gave it a chance and ended up being really into me by the end. He kept saying I had BDE). When the meal was over I honestly wasn't sure if he'd want to do anything else, I felt kinda meh about the interaction but he flirted on the way out talking about my ass (""you can always walk in front of me baby""), and we both relaxed a little. We talked and went to different little shops near the restaurant, and ended up on a pretty lit up bridge at night, just overlooking a river. We chatted for a while and I thought he might try to make a move, but he didn't. We eventually moved off of the bridge to get somewhere a little warmer, and when we sat on a bench, he pulled me into his lap and we started kissing. We ended up walking back to his car and driving over to mine, where we made out for another 15 minutes, and he invited me to come back to his place. I turned him down, but told him I had a great time and went home. 

Next weekend came around and we decided we wanted to see each other again, and I wanted to pick up where we left off, so I offered to drive 1.5 hours out to his place. I get there, I tell him I don't want to sleep with him, and then we made out like the weekend before and ended up sleeping together. The next week I go out to see him again, (I was living with my parents at the time, so his place was the only option for privacy), and we slept together again. He turned to me afterwards and asked if I was talking to other guys, we weren't official, so I told him yes, technically I was talking to other guys (but not as often because I was really into him). He asked if I was sleeping with other guys, and I told him the truth that I wasn't, and he asked if we could make things official. I reluctantly said yes. I stopped talking to all other guys I was talking with by posting a selfie of me and this guy snuggled up together onto a story that the other guys would see. Very classy, I know. He had posted me on his story twice at this point though, and he said he wasn't talking to anyone else, so I felt obligated to do the same. Some of the other guys I had been going on dates with (no more than 3)  were understandably upset to see me with someone else on my story, but I wasn't official with anyone.

The rest of the summer, I saw him 1-2 times a week, with for the exception of 2-3 times, involved me driving 1.5 hours there and 1.5 hours back late at night, because my parents would never have let me stay overnight. I was off of school but he worked full time, along with his military stuff which was part-time, so I tried to work around his schedule.

 I started falling for him fast, and he eventually came and met my parents. We all played cards together. He came over another time to go floating together. The floating trip is significant because we had to spend time together for like 4 hours, we couldn't really do anything overly sexual, and it felt really long. We got along but we had a lot of gaps in conversation that day, and idk. Things felt off. But he was so my type, I didn't think to much of it. Another red flag was a time that I was over on a Saturday, as usual, and his friends were supposed to stop by. He came onto me as he usually did and I said we should wait, his friends would probably be there any second. Low and behold, as soon as we start going at it, his friend calls and he jumps off of me and runs down to see them. I laid in bed for 15 minutes before I got dressed and went out to his living room, and watched TV while I waited for him to come back up. He came back maybe 25 minutes later and says ""you're dressed? Sorry, I told them I had *a girl* waiting in my bed, they finally let me go."" Didn't mention his *girlfriend* was over, didn't offer to introduce me, even though he always went on about how amazing I was and how he never stopped telling them about me. I was really hurt by that.

Weeks later, we met and had dinner at one of his favorite restaurants on a weeknight, which wasn't usual for us. He had a long military thing coming up, and o wouldn't see him for a few weeks. We ate, then sat and talked by a river at sunset and I remember thinking how attractive he was. Then he started trying to come on to me, and he wanted to go back to his car. I told him no, and he basically was like ""well, I better get going then,"" after he knew we weren't going to bang. 

Toward the end of his training, I texted him trying to make plans via snapchat. He sent ""hey listen, I'm thinking about moving away, we probably shouldn't keep seeing each other."" I had a couple things at his place, and he asked if I wanted to come get them. I knew if I went, he'd want to use me for sec one more time, I'd take my stuff, and then drive like the idiot I am back to my place. I told him no, and could he mail my things, he said yes. No word from him for a week after that, do I asked if he sent it, he said he hasn't but he was going to send it after work that day. He never sent it, and I was hurt again.

I'm dating someone new now, and haven't talked to the guy from this summer since things were broken off. I blocked him on everything after the reasonable about of time it would've taken to receive my shit. 

He enjoyed sleeping with me, and I enjoyed our physical chemistry too. I wasn't totally excited about getting into a relationship though, I just wanted to keep seeing him and sleeping together, because it was really fun and exciting. He totally just wanted to sleep with me without me having the freedom to sleep with other guys, and manipulated me into thinking he wanted anything more than that.

What do you think of this situation? I still feel hurt over the way he treated me, and I'm still kind of seeking clarification in a way.",42697,"Severe case of Cockholm Syndrome, I let a LVM manipulate my feelings for an entire summer.

I have almost no savings, have chronic illness (but work full time at a decent job), and have a lot of work to do self esteem building wise. I want to lose some more weight (im 55lbs down already), save money, etc.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years. We work in the same building on the same hours. We share a split level with my mother at the moment. We don‚Äôt have sex, he‚Äôs incredibly messy, has poor hygiene, and has no plans for the future, etc. I‚Äôm 28 and he‚Äôs 33. He only discusses our future together when I bring it up. I used to want to get married desperately, but ever since discovering this sub, I‚Äôm 95% sure I‚Äôll say no unless he changes his ways *severely* and I‚Äôm almost certain that won‚Äôt happen.

Typical story, bad childhood, no family, etc. I do believe he loves me, but I‚Äôm more of a comfort blanket than anything else. It feels more platonic than anything. In the past, he has emotionally cheated on me with multiple girls online. I‚Äôd say I caught him four times. I also do not know his computer or phone passwords. He now leaves it unlocked if he has to leave the room for a few minutes, but if he‚Äôs away for an extended period or asleep he locks it.

We don‚Äôt fight, and I used to think that was proof of our *~amazing relationship~*. L m a o. He claims he doesn‚Äôt watch porn or talk to other women online, but he moderates a Discord server that has thousands of members. I don‚Äôt really trust him, but I have also kind of stopped caring. Maybe it‚Äôs a defense mechanism because I don‚Äôt want to get hurt if I find out something has been going on. I‚Äôm 100% sure he‚Äôs not physically cheating as we work together and have the same hours, but emotional is still horrible.

Anyway, that‚Äôs my pathetic back story.

I‚Äôve been calling him out on LVM shit. This morning, I told him that his hair looked gross and he should get a hair cut. I used to never speak to him this way, but I‚Äôve decided to not baby him so much anymore and be honest. He‚Äôs balding pretty bad so it just looks awful when it‚Äôs like 2‚Äù long. He said ‚Äúyeah I do.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúIf you were going out on a first date with a girl, would you allow your hair to look like that?‚Äù He said no. I then asked ‚Äúthen why am I any different?‚Äù No response other than some sulking and laying his face into the pillow in bed.

The other day, I also said to him that I went food shopping and am planning on dieting and trying a vegan diet. I also said I‚Äôm trying to improve a lot in my life because I‚Äôm sick of my low effort lifestyle. I asked if he would join me in becoming healthier.

- Instrumentality: the treatment of a person as a tool for the objectifier's purposes;

- denial of autonomy: the treatment of a person as lacking in autonomy and self-determination;

- Inertness: the treatment of a person as lacking in agency, and perhaps also in activity;

- fungibility: the treatment of a person as interchangeable with other objects;

- violability: the treatment of a person as lacking in boundary-integrity;

- ownership: the treatment of a person as something that is owned by another (can be bought or sold);

- denial of subjectivity: the treatment of a person as something whose experiences and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account.

- reduction to body: the treatment of a person as identified with their body, or body parts;

- Reduction to appearance: the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the senses;

- silencing: the treatment of a person as if they are silent, lacking the capacity to speak.

He was freshly separated from a short-term relationship and also in the process of starting divorce process with the ex-wife after a yearlong seperation. 

I didn‚Äôt expect to like him so much, we clicked and it was so effortless being in his presence from the first date. We knew we wanted to be a couple, we wanted to be with each other and no one else instantly, but he was so  fucking stressed about being in a new relationship even from the beginning. 

I knew the breakup was coming as quickly as the relationship developed. Every time we met up he would get anxious about how much he liked me, saying how sacred he was to fall in love, no matter how many times I told him we would take it slow. He constantly said I was too good for him and he was worried about fucking it up and hurting me. 

When I rang him to say it was over and release him he ended up saying it first and it was a relief. It was too hard to begin with and I felt sad but proud of his decision that he was talking about entering therapy for his anxiety and issues. I was happy for him for taking control and he discussed wanting to connect again when he was in a better headspace. 

He contacted me this week about catching up and I asked him to call me about it. He didn‚Äôt ring, but every few days a message that he would contact me in a few more days. I don‚Äôt like being in a holding pattern - why was I waiting to hear from him about this? 

I checked his Facebook today - two days ago he gushed about how he found love this year and it‚Äôs the happiest he‚Äôs been for a long time. They met somewhere around a month after we broke up. She was at a party I was supposed to attend, meeting his closet friends and family for Halloween. I threw my phone across the room. 

It took me about an hour to compose myself and then I texted him to say it was actually mistake for me to agree to catch up, that I want to leave it alone and move on, that I wish him all the best in life and love. I said nothing about what I saw, and I didn‚Äôt wait for a response before I deleted him all over again. 

I‚Äôm seething with anger, a white, blind rage - whereas when we first said goodbye I ended up being very indifferent as I knew it was coming and we hadn‚Äôt dated long for me to get too attached. I don‚Äôt know what I feel under that - Inadequate? Unimportant? Used? Like I‚Äôm a nothing.

My boyfriend and I work at the same restaurant downtown and on occasion, we both like to go out and have some drinks after work. Except recently, it's been an almost every night after work kind of thing for him, including days that I'm not even there. 

We both need to have our own lives, I get that. But I guess when he gets home is the only quality time I have with him, because we've probably only been on 3 official dates since we started dating. Other than that we pretty much hang out at my place, watch movies, go on walks, lowkey things (which I still appreciate) but us actually having quality time out of the house together is few and far between. 

Anyways so tonight I really wanted to see him after work, so before he left I asked if he was gonna come straight to my house after, and he said yes. He just texted me saying he has to give a coworker a ride home who gets off later than him, and while he waits he's gonna go play pool at the bar. 

Btw, he doesnt even officially live at my house. He's lived here rent free (until this month when I finally asked for a small amount), so it feels shitty for him to sleep here when he's not even really here to see me if he's gonna be out until 4am and get home when I'm sleeping. Also it's especially frustrating on nights when he says he will be home at 1 and shows up at 4. But to be fair, I've done similar things before so I get it.. I guess it's just that I've done it 2 times compared to him doing it quite often. 

I also live in an apartment complex and have to buzz him in with my phone, so everytime he comes in late I get a call to my phone and it wakes me up. 

Yes, its inconvenient, but honestly I'm worried that I'm not justified in feeling so worried and shitty about this. I know for a fact he loves me and would never use me. He shows gratitude in many, many different ways (cleaning up around the house, having the bed and dinner made for me when I get off late, etc)

So where do I draw the line? Am I being controlling, or do we need to have set boundaries about this? How do i set my boundaries WITHOUT being controlling? Do I even have a justified reason for feeling any sort of way about this?",42582,I get stressed out when my boyfriend goes out to drink after work...,0,,

Hi ladies,

I'm new to FDS but definitely need it.

How do I always find these guys.

I met a cute guy on OLD and we've been talking a lot on most days for a while and had a lot of good conversations. I thought he's different than other guys. Of course. I wanted a fling or a short relationship or many long-term but I wanted monogamy. We talked a lot but only met up twice because of the distance. No sex. On the third date he told me he thinks he's in love with me. I said that's a little bit too soon and made awkward jokes because I was flattered but didn't know if he means it. He called me today and said it maybe was a little bit too soon but nevermind he things he's in love with a stripper and call girl he met recently at an ""sex industry event"" and would like to pursue a relationship with her. I don't seem too be too much into him anyway.
He said I'm a little bit too uptight for him too because I don't have as much sexual experience as her does.

I feel so stupid. How could I think he's different. It's silly but I also kind of feel bad because he's now dating a ""hot stripper"" and maybe I'm not too hot or something.
How can I feel better about this and how can you meet better guys who're not in love with everyone or had sex with everyone? It's not easy for me when they act like they're so different in the beginning. I'm so naive and romantic and always fall for their act.",42557,Another idiot,0,,

I wanted to share my experience so hopefully others can learn from it. 

I met my ex boyfriend last year on Tinder. I was only 20 and a virgin. I never had a boyfriend before. He was just a few years older than me. Nevertheless, he showered me with tons of affection and attention, and we had a lot in common, so I got roped in easily. Very early on, he kept trying to push sex on me instead of being patient and understanding knowing full well I had no sexual experience and felt uncomfortable with sexual touching. I wanted to take things slow. 

Once, we were going for a walk, and every time he'd pull me in for a kiss, he would slide his hands up my shirt into my bra and and down my pants even though I made it known to him that I don't want him doing that. I would repeatedly pull away and tell him to stop, and he would laugh and do it again. I confronted him the next day over text, he apologized and promised he would never repeat that behavior again (lies). 

Once we did start having sex, I had a very strict rule that he always wear a condom. Idgaf if it cuts his sensitivity in half. I don't want to get pregnant. And nor was I willing to put my body through birth control pills. Despite this, he would incessantly beg me to allow him to fuck me without a condom, promising to ''pull out'' even though I said no every single time. Once I had a pregnancy scare, and even after seeing how anxious I was, he would still beg for unprotected sex. Once I finally put my foot down and told him enough was enough, I asked how could he keep doing this after seeing how anxious I was when I had the pregnancy scare? He admitted he didn't take it seriously because he thought I'd just get an abortion. But guess what, he apologized, cried, and promised he would change. So I stayed because I loved him. 

Think he started to magically respect my boundaries? Nope. Later on in the relationship, he actually penetrated me without a condom three times without ever asking for my consent! And when I expressed that I was in pain, he shushed me and told me to ''hold on''. A couple days later, I texted him because I was having immense anxiety thinking I'd get pregnant but also I confronted him about violating my boundaries and doing something without my consent. Shortly after, I found out he had actually cheated on me more than once and I dumped him.

Went to get tested for STDs and pregnancy right away and thankfully, I was in the clear. For so long, the emotional abuse he put me through really messed me up. For a long time, I blamed myself for not running away when he showed his lack of respect for me and my body very very early on int he relationship. I still take part responsibility for not taking care of myself and allowing someone to continuously mistreat me. But I also acknowledge that I was young, he was my first relationship experience, and I've learned my lesson. 

I'll also have you know that many months after the breakup, I reported him for sexual assault. He got arrested last week and currently has a whopping three charges of sexual assault against him. The thing that saved my ass were the screenshots of me confronting him about all these things. If he thought he could get away with mistreating a woman then he was sadly mistaken because I am not a force to be reckoned with. So, ladies, the moment he disrespects your boundaries--haul ass. Doesn't matter how many times he apologizes or promises to change. He won't. They never do. The more chances you get them, the more they will test your limits to see what else you'll let them get away with.",42493,Why it's SUPER important to leave as soon as possible the moment you start seeing red flags,0,,

A couple of days ago I went on a date with this guy. The date was *fine*. I told him beforehand that I'm moving to Europe in 5 months so dating isn't really a serious thing for me right now, he was supportive and said it would be nice just to get to know each other. We had a good, long dinner. I mentioned during the date that I didn't like when guys are super clingy and that typically tends to happen with me on dates, we go out once and they think we're ""in a relationship"". He laughed and told a story about a girl that was talking about marriage and kids after their first date. I wasn't sure how I felt about him during and after the date, I mean he was very sweet and cute and 6'6 (let's not pretend like that doesn't matter) but he definitely wasn't someone I would date long term because I'm not giving up my plan to move overseas for some random dude I just met, amiright ladies? Plus we both work too much and he travels a lot for work and it just was destined not to go anywhere.

About an hour after the dinner he texted...

**Him:** Hey! I had a great time, hope we have that again.

**Me:** Me too

**Him:** Awesome. Have a good night liz. Stay cute.

**Me:** I will if you will

**Him:** For sure sweet thing.

And then... nothing. That was three days ago. And I haven't heard from him since. He went out of state yesterday for a week and I didn't hear a word, and I *definitely* don't text first.

So I started to be like, Wait, what? Maybe he doesn't like me? Then why did he text me after? What did I do wrong? What's going on here? Did I misread everything? What's wrong with me?

And then I stopped myself. And I remembered. **I. Don't. Fucking. Care.** 

Even while we were on the date, I was like ""I'm not feeling this dude."" But despite not being into him, I still felt some type of way when I perceived a possible rejection. I couldn't believe that I was even thinking about this guy several days later, as if I'm not That Bitch who has my shit together, an amazing life, and a bomb ass future. And then I realized that a lot of the time I've been ""upset"" about a guy, it was usually less about *him* and more about my ego being bruised or my feelings being hurt. Because in many ways, I still struggle to define myself by *my* approval of *myself,* and not someone else's approval of me. I still have a hard time not letting another person invalidate my own sense of self worth. Why is this? Possibly trauma. Possibly living in a society where women are defined by their relationship to other people and not raised to be autonomous individuals. I'm still figuring that out. 

So I snapped out of it. And it was such a good lesson to learn. And it should be a good reminder to all of us: 

* Are you actually upset about ***him***, or are you upset about the rejection?
* Do you *really* care about who ***he*** is at his core, or are you mourning the loss of the relationship, or the potential connection you thought you could be building?
* Does ***he*** actually matter that much at all?
* Do you get all caught up on a guy, do the bitch ass double text if you feel him pulling away, or feel a rush of relief when you *finally* get a text from him?

If so, you're probably like me and need to do that deep emotional work and keep building up that self-love. Women that value themselves above everything don't wait around for texts back from men they don't even give a fuck about. They do their damn thing and wait for the guy who is a ***good match*** at the ***right time***, not just someone who's kinda tall.",38601,I had a realization today...,0,,

I‚Äôve always had feelings for this guy and he was the typical fuckboy when we were younger. Months would go by and we‚Äôd barely talk. He approached me last year because he wanted to date but I had run back to my alcoholic abusive ex at the time. Long story short, shit went down and my fwb ended up saving me from staying with my abusive ex. Me and my fwb admitted we loved each other, ended up traveling and acted like a couple (that we agreed felt so natural), and saw each other day. We still see each other super frequently and text and talk daily. 

Over time, he admitted he‚Äôs ‚Äúbroken‚Äù and ‚Äúnot ready for a relationship‚Äù blah blah blah. My feelings for him were so strong and I really loved showing affection with him (holding hands, kissing, whatever). After we had gotten back from a trip, he suggested pulling back with that stuff and that we should take things slow. I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing and just knew I loved the guy, so I agreed. 

Fast forward to now, I‚Äôve bugged out a few times since we continued to hook up and I truly do not think I‚Äôm meant for casual sex. I‚Äôve told him how I‚Äôve felt, he‚Äôs not one to open up ever and I told him I don‚Äôt wanna hook up anymore since im only hurting my own feelings. He‚Äôs encouraged me to date other guys and it just makes me mad because I don‚Äôt want to. 

We hang out regularly. We do things on our own. We don‚Äôt hook up anymore. But I still feel some type of way. He‚Äôs a good friend and he‚Äôs there, but I feel my heart and mind have been played. I‚Äôve asked him before if this should just be done with, and his response was ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know what the future holds.‚Äù I‚Äôve been more cold and blunt lately and don‚Äôt get myself as upset, but there‚Äôs still a part of my that is hurt. 

I have zero interest in talking to guys after the stuff I‚Äôve been through this last year. I don‚Äôt go out much, because I kinda don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôve tried apps and I just can‚Äôt hold a conversation. I also still have strong feelings for this guy and am fine just being alone I guess.

It‚Äôs the been the busiest dating week for weeks lately, I had four dates and turned down two due to lack of time, with three dates already lined up for next week too. 

On top of that, old friends and old suitors have predictably popped up and as a result I have blocked three people I failed to do so with in the past when I was originally done with them. Learning as I go! 

___

**The Suitors** 

This week I am still talking to two people consistently from my last recap 

-	Ken - 33, professional removalist. He‚Äôs just gotten out of hospital and is relieved to finally get home and heal up. He‚Äôs tentatively booked a date for next weekend, depending on his recovery. 
-	Tim - 40, chef/construction labourer. Best date of the week üëåüèª and very consistent with contacting me and showing ongoing interest. The surprise MVP of the week. 

**People who have left the rotation**: 

-	Simon, 37, restauranteur. Stopped contacting shortly me after our date last week. Deleted.
-	Peter, 58, creative designer. Never heard from him again after meeting. Blocked and deleted. 
-	Damien, 38, Sous chef. I rejected a  second date after meeting (see below). 
-	Michael, 42, insurance specialist. Blocked and deleted him after first date for being a fucking creep (see below) 
-	Cameron, 38, motoring safety coordinator. Haven‚Äôt heard from him since two days after date (see below). 
-	Richard , 44, mechanic. I sent him a message politely saying I wasn‚Äôt interested and wished him all the best. Blocked and deleted. 

**New additions**: 

-	Jeremy, 36, the self confessed dork. A few too many Star Wars references that I don‚Äôt quite understand and I‚Äôm concerned about his intent on turning his house into a cat playpen (steps and cat shelves everywhere) but we‚Äôve been connecting on OKCupid over our love of sci-fi and video gaming. Asked me out for a date the same day we started talking and when rebuffed asked what my timeline for meeting looks like and if he can call me one night soon. 
-	Josh, 30, the sports guy. He messaged me sometime long ago before I found his profile. Outside of my preferred age range but sent me such an insightful message that I really wanted to feel it out. Matching on all our relationship views so far and share a lot of fitness hobbies. Seems really genuine and has expressed he likes to take things very slow. Very unsure of the age difference (I‚Äôm about to turn 37) so approaching it cautiously.

**The Dates**
 

Four days, four dates, all during one of the worst work weeks I have ever had. I am so tired and my social tank feels very empty today. Made a big mistake for agreeing to so many. 

All the men organised venues close to my location at my request and they also all paid, two were very extremely pleasant company and I would see them again, two I couldn‚Äôt get away from fast enough. Not the worst odds I‚Äôve had in a week but I wouldn‚Äôt book them all back to back again tbh. 


-	Wednesday: Cameron drove to my side of the city for tapas, even more extremely handsome in person and very well dressed for the occasion üëåüèª and he commented on how lovely I looked. Very chivalrous, opening doors, pulling my seat out for me and topping up my water/wine glass during the night. One of the best dates I‚Äôve had in a long time with lots of deep conversation and laughs over  pie incredible meal. He whisked away the cheque to pay before I noticed it has been dropped to the table and asked permission to drive me home to ‚Äòmake sure I got home safe‚Äô. Dropped me at my door, we hugged and had a kiss but it felt more friendly than romantic and he said he had to get home (1.5hr drive). I heard from him the next night (Thursday) and haven‚Äôt since. Not too worried about it as we had both voiced concerns about the big travel distance so wishing him all the best. 
-	Wednesday: Michael met me at a pub near my house for dinner. He was already on probation for sex talk and he just couldn‚Äôt hold his shit together. Saw his true and very pervy colours when he asked me if I had ever been to/would go to a sex club and then started talking about his kinky ex and asking what my kinks are. I tried to steer the conversation away for the remained of our eating time and then went home when he tried to propose a change of location twice. He [messaged me](https://i.imgur.com/pm0b1hS.jpg) after I left about meeting up again and I blocked and deleted him. 
-	Friday: Damien surprisingly found some time in his schedule whereas I thought it was going to take forever to spend time in person, so I was really looking forward to this one.  Unfortunately he had to update me twice that he was running late from work and we changed venues as the originally restaurant was starting to pack up the kitchen by the time he got out to me. Once he got to the new venue it all started to go very very wrong - I found out the secret that he has an 18yr old son - that practically none of our friend group knows and also something else I completely missed, he‚Äôs an active cigarette smoker. Total dealbreaker for me. Other than that he was just very odd, spherically he couldn‚Äôt stop talking so either of us could eat out food. Kept choking on his food as he was yell-talking without chewing as he was eating, and he sent the food away to order himself dessert before I could finish. He asked for a second date before we left and I deflected to think of a polite answer so I don‚Äôt upset all our friends. He‚Äôs messaged me around his work hours but I‚Äôve been asleep so we haven‚Äôt talked since then yet. 
-	Saturday: Catching up with Tim was the best date of the week and the best way to round out the weeks meetups. Went out for Greek food and Tim took the lead and ordered a gyros platter and wine when I was unsure of what to order. What followed was two hours of excellent food and extraordinary conversation, the time just flew by and my face hurt from smiling and laughing. I said in my previous post that he wasn‚Äôt my type but I was just so comfortable with him and he does actually look a lot better than his photos. He waited with me for my Uber afterwards and we hugged goodbye. Haven‚Äôt chatted today but we exchanged messages late last night thanking the other for the date and looking forward to meeting again.

**Insights**

-	I don‚Äôt have the mental energy to do four dates in a row, I was exhausted by the last one and almost cancelled. I won‚Äôt set them up like that ever again. People at work kept laughing when I kept saying ‚ÄòI have another one tonight!‚Äô. 
-	Who the fuck asks someone on the first date if they would go to a sex club? No, I don‚Äôt want to be passed around randoms or play Pok√©mon with STDs and collect them all. That question has made the top of my ‚Äòinappropriate date questions‚Äô hall of fame. Gross. 
-	Potentially dating people in your friends group is tricky, I now know a massive secret that he‚Äôs apparently told no one (had a son when he was 19) and I‚Äôm going to be very tactful about letting him down about another date so I don‚Äôt jolt the dynamic with our mates. 
-	You can have a wonderful date with someone, have a lot in common and no red flags but it still might not go anywhere. The first date with Cameron had me gushing the next day to people, but I had a very strong feeling it would probably be one-and-done. I referred to it as a ‚Äòpalate cleanser‚Äô date as he followed so many bad ones this year and reminded me that truly wonderful men are definitely out there. 
-	I‚Äôve tired of OKCupid and I‚Äôm going to move over to Hinge for something different. I feel like exhausted all the good men on the former and I‚Äôm ready for a new dating pool. First impression - all the dudes are so hot! I‚Äôll have to learn all over again how to sift through them as the profile set up is very different, but I‚Äôm ready for the challenge and already had a lot of likes and messages tonight to reply to.",38567,"Dating Report - W/E 8th Dec, 2019",0,,

What are your thoughts on OLD? 

I tried online dating for the first time in 2013-- I went on a few dates and almost got date raped. OLD probably wasn't too terrible in 2013, but I was young, inexperienced and dating in NYC. I'm just glad that I didn't get hurt. After that, I was too afraid to use OLD again for 5 years.

I didn't try online dating again until 2018. I was older and had a better screening process, and was able to avoid fuckboys, but I underestimated how crazy and desperate men are/were. It's easy enough to avoid fuckboys or men with little patience, but I found that OLD had a lot of mentally ill or personality disordered men. I went on 20-something first dates, less than 6-7 2nd dates, and no 3rd dates. All of this in under 2 months, before I quit. None of these guys made it to date 3. I started to fear the possibility, of finding someone who could manipulate me until date 20 or year 2. Most men's manipulation methods are very dumb and predictable, but there are some really psycho men out there who have patience.

Taking a long to sleep with men protects you from liberal men who think women are public property, but it does not protect you from conservative men who think women are private property. It does not protect you from really crazy, patient men who have the intention of controlling and abusing you in the long-term. There is no real way to verify the identity of any person you meet online, without doing a background check, perhaps without hiring a PI. You don't know anyone they know, they can be anyone or anything. 

I just don't think there is a safe or efficient way for women to use OLD. There is a huge pool, but the pool is radioactive garbage for the most part. The few good candidates on there-- are they what they seem? I also think OLD changes people's psychology and perception. We start to see the  sociopathic behavior of OLD as normal, when it's not.

You seriously have to be a FDS master to navigate OLD successfully. Even then, no success (on any level) is guaranteed. You'd have to find a guy who just signed up to OLD, who is actually really single, not just out of a relationship, emotionally available, emotionally healthy. 

I think women underestimate their intuition. In person, your lizard brain can make judgements about a man, that are just not possible when you are communicating through a screen. So much nuance is lost when you are using OLD. I went on 20-something first dates for example, but I honestly would not have gone on a first date with even half of those men, if I saw them in person. It's not because they were catfishing-- but just something in their body language, eye contact, how they speak-- that was completely lost until  I met them. I think OLD also normalizes women feeling uncomfortable and nervous in the presence of men. Since it is an inherently uncomfortable thing, to meet strange men off the internet. So you start to subconsciously think it's normal that you should feel unsure of yourself when you meet men.

OLD seems really dangerous to me. The only part of it that is less dangerous than meeting men in real life, is rejecting them without consequence or fear. You can just block them. You can't do that in real life. But in every other way, OLD seems really dangerous and basically not worth the level of mental and emotional effort that is required. 

I know I am biased, because of my early experience with OLD. I never really got over that, and I was actually angry and disappointed with myself, felt dirty, after going on 20-something dates-- because I felt easily 1/4 of these men would also date rape me if they had the chance and there were no consequences. 

 I met my fiancee in real life, and I feel validated that ""real life"" is better, even though on a rational level, I know that men in real life are also garbage and that it's possible for women to find good partners on OLD, however unlikely it may be.",38552,How dangerous is OLD?,0,,

We weren't exclusive and he was in love with someone else.

I learned to do makeup and dressed up to get his attention because I thought that I could change his heart about me. The end of my junior year, I got a boyfriend, who was jealous of this guy.

Every time I broke up with someone or got my heart broken, I went back to this guy. During the last year his behavior continued to get worse and worse. He negged me, he breadcrumbed me, he made me cry. I spent hours on the phone with him listening to his problems, driving him around when he got a DUI, etc.

There were two events that showed me how abusive he was and that I deserved better. One, he pushed me and took my phone from me when I tried to call a friend. This happened because he told me I couldn't sleep at his house, and he insisted I sleep in my car instead.

Another time, one afternoon when I was at his house, he made me cry and told me (paraphrasing), ""I love you, but I'm not in love with you. We're never going to be together.""

A few months later, I told him enough was enough and deleted him on Facebook. I wasted a total of 4 years on him.

Over the past several years he's messaged me occasionally to hook up, to congratulate me, to apologize, or some other B.S. This week, he congratulated me on my graduation (which happened 6 months ago), and claimed that he now goes to my school (I'm not impressed, I have 2 degrees now).

This time, thanks to you ladies, **I completely ignored him**. I no longer feel the need to prove that I'm doing better without him. I accepted his narcissism and his abuse because that's the behavior I grew up with. But, I won't tolerate any more.

The take home message is: **leave the past where it belongs**, because you can't grow by continuing to entertain people from your past. Sometimes people make mistakes, but a person who spends years disrespecting you will **never** change. Don't give them access to you or your time and energy.",38547,"From ""pick me"" to ""the one who got away""... I ignored him and it feels amazing to leave the past where it belongs",0,,

Thank you my lovely community - you have taught me how to be strong, to value myself, and to stick with my standards.

And I would really love to have your advice on this.

Situation: I met this person, D, through school. He is mid-thirties, vet, grounded, nice-looking dude. We have had chats here and there, but nothing serious... Yesterday we had a school-wide party. I ran into him at the party, started talking, had good conversations. He expressed that he was attracted to me (hands on my waist, sticking with me throughout the night, introduced me to his classmates). Alcohol was involved, although neither of us were sloppy drunk. We flirted all night, it was going well, until he asked me if I wanted to go to his place and take another shot. After we got to his place, we hung out a bit, and then we made out. At this point, I was attracted to him, but I wanted to send the right signal that I wanted something more serious, not another meaningless hookup (I need to connect with someone emotionally before feeling horny). So I paused him, told him that I am attracted to him but didn't feel like hooking up, and asked him to text me to hang out sometime. Then I left his place.

I am glad that I did what I did - what I used to do was to go with the flow - it was nice to feel loved, validated, and wanted at the moment. But last night I decided to set and stick with my boundary, and wanted to express that I wanted to make this a more serious thing. But I also worry he'd perceive me as too conservative, and I would never hear from him again (I do like him).

My questions is twofold: (1) did I do the right thing? and (2) how would you express that you wanted something more serious/meaningful without sounding disinterested?

Yesterday I met up with my (in every sense of the word) boujee friend for dinner. Let's call her Cardi.üíÖüëúüí∞ We decided on a chic restaurant and I offered to pay. She treated me to drinks the last time we met up so I felt it was my turn to treat her. Mind you, Cardi doesn't hide the fact that she's in a high income bracket and has secured a position in a law firm.


We received¬†great service from our waitress, so when the bill came I made sure to tip 30%. Weirdly, when I was writing¬†out the tip amount Cardi was oddly focused on what I was writing. Once finished, I excused myself to go to the restroom...When I came back Cardi had pulled out a $10 bill and placed it on the table in conjunction with with bill folder! She had looked at my 30% tip and decided it wasn't good enough!!!¬†üò±üò±üò±


Y'all. I cannot describe the feeling of INFERIORITY that I experienced. I was supposed to be covering the meal and ensuring that Cardi had a good night! Her contribution made me feel SO financially inadequate.üíÄ Bummed me out so bad I can't forget it!!!

Libfems decided that dinner dates were oppressive in 2035, and that women who like dinner dates those are too high-maintenance. LVM  agreed and pushed the degradation of standards forward.

Every woman who wanted kids is a single mom, because it became a given that men don‚Äôt provide or commit. Motherhood became a matter of women getting pregnant, knowing the men wouldn't step up. It's the norm.

It's 2050 now, women are seen as mentally ill if they don‚Äôt put out on the third date. It becomes a disorder in the DSM  manual. ""Self-opinion is too high, female has delusions of deserving respect. Doesn't have sex with every man who looks her way"".

 There‚Äôs no such thing as standards or respect.

Porn is on tv 24/7. It has been deemed healthy and therapeutic by psychologists, as relationships, monogamy, and marriages became a thing of the past.

Hello Ladies!

I‚Äôve waited a long time to post this because I wanted to give you actual results, not just a couple of good dates.

Using FDS as of last night I have a HV boyfriend after after about three months of dating.

I met him on the one of the apps. He is a bit out of my age range (M38) to my (F26). But I responded to him because his message was direct, clear and charming. He referenced my profile, and after only a few exchanges sent me his number and asked if he could take me to dinner. ( no drink dates, no hang-outs)

After texting him for a day or so and confirming I was free on Tuesday, he sent me this message. 

‚ÄúDo you like Italian Food? We could grab dinner at (name of place) at 7:30. The address is ( address of place)‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt realize how nice it was not to have to come up with a plan for the date.

Once we got there, conversation was amazing. I was sold on the second date half-way through the first. He‚Äôs funny, smart, silly and handsome. He also got wine for the table and paid the entire bill.

That was in early September. Since then I have not planned, nor paid for a date‚Ä¶or a cab, or a bottle of water. My money is no good in his presence. ( to the point that he‚Äôs fighting me on me getting him a Christmas present..even though he‚Äôs already bought mine *eyeroll*) 

I waited about six weeks to have sex with him, after establishing exclusivity. I made sure to keep my school work as the top priority in my life and I will not change pervious plans that I've made with friends to be with him. I also keep myself up. I dress up for all our dates, and really put in effort to be my best self.

The last few months have been a dream. I‚Äôve been to plays, museums, dance classes, open mic‚Äôs and little hole in the wall restaurants. He brings me tea in the morning before he goes to work and the sex is fantastic (It's so wonderful when the person is actually listening to you)

To be sure, he‚Äôs not perfect. Our age gap bothers me, (but he‚Äôs good about talking through it and letting me express my concerns), arguing politics makes me wanna kill him, and the man is 5 minutes late to EVERYTHING.

But the good outweighs the bad by a huge margin. and when he asked about us last night, my heart had already been his.

Thanks for reading ladies!",38513,"This really, really works..",0,,

One of the more insidious ways that women are inadvertently manipulated into unfulfilling one sided relationships is by social grooming that grossly misrepresents the ability and motivations of the average man. 

**Feminists have been saying men are just like us. **

The effect is that women get into relationships believing they can reason, negotiate, or emotionally appeal to men to recognize our humanity, in the same manner we would with other women. We give them the benefit of the doubt vastly more often than they deserve. We search ourselves for flaws that may contribute to the reaction. We try to be ‚Äúevolved‚Äù, ‚Äúopen minded‚Äù and ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù even in the face of direct disrespect and against our better intuition. After all, if men are just like us, why would they *intentionally* be cruel and selfish without motivation?


**TradCons have been saying men are better than us. **

Which causes women to vastly underestimate their power and ability. Men make it their business to absolutely devalue anything and everything women contribute that doesn‚Äôt directly benefit them.  They scare us with cat lady tales. They endlessly pontificate and perform ‚Äúresearch‚Äù about us to prove women are inferior or incapable. And if all else fails, they tell us their superiority was ordained by a divine being. And wouldn‚Äôt you know, all the roles women are best suited for based on their ‚Äúresearch‚Äù and/or ‚Äúdivine inspiration‚Äù are those which encourage our dependence on them, increase our sexual availability,  and discourage our autonomy? How convenient. 

Of course, both of these groups are wrong. The unflinching truth is that Men are depraved and self serving in ways that‚Äôs actually hard to conceptualize as women. You can‚Äôt reason with a population who never had the intention of engaging with you in good faith to begin with.

They are not and perhaps never will be as evolved, thoughtful, or considerate of women as  whole as feminists want to believe, nor are they as intelligent or innovative or irreplaceable as TradCons want you to believe. Men are also not as ignorant to the effects of their abhorrent behavior toward women as either of these groups want you to believe. They just don‚Äôt care. 

Men do what they want, and justify it later through controlled manipulation of a narrative. Which they then force us to participate in via gaslighting, fear mongering, concern trolling, social, legal or economic isolation, or outright threats.

The tools we have to fight them, which is reproductive freedom and the ability to have accurate and honest conversations about their behavior, are constantly under attack. 

I think what‚Äôs great about FDS is we try to adjust expectations of men down to reality. 
Unfortunately, they‚Äôre *consistently* worse than we have been led to believe, which is why so many of us end up abused, manipulated, exploited, and disappointed. And the closer we describe that reality on this sub, the more unhinged and vitriolic men become.

A byproduct of the adjusted expectations is that women start to view men in their proper lens: base, childlike, and mostly useless. And even more are wholly uninterested or unable to see your humanity,  but as a resource to be consumed. The are not at all self motivated as a group to be humane to women for its own sake, only for its perceived personal benefit. 

Which of course they don‚Äôt want you to know, because why would women put up with their crap? They need us to beleive in their lies during our childbearing years, and then when we‚Äôre old enough to see them for what they are they can dismiss us as ‚Äúbitter old hags‚Äù. They need to use the state to cripple us legally, economically, and socially otherwise we would find out how truly unimpressive they are. A truth that is becoming ever more evident as they lose the ability to exert absolute control on the narrative. 

Patriarchy is gaslighting women into believing most of male behavior is our fault.  From the moment Eve ate forbidden fruit from the tree, men have been blaming us for their fucked up nonsense. We didn‚Äôt raise them right. We pick the wrong guys. We don‚Äôt communicate enough. We‚Äôre not submissive enough.  We‚Äôre not pretty enough. We‚Äôre not assertive enough etc etc. Everything is about trying to distract us from what they are and make them our burden to bear.

**With this in mind, The MOST important message of FDS is this: **

WE DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS. We DON‚ÄôT have to put up with 1 SECOND OF THEIR CRAP. LET THEM FAIL. They‚Äôre SUPPOSED to FAIL.  Your continued benevolence will NOT teach them empathy. Men respond to FORCE and CONSEQUENCE. 

Don‚Äôt fix them, don‚Äôt try to, don‚Äôt try to change yourself for them, and *rarely* try and help them. If they fail to meet your expectations, they hit the bench or the chopping block. You are NOT RESPONSIBLE for nor are you obligated to tolerate the behavior of men. Do NOT allow men to leech from you from cradle to grave. Do NOT allow them to convince you to give them anything of value for free.  Exercise ruthless mate choice like you and your future children‚Äôs life depends on it, because it does.",38512,The Most Important FDS Message: YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF MEN.,0,,

It makes you his special-free therapist to unpack emotional baggage without giving you anything back and it kind of 'speeds up' sex between the two of you because you already 'know' each other (through text). 

I've had it happen to me a few times. A guy asks me out on a date and we set a day and sometimes even time and i don't text him 1 week before the date and he doesn't text me either. The day of the date comes, do i arrive? do i ask him the night before if it's still relevant? do i expect a text from him asking if it's still relevant? what do i do? do i always set a time instead of just setting the day?

I feel like texting a bit during the week helps ensure that the date will happen and sometimes even find out details about him that might make you change your mind and you might cancel the date but i might be wrong. What do i do? set a date 2-3 days after we texted instead of a week? it could still happen. I feel like if they haven't texted they forgot or aren't that interested.

I don't know how such different sorts of men (two HVM and one - that particular brother - very LV in how he treats women) grew up in the same household.

This brother (I'll call him Dick) sent us a surprise wedding invitation that arrived yesterday. He's not even divorced from his fourth wife yet. He keeps finding new women while married, getting divorced once his other woman is really in love with him, and then that new marriage inevitably implodes too. 

I know the new women are also being horrible but on the other hand he chooses really young ones, so I feel kind of bad for them because I feel like he's choosing them when they're still in the ""young and dumb"" phase. Then as soon as they're a little older and sick of his shit he finds someone else. 

The two HVM brothers don't talk to him very much and I think Dick prefers it that way too since he knows they realize what a loser he is. I'm sure he also never wants any of us to talk too much to his wives. (Of course... since all but the first started as ""the other woman"" I think they all realize deep down inside what will happen to them someday.) 

Last time Dick talked to my husband's good brother (I'll call that brother Joseph), Dick apparently asked, ""How did you and [my husband] manage to find women who don't drive you insane?"" Joseph told him, ""Well, for one we treat them well and don't cheat on them. Did you ever think of trying that?"" 

Last time Dick spoke to my husband, my husband told him, ""Mom and Dad would be ashamed of you if they could see you today."" You should've seen all the pissed off texts he sent my husband after that. I'm really surprised we got an invitation.

But I kind of just wanted to talk a bit about WHY pick me logic in its absolute root is flawed. And it really starts with motivation and its causes. I keep it a tad more theoretical so you can maybe also learn something to motivative yourself a bit better.

But what exactly is ""motivation""? It's an orientation of your physical and mental energy towards an activity you think will bring you to (or at least closer to) a goal you think is positive. So in short: You want something to happen that's positive for you, you'll do something for it.

Whenever you do something in any situation, it leads to an outcome which leads to consequences. Three expectation are linked to this:

* Situation-outcome expectation: what happens if I do nothing at all?
* Action-outcome expectation: what happens if I do something?
* Outcome-consequence expectation: what are the consequences of my action?

This means, before you lift a finger, you'll analyze whether using your energy on a certain situation will be worth it. When the situation will be better or is already good to begin with, why do anything? When you do something and nothing will be better, why do anything? And when consequences won't be as good as you think they should be, why even bother?

So by providing him with everything he could need (sex, caring for his household, etc.), a pick me creates a positive situation-outcome expectation for the guy: It's good already, he doesn't have to do anything. There has to be something to work for or else he won't do it. He won't ""change"" just because you give him more free time by providing for him. He also won't ""change"" now that you get children.

This whole motivation process is fast. It's something you do all the time with every situation you'll face in your day to day life. So once again: Trust him whenever he shows who he truly is. When he shows you he's putting in only the least amount of effort, don't say ""this will get better"". It won't.",38494,Let's talk about motivation,0,,

If I were to date again after being single for a while now, by choice (6-years), religion is something I would discuss before getting into a long-term relationship, instead of finding out later on that our worldviews are too different. I'm attracted to men and women, but religious men are a no-go for me. In my opinion, they're some of the most sexist, misogynistic, and controlling men out there; they use religion to control women.

So I met him at a bar a few weeks ago and we really hit it off. We also found out that we were both in the same career field and that we were currently studying for the same exam. So anyways, we met up a few times to study together and grab food. It seems like he really likes me and we‚Äôve made out a bunch of times. However, every time we got food (3 separate times), he won‚Äôt pay for me. I mean it‚Äôs not like I can‚Äôt pay for myself but it would have been nice if he offered a few times, since we‚Äôve been holding hands and texting everyday. 

We‚Äôve been talking about having a movie night soon and cuddling at his place but I don‚Äôt know, I feel like he‚Äôs not putting in any effort. I don‚Äôt wanna just ask him like ‚Äúhey so we haven‚Äôt gone on any dates?‚Äù. I know we are both busy studying for this exam but I still feel like he could have put in more effort. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm asking him to pay for my rent or anything like that! I‚Äôve dated many guys before and each of them would offer to pay for my food, since it‚Äôs a gentleman thing to do.

2. He will lie through his teeth to get himself out of a lie and question your recollection. He will say all kind of things, don't doubt yourself. You know what you saw.
3. FDS works, I employed all these strategies including checking his phone that was posted recently. I am not too broken up about it because I kept my heart to myself and never gave too much.

Background context: I am a 26f virgin(yes, I know üôÉ) who has gone on dates but never been in a relationship. This is mainly due to my focus on higher academics/career focus and a religious background. I would say the men who I have gone on dates with were HVM and very committed to monogamy, so I never had a previous reason to distrust them.

 I made a friend group with some  co-workers last January. I become solid friends with two guys, both of which had girlfriends. Something super weird that I immediately noticed about them is that Guy 1 would always bring up his girlfriend in our conversations(it came up organically and wasn't annoying) and Guy 2 never mentioned his. I actually had a female friend from work tell me that he had a girlfriend, but none of the guys volunteered this information. He was never obviously flirtatious or anything so nothing wrong there- I just thought it was odd.

Around the 3 month mark at work, another coworker told me that he broke up with his girlfriend. I left the job maybe within two weeks of hearing that information and our friend group regularly still met up to hang out. One day, this guy texts me and invites me to see a movie with him and my other guy friend and I agree. Last minute, he tells me(via text) that our other friend can't make it and ask if it is still cool with me if it's just us. I guess I'm just naiive, but I have good friendships with guys and it never occurred to me that he was asking me out.

Fast forward and several months later, he still sometimes springs me into situations like this. He has never tried to make a move on me physically or said anything weird or abnormal. He honestly acts like the perfect gentleman when we hang out and I find myself ""catching feelings"" for him because I feel comfortable around him and he behaves in the HVM fashion that past dates have. I just have a lingering doubt because of a few small details:

1. Never mentioned girlfriend when he was dating and seems to have recovered from break up overnight.

2. Has never tried to add me on Facebook but does follow me on Instagram/Snapchat. I'm honestly not trying to be shallow about social media, but for me and most of my friends, social media is more of a casual thing than phone numbers, so it strikes me as odd. And, usually when people add me on one social, they add me on the other.

3. I moved into an area that is heavily influenced by Latino culture(I did not grow up in the same culture) and my female Latino friends have warned me about the men they grew up with and how much they hate machista culture, including many of the men we worked with. I have some concern about being an infatuation simply because I'm ""different"" than the other women available.

4. This guy has never ""officially"" asked me out or made his feelings about what he wants from me known. I once had a guy friend who never even dated me, confess romantic feelings directly to me.

I know I should directly ask him what he wants, but I was raised traditionally, where a man expresses his intentions first and I felt some small doubt that he is trying to be discreet about pursuing me. I apologize- for this being so long- I just don't have any experience with this. Am I overreacting?",40935,26f virgin has been ambiguously asked out/dated by 23m on/off for the past 10 months.

First of all, want to thank you ladies and this sub to step up my queen shit game. i‚Äôve been employing tactics for the last two months and waaalaaa, managed to find myself a high value man that i see real potential to be with.

He‚Äôs basically everything i want in a perfectly wrapped up package: well-educated, interesting, sensible, good family, and drop dead gorgeous. 

we‚Äôve been seeing each other about twice a week (it‚Äôs all my schedule allows) and we‚Äôre building a strong, steady emotional connection. he‚Äôs deleted his dating apps and is making plans for us far into the new year, introduced me to his family, and has shown me that we are heading towards a relationship. 

the last two times i saw him, we‚Äôve cuddled and kissed and things felt very sensual and he even slept over but we didn‚Äôt do anything more than that. he would kiss parts of my body over my clothes which felt like he was initiating sex, but when i tried to to escalate, he would de-escalate. he kept saying that he‚Äôs enjoying the pace we‚Äôre going, which to me felt confusing.

i guess i‚Äôve never been in a situation where a man is choosing to wait? i‚Äôm used to men wanting to have sex on the first date and curbing them. 

is this weird or a red flag? obviously i‚Äôm willing to wait for him because he‚Äôs worth it and i‚Äôm also enjoying focusing on the emotional connection first. but physical touch and being intimate is important for me when it comes choosing a partner.

i want to ask him what‚Äôs up but also want to bring the conversation up carefully...should i just let things play out? curious to see if anyone else has dealt with this and what the outcome was.",40927,have any of you ladies experienced a man who wanted to wait longer than you for sex?,0,,

He lives about 90 minutes away but offered to drive and didn't seem bothered by it at all. We made plans for things to do and he said that he would have no problem driving over in the future (because I expressed concern about the distance) and that he was really excited to meet me, etc. 

We planned our first meeting a couple weeks in advance due to him having plans one weekend, and me having my children with me the other weekend. He continued to communicate pet much daily. Nothing over the top, just consistent so I'd know he was still interested.

Unfortunately, his dad had a serious medical issue. We talked about how he would go with him to treatments etc, so it was something I knew about before. Well a couple days before we were supposed to meet, he called and said his dad was rushed to the ER and he needed to stay around to help out his mom, etc. He asked me to give him a chance to reschedule and I said of course. I work in the medical field and I'm very familiar with his dad's condition so I wasn't concerned that he was lying or anything.

We continued to text, and we set up another weekend plan. At like 7am on the Thursday before, he texted and said his dad had another setback and got admitted again. I could tell he was really stressed about it, and later on he sent me a random hospital selfie and have me an update. We kind of left things up in the air and I let him know I wasn't worried about it, to just let me know when things calmed down.

The next week, things had settled a bit, and we got on the topic of getting together again. I told him I had my office Christmas party but he was welcome to come. He's in the medical field too, and is pretty laid back so I figured he'd fit in just fine and it wouldn't be awkward.  So we made plans to do that. He was waiting for a test result to come back on his dad to show he was in the clear, and he told me he'd text when he got it back.  Unfortunately, on my lunch break that day, he texted me that his dad passed away. He was obviously pretty stunned.  I wasn't sure how to react of course so I just tried to be supportive etc. I figured I'd give him some space and let him dictate the next step.

Obviously didn't talk to him for a few days but he did start chatting again and we got back to pretty much daily. He mentioned the other day that he wanted to get together soon and asked about my availability. I said I was free this weekend and he said that should work, he's looking forward to it, etc. 

So... This is obviously a weird situation lol. I haven't seen any red flags. I don't believe anything shady is going on, unless this dude is a compete psycho and faked everything with his sick father... I just think we were victims of terrible timing.  Assuming he comes this weekend, is there anything I should do or not do or be thinking about? Obviously there's been a lot of build up, but honestly nothing crazy. We've both been acting very practical and level headed - no future faking or making promises or anything like that. I just want to have a good time without it being weird!

**note: if you are a dedicated FDS follower and apply all strategies laid out in this sub to the letter, you will already know that getting emotionally involved with a man is dangerous and to be avoided if possible. However, I am a traditionally romantic person and love being in love. I know there are many women out there like me, this is for us. 

It‚Äôs quite simple. I have a pre-assigned time period that corresponds with the duration of the relationship. If a breakup occurs and I‚Äôm not ready for it- if I didn‚Äôt see it coming, or am otherwise not emotionally prepared- I give myself that exact period of time to grieve. No more, no less.

It‚Äôs an easy formula. If the relationship lasted for one week (or fraction thereof), I get a day. One month, I get one week to be upset. One year, one month. And so forth. 

So, let‚Äôs say you dated someone for six months and out of nowhere got dumped because men are snakes. You give yourself six weeks- that‚Äôs about a month and a half- and you really truly feel that pain. You talk about it with your friends if you want, you do self-care, you block him from your life completely... whatever you need to to do reach the goal of having erased him completely by the end of that six weeks. Earlier is better. In the end, your life will be better without him. His life will suffer without you in it. You are the asset, he is the liability. 

And then, after you‚Äôve gotten out all the hurt and anger, you move on like he never existed.

It‚Äôs so easy, and it works like a charm. Set goals for yourself and you will achieve them.",40887,My emotional time limits for recuperating from breakups,0,,

We were going steady like 2 dumb 17-year olds do and then things ended. I thought stuff was relatively amicable, except that he deleted me everywhere after I stupidly asked to stay friends. Then I get dirty looks from his friends, the few of which I knew also cut contact with me. 

Then the bombshell dropped. He had been feeding them shit every time I made him mad, and nothing BUT shit since the breakup. He made me out to be this clingy (honestly true), obsessive control freak that used him, and as a result all of his friends think of me as a complete bitch. 

I honestly didn't like them, since they made him act different, but he used this to make me out to be a controlling freak, and made his friends believe there was mutual hatred.

When I finally got one of his friends to spill the beans, it got worse. He also said that HE dumped ME, because I was ""mentally disturbed"" and probably had ""BPD"". He regularly made fun of my appearance after breaking up. It got so bad I lost an entire friend group, a hangout spot and a best friend we both ""shared"" whom he turned completely against me.

The worst was a year later. Despite ALL THIS, my stupid ass thought he was just emotional at the time. Turns out, he refuses to let his friends speak my name, they instead refer to me by a derogatory nickname he gave me. He openly admits to loathing me, like genuinely hating my very existence. He fucked a friend I had lost a bit of contact with, to hurt me. 

The worst part was when I started talking to a friend of his that had enough. We got closer, he found out, and WENT TO THIS GUY'S HOUSE, and threatened to ""bash his c\*\*t skull in"", and threatened to ""cut his eyes out"" with a pocketknife he always has on him. 

He's been incredibly strategic, making sure no witnesses are around, keeping out for loopholes. The damage doesn't end after a breakup, ladies.

i was exposed to porn and masturbation at about 9 or 10; i was taken advantage of as a child and that instance led to hypersexuality. at 22, porn is my only frame of reference for sex as i‚Äôm still a virgin, so you can only imagine how warped my view of sex was/still somewhat is. i developed an extreme hatred for my body, unrealistic expectations for sex, and a reliance on porn to orgasm/turn myself on. 

i turned to more violent porn when ‚Äúregular‚Äù porn failed to do its job; i‚Äôm embarrassed to admit that i found myself in ‚Äúforced‚Äù, ‚Äúkidnapped‚Äù, and extremely racist categories. not only was i brainwashed into believing that a man being violent towards me was a turn on, my self image as a young black girl was that i was nothing more than a fetish. i has come to accept that i‚Äôd never be a trophy to anyone.

i will admit that i use audio porn, however my goal is to eventually cut porn out entirely! after twelve years of porn consumption, especially during such formative years, i sometimes fear that i will forever be affected. i can‚Äôt pin point how due to my lack of sexual experience, but i do fear that it will come back to haunt me. 

for the time being, i really recommend that any women on here cut porn out of your lives. your libido, body image, and love for yourself will improve so much! you truly don‚Äôt know how much it affects you until it‚Äôs gone.",40763,on being a porn sick woman and the road to recovery,0,,

Back in August or September pickmeisha me actually turned down a guy for casual sex(Not in the strongest way but I still did) and he went crying with his dick between his legs because I didn‚Äôt want that or poly. Well he returned! Back and redeemed saying he wanted Monogamy and looking at my photos made him want to settle down with me. I‚Äôm SO LUCKY /s anyway I played along.

He made an off handed comment about ‚ÄúHow he wonders everyday how I feel inside‚Äù how romantic :) and then proceeds to ask me why my precious tinder date didn‚Äôt go well.

I gave him the truth sprinkled with FDS + DTW and target practice. ‚ÄúOh I was too expensive for him it was too painful for him to spend money every time he had to load up money on the card we were using at the activity we went to.‚Äù He proceeds to say ‚ÄúOh you made him pay for everything?‚Äù And I respond with ‚ÄúHe invited me out I didn‚Äôt ask him for anything, so yeah :)‚Äù  I can tell the conversation is nose diving but I am having fun being out of his league and reach. 

He then proceeds to tell me how materialistic that is and he remembers! I am the girl who said no to coffee and wanted a dinner date lmao. 

‚ÄúGoing our for coffee is like the standard, saying you want a dinner date makes it seem like it‚Äôs something else. We should get to know each other before surf and turf. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair a guy loses because he takes a woman out for a nice meal and has a nice time and may not even get a call back or anything.‚Äù

And I said ‚ÄúOh you mean he has a risk? Yeah women have a risk when they go out with a guy they barely know all alone and hope the guy is decent and safe. On top of that when you have the money and don‚Äôt mind it you give it or treat them cause you want someone to have it not because you think you‚Äôre being taken advantage of‚Äù 

He got quiet because he ran out of things to say and made an excuse to call me tomorrow after I said ‚ÄúNo need to debate it‚Äôs good to disagree you learn so much about a person that way!‚Äù In a nice voice. 

I‚Äôm laughing my ass off because I know he was basically trying to get me to lower my standards and make it a quick and cheap fuck for him.

Describe your wedding: big huge family affair?  small and modest?  did you elope?

2. Was it what you wanted?

3. Were you aware of FDS-like behaviors and strategies before or after your wedding?

I feel as is most male lurkers assume that since we expect men to pay for dates and we expect adult behavior from men, that we‚Äôre also golddigging princesses. This always confused me because, yes, while I expected an investment from my husband when we were dating, our wedding was very modest. 

We were in the throes of looking for venues and after a day of driving to and from another fun weekend trip, we discussed the wedding and the honeymoon and subsequently started over... because we realized we were planning our wedding around pleasing others instead of making it about, you know, our fucking marriage.  I had joked so many times about ‚ÄúUHG wedding planning sucks, I just want the ring and my husband and to be done with it!‚Äù And, well, that‚Äôs what we did. 

It was maybe 15 people in a room at a restaurant. Got officially hitched an hour or so earlier at the courthouse. Left for the honeymoon the next day. It was PERFECT. No stress, didn‚Äôt break the bank, we had wonderful pictures and we were so happy with it.  I would change nothing. 

I was employing FDS-like principles during dating and the engagement... but somehow I had reverted back to people pleasing when it came to my wedding at first. So glad I caught it and got what I actually wanted: no frills and no stress.",40662,Married FDSers: what was your wedding like?,0,,

 I (21F) just tried out OLD for the first time yesterday in over a year. I was in an extremely abusive relationship of 2 years before my 1 year hiatus from men, because the man I was with left me so traumatized and afraid of men that I made the conscious decision to avoid all dating possibilities in an effort to work on myself. It's been a great year, I've been taking so much better care of myself, focusing on my goals, and I have greatly improved my appearance and general attitude towards men and dating as a whole (a lot of that has to do with this sub). I got talking to this guy on OLD almost right away and we really hit it off through chat: within an hour of chatting he asked me out and set up a date for tonight. He seems to be HVM: he is 23 and works as a professional screenwriter (I love film) and has his own place. I am extremely nervous because nearly all my past experiences with men have been traumatizing. Just looking for any words of encouragement or advice for tonight... the date is in 3 hours. Thanks everyone &lt;3",40557,Seeking Advice,0,,

Dated a HVM and he asked me out at the two month mark (two weeks ago). We haven‚Äôt had sex yet. 

He invited me to his apartment last Friday to cook me dinner. While I was there, I peeped Playboy magazines on his table. They were covered with some books, but still clearly out in the open. Wtf? 

I‚Äôm not threatened or insecure about them, I just a) don‚Äôt understand why he would have them OUT while I‚Äôm there (you would think that‚Äôs something a man would hide before the woman he‚Äôs with visits his apartment for the FIRST time) and b) I don‚Äôt approve of pornography. 

I‚Äôm not sure how to approach the situation. I plan to mentioned that I don‚Äôt date men that _watch_ pornography, but haven‚Äôt gotten there yet. I feel like when I address that topic is the magazines will find a new home. Best to wait until that dealbreaker topic comes up?

Aside from that, homeboy hasn‚Äôt fucked UO at all. He‚Äôs a gentleman who pays for dates, picks me up, texts first, plans dates, opens doors, and respects my boundaries. He‚Äôs also secure in himself, makes good money, makes me feel good (has never negged) and is a provider-type. When I asked him to get tested last week he immediately said yes, with no attitude and did it the next day.

I don‚Äôt believe in getting emotionally attached to a man ever really, so I can easily drop him if need be. But I‚Äôd like see I‚Äôd this is correctable since he is a HVM. 

Maybe next time I‚Äôm there, point out the magazine and say, ‚ÄúOh is this a Playboy? I don‚Äôt agree with female objectification?‚Äù Lol, I don‚Äôt know! Ideas?",40556,How to handle this situation?,0,,

This sub has changed my life for the better and I guess I'm out in the field practicing strategy.

I met this guy at a bar at 4am two weeks ago. As FDS would correctly say, I probably fucked up the first impression because I was pretty drunk and we got along very well, therefore awe made out a bit before I went home. 

We've been texting for two weeks and he seems very loving. He wanted to invite me to a friends party the first weekend after we met but I cancelled. I agreed to go to a second party 2 weeks after we met.

The days leading up to it he would mention he's excited to see me. (I was excited to go to that party for other reasons- I like parties.)  We've been friendly and over text he would mention he spoils people he's dating. He even asked how he should introduce me to his friends, if he should say I'm his girlfriend. I told him considering we met only once that he should introduce me as my name lol.

At the party he brought me two presents and was eager to get me the party favors he knew I was excited for. He spent a lot of time holding me close, telling me how beautiful I am, how beautiful my eyes were, blah blah blah. ""No, I don't think you understand, you are SO beautiful.""

I like to have a lot of intellectual discussions and one of the presents he got me was a copy of a book that I had mentioned I wanted, the Bhagavad Gita.

It really bothered me that the entire night he didn't mention that I was smart. I'm not trying to toot my own horn but I do feel like that's my most obvious trait that really stands out and does deserve complementing. I am very smart. I think even people who don't like me are compelled to admit that. 

I don't really give a shit if I'm beautiful but I do care about brains. 

He was a philosophy major so I found it odd that he didn't acknowledge my intelligence at all. I almost want to text him and confront him about this, because it's important to me. If you're praising me on my beauty alone, thats very odd to me. I'm attractive but I think my mind is more important and more obvious. I'm totally more attracted to people for their brains than their looks and tend to date uglier guys because of it. I crave that intellectual stimulation more than anything. 

He also spent a tremendous amount of time kissing me or trying to kiss me and he didn't care if his friends were around. I was often pulling away embarrassed and telling him ""dude your friends are around"" but he really didn't care. 

Later he was telling me that he was asking his friends about me and that they liked me, and he asked if I liked his friends. I felt suspicious of this.

I also felt suspicious when we had a conversation where he was saying he really liked me. He said that he can read people really well and knows if they'll get along. I asked what can you read from me? He looked into my eyes for a long time and said something like you haven't been in many relationships before. I asked why he would say that and he said because you're afraid to love.

This isn't true. I've been in the dating scene since I was a tween lol. Obviously I'm not throwing myself into a relationship with the first guy who says he likes me. I told him that was bullshit lol.

Tl:dr: I probably know the correct answer here but I wanted to get your takes on this. I'm probably giving off all the totally wrong vibes because I made out with him so much last night. He was always trying to cuddle and hold hands. He's probably just love bombing.

I started to leave without having a preparatory conversation beforehand and he seemed really flustered and maybe slightly upset but he didn't confront me, he did walk me down and stuff.

He asked me something along the lines of did you really think I wouldn't want to say a proper goodbye and walk you down? and I said ""I wasn't really thinking about it."" LMAO.

He really insisted on getting kisses before I got in my uber even though I tried to use the excuse of cotton mouthing for not wanting to kiss.

Anyway I'm not super emotionally invested in this guy and he's not super handsome necessarily. But the party was fun, his friend group is really fascinating, and I would not mind hanging out with them all again, if I could not have to be kissing this man in front of countless others all night long. 

So tell me sisters, am I a dumb bitch? Is this guy trying to use me? Should I confront him about not praising my brains? ( I do want to haha). Is it cool if I let him take me out to dinner and maybe another party?",41695,Is this lovebombing and should he be tossed?,0,,

2019 was the year I met The Fuckboy (I won't introduce him, we all know a version of him and honestly they're pretty much all the same).

**The Beginning: Pickmeisha and her Prince not-so-charming**

The Fuckboy hid his colours well: we had such similar interests! He kept wondering why I was still single! He had accomplishments I admired! He complimented me!
Being a pickme with no self esteem, I jumped into his arms. Went Dutch, had sex on the first date when I've never liked sex, was very vulnerable very fast. I told him I had special circumstances at the moment that made me need more affection than most. 
""Don't worry,"" The Fuckboy said. ""I can give you what you need.""

He could not.

He had to leave our city for a few months for work reasons right after we met. But we kept in touch through daily phone calls, messages, promises to meet up soon. He was not ready to commit: he was in a new place, he needed his *freedom*. I was heartbroken, but I admitted he was probably right. I'd always been too emotional. His love language was touch, he told me, and with me so far away, I couldn't fulfill his needs. This was fair, I thought (even as the thought or *more* sex made me feel nauseous). After all, love was a two-way street! He kept in touch with me and distracted me from my problems: I had to *trust* him instead of being so selfish!

Ugh.

As soon as I could, I went to meet him (with my own hard-earned money, of course. I don't half-ass anything, not even my own stupidity). Homeboy didn't miss his chance: he proudly told me he hadn't even masturbated because ""why drink vinegar when there's wine coming?"". Was I supposed to feel flattered? Guess so. The Fuckboy Mind is a truly mystifying place.
So we had sex, a lot of sex, mostly PIV with no foreplay or me giving him oral sex (that he of course never returned). He couldn't come without a condom, he complained, so we did it without a condom. 
(Feel free to judge me.)
I was so desperate to please, so crippingly anxious, that I went with it. 

When I left, he had grown cold. ""It's too easy with you,"" he told me (straight from The Fuckboy's mouth, ladies: they don't like it when there's no chase!). Our intellectual discussions that I so enjoyed had turned into him making sexual comments. I felt like a sexual object.

I went home heartbroken. What had been a wonderful distraction from my issues had turned into an issue of its own.


**The Middle: Pickmeisha digs deeper**

He came back to our city for a weekend. I had the *privilege* of getting invited to a party with him, but I was exhausted and instead of dancing all night, told him I'd rather go home early. Did he come with me? Yes. Did he make me pay for the Uber? Also yes. (What a fucking asshole. I'm getting angry just thinking about it).

We went to his place and, too anxious at the thought of more dehumanizing sex, I confessed: I didn't like it. Hadn't liked it from the start. Maybe I could like sex, but only after a long time of knowing someone, with love and intimacy. I couldn't keep up with his libido.
""I understand,"" he told me... before promptly dumping me through a text message the day after.

In a way, I was relieved. One toxic nightmare was over. Now I just had to focus on everything else.

But I wanted to ""stay friends"" and retrospectively, I realize that he... didn't have that many friends. The support network I took for granted? He didn't have it. So when he had issues with work, I was the one he called. When his life started going to shit, I was the one he called. For months I played his therapist, giving him my attention and downplaying my accomplishments so he wouldn't feel bad.

(Why did I do all that for a guy who treated me like shit? It puzzles the mind. Go to therapy, girls, don't expect men to fix your issues.)

The man I admired had turned into a plaintive mess who couldn't handle basic tasks. So, so pathetic.

It took far too long for me to snap out of it.

**The end: levelling up**

One day I realized I had better things to do. I was about to graduate. I had great friends, was active in my hobbies, had made connections The Fuckboy would envy, I just... had better things to do. So when he came back in our city for good, I made excuses not to see him. I couldn't block him outright, we moved in the same circles, but I didn't want to see him either. 

By then I barely thought of him. I was too busy.

I saw him only once, when he unexpectedly came to a talk I was giving. He tried to suck up to me; I smiled and told him I was sadly too busy to meet these days. He tried to suck up to my close friends; they gave him the cold shoulder. In the end I saw him flirting with the 19-year-old girl in a corner. How pathetic.

I found a great job abroad, got ready to leave. He only contacted me once: to wonder why we didn't speak as much as we used to (the sheer gall!). With a lot of infuriatingly polite emojis, I told him we were both busier than we used to be. Oh, but The Fuckboy was not busy! He was back at his mom's, without a job.
*That's so sad*, I answered. *I'm sure you'll be back on your feet soon :)*

I think he blocked me after that. Yes, ladies, you read that right: *he* blocked *me*. He had made a fool out of me, had used me for sex and emotional support, then discarded me without a thought... yet as soon as I implied I wouldn't play his therapist anymore, blocked. It truly is a *mystery* why this man isn't drowning in friends.

I don't know what has become of The Fuckboy. Don't care. This is just a sad, hilarious story of what we do when we have no self esteem and a desperate need for validation. I'm not perfect now but at least I stand my ground, I only do things I enjoy, I make sure my relationships keep being beneficial to me.",41690,A pickme/level up tale,0,,

Yesterday was supposed to be the best day of our relationship. My long distance boyfriend (27) had a ticket to come and visit me (23) for the holidays. We had been talking about this trip nonstop and I really thought that we were on the same page. He called me on the way to the airport and was updating me with all of the flight delays and details. I had the alerts coming to my phone too, so I knew he wasn‚Äôt lying about delays and stuff. When he landed at the airport for his layover, his responses became short and spread out. He said he wasn‚Äôt feeling well and was nervous and asked to call. He never called and stopped responding to my texts. I thought that maybe his phone died because I called and it went to voicemail. At that point, I started panicking but still drove to the airport to pick him up. I waited for over an hour. I watched hundreds of people walk by. I searched for him. I went to baggage claim. I went to the airline desk to see if he had maybe missed the flight. They informed me that he had never even gotten on the first flight.

My heart is broken. I haven‚Äôt heard from him at all. I am very confused because I don‚Äôt know why anyone would put so much time and effort into someone and then do something like this. I really believed in him and I look like an idiot to my family and friends now. I spent so much money on him for Christmas. Now, I feel so fucking numb.

I guess we are broken up, but I don‚Äôt want to be. I feel like I deserve an explanation but I don‚Äôt think he will give me one. There‚Äôs really no excuse, but I still want to know why I‚Äôm not good enough. He had just told me how happy I make him and how excited he was to be here. Was everything a lie?

Do I keep trying to contact him or do I move on? I love him with everything in me and have loved him for so long. Fuck the holidays.

TL;DR bf stood me up at the airport and hasn‚Äôt contacted me since. Do I keep trying?

Members of this sub expect men to pay on all dates and there‚Äôs a general consensus that the man is ‚Äúcheap‚Äù if they don‚Äôt want to pay for a fancy dinner date right off the bat.

Not to devalue anyone here, but I think that it also matters whether the man sees your worth and not just whether you see his worth. You can‚Äôt expect men to give it everything they‚Äôve got at the very beginning of a relationship, because the way it looks, y‚Äôall won‚Äôt give it everything you‚Äôve got until the man proves himself. There is a clear imbalance here. Why do men have to be the first to prove themselves? Surely there are also LVW out there that would try to hurt men. What if the man is just as afraid of getting hurt by women the same way you want to protect yourselves from LVM? In dating, both sides try to prove their worth to each other. That‚Äôs how people fall in love, because there are things both sides like about each other.

There are real stories about women using men for a free dinner. It is cruel to any HVMs out there who might be trying to find a long term relationship, and maybe then his strategy would be to make the woman pay for the date next time so that he doesn‚Äôt get taken advantage of, just like in this sub. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs LVM!‚Äù doesn‚Äôt cut it at all. The same way you don‚Äôt want to get taken advantage of, men don‚Äôt either. Relationships are two-sided and I think things just don‚Äôt work that way. You have to meet your partner in the middle.

It is important for both women and men to know their worth. 

Women may put a lot into dressing up for dates, or have big responsibilities as Stay-At-Home-Moms. AND THAT‚ÄôS OKAY! But I think that to find a good HVM, sometimes you have to splurge a little to show sincerity.

If y‚Äôall have thoughts to share about this, please go ahead. I‚Äôm looking to understand your point of view.",41685,[Female lurker] this sub‚Äôs values are skewed,0,,

I have only ever dated 1 guy. I have known this guy the past 4 years. We met at church back when we were both Mormon. We started as friends, then we went to prom together when I was 16 and he was 18. I sort of ghosted him because I had never been in a relationship before and I was in a really bad place self-esteem-wise and just couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure or the scrutiny I was feeling dating this guy‚Äî not necessarily from him, but from the culture of our religion; obviously he was going to go be a missionary and when he got home he would propose to me and we would get married and have 7 kids. I‚Äôve never wanted to get married or have kids, so that irked me.

I left that religion around the time I ghosted him and then went to be an exchange student for a year while he went to be a missionary for 2. We barely talked the entire time he was gone because I had nothing good to say about the religion he was devoting 2 years of his life to, and eventually you run out of things to say. So I would send him an email every month or so with pictures of what I was doing and questions about what he was doing.

He came home 6 months early in October and just recently decided to leave the Mormon church too. We went to see a movie a month ago. I‚Äôd decided to just be his friend when he came home, but then he took my hand during the movie and I wasn‚Äôt sure how I felt about it. Afterward we sat in my car and talked about a lot of stuff, mostly about how we‚Äôd both changed during the time we were gone and the things he went through that made him need to come home. We talked about a lot of very heavy, very personal mental health stuff. Next day we went to the beach, my family and him. (Even when he and I weren‚Äôt talking he‚Äôd still do stuff with my family because they all really like him and he likes them. That‚Äôs where some of that pressure I felt came from.)

That day at the beach, he basically confessed his love for me, over text, in the car on the way there. We had started talking about church issues and then he asked me if I liked him. I thought he meant like as a person, so I said yes. And then he said, ‚ÄúI know this is forward, but I want you to be a part of my life.‚Äù He told me he feels empty most of the time, but not with me. I said I wasn‚Äôt good at relationships, that I didn‚Äôt want to put a label on anything. He said we don‚Äôt have to rush anything and that he knows we can communicate and work things out. When it became clear to him that I was saying I didn‚Äôt want what he did, he started apologizing for being too forward and making things awkward and he said he‚Äôs happy to just be my friend if that‚Äôs all I want. I said it wasn‚Äôt him, i did like him, I just didn‚Äôt like the idea of myself in a relationship at this point in my life when I have all these goals that a relationship could get in the way of. I held his hand at the beach (because I felt bad that he felt so bad, mostly) and he put his arm around me in the car on the way home because I was cold, which I was fine with.

And then shit hit the fan with his family. They basically kicked him out when they found out he didn‚Äôt want to be Mormon anymore. He moved in with my family for a week and we talked a lot. We fell asleep on my couch together a couple times. A very strange situation to be in. He moved back home but we‚Äôve still been spending a lot of time together. 

I‚Äôve kissed him a couple of times, which I never actually did the first time we dated, because Mormonism. I‚Äôve initiated pretty much everything. And at the beginning, whenever he would put his arm around me or hold my hand, he would ask if it was alright. He asks me before he kisses me. He‚Äôs respectful of me and my boundaries. He tells me that I‚Äôm beautiful but that he likes me for who I am first and doesn‚Äôt care that I gained weight during my year abroad. When I asked him to block this other Mormon guy we both know who has creeped on me in the past and only follows porn accounts, he did it, and then unprompted expressed how disgusting he thinks porn is for how degrading it is to women. 

So he sounds pretty much perfect I guess. But it‚Äôs barely been a month since the conversation at the beach. He‚Äôs so, so sappy with me. I prefer to be around him when other people are there because then I can actually have a conversation with him that doesn‚Äôt revert back to him telling me how much he likes me or putting his arm around me again or putting his head on my shoulder. I saw him for a couple hours at a Christmas party today and when I helped him carry a few things back to his car when he had to leave, I gave him a hug, and then he told me that he _loved_ me.  And it made me angry, angry that he put me in that position. But he told me I didn‚Äôt have to say it back, and after he got home he texted me and apologized and said he knows he‚Äôs moving to fast and that he doesn‚Äôt want what he said to affect things. 

I‚Äôm just conflicted. I think he‚Äôs overall a great person, and I guess I do like him, but I definitely don‚Äôt like him as much as he likes me at this point, and I‚Äôve never dated anyone else so I can‚Äôt compare him with anyone. On top of that, there‚Äôs the fact that I‚Äôm bisexual and until recently I thought I would end up with a woman as I‚Äôm much more attracted to them. And yet again, the idea of marriage is being thrown around because of the culture of our families religion and everyone else we know. I don‚Äôt want to break up with him and I know I‚Äôd be incredibly jealous if he were to start dating someone else. I‚Äôm sort of afraid that if I did break up with him, years down the road I‚Äôd realize that he was the best I was ever gonna get. And since he‚Äôs so close with my family, it‚Äôs guaranteed he‚Äôd still be in my life, a reminder. But I‚Äôm also only 19 and I don‚Äôt want to only ever date one person. I want the chance to date women too. I just don‚Äôt know how to navigate this situation. I can‚Äôt tell which feelings are real and which are because of the emotional intensity of the whole situation of his family kicking him out and the ongoing drama surrounding that. I could really use the advice of women more experienced than me.",42103,Do I have a HVM?,0,,

&gt;Here's what's wrong with a cheap ""first date"". If you are young, naive, or have had less than 5 LTR relationships (lasting 2+ years), you won't know when a man is stringing you along. You may know it and not believe it, or be too insecure to leave, because you're inexperienced at dealing with breakups effectively.   
&gt;  
&gt;Most men who will string you along and waste your time, bullshit, fail to commit, will also generally be cheap. **Because their intention for you was to fuck around to begin with, they won't want to set aside a ton of money because they plan on ghosting you now, or 3 months from now, or don't see anything longterm with you. They won't tell you that up front, because then you won't suck his dick in the backseat of his car, after going dutch on Dinner and a movie. That's why.**  
&gt;  
&gt;When you only agree to go on a date with a guy you've had time to vet, and only if he pays for dinner (like $30+ at least). You'll know he's trying to impress you, and is putting forth an effort. This creates a ""security deposit"", where if he's going to waste your time, it's going to be expensive for him to bullshit. If he's bullshitting, he won't be able to afford it for long, and will drop you sooner, rather than later. You will find out after 4 or 5 dates that you're seeing a fuckboy, as opposed to 3.5 years and 2 kids later. Sorry/not sorry. A man who's not bullshitting and who sees something longterm with you will do the work of courting you.   
&gt;  
&gt;Dating is literally 80% about weeding out the bullshitters because again, every man wants his dick sucked in the back seat of his car after a few drinks, on the first date, but only a man who wants to be with you longterm will pay for dinner first, and drinks, and several extravagant dates to get there. The fuckboys will bounce after date #1, or #3 once they realize you're not going to put out without significant evidence of investment in you, from him.

**A man must invest in you, extensively.** Make it difficult and expensive to play you and fuck with your life.

They met OLD. They went out for one date where he only took her for drinks. Took her back to his place but didn't hook up because he didn't have a condom. Then, she left while he fell asleep and didn't answer her phone calls when she got lost. 

Two weeks later, he texted asking to take her on a 'real date'. She obliged. Then, the day of the date, no words from him, not even a single plan. Eventually, he texted saying he was stuck at work around 8PM. So, she told him she was done with dating and needed a break. 

She came to me wondering why he kept texting her. My guess was that it's easier to circle back to girls he's already met than going back on the app. This is what my guy friends have told me about OLD. Lo and behold, the next day, he sent a text confirming the same thing. Because she didn't straight up say ""I don't want to date you"", he keeps texting her thinking that she's taking a break from dating.

I (22F) am dating a great guy (23M). We met six months ago and made it ‚Äúboyfriend-girlfriend official‚Äù about two months ago.

Here‚Äôs my problem. I was the worst kind of pickmeisha (or maybe just emotionally avoidant) early on in the relationship. I had sex on the third date because I was worried he wouldn‚Äôt stay if I didn‚Äôt (which I know now was not the case ... he didn‚Äôt even want to have sex and kept asking me if I was sure, months later he said he would have preferred to wait). 

I also talked a lot about how I typically only ‚Äúdo casual things,‚Äù I don‚Äôt like commitment, I don‚Äôt like labels BLAH BLAH BLAH. That may have been true for me at the time, but I have done so much soul-searching and personal growth over the past few months and realized that I DON‚ÄôT like any of that shit. I want a serious, committed relationship. 

I think this guy is a HVM ‚Äî our dates, early on and even now, have been museums, fancy movie showings, fun dinners and drinks, whenever I would suggest just coming back to my place he would always counter with dinner first instead. Whenever I would say I didn‚Äôt want to talk about something emotional, he would be respectful but remind me that emotions are OK. He‚Äôs sweet, respectful, has a good job and is overall just a great guy. 

But here‚Äôs my ‚Äúbut.‚Äù I worry that because I was so emotionally avoidant early on, he won‚Äôt know what to think if I shift gears. I‚Äôm talking, not responding to affection or affectionate texts, not wanting to be treated like a ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù in public (now I‚Äôm kicking myself thinking, what, you didn‚Äôt want to be treated with RESPECT and like you are SPECIAL?!) and going days without responding to his texts only to pop back up later. Classic breadcrumbing and negging. I am shocked that he has put up with my behavior for so long. I am worried that I have driven him away with my behavior. It seems like he‚Äôs afraid to text me and he will make a concerted effort not to touch me in public because I expressed so much distaste for it before. 

So here‚Äôs my question: how the hell do I shift gears now? I‚Äôm so thankful to this sub for showing me what to expect from both others and myself, and I could really use some help!",42486,Turning myself into a HVW while already in a relationship?,0,,

I have tried to talk to pickmeisha friends. They ask me for advice but never follow my advice. I've spent many many hours of my life, giving unreciprocated support and free therapy to pickmeishas. They expect so little from men, but have very high expectations for female friends. They expect their strong female friend to be their free therapist,  their shoulder to cry on, and so on.

After getting over my 2+ year saga of a relationship, I cannot stress this enough. My ex was a chronic liar, constantly hiding dumb shit. Naturally a woman picks up on the shadiness, but he says ""Oh it's nothing"" or ""Oh, she means nothing to me!"" Eventually it turns to, ""You're crazy, this is nothing"" and you begin to feel insane.

The last nagging feeling I had was that my ex of 2 years turned FWB was catching feelings for a girl. I kept telling him that he liked her but he would attack me, call me horrible names, and became incredibly emotionally abusive. He asserted over and over that it was crazy that I assumed he would have a crush on her, and then coincidentally decided later after hanging out with her for an entire week, to break off of our FWB agreement.

They're dating now. I was right, and pissed. He looked at me, laughing, ""When did I say I never liked her?"" and at that moment, it all clicked. I can't even describe how confused I am now realizing that my gut feeling was right throughout the last 2+ years. Not just limited to this situation, but *all* of our fights.

Essentially this dude was a close, very loyal and very good friend for years. This is objectively true - if he had feelings he kept them out of the friendship. I sorta knew he was into me but he respected my boundaries as I was always dating other people. 

Fast forward to after college. I visit my old campus to see friends and he asks if I‚Äôd stay with him, which I do. He and I had shared space many times before and nothing really physical happened despite how attractive I found him (he‚Äôs very beautiful). He‚Äôd even pulled the brakes before and hadn‚Äôt wanted to get into that if I wasn‚Äôt interested in a relationship. All good and dandy.

So I in my infinite wisdom one night hop into bed with him and seduce him one night and he really goes for it (duh) - thus begins almost a year of us traveling between states to see each other. He then moves close to me by pure coincidence because of a job offer. We continue to see one another. I, being the oblivious person that I am, fail to consider the implications. He had said he would want to be in a relationship and aim for marriage before he moved IF ONLY circumstances would align. HA. We all know how that goes. In the end he had a falling out with his family and he realizes he can‚Äôt date an American girl without losing those bonds, he chooses family, I accept it but decide I don‚Äôt want to be FWB and communicate that, and then I give us both space.

Well I guess he thought I hated him or something because homeboy sends me a REALLY nice Coach purse??? And he texts me saying there was supposed to be a card, but that he wanted to wish me happy holidays and that he wasn‚Äôt really sure how we stand, that he misses me and is thinking of me all the time - y‚Äôall know the drill. Why he thought this wouldn‚Äôt be awkward as hell, I couldn‚Äôt tell you. He‚Äôs always exhibited very HVM behavior but we just weren‚Äôt aligned for a romantic relationship. I intended to preserve the friendship but wasn‚Äôt sure it was possible so this is just very random.

My main question is - how would you ladies react? Should I return the gift? Why tf do men do weird shit like this instead of just asking for clarification?! Could it just be an actual holiday gift that looks weird on the surface? Thanks for any and all advice.",43572,"I vaguely act like pickmeisha. I sleep with friend of 6 years.

Congrats, one of the first steps towards being a goddess is knowing that you are part of the equation of your cyclical misery. For those in the back, I said PART OF. You can't fully blame yourself, that's still practicing these feeble behaviors. Yes, we're here to take responsibility for our current mindset leading us to where we are right now. However, realize that you have been surrounded by men who exhibit microaggression towards women, you have been brainwashed by other PickMe's. But now you know the truth: You are worth SO much more than anyone ever said you were. YOU determine where you go from here. Being a woman, you have been through so much. Think about the men who try to control our bodies, who use us to fulfill their sick fantasies, the statistics on violence. The media celebrates this and fuels this grotesque reality that we are meant to be meek, feeble and to endure abuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Promise to yourself ""never again"".** Never again will you be manipulated or abused. Never again will you quietly endure your discomfort. 
2. **Realize that AMALT (All Men Are Like That).** Thinking ""Not all men"" is DETRIMENTAL to your safety. ""Not all men are rapists"". Fine. But if I gave you a pack of gummy bears and told you one was poisoned, wouldn't you treat each of them as potentially lethal? Let them prove to you that they are ""not like the other men"". Do not prove to HIM that you are ""not like the other girls"". One of men's biggest worry is to get ""divorce raped"" but are they ever worried about ACTUAL RAPE? NO. So don't give them the benefit of the doubt, make them show you through ACTIONS. A HVM will have no problem with this. A scrote will act offended and immature and just not worth your time, this is because he doesn't respect you. Which brings me to... 
3. **Define your standards and warning flags.** You need to write this down. 5 is a good number to start with Comment this below if you must, I want you to be CRYSTAL clear on what you will NEVER tolerate ever again and what you will NEVER tolerate ever. For example, I will never be with a man who cheats on me. I will consider repeated arguments a huge warning flag. If I need to repeat myself more than twice about something that is clearly important to me... boy BYE. (If you choose to comment, it also helps other women identify red flags and help them define their standards as well. 
4. **BLOCK THAT SCROTE/ EX/ STALKER.** Stop being nice to him. He sucks and has zero value to you. You know he just wants to sleep with you. Block him now. You will feel so cleansed. If they try to reach out again, say that you have been really busy and focusing on yourself. They may call you a bitch for ""leading them on"". You can tell them to go to hell. You don't owe no one an explanation. 
5. **Read the sidebar.** Take your time with it, it's a lot to take in. But it will equip you in the long run and there's plenty of good stuff. 
6. **Take care of yourself, starting today, starting now.** Say no to something you don't want to do. Don't pick him up, don't make him a sandwich if he doesn't deserve it. Begin breaking out of your PickMe routine. Don't adapt to his needs now because it will be ""worth it in the end"". Honey, it's not worth it. You deserve to be happy NOW. Another way you can practice this is to take care of your hygiene and your environment. Be proud of your appearance and your surroundings because you did it for YOUR well-being. Most PickMeishas are externally motivated, they just HAVE to get that ""good job"" sticker. Nothing wrong with being externally motivated, but pining for a man's approval is just pathetic. Do it to make FDS proud, do it for YOU. (this will take time, I'll make another post on it someday but try your best! We're rooting for you!)
7. **Realize that there are high-level women out there who will support you. Maybe even on here.** We're all just trying to look out for each other, but no one can help anyone that doesn't WANT to realize their own self-destructive behavior. So if you think your situation ""isn't so bad"". Sorry, this wasn't the post for you. 

I will try to update with more suggestions as I get them.",43562,Pickmeisha Rehabilitation: First steps,0,,

I couldn‚Äôt sleep until I‚Äôd written this hypothetical come back, addressed to an imaginary man who‚Äôs confronting me about my dating behaviour. That was just a prompt though, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever say this to a man I was interested in. It was more just an exercise, the result of the work I‚Äôve been doing through being here at FDS. I write this as an unmarried and pre-kids woman. There is absolutely no judgement about anyone else‚Äôs situation. üíïüíïüíïüíïüíï

I feel really happy because it shows that my inner self is listening, and is now voicing what I‚Äôve learned in my own words, to the point where I couldn‚Äôt sleep until I wrote it down. My brain literally got its wiring fixed and needed to print off a test page üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Here it is:

Honestly John, men have caused me a lot of problems over the years. They‚Äôve taken advantage of me in various ways, and caused me significant emotional pain. I have enjoyed dating and relationships, but I‚Äôm now taking a more objective view on my life, and I can say that where men are concerned, the negatives have outweighed the positives.   

I still believe in love, respect, and commitment.  But yes, now I have my filters set to difficult mode.  I can‚Äôt control or change men at large, so I do control myself. 

Realistically, the next stage is even more important. Moving forwards in life with a man would entail being tied down socially, logistically, financially, and legally. I‚Äôm open to those things for the right man, and no one else. 

Thinking even further ahead, for a woman to have children is an undertaking of the greatest magnitude of her life. It is likely the biggest piece of work she‚Äôll ever do. It costs her extremes of physical, mental, and financial strength, and lasts the rest of her life. Not to mention, it risks her health and her life! It risks her future happiness, and her attractiveness for any new partner if the father of her children lets her down, as so many of them do.  It also risks the entire future of her children if she selects the wrong father. 

Despite all of this, it is something I want and am willing to do. But when we realistically assess the risks, I‚Äôm not going to expose myself to all that, without being as certain as I can be of who I‚Äôm doing it with. So yes, since you asked, you could say I‚Äôm giving you a hard time, and it is conscious, and it is for the best.",43449,How I know I‚Äôve internalised FDS - couldn‚Äôt sleep at 2am until I‚Äôd written this imaginary monologue down!,0,,

Ofc there were rude guys but the percentage was much less. 

I don‚Äôt mean to shun American guys but they don‚Äôt dress well and talk loud and talk a lot in public. Also physically, even average guys tend to be chubby with shorter height and rounded jaws. ( that‚Äôs the first distinguishable factor I noticed about American guys ) 
And one thing I noticed was they are more into gym vs European guys more enjoying outdoor sports. And I prefer the latter as I prefer someone who‚Äôs not muscular but with tall and slim body type. 

But what puts me off most is how rude some guys are here. Like maybe because I met them through dating apps but guys are straight out rude and don‚Äôt even know it.  

I could see why there‚Äôs so many women experiencing these harassments from these loser guys. Like how can you expect a random woman to come to your place to suck your dick ? Did your parents taught you that way or was your mother that to your dad ? Merely a whore ? (This is literally what I wrote to one guy on tinder )
