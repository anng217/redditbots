308,"I'm a 13 year old male raiding this sub, I don't hate women at ALL, I just came have some shits and giggle because how good you guys are at being hypocrites.

You are on a men hating sub but yet complain about 2 women hating subreddits, there are 10 men hating subreddits in counting and you don't complain about that.

Go ahead and ban me from this sub, silence me. But that won't stop me from speaking the truth.

You guys have alot of privilege, like alot, society LOVES women, like if you falsely accused a guy of rape, who would the law listen to, you, and won't hear the guys side of the story or even show evidence in alot of cases I've heard about.

If you raped a man, if he impregnated you can sue him for child support.
Not only if you raped a man, society would tell that man he's lucky to get with a girl, or would repress him by telling him to ""man up"".

If you got a divorce your most likely to get the child no matter how abusive you are, even from the countless protest from the father or the internet you would still get the kid. Not to mention boys are the majority of Child Abuse victims.

Men take more of 93% of work place fatalities and 76% of rape victims + prison.

You feminist protest male rights meetings and in other countries had protested so much that you made rape against men legal in India, mylasia, and Brazil.

You complain about trivial things like manspreading when women in Afghanistan can't even show they're faces in public and girls in Somali get they're clitoris cut off?  It's seems like you only complain and not protest about it. 

You complain about men spreading they're legs far apart when you take up spaces with your shopping bags.

Why you think your feelings go first before facts?

Why you insult men who disagree with you and men's right activist by calling them a neckbeard, fuckboy,  manlet,  and mantards when they disagree with you but get so offended when a man calls you a cunt which just means vagina and not real insult?

Why you women complain about being expected to shave your legs when I grow a beard I have to point a sharp instrument towards my throat just to avoid being called a neckbeard?

Why you condemn men for slut shaming but when it's being done predominantly by other women?

Why is that whenever a man gives you a compliment you misinterpret as a insult?

Why you complain about men not showing they're emotions, but the minute they do, you revel in their ""male tears"" ?

How do you expect anybody to see you as a ""strong independent woman"" when you sequester your self in ""safe spaces"" to avoid being challenged like how the moderator of this subreddit is deleting and banning the men who prove you wrong with facts and a valid argument other then calling you all the insults in the book 

Why you make the ""yes all men"" argument when a lot of men don't have that same mindset.

Statistically, the vast majority of Child murders are committed by women, so why is the ""teach men not to rape"" argument valid but ""teach women not to kill children"" isn't?

So you reached the end of my argument, I want you to reply and if you haven't read this comment I want you to with a valid argument other then calling me a manlet and incels then have the audacity to ban me of my free speech to you hate speech.",TryAgainWill,2019-09-02 04:35:43,2019-09-02 04:35:44,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/cr661h/question_for_men_raiding_this_sub_why_are_you/eysi1vg/,t3_cr661h,FemaleDatingStrategy,1
309,"Personally, as a guy. Here is all you have to say:

*""I'm sorry. But i just don't think i'm reciprocating the same feelings as you.""* or *""Thanks for the compliment, but I just don't like you that way.""* Or something along those lines. Should he persist, be more direct. Say *""No. I'm not interested.""* If he continues, Block him, call the police, do what you need to do to be safe.

I wish this was taught a lot more because the world only benefit from this. Women can reduce the chance receiving an extreme emotional outburst from a guy a rejection, Because the guy spent all that time thinking that you two share the same feelings only to receive that hard reality that it was all one sided and now he looks like a creep. But say, if he is rejected earlier, then really he would normally just be sort of bummed out and move along, plus it's one less creepy guy bothering you. Needless to say, the latter option (reject sooner rather than later) is MUCH safer for women. Also it's good for men because, us guys wouldn't be wasting time bothering y'alls when you are not into us, and move on to find somebody else who would reciprocate those feelings. 

Also, I know I'm kinda going back on the previous paragraph. Which in the context says ""Guys have feelings too"" and switching over to ""Guys are tough"" But whenever a guy approaches you that you are not interested in. Just keep a mental note that us guys can take a hit, so don't feel bad for forward and saying that you are just not interested.

(Side note: Remember to be direct and don't leave any holes for opportunity where the guy would constantly ask you later. You don't want him thinking that you will later be interested.)",hyperdude321,2019-09-02 04:34:05,2019-09-02 04:34:06,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/cxv5un/how_to_politely_decline/eyshydu/,t3_cxv5un,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

 Of course it's true

 any woman who has taken her bf with her shopping for clothes learns very quickly her bf couldn't be more disinterested in her choice of clothes if he tried

 where as when a woman takes her gf along with her shopping for clothes, they usually have a wonderful time, chattering about the clothes and trying them on and complimenting each other

 ""yeah you look wonderful in that, it really suits you, she said""

 said earnestly by the gf

""yeah you look wonderful in that, it really suits you, he said""

 said begrudgingly by the bf

 for the bf it's not only a bore shopping for clothes for his gf, it's also a chore he feels obliged to endure just to please her

362,"Women listen up

when men are told about the millions of women and girls who are being raped and murdered by millions of their team manhood across the globe

it doesn't trigger any reaction in men 

apart from a snigger and a usual yawn of indifference and a cry of

""is that all you women are complaining about?""

but when you tell them about the one woman who cut off one man's dick in retaliation

well you will have the turds fullest attention then for hours and hours

and they will all be up in arms demanding revenge, while squealing in their male voice choirs

""How dare a woman do that to a man? How dare she? How dare she do that to us V.I.P.S. we the protected sex.. off with her head?""

Men and their priorities in their man's world protecting their manhood is at the very top of their list.

 Who knew?

Women don't waste your time looking for empathy from men by showing them images of women and girls who have been raped

 because

 it is those images that turn men on not off

it is those images that trigger men's erections, not deflates them.

Men are all brothers in arms when they have one mutual male goal in common and it's the glue that binds them all together, THEIR LITTLE MALE COCKS

All things considered, monogamy doesn't seem like the answer.

419,"Repost:

The thing is sis, you can‚Äôt read men‚Äôs minds. And even if you could, I don‚Äôt think men even know the difference between infatuation and love most of the time. That takes a level of introspection they‚Äôre not usually socialized to have. They just know they feel good.
 
As with all things, time is your friend. Time reveals a man‚Äôs character and intentions. And you‚Äôre right to be worried that he might just be using you for a self esteem boost while he gets his life together. Keep him at a distance until you‚Äôre sure. Might seem like a glaciers pace but it will save you a lot of trouble.
 
As far as the lovey-Dovey behavior any practiced manipulator can pull that off. Most men know you can‚Äôt just come out and say you just want casual ass, so they finesse it. This way he gets to still feel like a ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù if he decides to dip out later.
 
You should act like you‚Äôre used to this level of treatment and stop being impressed by it. Even if it‚Äôs not true, fake it. If you seem like you‚Äôre buying too hard into his machinations then he‚Äôll figure he‚Äôs the best thing that happened to you, and that it doesn‚Äôt take much to impress you, and that his game is just that special and he‚Äôll start to subtly disrespect you.
 
In your case, I would just straight up ask him what he‚Äôs looking for.. He needs to verbalize it. If he struggles or stammers or makes excuses or says he ‚Äúwants to take things slow‚Äù or ‚Äúcasual‚Äù you know he‚Äôs full of it. That‚Äôs an immediate answer that he‚Äôs using you to boost himself in some way and isn‚Äôt actually interested ina long term connection. You‚Äôre a placeholder.
 
What I would also suggest is to start to limit your time with him and see if he picks up the slack. Start to reject him a little and see how he reacts.",TheOGJammies,2019-09-11 06:20:18,2019-09-11 06:20:20,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d2l0gp/do_you_ever_wonder_how_much_respect_from_a_new/ezvl4hp/,t3_d2l0gp,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

511,I read this and all the comments. So do you really think both genders sleeping with dozens of people is a good thing? By the way I do not agree with the primate analogy to apes. We are not Apes and we have higher brain function. If you do not agree with that its fine and makes your argument more valid. I personally do not. Whether it is a guy or a girl if you know someone your seeing is dating 5 people and maybe not having sexual contact why would you continue dating them after a while? Maybe if either gender is not dating for the purpose of LTR that works. But I believe either gender would feel like ok your fun and all but I am not going to waste my time and money if after say 3-5 months if it is going nowhere. But I guess that implies not dating just for sex. I believe both genders need to keep it in their pants until their is real feelings . Sex viewed as and activity like tennis is not very fulfilling. Maybe more for guys but I doubt it. Just to clarify I think it is bad for either gender to have slept with dozens of people.  I believe it is possible to keep it going as friends but both genders have limited time and money in most cases. I would say its great to be honest. But I doubt most folks want to settle down with people who have slept with dozens of others. I think it would be great to see a study on how many partners each gender has slept with and the length of their marriage. I would bet the more sexual partners the likely the marriage will fail. By the way  your perception of Women and men is very combative. I am sure that gets in the way of a good relationship. Good luck. Do  most of you even like men? Or do you think all men just want to use you for sex? And that all women just want to use men for resources? Seems like a very heartless way to view both genders. By  the way I am glad I am not in your generation of dating. You all seem to really dislike the other gender. We have been very happily married for 31 years. Still we are attracted to each other and have a very fulfilling life. And guess what we did not sleep with Dozens of people and use other men or women for resources whether it was for money or sex. You have a lot to work out. And yes I think the world has become very screwed up and combative  between the sexes. Good luck to all I wish you success in your dating lives I know it must be very difficult.,centers1997,2019-09-20 14:49:13,2019-09-20 14:49:14,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d2lg9t/girl_game_pt_1_males_monogamy_and_mateguarding/f0vsuyd/,t3_d2lg9t,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

You will never learn to trust someone more by letting him sleep around with other peoples, it's the other way around: you can let someone do that *because* you have absolute trust in him. If not, the open relationship is the *worst* thing to do. 

And it's normal that you don't want to have one. Being *insecure* is not something bad (it's when you began to be possessive that problems starts, but it's *really* different than being insecure). Having an absolute trust in someone is something that should be earned over the years, and even that you need the other to show signs of trust. I'm still insecure a lot of times (I'm basically a ball of anxiety) but I managed to put my insecurities somewhere else, because I made the separation between love and sex.

572,"I think this comes with an asterisk. Cold approaching men for romance/sex/flirting may not work, and might even have the ""free submarine sandwich effect."" To wit: You get a coupon from a sub shop that's ""eh"". It's nearby your work and the coupon says ""free sub!"". You amble over, grab a blah sub you forget about eating minutes later and never go there again. Ladies, don't give out ""free sex"" coupons :P (By being drunk and handsy, by ""wyd"" exes late at night, by cold approaching and shooting way out of your league). The dude will likely redeem his ""free sex"" (or ""free attention"") coupon, and move on immediately. 

Because the bar for one nighter or ""fwb"" sex is so much lower for your average dude than it is for your average women, any approach that's bold and flirty will be considered, even if you're not his type, he's ""talking"" to someone else, or he's 100% not available for a relationship with you. 

Also, be aware that because men approach women for sex, and women so seldom approach men, men can sometimes take it *really* wrongly. Like you have a case of insane hot pants for him, otherwise why would you have screwed up your courage and approached him if you weren't *dying* to f--- him? So they can be very crude and overly forward and have some kind of gross assumptions. 

The asterisk part comes in this way: if you approach an interesting dude and sparks are there, ask him to coffee. Approach it as friendly, maybe-more getting to know you. Then let *him* make the moves from there on out. You can also smile and even say ""hi"" or do other ""meet him halfway"" moves to see if he's feeling it.",Chazzyphant,2019-09-20 00:32:07,2019-09-20 00:32:08,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d2bzpr/why_its_rarely_a_good_idea_to_approach_men_first9/f0ufp67/,t3_d2bzpr,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

575,"Pretty much. The majority of them fail at traditional masculine roles: providing, fixing and building things by themselves, leadership when times are hard etc. 

And they fail at traditionally feminine roles: caregiving, emotional intelligence, support of significant other, cleaning etc. 

Failing at all these things makes them effectively useless. They have abandoned all positive masculine traits while adopting negative masculine traits and have become more feminine without adopting any positive feminine traits  which I find bizarre. Their hobbies are video games, watching other men play sports and jerking off to porn. 

I‚Äôm very curious on how historians will study the phenomenon of millennial men and women. The women have become stronger in the sense that they have become more ambitious self-confident and independent and the men have become weaker; less ambitious, less independent, less social and more prone to suicide.

&gt; and especially if I sleep with one, even though I try to force myself to follow the ‚Äúrule‚Äù, I just cannot get myself to want to talk to anyone else. 

This is literally the *worst* time to stop talking to other guys. Men who 'game' women will tell you that the moment they sleep with a woman the power shifts over to their court. This is when a lot of women start losing the guys they are dating, which is why so many girls say that guys lose interest after sex. In actuality, it's because you start pining over the guy and they can sense it, partly because they are *expecting* it. It's seriously the worst time to pine because it shows that they 'got' you and that you're the more invested one now, and that you have more to lose. They already got to have sex with you and now you're the one who is 'pumped and dumped' if he decides to pull the plug, so any sign that you are suddenly more invested afterwards will often cause them to pull away because they think you'll be pushing for commitment. You need to play it cool and not act any different afterwards. I never text a guy first after hooking up with them for example. This is when you need to be on your best game, which usually means entertaining other options. I am the monogamous type too, but this strategy is what will maximize your potential to achieve the highest quality monogamous relationship with the best person.",bearded_dragonlady,2019-09-29 21:07:18,2019-09-29 23:37:03,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dayy03/opinion_wanted_thoughts_on_dating_multiple_people/f1wyshd/,t1_f1wqsws,FemaleDatingStrategy,4

I've even stopped seeing a woman so that she could go do her thing with other men.

2, male mate competition is ridiculous. If another guy has rapport with a woman, who am I to think I have any right to her romantic interests?

1664,"Thanks for your reply! 

As a radfem, I love makeup, I love wearing heels, I love having sex and I love birth control! The thing with makeup according to radical feminism is basically: would your drive to wear makeup and heels be as strong in a society in which women aren't valued based on their looks? The obvious answer to me, is no. When us women say we do this for ourselves, we do it to look better and thus receive better treatment. How come makeup as an art is reduced to enhancing features in a way that corresponds to standards of beauty? I ask that making the bold assumption that you aren't walking around with fx makeup as a way of expressing yourself.

 Radical feminism just says it's a shame that as a woman you would value yourself by your looks. You have so many things going on for you and it would be nice to be appreciated and celebrated for your sense of humor, intelligence, etc as men are - instead of for how fuckable you are. Radical feminism doesn't take the choice to wear makeup away from you, it just comes with the bitter pill that by trying to better your own life you are contributing to the very system that created the need for you to better your own life in the first place.

As for porn objectifying women... of course it does. Women in porn aren't sexy or fuckable because of their great personalities. They are sexy for having \*insert physical characteristic here\*. That's the very definition of objectification: reducing a subject into an object. How else would porn function?

Being a radfem just means you see how gender can be used as a tool with which to oppress women and that you aren't going to put up with that shit. Really all it means is recognizing your worth as a human being.",madandunabashed,2019-09-06 13:41:11,2019-09-06 13:41:12,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d0ducp/isnt_this_like_the_female_version_of_rinceltears/ez9a6un/,t1_ez99274,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

1672,"I fail to see how your comment relates to the orginal  topic of conversation of men not marrying the woman they love the most. I pointed out a mental thought process a lot of men have and even called it silly. 

But if you want to get into the topic every women and relationship is different. Thier are women that plan to be mothers regardless of the risk even if they have man in your thier life or not and couples that choose not to have kids because of the risk  or cost that would remove your agruement. The mental stigma I was referring to comes from the older generation (parents maybe) and people who feel burned from men and women who used them for money or were placed in worse situations after a divorce. 

However, let's talk about the things differences in society between men an women that you have pointed out (which your points are vaild).

 for bodies topic, men will work themselves to the bone to provide and protect for thier family if there not you might want look again at the man you're dating. But if they are and not doing a good job they are socially not men enough so they take on the mental stress and that impacts their bodies in forms of if they injure them they work through the pain or they get fat, etc.

Career opportunities, again are expected to lead the family and be the beard winners. Yes, it is 2019 and things are changing but the society expectations don't move as fast as technology does.  So again when a men loses his job or becomes a stay at home dad majority of the time he is looked down upon as a men even if he is doing his part. Let's even talk about careers where men have to jump through hoops like the modeling industry, teaching, nursing, etc which are preceded as a women's career and when a men is accused of something in these field the impact is far harsher than the counter parts.

As far as dating desirability...as a dating coach can tell you dating as a single parents is difficult period regardless if you are a man or a women. Dating is difficult for some and added a kid to the mix always makes it difficult period. I experience this as well my dad has be single ever since my mother divorced when I was 5 and my mother has remarried 2 more times. 

Sure you can puff up say this and that point fingers a specific things that way more to one sex than the other but society is a spectrum and society is trying to correct itself socially.  As far a biological speaking because women birth children they have been seen as valuable and yes they can die from it but thought history that is why the majority of world treasures women. Society's standards or religious views are what corporate that. On the other hand men throughout history men are only worth what they can do and provide.

However, it still does not dispute that, like your lived experience as a target of racial inferiority, women can also experience racial discriminations, and both genders often internalise the very same racial inferiority complexes that work against them. 

Hence whilst your racial discrimination is as viable as the next, women experience a discrimination from simply being female on top of that as well. Just as it was important to note the racial complexities of modern societal hierarchies, it is just as important to remember the historically gendered exclusions from society, whether it be in America or the rest of the world.

1737,"Somehow I ended up here from r/All. Here's my take as a male which is counter to OP's, this is of course purely anecdotal.

If anything I prefer to sleep with and date women who have had a decent number of partners, it would only bother me if the number of partners they had possibly indicates sexually compulsive and/or addictive behavior. I can't say what that number is exactly, because a lot of factors go into it, i.e. age, culture, number of years sexually active, etc. My reasoning as to why is that as someone sleeps with more people, they learn more about their own sexuality and preferences. In my experience sex with someone who is more aware of their own sexuality and preferences leads to better sex sooner, and good sex is a cornerstone to a good relationship for most people^(1). I think it's good to sleep with someone pretty early on in seeing each other, personally, it's not unusual for me to sleep with someone on the first date, and if neither of us is interested in it by the third date or I don't see much point to continuing seeing each other. I don't think that's the specific number of dates people should go by, it depends on what your priorities are when looking for a partner, but as a very sexual and open person myself, I'd prefer to date someone similarly open and sexual. In general, I'd say it's to both the male and female's advantage for the female (really, both) to have a decent number of sexual partners, so that they have a better idea of what they want. It results in less ""wasted"" time for both parties.

1: The second leading cause for divorce is infidelity, which could loosely be interpreted as correlating to sexual dissatisfaction on some level.

Why would you regret the loss of someone who turned out to be emotionally unavailable? It's good that you did not have to waste another 6 years of your romantic life. 

Had you been available in the first place, your relationship might have been over before it started, instead of 6 years later. You then could have found someone who was a better match. It's never too late.

Honestly, sometimes I question whether there's even anyone out there for me who is emotionally healthy enough, who also wants what I want. So I understand where you are coming from on this and I do agree with a lot of what you have said about your personal experience.

1813,"A decent woman would \*never\* ask you to pay for a date. That would be uncouth to the extreme. But here's the general thought process: 

When you ask her out on a \*date\* (rather than a hook up or hanging out), one can assume that your intentions and interest  are not purely superficial. It would be unfair to expect her to pay for something she didn't plan or budget for, especially if you invite her to an expensive date. Of course you don't (and shouldn't) spend a lot of money on a first date. But even when you offer to pay for the coffee, it shows that you value her and her effort.

Most well-mannered women will decline anyway, especially if they don't plan on seeing you again. It's the the thought that counts.

Because it reaffirms your interest. Guys who ask a woman out and don't even offer to pay for the first round of drinks, are either not really interested or are too broke from going to too many low effort dates with women that don't really interest them.

1821,"Hey Op!

27F here, plus gay, but I hope my insight and experiences will help get a long term stable partner.

I've got a rough formula that I apply when I meet new potential partners - they should be different to me in ways that keep it interesting (for example, they like Indian food and I like Chinese); similar to me in decision making (e.g. long term vs short term thinking, do we reach similar conclusions even if we have different values?) and complimentary to me in ways that make us stronger together than we are apart (aka we can be a team).

They should ABSOLUTELY respect me, my time and my autonomy - this boils down to, giving me the freedom to make my choices, BUT they should trust me enough to know I would make choices that are best for the both of us to the best of my ability.

I also need to trust them in return.

They need to be willing to grow as a person - people who are stuck in their mode of being and not open to change will absolutely hold me back and be a liability.

1825,"The thing is, your advice is here as a means of protecting women from this?

In any case, the only thing in your OP I would challenge is this - and I'm curious to what your response would be:

\&gt; Social consequences are higher for women due to sexism. It‚Äôs not fair - but it‚Äôs true. If things go south - You‚Äôll be looked At badly and take most of the blame.

I would say it's fair because in a consensual situation, men can make the request for sex, and women can reject that request. (In a non-consensual situation, aka rape, the man SHOULD always be blamed.)

Now, say a woman accepts the request for sex indiscriminately, as is the premise in your OP, should she not be judged for having poor judgement?

A man that is able to sleep with many women with no promise of commitment, aka a player, is probably a great womaniser, but doesn't have much else going for him - because he spends all his time womanising.

So, if society judges a woman harshly for falling for his tricks, when she knows she has more to lose for doing so, is this not fair?

Again, genuinely curious to your reply - maybe I've missed something.

Plus to be fair, men who sleep with TOO many women are also judged harshly, because, being a serial womaniser means ""spoiling"" those women for the Average Joes who probably spend their time doing something more productive in society.",DjanoManjo,2019-09-10 17:49:47,2019-09-10 17:49:48,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d22vzv/given_that_the_risks_of_sex_are_way_higher_and/eztspy3/,t1_ezts0vi,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

If a woman is trying to ""hurry up and settle down,"" by definition, she will be discriminant no? Otherwise she will not pick the best partner for marriage? 

Perhaps you mean that women just settle for any idiot to marry just so they can be married? But even then, I think most women would still be discriminatory in the man she settles for, even if he's not the calibre of man she wants. Does that make sense?

1867," Dating and relationships are complex, and this is human nature we are dealing with. Human beings are most unpredictable, plus with the added complexity of hiding behind a wall of anonymity in the case of on-line dating, no one is in full control. 

The best analogy I can think of is that of Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz. Dorothy was aware that something magical was at the end of the yellow brick road, but was not prepared for the surprises she encountered along the road. In her case, the tin-man, the scarecrow and the lion whilst not obvious companions in any other circumstances became friends with a shared purpose. Today‚Äôs dating is very different from our experiences of engagement with our friends or work colleagues.

1870," In my opinion, understanding the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô is much more a journey of understanding your self-worth, and reaching out to take hold of what you desire. This is a journey that you can choose to take control of as opposed to letting your pathway be informed by others. It‚Äôs about you being objective and not being reliant on the opinion of others, no matter how close they are to you. Typical examples of being subjective and letting the thoughts and opinions of others ‚Äòcreep‚Äô into your approach to seeking romance:

‚ÄúMy friends said‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel left out‚Ä¶.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI always felt like a third wheel‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy friend has a great life. I could have that life too if only I had a partner like she does‚Ä¶..‚Äù

It takes more than simply informing someone that you‚Äôre continuing to date several people.....there‚Äôs always a hierarchy of preference &amp; asking what your date‚Äôs looking for &amp; what priority an attribute has for them is important, as are yours. Also important is talking about how you &amp; your dates determine the attributes you seek....is it gut feeling or are their specifics that matter. Being informed helps to determine how realistic, mature &amp; reasonable your dates are &amp; whether they‚Äôre likely to assess you fairly or not.  Understanding what non-monogamy looks like to your date &amp; vice versa, is essential because while using similar language, you may be miles apart in reality. Also important is to discuss if &amp; how each of you are willing to talk about your other dates or not. The issue of sex is important to discuss - is there to be secrecy or will everyone know everyone‚Äôs intimate business.  Non-monogamy should be ethical &amp; consensual, not grudgingly accepted. Issues like sexual health must be discussed &amp; agreed upon.  Studies show that conducting non-monogamous relationships may result in greater overall life satisfaction but studies are frequently methodologically compromised by the discontinuity so common in these relationships. Spending time on the non-monogamy subreddits clearly demonstrates the commonly encountered issues, many proving difficult to navigate despite coming with stability &amp; established permanence.

1946,"Yes he can. Sex count matters when it comes to women and women have a habit of eventually falling for whatever dick they are taking long time
It says alot about her impulse control.
Its much easier for a women to have sex. Because women are the choosers of sex. Therefore, if she has a huge N count then her standards must not be high and she must give in to temptation way too easy. Thats why guys look down on it.

Its not that easy for guys. Nowhere near actually. Whether guys see having a huge N count themself as an achievement is irrelevant. Its like the guy that chases girls for relationships and is insecure in himself. Women love commitment. Men are the choosers of committment. If a guy was to commit to a girl who showed him abit of attention everytime then it shows his low sense of value and self esteem.

Guys and girls are different and you clearly lack the ability to differentiate the standards at which both genders are held at. Different standards exist in society whether you want to act like a baby over it or not. Get over it.

1955,"I've never pressured a partner to take birth control and have actually been a huge advocate for stopping it because of the negative side effects. I have always not only worn condoms but purchased them and brought them myself if I expected to have sex. I have had multiple partners who needed to stop partway through and cry in my arms and I was more than happy to hold them and be a source of safe masculine energy while they discussed abuse in their histories or sometimes didn't want to talk about it and we just sat in silence.

I have no problem with the picture. I'm a man who firmly believes in bodily autonomy and not only have driven friends to the clinic and gave hell to the despicable picketers I once made my own signs and counter protested them. *Me*. I came up with the idea. I got a group of friends. I bought the supplies. I tried to keep it civil and respectful and just show them how much they were hurting the poor girls who already had trauma to deal with and I had all sorts of people honking and showing their support against the hateful anti-abortion people.

My problem is with the damn caption that says ""all"" men

You read my story. You don't have to believe me. I know who I am and while I've made a lot of mistakes those are some of the things that remind me I'm not garbage and I'm not a piece of shit. There are a lot of men and boys who are fighting just as hard as you women are against the patriarchy because it hurts us just as much as it does you. It hurts us to see you suffer and we hurt our own masculine wounds too. You *don't* know all of our stories.

So please, I'm saying this because I care about you and I know that you wrote that title from a place of hurt, find a way to forgive masculinity and understand that it's not ALL men. It's a disease that has brought a gender just as beautiful as women to this horrible place.

I also observe that if you still like your ex and you're still around being his friend after he dumped you, you're holding his hand through the breakup making him feel better while you still suffer. You make the transition easier for them. And by doing that you also increase the chances of them finding someone and having a long lasting relationship with them because you give them the confidence to pursue new relationships knowing that if everything goes wrong you're there for them and you can even get back together.

I get that women have and do take birth control without their partner's knowledge, and that is very bad in the case that a man is being deceived about trying to have children, but who really holds the most power with effective birth control especially given women are generally more likely to seek parenthood and family life (currently).",swillah,2019-09-19 14:54:02,2019-09-19 14:54:47,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d6a0pv/what_did_i_say_all_males_act_like_toddlers_but/f0sh4im/,t3_d6a0pv,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

2001,"Pretty much all of those ""where are all the good men"" articles you can find are [written by and about women aged 30 and older](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=where+have+all+the+good+men+gone&amp;t=fpas&amp;ia=web). That's the age. It's extremely easy for women to attract male attention in their 20s because that's when women are at their most physically attractive. That seems pretty obvious.

Problem is, you all ""know what you want"" and yet don't have a realistic picture of your own leverage. Statements like:
&gt;&gt;If men were the prize, they'd be leading the breakup and divorce rates but they're not
Followed by
&gt;&gt;The very few women who are the victims of r/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen simply haven't discovered this yet. Or are too insecure to believe it.
...honestly just comes off as delusional. Because if you put attractiveness on a curve, you're going to find that a solid half of women are of average or below average attractiveness, even at their own peak attractiveness, which will decline with age. You simply aren't going to get the same amount of attention at 35 that you did at 18. So the longer you wait, the harder it gets. If anything, dating around and not being realistic about your own worth, never accepting that you may have hit the bests you can realistically do, just makes it more likely that you hit that wall.

Does your current boyfriend know you're on dating apps?

Do you think having fucked up a relationship so bad that the man who promised to marry you called it off makes you an authority on this subject matter?

I pushed through years of therapy and self improvement while encouraging him to do the same while he sat on his computer neglecting his life (himself, me, his family, what friends he had) and numbing himself continuously each evening. 

I stayed physically active and encouraged healthy eating habits while he protested and would reluctantly drag himself to do 15-20 min of exercise once or twice over several months and would cook (delicious) but unhealthy food consistently.

I told him frequently that he was loved and that he held the potential for a rich life if he reached out for it. I let him know that he was handsome every day despite the fact that he never told me I was beautiful.

The rare times he would go out of the house included when I would catch a cold or something, you know, the times I would hope to get cuddles on the couch and comfort.

I tried to teach him the benefits of empathy and compassion, but what was always more important were his opinions and being right. He was also very unsympathetic to the challenges that women face in life usually purporting that we imagine them. He always complained about his female bosses as being ‚Äúmatriarchal‚Äù and generally seemed to have a disdain for females that was was pretty well hidden for the first couple of years.

He is a very intelligent man that led me on over 6.5 years to believe that he would grow up and become less selfish.

She has no business dating until she is single and has straightened out her life. Most men, unless they also have kids, aren't going to be interested, regardless.

2049,"Dude's opinion here:  I hate to say it, but I think you're overcomplicating this, and it would actually have the opposite effect. Men tend to ""date down"" for extra security even.  If you want a guy's attention, do the exact opposite:  be alone and casually timidly glance at him while doing something else.  Hard to resist that honestly.  What you describe only works if you're trying to filter out beta men or fuckbois, but if you know the man you want ahead of time, make yourself as vulnerable and uncompetitive as possible.

Regarding asking a man out, that's sometimes true.  It's not what you'd expect, but the good old high school ""tell your friend to tell him 'My friend over there likes you, go talk to her'"" totally works past high school.

2065,"&gt;Men swim peacefully in their mediocrity 

Followed you over from PPD....guessing I won't make it through the filters on this sub so I'll keep it short.....

I got my first ""real"" job by looking good in a suit. That's it. There's my privilege. It's.....considerable. I've done well since, all things considered. 

Here's the thing....I'm a hardcore sapiosexual. Why do I give a fuck if other guys get laid? I'd rather help other smarties get laid. 

It's funny.....I am still close with my last ex, and we had a very specific conversation about her current focus, a really good man who would be lucky to be snagged by such a wonderful woman. She said I'm the only one who gave her remotely good advice, acknowledging that I was swallowing jealousy as she almost ""branch swung"" to him halfway through our relationship (yes, lingering oneitis). 

Yet when I talk about my own strategy, I get ""You might be missing out on the love of your life"" (she tells a 47 y/o who's been divorced twice). 

It's hard to be honest, I guess. 

Anyway, I'm sure you're aware of the counter-narrative to the OP....I mean, not specifically counter, but more sort of a game theoretic framework (if you'd call it that) which says ""hey, y'all are doing fine, I'm gonna lift weights and do my thing, and since you don't need a Provider you'll be down for.....Netflix &amp; Chill""",fuckGuilt,2019-09-25 01:58:33,2019-09-25 01:58:34,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d8m7gk/stop_crying_over_pathetic_men/f1d8jxn/,t1_f1d406h,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

2104,"&gt; You got shafted during the divorce not because of laws and evil women, **but because you thought with your dick when you got married.** 

Very much agree with this and pretty much everything else you said. It annoys me too.  

I find the preponderance of misogynist fora on the internet (in combination with Trump and similar movements elsewhere) pretty threatening. Have you looked into gamergate, and all the misogynist BS it spawned? I'm not really a gamer and heard about it 2 years after the event. It was like finding out that most of the men I know (most of them do play video games) are actually werewolves. That viscerally hate female autonomy, equality in the workplace, child support, equal pay for equal work, women in supposedly 'male dominated' spaces like video games,  etc. 

Tinder is also a huge source of fresh misogyny because men experience a lot of rejection in OLD. You can find that a source of balance since it puts power into the hands of women, it just seems to make them more toxic in everyday social interactions. 

That said, I'm not sure this type of subreddit is helping. It looks like a good place to vent, obviously. Should women be better than the human trash pandas on the incel forums?

2162,"I gotta say, I actually love seeing woman driven threads like these that are focused on dating... It shows me what the men focused ones are doing wrong and gives me the other perspective which, believe it or not, is not an easy thing to empathize with if you didn‚Äôt grow up with it (surprise, surprise). As an only child, grown up in an old school man-centered (patriarchal?) household, I‚Äôve always had trouble with girls. It wasn‚Äôt until I got into the ‚ÄúPUA‚Äù scene that I actually started to get better at dating. I totally understand why girls hate that shit though, because a lot of them are assholes that do it for the wrong reasons, and a lot of the guys that give guidance on pick up do show some very misogynistic ways of being. But please understand, these threads do teach a lot of things that I see on women threads as well. Confidence, forget about chasing the opposite sex and improve yourself, etc. Things I don‚Äôt think I would have ever learned if I didn‚Äôt get into that scene (they seem so obvious but to a lot of people seeking the attention of the opposite sex, they‚Äôre not). And I‚Äôve met girls that were onto the whole PUA thing from the moment I met them, and they would call me out on it from the get go. But they didn‚Äôt care, because in the end, I wasn‚Äôt being an asshole or hiding anything. I was just the guy who wanted to get to know them. Anyway, please continue growing the women dating scene. Men and women are naturally different but we learn from one another, so I hope that by every now and then listening in on the perspective of the other will help us grow to understand each other a bit more.

Also, to address the abundance mentality comment, what it really is is a way to avoid a scarcity mentality. And this applies to both men and women alike. I‚Äôve met a lot of desperate women and men (me being one of them at some point) and what the men community tries to teach is that there are plenty of fish in the sea. Super obvious right? Well, you can think that all you want, but unless you interact with the many fish in the sea, you‚Äôll feel just as scarce as ever and quickly forget about how many fish there are. So these guys tell you to go to the easiest place you can find a lot of women that are somewhat open to social interaction (a bar, a nightclub, a social gathering) and just talk to them. Reinforce the fact that there are a ton of fish in the sea and that rejection is okay (applies to both men and women). This will eventually get you into a state where you don‚Äôt go seeking female attention because it is literally everywhere. Women naturally have this ‚Äúabundance mentality‚Äù because men are way less selective than they are. Meaning, a woman can get a mans attention a lot easier than the other way around (quality of man may vary). So all we are trying to do, is level the playing field by getting men into the same mentality that women have.",prolerbear,2019-09-29 13:41:00,2019-09-29 14:02:38,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/da0a3l/men_are_getting_riled_up/f1uwh1l/,t1_f1o2dly,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

2197,"I think I spent half my life seeking validation from men. I only kept getting hurt and self destructing. Men can be very toxic.

I‚Äôm not sure I can say I regret it all necessarily because I raised myself and I had to learn somehow how things worked and how men work. I never had a father or any brothers or male figures in my life. Men always were really drawn to me but would hurt me terribly. After so much pain, I finally decided to be alone. I did meet someone who I am falling deeply in love with but honestly if he and I don‚Äôt work out, I think I‚Äôm going to give up on men or go back to my ex who was impotent but we loved each other dearly. He‚Äôs pretty toxic too though. I would never live with him. In fact it‚Äôs hard to imagine living with a man again and I spent 14 years living with two of them.

Also volunteer work, a part-time job, and keeping an eye on your finances.

Forget boys, they add nothing to your life right now that you can't get yourself or from women.

Do go on casual dates to learn social skills and spot red flags (start with the list of everything that's wrong with your ""boyfriend"" and avoid that in future), but don't upgrade anyone to ""serious boyfriend"" until your 20's.

3265,"As a female, I understand where you're coming from, but the point made was valid. Not *every* guy is like this. A lot, yes. Although, you can argue that the ones who aren't are more secluded in more ways than one so it's hard to have an accurate depiction of how many men are just respectful people who don't care about gender. I would imagine that it would make a person sad to see their gender being generalized, as it makes me sad when I witness misogyny. I'm not saying your personal view is invalid or underserved, *as an opinion*, but it just simply is not fact. I hope my comment isn't upsetting, I don't want to be a dick to anyone, I just also don't want anyone to be a bigot. 

Like, Idk what the removed comments said about race, but let's compare it to racism. White people being racist to black people is a problem, even with all the headway, racism exists, systematic racism exists, neonatzi groups and the kkk exist. It's obviously, *the* problem, so to speak.

However, black people can be racist to white people. It's not an issue the way the reverse is, but it still happens. That white kid goes to a school full of black kids, and gets bullied for being white. So, did that kid deserve to get bullied?

The answer, obviously, is no, because racism is never okay. So we take that example, and talk about sexism.

Men have ruled the world for years, and us women have finally gotten a voice in the last fifty or so. It's getting better, but systematic sexism exists. Government officials try to maintain as much control over women as they can. Constantly we're reminded with jokes and slights that we are often viewed as the weaker sex, the gentler sex, as less than. That's not okay.

Again, though, if you reverse it, even though men don't go through what we go through, like how white people do not have the same experience as people of colour, it's not okay to generalize, identify someone's thoughts and actions solely on a physical part of them, and attack them for something out of their control.

I'm sorry about your personal experience, I'm sorry it hasn't been better. I am so sorry for you that you have had shitty people in your life, because that just sucks. I genuinely hope you, and everyone else honestly, has the chance to meet good people that will remind you of the happy things in the world.

The fact of the matter, though, is that men are born men. That's out of their control. We can't pick our parents, the people that teach us how to be people. Unfortunately systematic sexism is an infectious concept, bred through generations, but not every family has those ideals. Not every father teaches his son that women are below him. Some people are just better than others, because that's how life goes.

I'm sorry for this extremely lengthy comment, but I'm hoping it might give you a more optimistic outlook of what you could find out there. A lot of people are shit. Seriously. That, however, is men *and* women. People are just shit, lol. There's someone for everyone, though, and I wish everyone the best of luck finding their someone, and leaving all the shit people behind.",MangoJayne,2019-09-03 17:16:34,2019-09-03 17:16:48,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/cywzhh/another_reason_to_never_feel_for_bad_ghosting_men/eywjlqn/,t1_eyvfbv9,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

Yes, they're are bad guys. There are bad women. Bad gay people, bad straight people, bad blacks, bad whites, bad Asians, bad Hispanics. If you decide that all black people are garbage off the actions of, say, those in gangs, there's a word for that: racist piece of shit. If you think all women are bad due to those that use men financially, then leave them for whatever reason (like incels do), there's a word for that: misogynist piece of shit. Grouping people all together and hating them for the actions of a few, even a bunch, but far from all, is asshole behavior, and you have zero business trying to date anyone with your bitter heart that cares nothing for their feelings. Go to therapy, you have zero business giving anyone dating advice... Which I thought was the purpose of this sub. Self preservation is keeping your eyes open and making careful decisions not to put yourself in dangerous situations, like downloading an alarm/alert app before you go on a first date in case things get hairy. Its waiting as long as you need to for sex, etc to protect your mental health and feelings.

Also, being that fucking rude to another woman that politely didn't agree with you is pretty much like those bitches that told me I have internalize misogyny bc i like sephora lmao.

3357,"what? men have always had way less standards than women. women rate 80% of men as unattractive, whereas men rate women unattractive 50% of the time (how it should be). the only men who have it easy with women are very very good looking men. tall, handsome, you know the drill. proximity is not a problem anymore. online dating solved it. the problem is that women only swipe right, on average, 4.5% of the time (according to new study, and further alludes to higher female standards). men swipe right, on average, 61.9% of the time. who is being picky here? average men barely have any fucking standards anymore.

the problem of loneliness is predominantly male. male suicide is skyrocketing. male sexlessness is skyrocketing. not female. females will always have options. they know they'll be an average looking dude waiting for her if she doesn't secure her ""ideal"" man. i'm not saying that girls can't feel lonely, it's just a mostly male problem.

online dating and social media has completely fucked over average males. women are no longer confined to their immediate vicinity. average girls can now find a guy 47 miles away that is her perfect type (tall, handsome, white, whatever). Males do not have the same luxury, unless you're that very good looking dude. as girls figure out they can just go on online dating and easily get matches with men who fit her exact preferences, and since there is certain beauty standards that means most women will be chasing the same men (again, tall, lean, muscular, and handsome), which is evidenced by the 4.5% figure i cited above, this leaves average and below men in the dust scrounging for scraps. this mainly applies in the women's 20s when their SMV is highest.

‚ÄúAs you can see from the gray line, women rate an incredible 80% of guys as worse-looking than medium. Very harsh. On the other hand, when it comes to actual messaging, women shift their expectations only just slightly ahead of the curve, which is a healthier pattern than guys‚Äô pursuing the all-but-unattainable. But with the basic ratings so out-of-whack, the two curves together suggest some strange possibilities for the female thought process, the most salient of which is that the average-looking woman has convinced herself that the vast majority of males aren‚Äôt good enough for her, but she then goes right out and messages them anyway.‚Äù",bloyy,2019-09-05 17:08:49,2019-09-05 17:21:17,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/cple86/young_women_need_to_hear_this_its_okay/ez5qvtv/,t1_ez5l2nx,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

3443,"&gt; as girls figure out they can just go on online dating and easily get  matches with men who fit her exact preferences, and since there is  certain beauty standards that means most women will be chasing the same  men (again, tall, lean, muscular, and handsome), which is evidenced by  the 4.5% figure i cited above, this leaves average and below men in the  dust scrounging for scraps. this mainly applies in the women's 20s when  their SMV is highest. 

Obviously this means that a lot of girls are dating this same small group of attractive men and these guys must have multiple girls chasing them. 

I expect this applies largely to hookups and casual dating and would be different if you look at women in long term relationships because all these average women can't all date/marry this small group of attractive men, who will probably excluding the average girls and choosing one of the higher tier women when they decide to settle down.",billykangaroo,2019-09-08 15:15:12,2019-09-08 15:15:25,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/cple86/young_women_need_to_hear_this_its_okay/ezk6ix8/,t1_ez5qvtv,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

You can get therapy (which definitely might help) but for me even better than therapy has been making sure the voice in my head ONLY is allowed to say nice things to me. NO self criticism.

Women can and do perform for other women too. There are creeps out there regardless of gender. That‚Äôs why people should know how to protect themselves if they do find themselves in danger. 

Some people do things like this because they enjoy the performance of doing it. I feel it‚Äôs empowering to have the choice to do such NSFW performances and earn money from it. And I don‚Äôt see the issue if the stripper likes the attention from those people. As long as no one is hurt and both parties are consenting, it‚Äôs fine by me.

&amp;nbsp;

 And at the end of the day, these are jobs, jobs in industries which women generally have little control over, so if your boss is male, the clients are male, the pay and the terms are set by the market, and you‚Äôre the product, how can this possibly be empowering? A lot of porn actresses have talked about having to do riskier and more extreme things to keep making money because the market is so saturated. Strippers are constantly getting ripped off by club wonders who skirt contract law.

&amp;nbsp;

LibFems like to claim these things as empowering with almost absolutely no context. Under what circumstances is it empowering? Is it actually empowering for women to be in sex work reenacting their sexual trauma in front of the male gaze? To what extent are these things freely given and to what extent are the coerced by men influencing society in ways so that women feel they have little choice? There‚Äôs women in these industries who are doing half this shit to self abuse and need to go to a therapist instead of another BDSM party.

&amp;nbsp;

LibFems also fail to discuss the consequences of said behavior. Just because you *feel* empowered doesn‚Äôt mean the rest of society is going to support you. Sure, you can suck a football team of dicks as is your god given right but let‚Äôs not mislead girls into thinking the rest of society is going to look at them like a hero instead of just pathetic or that there might not be serious consequences for the behavior. 

&amp;nbsp;

Sexual empowerment *should* have been focused on teaching girls how to articulate their sexual needs, boundaries, consent, and sex on their own terms - not just showing your pussy on Instagram for likes. 
It should have been focused on teaching men how to please women, instead of all this long list of extra shit that a lot of men now feel entitled to for no reason other than LibFems repeatedly calling it ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù.  All this ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù is going on and yet Straight women are still orgasming significantly less than everybody else. All this ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù going on, but schools are still pushing abstinence education and letting teens learn about sex through porn made by middle aged white perverts.

&amp;nbsp;

Finding out what you want is a process. The first step is to listen to yourself. In your heart of hearts, what kind of relationship would you like to have? If you really are not sure, start out with identifying the traits you like in your friends and see if that can help you start piecing a picture together.

&amp;nbsp;

Next, and this is important, you have to learn how to strategize to get what you want out of situation. Understand that all people cannot be all things to you. You must be able to observe men as they are, understand their strengths and limitations and set boundaries accordingly.

Men are so terrified that women are going to take advantage of their offer to pay. But the truth is, the right woman will *never* be content to let you pay for the first date, especially if she's not interested. Even if she accepts once, it's unlikely she will accept twice in a row. 

But even in this day and age, your offer still lets her know you are interested and consider her worthwhile. Even if she declines, rest assured she took note.

The current amazing and hopefully long term woman in my life right now came from a shattered married which brought with it a beautiful little girl named Abby.  Abby‚Äôs mother was broken and severely tired from the previous relationship she had been in.  I befriended her.  She told me all the time I was one of the few people she could be so intimate with, so open, vulnerable, and yet, there wasn‚Äôt a physical pressure from me for her to ‚Äúlet me stick my dick in her‚Äù.  It wasn‚Äôt until about 4 months after we started conversing that this indeed happened.   She never wanted me to pay her way.  She wanted to enjoy a co-mutual relationship where all things were equal because she was scared of her past and did not want any external pressures but she did want to see if there was still a possibility.  I indeed told her that I was not after her for the purpose of the physical relationship but that is easy for men to say.  I did earn her trust over time and I am very happy that I made the choice to forego the pressure which does exist(sadly more times than not) for a female to supplement the relationship by giving into a physical situation in exchange.  I would always encourage all women to find their rhythm and only have sex because they want to have sex and don‚Äôt feel pressured into it or let yourselves submit before necessary.  There are some key tools females can use to gain the heart of a man if his heart is open and great tools to quickly weed out the fuckboi‚Äôs.

I was being voluntarily oppressed, silenced, forced to accept scraps from men who admonished the morals of women they wanted but couldn't control but had no morals themselves. RPW bend over backwards to be sweet, polite, submissive to men who spin plates like a DJ and couldn't give less of a fuck about the self-esteem and feelings of the women they're hurting. 

If being a RPW woman worked, then men wouldn't leave and abuse women after taking advantage of them when the women show these men their domestic talents; one girl was cleaning her man's house when she *didn't even live there* and he was dating another one of his plates behind her back. He convinced her that he couldn't be monogamous but the wave of ""he's a man, let him do what he needs to do!"" kept her from getting the fuck out.

It binds you to that one person for 18 years.

It is far better to take charge of your own life, and have a baby/babies through a donor.

That way, if you partner up with a man and it doesn't work out, the child won't be used as a weapon, and the child will always have a safe harbour, always.

3661,"The problem with treating any prospect as serious at 24 is your own age. You physically are probably superb, but your mind and unique attitude have not yet fully bloomed. The highest value men who are hunting for marriage material will likely have a floor of 27 for their prospective wife (and a ceiling of 32 so it‚Äôs not a large window). 

This can be frustrating to you because I‚Äôm sure dating men of your age is dreadful and those in the prime eligible age will seem very mediocre because those with wife-standards are refusing to consider you. 

In other words you need to wait 3 years or so to gain enough life experience to really command your best pull. The 40 year old is trying to jump the gun before you realize you can do much better. This would be like selling your stock in Apple right before they came out with the iPod.

3879,"I just stumbled upon this sub, but as a person who was in a relationship with a violent, abusive, alcoholic woman, the trope of the ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù ex as a source of comedy deeply disturbs me. It‚Äôs not cute, it‚Äôs not funny, and it ultimately reduces the agency of all women to be seen as both capable of and responsible for their own actions.

In turn, my ex came from a family where her father, brother, and grandfather were emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive. Her mother and grandmother blamed each other and my ex for the violence, gave her brother a boys-will-be-boys pass, and were often emotionally and physically abusive to my ex. I believe her brother is in prison for DV and she would be too if I didn‚Äôt refuse to cooperate with the prosecutor after my ex called the police and claimed I was kidnapping our son after giving me two black eyes and slicing my back open with a broken wine glass.

When I was in the relationship, I found myself thinking that violence and humiliation seemed like solutions to problems. I was so overwhelmed with fear and stress that I‚Äôd end up punching walls or driving recklessly after my ex got drunk and hit me or called me worthless. She convinced me that I was the one with the violence problem until she locked me out of the house one day and I signed up for therapy to appease her. My new therapist very gently explained to me that I was likely to be seriously injured or killed if I didn‚Äôt move out permanently.

Untreated extreme mental illness and abuse are incredibly dangerous. Because our society encourages men to act out rage and suppress emotions and because men are typically stronger, I feel like women are in greater danger. For the same reasons, however, I feel like men who have been physically abused often don‚Äôt recognize it or know how to ask for help without feeling like less of a man. I hope anybody who finds themself in a relationship with someone who shows the hallmarks of an abuser can find the strength and resources to get out.

3940,"Well this guy is only semi-aware of what's going on. Yes, women are generally unimpressed with men. But there's economic factors that have been at play here for a century. To boil it down to its fundamentals, the perception women have of men is a function of the size of the state and inflation and debasement rate of the currency. Bureaucracies, credit, quota hiring cheap laborers like women and immigrants, all these things serve to push men out of the scope of society where they're useful and valuable. Wages haven't risen in decades for these reasons. That's why men are largely broke. Which is why women aren't impressed with them. However, that perception can flip to admiration overnight with one good economic collapse. Try finding a job during a very long, drawn-out recession ladies where you're not getting the handouts that you're used to getting.

it's the actual reason for men to be part of it and seen actively involved in it supporting it and all the other men connected in it.

Misogynists do unite together and annihilate the image of the female human just to show to their male peers they are part of their male union and are committed to supporting their male cause and to elevate the significance of their own male image they have to smash down women's in the name of their male supremacyst cause.

 So knowing that, you can now tell me which men are not part of that union in the name of their manhood  can't you?

Rapists like nothing better than women and girls who aren't interested in them?

 That is the truth isn't it?

 and it's the core principle of the rapist, he wants to have a conquest under his belt 

and to feel like a winner, right?

 He wants to annihilate his victim and in seeing her pain and hearing her suffering is 

where he achieves the most sexual exhilaration and satisfaction for himself? 

That is the truth isn't it?

Women, men all need something they can take their sexual frustrations out on and why else 

would you females exist in their man's world if not for that, men have been asking 

themselves for centuries and none have  been able to come up with an alternative answer yet?

 but listen up women

WOMEN LISTEN UP

Rapists like nothing better than women and girls who aren't sexually interested in them!

 Rapists are sexist pigs who are all at the same trough pigging out on women's pain and suffering and all are gorging themselves on it.. all laughing with each other and high fiving each other

and

They are sexist pigs celebrating the death of a women, the mutilation of women, the dehumanisation of women because the pigs see women's being brutalised and trashed as nothing more than a glorious sport, nothing more than a sadistic sexual thrill for themselves.. it's a turn on for the rapists, not a turn off.

 and if you don't recognise it as anything wrong well why would you question it?.. why would you even acknowledge it as wrong when you are having so much fun at your victims expense?

 The Nazi's never thought there was anything wrong in their murdering the Jews and torturing them because the Nazi's saw themselves as really quite decent chaps and murdering the Jews was the only decent thing they could do in their Nazi world, rid it of those they classed as their inferiors and if not ride them comp0letely at least enslave them and brutalise them because it was better to have the Jews obey the Nazi's rather than question their sadistic murderous Nazi authority

One should never underestimate the capacity of men to bond together in total male solidarity while the trauma of their female victims are reduced down to background noise!

 Men are not victims here, women and girls are and you need to keep your eye on that ball..

it is pointless showing men images of women and girls who been raped and brutalised to expect to get empathy from men

4085,"Yes.

1. Has exclusivity been explicitly discussed and agreed to, by both parties?


2. If the answer to #1 is YES, then back off. Begin the slow fade. STOP texting him first. Cut that out IMMEDIATELY. NEVER DO IT AGAIN. EVER!!! When he texts you back, NEVER EVER EVER EVER respond immediately. Always make him wait at least 30 minutes for a response. An hour is ideal.


3. If the answer to #1 is NO. Do NOT assume exclusivity. Do NOT be exclusive to a man who isn't exclusive to you. NEVER EVER EVER DO THIS! ALWAYS date at LEAST 3. Date 5 or more at a time if you know you need more attention than that. Make them all work hard to secure exclusivity with you. You'll discover a few things by doing this. First, when you're out on dates and YOU don't bring up the ""what are we"" discussion, he'll get curious as to why. When he does get curious, he'll bring it up himself. When he does, act surprised and like it's not a big deal. Make him work for the answer. 

Once one of them asks you to be exclusive, you'll have to cut off the other 3 or 5 or whatever. Most of them will defensively push harder for you, as you break it off with them. IDK why they do that, but it ALWAYS happens.


4. Never EVER EVER EVER EVER get stuck on any one dude. There are THOUSANDS of men out there. OLD is a woman's game. You can get a new boyfriend within hours while an attractive man has to send hundreds of messages just to get 2% to 5% of them to text back. It's just reality.

4109,I think going into sex assuming an outcome is a mistake many women make. Some dudes just want to fuck and some want more. My girlfriend and I got together cuz we both wanted to fuck and have been together 3 years now. Neither of expected anything from eachother. We didn‚Äôt pressure eachother. The relationship just formed. My advice is to just try and enjoy the sexual experience on its own rather than expecting extra. If you want to have sex with a guy go for it and enjoy that as it is. If you guys are compatible chances are a relationship with show itself. I think this goes both ways as the same thing has happened to me with girls where I tell myself I‚Äôm seeing relationship signs when really they were barely there and all we had was sex,JadowArcadia,2019-09-22 00:42:51,2019-09-22 00:46:41,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d7flzh/never_fuck_a_guy_on_the_first_date_if_you_want/f10iac6/,t3_d7flzh,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

4129,"I thought humans were serially monogamous (as a species, no differences between sexes) and that mate competition was managed on two psychological fronts:

1. Pre-requisite (likelihood) fronts usually classify a mate, male or female, as too good, equal, or beneath and then that allocation sticks somewhat like a first impression. Tactics 1 and 2 are dangerous for this since Tactic 1 will question mate viability and Tactic 2 will create inherent discomfort.  I think that the options aren't bad but they also have some issues regarding realistic expectations from male behavior because everyone has these behaviors, male or female, and so the same disgust elements that affect female judgment (such as male promiscuity seeming too high) work the other way around. In essence if a man has to fight too hard for you he won't fight for you at all. That limit is directly correlated to your perceived value which is going to be far more than your physicality; there's got to be something very serious on the table to raise that bar so high that you can practically get men to kill for you. That is not most women.
2. Neurological (confirmation) fronts usually don't work for 3 or 4 specifically because the brain is poorly wired to make sound judgments regarding such facts. Ironically, Tactic 1 can actually create a failed barricade in this event specifically because as long as your options are open so are theirs which means whomever can wait you out indefinitely. To Gatekeep sexual access requires some form of exclusivity regarding power; if getting sex from you is going to take a year versus someone else but they can just have sex with both, why not just have sex with both? A year will pass, they will get the same, and it isn't even a play on patience because they happen concurrently especially with the belief that you yourself are doing the same thing.

Bonus: Monogamy is never present. The concept of monogamy being for a certain status is completely against the very suggestion you made. Getting married does not somehow seal your vagina against penetration from other males so the idea that your whole libido and such from previous arrangements will suddenly fall in line is just terrifyingly wrong. [If this is your plan do not be monogamous at all.](https://ifstudies.org/blog/counterintuitive-trends-in-the-link-between-premarital-sex-and-marital-stability) Your odds of marital dissatisfaction go up, and it is plain to see why; how exactly will your say 25\~30 yr. old self suddenly drop your wild years and yearnings of just a year ago instantly because of a random circle object worn on a finger and a legal transcript?",quibbii,2019-09-21 20:21:58,2019-09-21 20:21:59,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d2lg9t/girl_game_pt_1_males_monogamy_and_mateguarding/f0zk8o2/,t3_d2lg9t,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

I don't think he lied about the age (not that I know of but I wouldn't be surprised lol) but he lied about lots of things. He also disliked that I was in university working on my education. He actually despised anything that involved my self improvement and becoming more independent. These abusers feed of making the victims feel small and totally dependent on them. They don't want to see you thrive because they're scared that if you do you'll see them for who they truly are and dump them.

""but according to a number of studies and surveys, between 14% and 35% of young men experience ED. Until 2002, the incidence of men under 40 with ED was around 2-3%. Since 2008, when free-streaming, high-definition porn became so readily available, it has steadily risen.""

I'm 40.

Dialup / internet porn came out in the 90's, just as my cohort hit puberty. Anyone without a steady girlfriend (aka anyone with poor social skills and who is likely to be ""never married"" or single again today) became a porn addict. My last boyfriend was an addict for 25 years.

I gotta hit that sweet spot of ""too old to have started porn when it came out, and dick still works because he's not yet a geriatric"".

I do not envy young women today at all :(

4263,"Your theory is that females want to use pussy power to accumulate. That it's natural and unavoidable? That its your job to pit fight males to obtain the best result?

There are some problems with your theory.

1. Your logic is for monkeys. 

We're not fucking monkeys. We're humans. We're exponentially smarter than any animal. Every day we have a choice: act like a human, or, act like a fucking animal. If monkeys had it right, we'd be the ones in the zoo right now.

2. You've set up everything as an us vs. them scenario. This is why monkeys fucking suck and don't rule the planet like us. They use harems. Their family units are weak and fucking volatile. Such heavy concern is placed on sex and fighting that it will take them forever if not never to evolve to learn tools. In fact, most mammal ""fathers"" aren't actually fathers and they continue going penis penis rape punch mode so the dumb animal cycle continues on and on. Human pair bonding may have started as mate guarding but has evolved to a greater benefit: stronger families, stronger societies, coordinated societies, stability. We didn't punch our way to the moon.

3. The entire exposition seems like the mental X-games to try to justify, ultimately, ape-like behavior and personal sexual gratification. Why not just say you want to fuck a bunch of alphamales and get it over with? Does it make sense? Sure. Does it make you look like a dumb impulsive animal? Also yes. If all men let out their most primal desires tomorrow, 2/3rds of the population would be dead by the end of the week and ABSOLUTELY NONE of your mental tactics would stop you from getting raped like the animals you want to take pride in being. You would have ZERO choice in the meat wilds. But we're humans, not animals.

I know I'm going to get roasted and downvoted right into the trashcan. But at least you read it (reddit, lol). I hope it is a little thought-provoking.

Personally, all the men I know that you'd cream over (strong, smart, well-off) are all disciplined self-developers that strive for stability and personal advancement in the pursuit of self-fulfillment. They don't think about slamming the pussy as much as you'd believe. Does it take them a lot of discipline to not capitalize om their female options? Definitely. Do they still stay true to it? Yes. Many have had their time and now it's time to suck it up and be a man. The best woman they could ask for is one that is willing to put in the effort that the they are putting for them.

4284,"Did he ask for commitment before you guys had sex? If not, you 
never should have exclusively dated him. Always have at least 3 men on your roster at all times, *especially* if you plan on having sex with one of them. The other 2 men vying for your attention is what takes the edge off of slow fades and keeps the power in your court, even after sex. If you had been dating other guys, you also wouldn't have invested so much so soon in terms of talking every night on the phone. It makes you seem overly available and shows him that you have no other options. It also makes you too attached too quickly, before he shows his true colors.

If a guy is not doing something right say that. If you are uncomfortable saying something the don‚Äôt pretend to be enjoying it. If the dude doesn‚Äôt change something or ask me you then they are probably a bit selfish. You don‚Äôt have to say it in a abrasive manor you can just say maybe try this instead. Only an insecure dick is gonna get butt hurt about doing that.

I downloaded Tinder about a week ago, and it has been awful so far, I think partially due to the quality of men, but also due to me being in an overall terrible mood and feeling shit about myself. I am deleting it for now and will try online dating again once I feel a bit better about myself. I am working on losing a bit of weight, buying some new clothes, and getting my hair done.

In modern culture, men are portrayed as plentiful and disposable, but in reality, good men (aka non-manipulative, loyal and emotionally stable) who are also handsome, good at sex and have stable jobs are extremely rare. Few women will get one such man, more often than not the result of looking for one for their entire lifetime, most won't.

When it comes to improving SMV, you shouldn't be trying too hard until you are at least 18. At only 16, it's mostly about keeping a healthy weight, a nice haircut, and avoiding weird experimental make-up techniques. Do not try to become prettier to make your lame boyfriend treat you better. Do it to become more confident in yourself, but do not care too much about what guys think at this stage.

4415,"Hmm I don't know then. Since you said that method is not working because they just wait and then still only want to hook up... aside from sex what else do you do when you go on dates with them that puts them off having a relationship with you? Clearly it's not the sex, so there must be something else they see as a deal breaker for a relationship.

A few ideas I have are:
1. Maybe you give guys the impression that you'll be too emotionally needy without being there for them in the same capacity. Could happen if you're asking for their emotional support too soon or too often, or even not asking but just talking about your own stresses/problems without asking how they are a lot or trying to truly listen to them / find out about them enough.
2. They feel like they have to invest more in you than you are in them, For example if they always have to pay for dates, or always have to pick you up and drive you somewhere, or always plan what you do together. Some guys might like this but I think most want it more balanced.
3. Could they feel worried about being able to ""keep you"" in a relationship? I'm not saying you actually would sleep with with other guys or leave them for another guy if someone better comes, but maybe they're getting that impression somehow.",IntoxicatedOrange,2019-09-28 18:44:00,2019-09-28 18:44:04,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d9kfo3/this_generation_of_men/f1q9ic9/,t1_f1pn6ri,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

4427,"I was in a very similar situation. My ex-boyfriend of 2 years was very mentally abusive. I felt like garbage after I got out of that toxic situation. After I isolated myself for a bit because that's how I handle things,  I started casually dating again in hopes that I would feel better about myself after some male attention. 

But it actually made me feel worse because men in their 20s tend to be the worst. My roomate at the time was a sugar baby, so I decided to give it a go. I figured..if I'm putting up with all these shitty men in my life for free..I might as well flip a profit. 

It sounds super shallow but that whole experience gave me sooo much confidence. The fact that I never felt good enough, but now men are paying to just spend time with me? That was awesome. I stopped doing it once I felt more comfortable and confident with myself, because the was something I knew I didn't want to do for a long period of time. 

If that's not something you are open to doing (I'm well aware it's not everyone's cup of tea lol) I would suggest pole dancing classes.

And you're suggesting that you're so unique and different that you think guys are hot that others don't? Please.

&gt;It means what I find physically attractive.

Aka ""Chad"" as you put it.

&gt;Dude, I don‚Äôt care if all of my friends marry. 

Not yet. But when you don't get to see them because they are too busy with family stuff you're going to feel left out. It's best natural.

&gt;Societal pressure isn‚Äôt going to make me compromise my happiness and freedom. 

You're doing that all by yourself.

&gt;I‚Äôve known i didn‚Äôt want kids and I‚Äôve been 50/50 on marriage since I was 4. 

And everyone knows what you decide at four is always the best decision to stubbornly stick by for no reason other than to be stubborn

&gt;I know you have some weird revenge fantasy about all the women who rejected you growing old and being lonely but that‚Äôs just a cope. 

Why do you keep trying to make this about me? Is the only way a man can believe women are happier married is if he has a revenge fantasy? That makes sense to you?

&gt;I don‚Äôt actively pursue men out of my league if I get a man that‚Äôs hotter than me. Great! I‚Äôll pat myself on the back. 

Right on the spot he came on before he never called you back! Kudos!

&gt;I do pursue attractive men within my league though and I‚Äôm not willing to settle.

I think you are delusional as to what your league is or you'd WANT to get married.

&gt;So far having these standards and boundaries has lead me to having great romantic relationships with men.

That have all ended one in him cheating on you, yeah sounds amazing. Seems like they just don't want to commit to you, probably because you aren't as hot as you think you are. It's actually a very common problem in women.

&gt;And I love how you equate women experiencing soul crushing identity crisis because of thankless marriage and unappreciative children as ‚Äúwork‚Äù. 

Why would taking care of your kids and cleaning make you have an identity crises unless you have the mental fortitude of a conceited child?

&gt;This is not normal work and comprise that you have to put into every relationship to make it work. This is settling. This is your family taking and taking from you, being ungrateful and getting little to nothing in return.

Kids are ungrateful. They don't have perspective. You expect a one year old to thank you and experience an ""identity crises"" when he doesn't?

You're identity is that kids mom. The only crises is you got bored or overworked and want to forego responsibility so you can ride the every shallower dick tide.

Who will leave you behind and not invite you to anything because it's all baby/couples stuff so kiss your wonderful friends and social life goodbye relatively soon.

5753,"&gt;Ahh yes, threatening a woman with loneliness so she lowers her standards and settles for an ugly man.

Facts aren't threats and I already pointed out you could settle for average, you know, the category between ugly and hot that you pretend doesn't exist. It's like if I said ""keep smoking and you'll get cancer"" and you said ""stop threatening me"" I'M not threatening you, reality is apparently.

The argument isn't ""settle for an ugly man"" it's ""be realistic"" but of course reality is a threat for women.

&gt;I‚Äôd much rather be alone and happy.

Implying that if you can't have the most attractive man possible there is no way you could be happy, ridiculous. You could get a reasonably attractive guy.

&gt;Threatening women with ‚Äúyou better settle down or no one will marry you‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work any more. 
It's not a threat lmfao it's reality.

&gt;Single women are the happiest demographic.

You have lost your fucking mind on that one.

&gt;still don‚Äôt have Paul Dolan‚Äôs book. (It is on its way.) In the meantime, the best evidence I know of that shows that single women with no kids are doing better than all the other women is from an Australian study of more than 10,000 women in their seventies. It is a cross-sectional study, so it is subject to all the qualifications I already described. Keep that in mind.

&gt;The fact that the women were all in their seventies means that the findings may not be generalizable to younger women. (And men were not included at all.) 

So the only study that exists that even suggests you're right completely left men out, was specific to Australia and was performed on WOMEN IN THEIR SEVENTIES.

So hilarious. You think that applies to you. It doesn't even say they are happier than men. And it specifically says you can't extrapolate to younger women.

So you'll be miserable until your toothless and then in your seventies experience a modicum of happiness, probably because you decided to stop hopping dick to dick and focus on your family GASP!?!

&gt;I‚Äôve seen women turn into shells of their former selves because they sacrificed every thing for their ungrateful husband and kids. 

Yes marriage is not all fun and games and requires work. I know, terrifying.

&gt;That life isn‚Äôt for me. So the odds of me ‚Äúreaping what I sewed‚Äù as you put it are pretty none existent.

You do realize that as you grow you change, meaning you don't always feel the same way ten years after the fact right? 

&gt;Average men do exist I never said they didn‚Äôt. Average men can be attractive to some and not attractive to others.

You said hot and ugly you literally never mentioned average guys. When I suggested you don't sleep with the hottest guy because he's garaunteed to just screw you and leave you, you said ""I'd rather be with a hot guy than an ugly guy"" leaving literally no room for the idea that you could be with an average guy.

&gt;I know this might disappoint you but I‚Äôve never been pumped and dumped by anyone.

Well you have something to look forward to at least.

&gt; I‚Äôve been cheated on once but besides that my other romantic relationships have been respectful and mutually beneficial.

And yet you claim all ugly guys are shitty cheaters even though you've only been cheated on once? You have decided all ugly men are cheaters WITH A SAMPLE SIZE OF ONE!?

And you don't realize how stupid that is?

It's like I sleep with a girl and get an std and decide based on that every girl has STDs. It's really that stupid.

&gt;If not settling is what you call shallow, then yes I‚Äôm shallow.

Yeah I know that's what I'm saying. You refuse to even consider that YOU aren't good enough for the guy you want, and that as a result you will be treated poorly.

&gt;I‚Äôm not going lower my standards for a partner because men I don‚Äôt know are throwing tantrums about how they can‚Äôt get laid. That‚Äôs not my problem.

The only time I suggested you lower your standards was to be realistic. Meaning if you're 4 foot 9 250 pounds with acne, you should have realistic standards, if you're that person wanting a 6 foot 2 model guy, you are ridiculously shallow foolish and will end up miserable.

Go to this sub https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen/new

You will see what will become of you. These women are just like you, ""I'll never lower my standards"" etc.

Ten years later ""no guy even looks at me, why are all my friends leaving me behind and getting married?""

Or ""I'm tired of being used""

And remember, they started out just like you, believing that they deserved whatever they wanted whenever until life slapped them in the face.

I MUST be a virgin if I think your logic is flawed, there is no other possibility right?

&gt;My point stands: 

Pfft. 

&gt;why would any woman risk getting fucked over by a man they aren‚Äôt even attracted to. What‚Äôs the benefit of that relationship? What‚Äôs the upside?

They might not whereas if you go for the man they are most attracted to, there is basically a garauntee. And why is it binary for you? There's attractive men and there's ugly men. No in between. No so so guys, just hawt or not. Preposterous.

In reality there are average looking guys who would treat you well, instead you dismiss them purposely so that you can get pumped and dumped.

&gt;So yes, 

So? You haven't made a point. You asked me a question.

&gt;I would take an attractive nice guy over an ugly nice guy and I would take an attractive asshole over and ugly asshole. 

Again, it's not binary like that in reality. There's hot average and ugly, not just hot or ugly, that's a fallacy.

&gt;You can throw as many insults at me as you like it won‚Äôt change my stance and it won‚Äôt change the stance of many other women.

So you literally admit to being shallow, I call you shallow, and now I'm throwing insults? What's insulting about what you personally admitted? 

I'm not trying to change your stance, I'm glad shallow women like you will end up used, alone or just a single mom to a (statistically likely) criminal. I'm happy you will reap what you sew and by the time you hit thirty give you will be weeping about how you wish you would have settled down and had a family.

All I was doing was saying ""your logic makes no sense"" and you reply ""you're not going to change my mind"" it's like if you said 1+1=3 and I said ""that makes no sense logically"" and you said ""you won't change my mind""

I don't care if you change your mind your obviously just content to live without logic chasing emotions that will eventually betray you. I DO care that you're lying to other's and trying to poison other's minds. 

I never said anything about ugly men, I'm glad your shallow and think there is no average looking person, it doesn't matter to me. It does matter that what you're saying isn't factual and you speak it like it's fact.

It's like flat earthers, they are welcome to believe what they want, but if I speak with one I will point out they are wrong. I don't see how that makes me a ""virgin"" but hey we've established logic isn't your strong suit.

5769,"&gt;Who cares if a guy is naturally an asshole or his negative experiences with women made him an asshole? 

YOU DO. You are the one who claimed to know why he was doing these things. I simply pointed out you could be wrong and you respond ""who cares""? If you're aware you could possibly be incorrect, why are you pretending to know the reason?

Women make no sense.

&gt;He‚Äôs still an asshole and I will treat him accordingly.

Yes women don't have any sympathy, I know. A guy whose whole family was killed and is angry at the world deserves no more respect than a guy who is angry nobody will fuck him right?

You're a lunatic, that's the perfect example of why women are in no way shape or form the ""fairer sex""

&gt;And no, women don‚Äôt ‚Äúforce‚Äù men to act any way. Men are in control of their own actions and reactions.

Constant rejection USUALLY ends up with anger as a response. If someone is repeatedly slapping you in the face how long would it be till you got angry?

Oh never right because you're 100% in control?

Pfft! That's a joke.

&gt;How you respond to the challenges life hands you determines your character. 

And how you respond to X thing is also important. The thing they are responding to is important. A person angry you killed their dog is not the same as a person angry you wouldn't sleep with them.

But you would love to just forget WHY they are the way they are and focus on dismissing them without any attempt at understanding. And you wonder why relationships don't work and all men just cheat on you, you're a conceited person who only cares about how a person treats you and not about the person themselves.

&gt;You can react positively or negatively to any given situation. If you decide to act negatively that isn‚Äôt a woman‚Äôs problem, that‚Äôs your problem.

Apparently it is your problem since, you know, you keep getting cheated on.

&gt;You can go ask other women about their romantic relationship with ugly men if you‚Äôd like I guarantee 70% of them will tell you they had a negative experience.

I can garauntee you 70% of women are narcissistic then.

&gt;And most women would agree with me although they probably won‚Äôt word it as harshly as I did.

Yeah because women are known to be secretive.

&gt;You can cry all day about how women should just give ugly dudes a chance. 

I'm just pointing out your logic in the matter is entirely flawed.

If you don't care you're illogical then fine, but don't act like what you're saying is true.

&gt;The problem with giving chances to desperate people is if you give them an inch they‚Äôll take a mile almost every time. 

If you're a petty person who doesn't give a fuck why they are sad/angry. Their mom died? What an asshole for being angry right?

You don't even try to understand because YOU DON'T WANT TO. To admit that understanding is good would be to take on responsibility, which is female keyptonite. 

You might actually have to TRY? Fuck that just go get dicked and dumped and pretend you're happy.

5780,"&gt;Dude, I‚Äôve been treated better and like an actual human (not a sex doll) by hot guys than I have ugly guys who often put down women so they can feel a semblance of power in their pathetic lives.

First off, I love how you behave as if you can see the reasoning these people have. If an ugly guy puts you down it CAN'T POSSIBLY be anything wrong with you, it has to be that they ""need some semblance of power in their pathetic lives"" right?

Please let me know where you got your psychic powers, must be useful.

Oh and even if what you said was true, your experiences aren't universal nor are they indicative of men as a whole. You can't just say ""my experience in pretending to be a mind reader was x, therefore x is universally true.""

That's moron logic.

&gt;And yes, I‚Äôve seen guys who can‚Äôt even get one woman say if they could get multiple women like Chad then they would be a player and a womanizer too.

I don't think you understand, you've heard that happen so it must be universally true correct? Nope.

And a guy saying that is akin to saying ""I've been rejected and treated like trash by women so long it would be nice to return the favor"" again, you're putting the cart before the horse. You're saying the guy says x, but you don't care to be at all sympathetic or even consider what negative things happened to him that made him feel that way.

Instead you ASSUME that he just was always naturally an asshole. You don't consider that the girl he fell in love with treated him like trash and fucked ""Chad"" so now he thinks ""if I want the girl of my dreams that's how I must behave""

You women are forcing men to behave like this while claiming it's men's fault.

&gt;You‚Äôre a straight guy. You‚Äôve never been on the receiving end of a romantic relationship with a ugly guy or an attractive guy.

Irrelevant. Because your personal experience isn't universal.

&gt;I‚Äôve been in both. The ugly guy isn‚Äôt any better, I promise.

Again, your assuming every ugly guy is the same as every other one.

&gt;When he gets all high and mighty because he finally has a girlfriend he‚Äôll start thinking he can do better (which he can‚Äôt). 

Lmfao.

&gt;This has happened to me and this has happened to all of my friends who decided to give an ugly guy the time of day.

You've lost your fucking mind. Literally. You have gone so far that you cannot comprehend reality, you can only live in a world that you are the victim in. It CANNOT be that the girlfriends of these guys messed up somehow, nope that's ImPOssIBle. It MUST be that they just feel high and mighty from the attention.

In other words, women have no agency in their relationships, if they break up it's the man's fault period, for reasons you will determine through non existent psychic powers, which will always determine it's the worst possible most victimizing thing.

&gt;With an attractive guy you don‚Äôt have to worry about his insecurity or low self esteem. 

Again, how DARE a man have feelings!?!

&gt;Or him having a mental breakdown every time you want to go out to the club with your girls because he thinks you‚Äôll leave him for someone more attractive.

So wait, these same guys who don't give a dick anymore because they think they can do better are begging you to stay home with them? Why wouldn't they happily let you go and pursue other women? Your logic is not internally consistent.

""Ugly men with gfs just want to fuck other women, yet when I go out he just wants me home with him.""

5788,"&gt;A lot of ugly men are just assholes without options. 

Chicken and the egg much? Are they assholes with no options or assholes BECAUSE they have no options? People get really down when they are constantly degraded and humiliated. It's erroneous to ignore the cause.

&gt;If you think for a second that ugly dudes wouldn‚Äôt fuck a different woman every day of the week if they had the choice then you‚Äôre delusional.

I disagree. They would be much more appreciative. Your logic is basically ""a stuffed guy at a buffet cares just as much about food as a starving man offered a sandwich"" which is moron logic. The guy who is stuffed at the buffet (hawt guys) appreciate food (sex) far less than someone who is starving. The food isn't special to them because they have all the food they want all the time.

And even if what you said was true, they can't, therefore they won't. So by your own logic they are still the better choice unless you just want to be used. Seems like you just want to excuse your lack of self control by blaming some Boogeyman.

&gt;Not to mention ugly guys tend to be insecure and project their insecurity on their girlfriends as emotional and physiological abuse.

How dare guys who are constantly rejected have emotional hangups about it!? Abuse! How dare they feel less than when women tell them they are all the time!!! 

You see how stupid that sounds? It's not abusive to be insecure, that's just the excuse girls use to leave guys who share their feelings although every woman claims she wants a guy that does just that. Yet when they so share, it's abuse right?

Absolutely psychotic gaslighting double speak.

&gt;At the end of the day, I‚Äôd rather be cheated on by a hot guy

Why?

&gt;than an ugly dude because then I‚Äôd at least have an excuse for why he cheated and not look like a dumbass and feel humiliated for giving a ugly dude the time of day.

Why is the ugly guy worth your time less? Why are these hot guys who don't give a rats ass so much better in your eyes?

How will the ugly guy cheat with zero opportunities?

Now if only they could stop only pushing their own standards up, because of social media and the amount of possible partners / attention you get for literally just being female already, instead of actually trying to find a partner on their own level.

It's perfectly fine to think ""I know what kind of people i find attractive, i want someone with a job and who's good with dogs"" for example, nobody has an issue with that.

5839,"Because you don‚Äôt wanna talk I‚Äôll tell you all how I was date raped.

I‚Äôve never posted this on the internet before.

I worked as a bellman at a large hotel I was also the driver for. The front desk staff besides myself and two other bellmen was all girls. 

At the time I was dating the girl I have previously discussed. Her name can be Alexa for this. Her daughter will be called Amy. My coworker is Claire and my boss is Karen. 

Claire has seen me with Amy a bunch of times talks about how good of a dad I am and all that good stuff. I made a mistake of being friends with her and doing something that I have learned to stop doing. Sharing details about your relationship with someone else and not having a open and honest discussion with the person you are dating. I complained about Alexa a lot to her and when Alexa tried to kill herself and got committed to a hospital for four months I waited for her. I loved her and still do even after all the shit she did to me. 

Clair invited me to a Halloween party and my grandma had died about 2 weeks before this. I was on a bender to end all benders. I wanted to die. That night I told her I was too fucked up to drive hoping she would let it drop. Then I get a text saying a Uber is outside and to get in. I‚Äôm very awkward and don‚Äôt like to disappoint people so I get in the car anyways. I‚Äôm on over 100mg of OxyContin. I tell her this and say I don‚Äôt want to drink she gives me a coke she spiked with rum and I could tell. I get annoyed she badgers me until I start drinking. I remember asking to sleep on the couch and she wouldn‚Äôt let me because it would mess up the cushions. I have previously made it known that I love Alexa and Amy and just want to be friends. She told me to sleep in her bed and she would sleep with her roommate and she didn‚Äôt. I remember telling her to stop and her saying ‚Äúbut your little friend seems to be enjoying it this‚Äù at one point I threw up all over her and myself and she dragged me to the shower to clean me up and tried to sleep with me again. After I woke up the next day I was mortified of what happened and why she did this to me. She told me she had a crush on me for a long time and we should date. I declined and walked home (4.3 miles). Work was super awkward after that and then Karen her friend started to ask me why I won‚Äôt date her and all this nonsense. Eventually I started getting suspended by Karen a lot for things that were okay a month ago. My friends who I talked to about this said there was no way a pretty girl would rape a normal looking sorta chubby guy like myself... when I told Alexa she had a meltdown. We never slept with each other again for the last year of our relationship. I don‚Äôt make moves on girls because I once kissed a girl during a misunderstanding when I was 16 and have been scared to ever since. I never want to make anyone uncomfortable. I never want to be anyone‚Äôs mistake. Anyways the whole thing fucked me up for a while the next girl I dated I didn‚Äôt sleep with for the first 8 months of our relationship and I still don‚Äôt like getting naked in front of anyone still.

5841,"If you don‚Äôt know much about wrestling this is what happened.

Before 2016 no woman ever main event a pay per view. They got paid less than male wrestlers, also they would get devoted woman‚Äôs segments witch would be about 15 min of a three hour show and they were mostly bra and panties matches. They were called divas and everything was highly sexualized. That was awful and it‚Äôs not real wresting. Anyways AJ Lee my favorite wrestler of all time changed all of it (got the ball rolling). The wrestlers are now paid as much as the men, main event ppv‚Äôs and had their own called evolution. It was awesome. I love woman‚Äôs wrestling now. The storylines and drama and in ring action are typically better than men‚Äôs now. It use to just be all about the way a girl looked but now it‚Äôs about actual skill level.

5843,"This was always an important dating strategy in patriarchy. Ask your mom or grandmother. They will tell you to avoid men who are not generous. 

Why? It's simple. Once you are knocked up, you are immediately placed in a very vulnerable and weak position. Depending on how bad your luck is, you might have to either stop working or your earning capacity and career opportunities are greatly diminished. 

In that case, there is nothing worse than being dependent on a man who is a miser and/or financially incapable. 

Then there is the other kind who is only generous when it suits him. Other than that, he lives like he was born and raised in a barn. Pay attention because that will be your life when you marry him!

And when your children are old enough,  you will be forced to explain why you picked such a loser. 

It's best to never assume that a man will remain as generous as he is during courtship. So don't have any children you cannot personally afford. 

If women actually adhered to this, we'd see a *significant* reduction in overpopulation and absolute poverty.",whycantweallgetal0ng,2019-09-07 06:05:48,2019-09-07 06:06:00,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d0mbe3/if_you_want_to_quickly_gauge_how_a_man_feels/ezckat7/,t3_d0mbe3,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

5852,"I‚Äôm a guy and I found this sub by following mangos comments. What happened to you that is making you think this way? Who hurt you and what did he do to you seriously? I‚Äôm sorry that you have all this anger directed at one gender. I‚Äôm 30 I‚Äôve had 5 girlfriends my entire life and every single one of them has lasted a very long time. I would get made fun of by my other male roommates when picking up girls from bars because I wouldn‚Äôt ever sleep with them they would take my bed I would take the couch. I just wanted to see if I liked the girl before sleeping with her and getting to know her and maybe smoking a little weed with her. I‚Äôve been knocked out for defending a woman who was sexually harassed by multiple men at a party where she was the only girl ( me getting my ass beat by 5 guys gave her time to get out of there). I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm asexual because I‚Äôm not always thinking with my dick. 

I‚Äôve been date rapped by a woman and have been told that it was my fault  because I must have done something to make her think I wanted to sleep with her.

As a man I was in a abusive relationship for 5 years. If I attempted to break up with her she would threaten to kill herself. She set my Xbox on fire, burnt my clothes. The funny part about that is I actually wouldn‚Äôt play video games or watch sports when she was home because it‚Äôs not something we could enjoy together.I‚Äôll give you some examples though of how are relationship was.
- I ruined New Year‚Äôs Eve because I got stuck working late and came home a half hour after I said I would be.
- Every girl I was friends with was trying to sleep with me (I‚Äôm a average looking dude)
- I ‚Äúcheated‚Äù on her with weed while we were broken up (she didn‚Äôt want me doing any drugs so I cheated on her with drugs)
- She once tried to steal my cat because I love him more than her
- She had no job for multiple months and dropped out of college after breaking up with me once because she couldn‚Äôt handle the emotional toll it took on her 
- During those months I supported her and her four year old daughter paying for everything 
-  I visited my parents too much and would get shit for spending time with my family 
- My best friend is her (male) cousin, we were not allowed to hang out due to her thinking all we would do is play video games and smoke pot
- When he moved to Florida and wanted to come back I drove 18 hours to get him she was suppose to come with me broke up with me a week before the trip convinced me to get back together with her the day of the trip. She then insisted I shouldn‚Äôt go because we needed to spend time together. I went and she broke up with me again
- When we finally broke up for real she took my old roommate to a concert she had bought me tickets for (it was an attempt to get us back together) then slept with my roommate in a car and called me the next day to tell me about it 
‚Äú I love you too much and you weren‚Äôt give me enough attention so I fucked Josh in the back of his car last night at the fidlar concert I got you tickets for. Also were going to be dating now because I don‚Äôt really like him that much so he wouldn‚Äôt be able to hurt me the way you have.‚Äù 


In summary we are all not the same. My number one priority is trying to find a way to fight my depression. Number two is probably my family and my cat who is the best kitten in all the land. After that it‚Äôs my job then hopefully meeting a woman to date and start a family with because I honestly don‚Äôt want sex I want love. I want to have a special person to make memories with and watch stupid shows we both like together. Shit like that.

People are not the same, everyone is different and both genders both have the ability to be awful people. I hope you meet better people and your perspective on the world is happier. If you ever need anyone to talk to I‚Äôm a pretty good listener and as someone who‚Äôs experienced quite a bit of trauma in my life maybe we could become pen pals or something like that and have a meaningful conversation. I‚Äôm sorry that guys can be dicks sometimes I went to a all male school and saw first hand some of the things you guys have been talking about in this thread. This will probably be taken down but I hope this reaches some of you and shows we‚Äôre not all bad.",Deadmatt420,2019-09-07 05:37:28,2019-09-07 05:38:56,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/cywzhh/another_reason_to_never_feel_for_bad_ghosting_men/ezcgabp/,t1_ezb6axi,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

And as if men don‚Äôt have to give too much effort into doing their jobs and getting hired. Men have to worry about their outer appearance too when getting jobs.

A woman probably won‚Äôt get fired if she suddenly stopped wearing makeup.

5923,"I don't remember writing this post. But I can swear it's like I typed out every word of this post. 

I dated a guy for 8 years. The first 6 years, I kept a distance and he was head over heels for me and would go out of his way to do things. I would also be loving to him and give him necessary attention but also keep him at arms length. The moment I opened up he lost interest and it was just me always making plans to meet up or spend time together.

Same thing happened to my most recent relationship. Guy was super invested and chased me despite me telling him from the beginning that it wont work out. But after few months of spending time together and after seeing the effort he put in to this, I started liking him. I opened up and gave him all the love I had and boom there goes his interest! I sit and read texts he sent me during ""the chase"" and laugh at the shit that guys say to get you. 

Anyway this post is 100% true and I can tell you that it works. I am not saying that you should hold back love or affection from your partner.

5928,"I understand the replies you got might come across to you as harsh. The thing is, no objective third party reading about your situation will find themselves wishing that was them instead of you. This is the sort of post you read and feel grateful about your own relationships being so much better. Doesn't that seem like a red flag to you? Even beyond the lack of sex, there is nothing about this arrangement that seems like you're being treated right.

&gt; He made me feel amazing about myself and made me forget about my flaws. 

This is the key as to why you feel so strongly for him now. Isn't it scary that all it took is for a man to come along and tell you what you wanted to hear? What if he still perceives your flaws as flaws, he's just really good at lying? This is why the other posters said you should prioritize working on your self confidence. Your insecurities are weaknesses that leave you susceptible to settling for less than what you're worth.

Did you realize so much of your dynamic happens on his own terms? Look how he has the upper hand.

&gt; He started asking me spend the night. (Which was a big deal for him) 

By presenting it as a big deal, he made you be grateful for such a small gesture. Isn't it normal that he would want to be around you more if he's into you? 

&gt; I feared I was overstaying my welcome but he assured me I was not and reassured me that he wanted me there and that he liked my presence. 

You never need to ask for permission or reassurance. You will perceive the change the moment he stops enjoying your presence. If you don't trust yourself to do that, it's always better to be safe and err on the side of leaving him wanting for more.

&gt; We have agreed on Staying together but spending more time to ourselves. 

So he tells you when to come and he tells you when to go.

&gt; This terrifies both he and I greatly.  

Really? This clearly terrifies and preoccupies you. You're posting about it here and I bet you think about this on and off throughout the day. Do you think he's off asking for advice from anyone? Do you think he seems to be as preoccupied as you?

What issue would he take with this situation anyway? You're at his beck and call. If he wants to have sex you're there and if he doesn't you're there too. If he wants you to stay you will and if he wants you to go you'll do that too. It's win win for him. 

Objectively, your best course of action is to dump him but I know that's not what you want. If you want things between the two of you to improve, you'll have to work on gaining some of your power back. If you lose this thing it won't be because of your sex life or lackthereof. It'll be because you made yourself too available and thus uninteresting to him.",madandunabashed,2019-09-09 07:22:58,2019-09-09 07:23:09,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d1hlg5/i_dont_know_how_to_feel_about_this/eznyxhb/,t3_d1hlg5,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

In the past, women were expected to stay at home and take care of the family. So part of the courtship process, was the man showing that he is willing and able to take care of a future family by paying for meals and such while courting you.

A lot of that now sounds completely outdated.. and yet it still isn't. Many young women *still* marry and end up staying at home because it's the most affordable option for the family. And then when you are faced with a man who is a miser and considers you subhuman for not working and makes you beg for money, then you realize that mom may have had a point.

5971,"This is super interesting to hear, and I can see that obviously there‚Äôs truth to it because it works.  But I wonder what else is going on.


Would you take it as far as marrying someone who you are fully aware loves you because you remain emotionally unavailable? What about when kids are involved? Do you then love the children more than the husband and if so what is keeping him committed to you?

Or do you think there‚Äôs something more at play here,  perhaps your emotional unavailability comes off as confidence to men? And they‚Äôre attracted to a woman who knows her inherent worthiness.  Worthy of the best partner etc.

I have seen the incredible power I have, (and other women have) when I truly understand my worth and live from a place of truly knowing that to be in a relationship with me is a privilege. Not from ego, or conceit, but because I respect myself and my needs and I want to be and have the best relationship that I can.  

Bitch, doesn‚Äôt play into what I am a demand for in my relationship with my significant other (although of course it comes out sideways sometimes as I‚Äôm human).  I want to be known for who I am, heart-open, and loved and accepted by my partner.

5984,"Now I understand why the men are giving her this advice, as well as some of the women as well (since this advice can actually ring true for women since we, for our own safety and just in general need time to feel out what a man‚Äôs real intentions are since women are far less likely to lie about just wanting sex since they know men won‚Äôt turn them down, vice versa isn‚Äôt true.) However, the women are making the mistake of thinking that men generally think of LTR in the same way as women do, as is the case with the women giving the ‚Äúbenefit of the doubt, he doesn‚Äôt just want sex‚Äù advice.

I‚Äôve said it in the thread and I‚Äôll say it again. The guy who fed OP this line is using a LTR as a carrot on the stick; he‚Äôs manipulating her by pretending to think of LTR the way that women do. Its easy to see why men are telling her to give him the age old ‚Äúbenefit of the doubt‚Äù, since women becoming keen to what this really means would mean that men wouldn‚Äôt be able to use that catchphrase to ease a woman into giving him sex for the non-existent promise of a relationship in the future.

Men are not like women in how they think of LTR. While women need time to feel out a man‚Äôs true intentions since we have something to lose if we get used for sex while men don‚Äôt (sex is what they want and society never uses the phrase ‚Äúhe got used for sex‚Äù since women don‚Äôt need to manipulate men to get men to open their legs in the first place), men are hard wired to chase and protect what‚Äôs theirs.

Unlike prostitutes, women actually vet who they let pleasure them based on personality, compatibility and charisma. Prostitutes are the ones who sell their bodies to the highest bidder.

Within the first meeting you already showed him that you barrier to entry for men who want to have access to you and your body romantically is extremely low. This gave him the clear signal that you're DTF, since a woman who wants a relationship, if she's playing her cards right, won't give too much of herself too soon. It's bad form. Also: you put far more romantic emphasis on this kiss than he is. While we as women tend to view kisses as romantic and swooning and ahhh, considering the fact that you guys weren't on a date but at a friend's house, he saw this as you offering him sex. Also, you said you two ended up doing a ""bit more"". If that means BJ/HJ, at your friend's house, first time meeting each other, *and* want a relatioship to blossom from that? Nonononono.

Of course he is, he just got a HJ/BJ. You viewed what you guys did as intimacy while he just views it as casual sex. You are making the mistake of thinking that men think of sex the same way that women do; he knows this, and knew you would interpret ""how happy he was to have met me"" as him being happy to have met you as a person.

&gt; Next day I texted to check up on him

He knew you were more invested than he was at this point. Texted super soon and first.

&gt; last night he asked me to go over to his place.

Get used to doing nothing but Netflix and chill because how a man treats you at the beginning is when he's on his best behavior. I'm sure you were hoping for him to ask you on a real date but you gave into meeting this player at his house, showing him that your standards are very low and that you will accept being treated however. This was also a clear booty call and I'm sure you knew that. This would be ok if it wasn't for you having feelings. This was the time to put your foot down and tell him you're not a hang out at home and chill in bed kind of girl. A real date at a public place where he has to put in effort and treat you or nothing at all.

&gt; ended up having crazy/intense sex (which I somehow initiated) Connection was amazing. 

I'm sure it was; you have feelings for him which made everything feel so much more amazing. Glad he seems to have made an effort in bed.

&gt; We texted a bit more today but I initiated the conversation since he asked me to remind him about an important task today and that‚Äôs how the conversation started

Nonononono. 1. You texted him first after sex. You showed him that you are far more invested than he is. Game over. A man should make the effort, take the initiative of hitting *you* up after such an intimate act. I'm sorry but do it the other way around and this exact scenario happens: he knows you're in the palm of his hand. 

2. He asked you to text you to remind him of that thing as a test. He wanted to test exactly how invested you were in him and how much he could get out of you just by seeing if you would put in the effort to not only remember this thing but take it upon yourself to remind him as if you're a reminder in Google Calendar. He also asked you to do this so you would feel pressured to be the one to text first after having sex, taking that responsibility off of him and further cementing your invest in him since you would just justify it by saying ""should i really text him first again.....nah, he *asked* me to remind him!"". so this trick was two-fold.

&gt; I know for a fact that he‚Äôs not a texter because common friends have told me that

The only way to test this out would be to see if he texts you first as often as you do to him.

&gt; I also know he just got out of a long term relationship

He's more than likely emotionally unavailbe and made this clear to you so he can cover his own ass when you get super deep feelings and demand answers for why he won't commit, because he can just say ""well you *knew* I was recovering from a LTR"".

&gt; On another note he expresses interest when we are together and is very sweet.

This is very deceiving. This guy got laid easily and quickly after meeting you. It's in his best interests to be sweet and feign romantic interest lest this guaranteed sex stop.

&gt; He also says stuff about future plans like for example traveling to his hometown together

This is a carrot on a stick. He's filling your head up with fantasies of things that he knows will never happen. Pretending to pursue a relationship down the line is one of the most common long-cons that men use. What better way to get investment, companionship, and nonstop sex from a woman than to pretend to think like one? 

&gt;  I am also a very honest person so holding myself from asking him is something that takes energy

Girl I know someone asking you to hold back from not being all over the person you adore sounds like someone asking you to hold your breath for an hour. You were honest, you showed your hand, so he knew exactly which game to play to get what he wanted. Men use different strategies depending on what a woman wants/the persona she puts up. She wants a relationship? Pretend to really like her too while getting by with putting in minimum effort, as he's done. She has sex early? Tell her you don't understand why society puts down women for having casual sex and that he doesn't think any less of you for it. Gas her up.

You say ""ask him"". What do you want to ask him?",RussianAsshole,2019-09-10 05:03:19,2019-09-10 05:03:21,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d1y5il/hooked/ezshh0k/,t3_d1y5il,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

Funny enough, the ones that insist that they're giving me some kind of ""equality"" by splitting half the bill tend to be bad matches in so many other ways - really insecure, obviously reading some kind of redpill material, extraordinarily cheap.

The Male Utopia will be split into 4 different areas to accommodate MGTOW needs

Area 1 will be known as Mansplainville,  Area 2, Gamergate city,  Area 3, Lonely masturbation harbour 

Area 4. is the capital, Dudey town

 Facilities will include, in no particular order of wank

1. Monasteries for the incoming monks

2. Hermit caves

3. A wailing wall

4 A priest Hole

5. A cul de sac

6. Sorry But No.6 has been cancelled there will be no Gene Pool

7. A Jim with a football

8. A Cinema, showing just one film, the red pill

9.A none internet cafe as no internet connection will be required, no porn will be required because the island is a male utopia and no images of female are required as females are non existent in a male utopia and any images of females would only be a distraction to mgtow who need to fully focus on their male cause

6080,"This is very interested to me. This is not even about gold digging (I'm not a gold digger and never was nor appreciate that lifestyle) but the thing is this is how it works no matter how men complain how unfair it is. The same men that complain about paying a dinner to a woman are like you say the ones who either don't have money or the ones that are all ""MGTOW"" until they find a girl they really feel attracted to and want to impress and then they won't even bat an eye to impress her with a nice date paid by them. I have my own money and earn good, but the truth of the matter is that despite not needing that men pay me, the reality is that the men that didn't offer to pay the first day were the ones that weren't that into me. It never evolved to a relationship or they never showed much interest.

We can talk about how unfair/fair it is, but this is the truth and what happens in reality. And I'm not even talking about expensive dates but a man who wants to go dutch with you or that will only pay for his share on the first dates where men usually put the effort to impress the woman they want...? No. I also don't feel interest from a man when they don't make an effort to take the initiative to come up with the date and just uninterestely be like ""I don't know, you pick"".

6107,"I didn‚Äôt miss your point I was using an analogy. Why would you go out with someone and not have the funds to pay for yourself.? This line of thinking fails if neither one of you have the money to cover the bill and tip.

As if you know anything I‚Äôve been through.. equality happened when we treat each other equally. Like a certain Dr. that we celebrate in January mentions.

Men are taught to hide their emotions at a young age, therefor, have a hard time opening up to people around them. Men usually spend less time with their children if they are the ‚Äúbreadwinners‚Äù you ever so want them to be; they won‚Äôt have a lot of time to see their children if they‚Äôre working 80+ hours a week. Same can be said about chores. Sex education can be taught better I agree, however I don‚Äôt think parents would enjoy JOI in classes. Or better yet, communicate with the man you pleasure you better so you can have an equal amount of orgasms.

That last argument is literally used from incles and MGTOW to discredit and hate women. Their are men out there genuinely looking for a potential partner and they read or see shit like this, it scares them into actually interacting with women.

6108,"Lol. Men don‚Äôt have a problem asking for sex so why shouldn‚Äôt we ask for something that also benefits us? Going out with a friend is not going out on a date. I‚Äôm not gonna consider a relationship with my friends. Nice purposely missing the point.

And yes....it does. A man who truly values the woman he‚Äôs with would never want to embarrass himself by offering to split. The real world doesn‚Äôt care about your feelings. If he‚Äôs broke or has money issues, he doesn‚Äôt need to be dating and asking a woman to struggle with him. Struggle love is bullshit and is a scam to get women to give their emotional labor and time for scraps. He needs to be getting his coins up in that case. Women can‚Äôt admit certain things to men either because we know they would ghost, so what‚Äôs the difference?

6178,"Male speaking.

You girls are right that demand is on your side, and once you got the mindset to, nothing prevents you to use it to your advantage like explained here, it's actually smart to do it.

I would like to share my thoughts about it, i'll may be downvoted for commenting but whatever, i'll only share my mind and feelings.

I'm less than 30yo, quite successful in life for work and stuff, less for dating but when looking actively, was always able to find a partner. I got tired of it because of all the games, and this only gives me more confirmation that staying alone will make me more happy than finding someone.
I want to feel loved, i want to feel special to someone, like you all i guess. If i'm always competing with someone, or have to share my SO, it is not worth to me. 

I did shit with girls in the past, but learned from it and trying to improve, i'm now a lot more selective with the person i'm looking for, because the shit i did was partly because i was with the person for wrong reasons and i now know it.
If i find that person, i'm looking for comitment, to feel loved and special. If i don't get it, then rather be happy alone.

I say that, because when men and women will learn from all the societal changes that are going on atm, the evolution of the relations between genders, i feel like many more men will get to the same conclusions, and the ones left will be either too dumb to understand, or enough successful to not need to be commited to a girl, because he is a ""high-demand"" male.

1. **Keep your options open, always.** Instead of women desperately pursuing a relationship with a single male, you maintain several which are beneficial to you in different ways. Although, at this stage, you shouldn‚Äôt allow sexual access.
2. **Go on dates where you‚Äôre likely to encounter a lot of male mate competion.** Sporting events are at the top of the list, but this can be any event or activity where men are likely to be ‚Äúpeacocking‚Äù for females and posturing for other men.
3. **Sexual Access is reserved for the male or males who have demonstrated good character and significant investment.** There is no need to abide by an artificial 90 day timeline. You withhold sexual access until you can safely assure the encounter will be to your tangible benefit.
4. **Monogamy is for marriage.** Unless a man expresses an explicit desire for marriage, with a timeline in mind, you should not be monogamous. Again, monogamy benefits men, not women.

You‚Äôll know you‚Äôre successfully triggering the mate-guarding instinct if the man or men begin to demonstrate ‚Äúsequestering‚Äù behavior.

6218,"I met my ex husband at age 28 and was married for a decade and had two kids. All my relationships with men have been a disaster, and I‚Äôve seen my pushover friends let their husbands walk all over them only to get divorced, cheated on and their self esteems wrecked by men. I don‚Äôt like most men. But I know there are good ones out there. I hope and believe I finally met one. I‚Äôm 45 now. I had my first boyfriend at age 15. I can‚Äôt think of a single healthy or whole man I‚Äôve ever been with. 

I finally decided to be alone, and I was totally 100% content with that decision. For the first time, I wished I could be gay but I‚Äôm just not. I met a man recently. I‚Äôm pretty scared. It seems to be going along really well, we‚Äôve seen each other 5x now and haven‚Äôt had sex. It‚Äôs just been innocent, I feel like I‚Äôm being courted in a way even my ex husband never did. That said, if this guy isn‚Äôt the one, I‚Äôm either going to be single or end up with a woman because 30+ years of broken men would just be my breaking point. 
What do I want from a man, a reflection of who I am today - certainly a 180 degree different woman than I was all those years I let men have their way with me, cut me down, abandon me, and abuse me in every way possible. 

Just make sure you are strong and wise enough to know the truth about men before you put yourself out there. Unfortunately I had to go through a lot of suffering to know what I wanted from a man. Now I know it‚Äôs just to compliment who I am today, a companion who is like-minded who I can have fun with and be young with again, and erase and forget all the pain of my past. Money helps, it is not the deciding factor for me. At all. Finding a man with values, morals and integrity will save you a great deal of suffering. Take your time in figuring out of they possess these things. Things are not always what they seem in the early months. 

Ultimately, you have to know yourself to know what you want in another. Visualize him too, that helps. Make a list of traits you want in a man. Simply put, I wanted chemistry, emotional/physical and intellectual attraction, and someone who had some money, since I don‚Äôt make a lot, and someone who was positive, could make me laugh, and possessed a sensitivity chip. I just sold myself so short all my life. I wanted this now or nothing. And I *think* I got him after 30 years of hell with men. If the way he hugged and kissed me goodnight tonight was any indication of his feelings towards me.

We were in different degree programs but we both value using our brains and thinking philosophically, care about education and stability, growing ourselves and our futures, creating a firm foundation for as our family unfolds. Obviously we first started dating due to shared interests: research and scholarship, a love of the outdoors, and we had the same religious background and so we bonded over that, although we didn't start really converging on our beliefs until later in our relationship. At least in my life, I think that every married couple I know met in grad school or continued dating while one of them was a grad student and the other was building something important to them. So I'd say pursue an education so you have interesting pursuits to bond over, and work at something that brings meaning to your life.

6235,"For whatever reason this sub popped up in that whole recommended subs thing for me.  Not sure why.  Is this like a female red pill or something? That's so surreal.  I don't even like trp people.  


I'm clearly in violation of your #1 rule.  Anyway, since I'm gonna get my post removed and blocked from this sub anyway, I've decided to indulge my insanity and ask a few questions:  


1) It's perfectly fine to keep your options open.  Not sure why people just jump into relationships.  Agree, except on the whole sexual access thing.  This would probably go against the whole 'female dating strategy' thing, though, so I can understand where you're coming from.  Is sex like some sort of bargaining chip?  I stop seeing women if we haven't had sex after like 5 dates (if I REALLY like the girl).  I just assume our values don't really match up, or she doesn't like me that much.  


2) Not really sure what this is supposed to accomplish?  Sure, guys get jealous and engage in mate guarding behavior, but this isn't a universal truth or something.  I've gone on dates to places like bars, concerts, football games.  Sure, there are a lot of dudes around, but they're strictly non-threatening.  I'll intentionally let people into the interaction just to see what they're working with.  It's entertaining.  Sure, this has sometimes backfired and I've gotten my date taken from right under my nose (a single time in the last 6 months).  However, I can appreciate a game well played and events like that just get me more interested in improving myself.  So I'd never mate guard.  I find ""female hypergamy"" or whatever to be a great motivating tool to always be the best version of myself.  


3) Ah, I completely agree, though sex seems to be used as a bargaining chip here as well.  Wouldn't this sort of attitude towards sex lead to more heartbreak than anything?  


4) I don't get this one.  Is a guy supposed to propose to a woman without knowing she can be faithful?  Even then, marriage isn't really a guarantee for commitment, it's just a legal contract that people break all the time.  Why get married and be monogamous at all?",TheManWithThreePlans,2019-09-14 04:26:16,2019-09-14 04:26:27,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d2lg9t/girl_game_pt_1_males_monogamy_and_mateguarding/f06d2xq/,t3_d2lg9t,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

Women can barely seperate their emotions from sex and end up pushing for commitment but end up dieing abit more inside when the guy runs the other way.

Sex is more mechanical for men. But if the woman is good he will commit to her. Thats probably a part of guys have trouble understanding.

A woman with a 100+plus notch count may be ready to make babies but she will 100% not be a good wife. And most certainly will try to avoid the question of topic of how many guys shes slept with if ever brough up. Because she knows its a turn off to men.

6299,"I think this post should be retiteld: 'How to Land a Desperate Beta Male Who You Will Hate"". 

First, can we all agree that the modern day value of pussy is at rock bottom levels? We're talking fire sale pussy prices. It's nuts. Which kind of upends rule number 1 and 3 - if high status guys dont follow your commitment expectations, and instead just angle for a pump and dump (or else NEXT), then following rules 1+3 implies you'll just be surrounded by a bunch of low quality desperate orbiters. Sounds... awesome.

Furthermore - how are you determining 'good character and significant investment'? Sounds like you're describing a boring guy who is completely without options. The high value guys aren't interested in 'significant investment' and have zero need to make that kind of down payment - its literally raining pussy for them.

6310,"You don't. in your 20s. Literally live it up and focus on ""having fun"". Let THEM worry about getting you to commit to dating and seeing them only and exclusively. You don't worry about marriage until about 27 or 28. By then, you'll have plenty of time to find someone, you'll also have the experience of knowing what bullshit to avoid, and when to cut loose and RUN (not walk) from a man. 

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE THAT LOW-EXPERIENCE WOMEN MAKE IN THEIR 20S AND TEENS!!!! Demanding commitment, smothering him, obsessing over him and being ""needy"". Have you ever witnessed a friend of yours get obsessed over a guy and he didn't give a single fuck about her?? That's because the girl he IS giving a fuck about, isn't responding to him, and is ignoring him. He's focused on that one. I SWEAR BY THIS METHOD, it has worked for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

YOU are the prize. A young 20 something woman is the most desirable creature in the WORLD. Most men are attracted to you. You have to make them compete for you. What you should do, which is counter-intuitive to red-pill female ideology is date multiple men at the same time and don't commit to a single one. Make them wine and dine you. If they ghost, you ghost even longer. You make them pay for your meals and then you leave them with blue balls. If you NEED to have sex or you'll die, get on tinder and literally fuck the most handsome one. Use protection. 

&amp;#x200B;

Literally be on Tinder. Date 4 or 5 at the same time. This will help you get the attention you want and you won't feel the need to incessantly message or focus on one or two of them. Once they see that you're not worried about them, that they might lose you, that's when they commit. Seriously. Go lurk on the r/breakup subreddits. 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of men poo hoo hoo because the girl they refused to escalate a relationship with, chose someone else. Some of these men are stuck on their exes for years. Some of them move on to subsequent relationships and then hit a depression when they find out an ex got married or had a child. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also STRONGLY STRONGLY recommend that you pay the $15?? bucks to buy/download/and read the ""Why men marry some women and not others"" book. It literally spells out for you exactly when to leave a man and exactly which red flags should be deal breakers for you.

6325,"Brown was driving a vehicle with Robyn F. as the front passenger on an unknown street in Los Angeles. Robyn F. picked up Brown's cellular phone and observed a three-page text message from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with.

A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.

Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.

Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the sh-- out of you when we get home! You wait and see!'

The detective said ""Robyn F."" then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer.

Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.'

After Robyn F. faked the call, Brown looked at her and stated, 'You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I'm really going to kill you!'

Brown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in [an] attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown.

Brown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand, causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps (sic) that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand.

Robyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.

Brown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular telephone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand.

Brown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of 333 North June Street and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it.

Brown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F.'s left and right carotid arteries, causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness.

She reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gouge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown's body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet, causing several contusions.

Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response.

There is a HUGE reason to justify this that hasn't been mentioned: women live longer. Full stop. I watched my mother widowed at the age of 42. Her entire life fell apart and she had virtually zero relationships, either friends or more than friends. The lack of emotional support and companionship did her no favors. I can't stress this enough.  Men have been arranging ""harems"" for centuries. There is no reason a woman shouldn't do the same and refuse to put all her eggs into a basket that's guaranteed to fail her.

6377,"  ***Preparing yourself emotionally/Building self-love:*** Before you are able to love someone else, you need to love yourself. Self-love is a term that has been tossed around so much more lately, so what exactly is self-love, and why is it important to living well? It influences who you date, how you function at work, and how you deal with the problems in your life. 

A simple definition of self-love is that it is a state of appreciation for yourself that grows from the actions that you take to support your physical, psychological and spiritual growth. When you act in ways that grow your love and appreciation for yourself, you learn to accept your strengths and weaknesses, have less need to explain away your shortcomings, and you develop compassion for yourself as a human being struggling to find personal meaning. Self-love also means that you are more centered in your life purpose and values.",worthij,2019-09-15 17:33:34,2019-09-15 17:33:45,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d4m2p3/hi_im_19_ive_never_been_in_a_relationship_before/f0ei7a9/,t3_d4m2p3,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

6392,"Well. I hooked up with a short ripped guy for a while and his height had nothing to do with why I ended it. He was around my height, maybe a couple inches taller? 

But yeah most women want a dude their height or taller. Lucky for dudes women average like 5‚Äô3 with many above AND below that height. Don‚Äôt act like there aren‚Äôt a ton of 5‚Äô0-5‚Äô4 women out there you could go for.

Also, miss me with this whining. At one point I was 165 lbs and men‚Äôs interest in me plummeted.  Many women suffer from weight issues that they can‚Äôt mentally control (without surgeries, which many can‚Äôt afford) and boom! Invisible to all men. For the women whose weight gets REALLY out fo control there‚Äôs no ‚Äúwell you can lose weight, I can‚Äôt get taller‚Äù argument because even if they do they have tons of lbs of skin hanging off them and will still be considered unattractive to men without several rounds of plastic surgery ($$$$$$) and maybe not even then. 

I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones who doesn‚Äôt actually suffer from a literal eating disorder so I just lost the weight and it was back to business as usual.

as for the 5''7 thing- also not an unreasonable expectation.

the mean [height for men](https://tall.life/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/New-height-distribution-with-legend.jpg) is 5''10- there are a shit tonne of guys within this height range. OP could only date 5''10 guys for the rest of her life and die before she dates all of them.

there's nothing shallow about not wanting to date broke men. If i earn money and work hard, i want my partner to do the same too because that's something i value. being broke also has other implications about character and work ethic which are important in dating.

He's using you as another social media platform - a blog. Posting pics to your wall for Likes. You're meant to give him enthusiastic pats on the head. ""How you doing"" is ""entertain me, tell me something interesting"", implying he has lost interest, and *needs* something from you to regain his interest.

If he's still a rescuer, if he only gets thrills and validation from being useful and saving a woman, and has done no work beyond recognizing it and saying ""he won't do that anymore"", but he's still feeling the feels from whatever happened in his childhood, he isn't fixed. He's simply not excited by your independent self who doesn't need him. So he's forcing you to GIVE him attention to keep his interest. He hasn't worked out how to exist in a relationship without an unhealthy validation method (rescuing or attention seeking)

6544,"NO. We advocate for women learning how to navigate the dating world with their own best interests in mind. We share posts of women successfully doing those things that help them towards finding romantic success, and help steer them away from time wasters, or at least, we arm them to know when their time is wasted so they're not devastated when a time waster well... wastes their time.

We teach women to take no shit, from any man and to find self-esteem and learn their options. We outline and highlight male depravity, male deception, and counteract male dating strategy.

6561,"Careful.... familiarizing yourself with TheRedPill has unintended side effects like: realizing men aren‚Äôt out to control, destroy, or otherwise harm your ability to have the same rights as them, the undesired affect of seeing how backward the left is (BOYS can DESTROY girls sports-just because they self identify as a girl- way to go feminist- you tossed the baby out with the bathwater)... speaking of babies... you‚Äôll realized, abortions are an archaic practice completely unnecessary today, since there are SO many FREE contraceptions available from your favorite women‚Äôs ‚Äúhealth‚Äù center, Planned Parenthood.... you might find out that men want you to have some class and not sleep with all of them... sleeping with them on the first date doesn‚Äôt look good, taking you off their ‚Äúcould marry‚Äù list and completely into their ‚Äúeasy booty‚Äù list- meaning they won‚Äôt say no, they‚Äôll just put you into their ‚Äúrotation‚Äù.... men typically prefer someone they kinda have to work to get.... that‚Äôs why the creeps won‚Äôt go away but the ones you want take off.... hmmmm, imagine that! You‚Äôll realize that the majority of craziness comes from the bastardization of family units.... two parent households aren‚Äôt the enemy- reliance on the government is! You might also learn that our Constitution is under attack and even though you don‚Äôt feel that people who have a differing opinion to you have a right to see, feel, or express their opinion freely; you might learn that they want you to have a differing opinion even if it doesn‚Äôt align with theirs. They don‚Äôt mind that you believe what you believe- they just want you to respect their rights to believe what they want. You‚Äôd learn the red pill community may make fun of your foreign views- but, they won‚Äôt dispute your right to have those views. You‚Äôll learn the red pill isn‚Äôt as scary as your mainstream media have made it sound. It‚Äôs that the basic principles that  make our great Republic great, the very things that allow you do believe and act crazy only work when the rules are blindly upheld. The Republic that protects your foreign opinions, that allow you to chose your life‚Äôs path are only able to exist because theredpill community believes you have a right to have your opinions, otherwise our guns would come out, you‚Äôd be imprisoned as enemy combatants since your socialist and communist ideology are incompatible with the very fabric of our country‚Äôs establishment. If you familiarized yourself with theredpill community, you‚Äôd realize, there a so many more guns than you can comprehend all around you, all the time, YET none have harmed you.  You might learn that guns aren‚Äôt scary, they‚Äôre empowering. You‚Äôd learn that your leftist views are harmful to the majority of our country. In rural areas there aren‚Äôt police a block or two away- a gun can be the difference between you living or you dying, you can‚Äôt call a cop if a bear roams onto your land in the middle of a 200+ acre farm. Living where the cops can take 15-20 minutes to get to you (at best) means you‚Äôve just condemned that person to death- with your misguided, anti-gun rhetoric. You‚Äôd be surprised how many people live far away from the police. You might learn that those crazies in the city who you‚Äôre afraid would shoot you, might think twice if they thought everyone around them had the potential to be carrying a firearm. You‚Äôd learn that you shouldn‚Äôt fear and ban, but understand and empower yourself. You wouldn‚Äôt fear cops violence on you, since you‚Äôre able to equally defend yourself from them. You might learn that the world isn‚Äôt such a scary place when you‚Äôre empowered and confident in your own abilities to protect yourself and your loved ones. You wouldn‚Äôt fear big guns like ‚ÄúAR-15‚Äùs or assault weapons since you‚Äôd try one out at the range and decide you like how it handles,  you‚Äôd make the connection that you‚Äôd need that weapon since the left wants to remove all of your rights and should their tyrannical candidate become president- the government is coming for them.... even though you‚Äôre a law abiding citizen, with no record, or no documented history of mental illness (lucky for you physiologist are usually leftist and don‚Äôt have feminism as a mental illness- yet-because yes that could change).... the government has big guns, a small firearm is nothing compared to those big scary guns, you‚Äôd be out gunned and that‚Äôs not fair.... wait.... you‚Äôll learn you‚Äôre getting angry over the government coming to take your lawfully obtained weapon simply because someone else doesn‚Äôt like it. Slowly you realize, your opinions no longer align with the left. You feel empowered by your own womanhood and your bitchin‚Äô AK-47.... just to find out, you‚Äôre on their list of potential problems, because you flipped on the degenerate home wrecking tinder date that stole your gender non-binary ‚Äúthemfriend‚Äù who happens to feel like a wet paper box and it‚Äôs against the law to discriminatively not want to engage in a shared relationship with your ‚Äúthemfriend‚Äù because you know the wet paper box has the herpes and you‚Äôd rather not partake in that flavor of ‚Äúfun‚Äù.... The wet paper box maliciously reports you to the FBI and the news is reporting you‚Äôre a crazy right wing conspiracy theorist fixated on your lord and savior Alex Jones.... even though you HATE Alex Jones! Suddenly, everybody you know is saying you‚Äôve always been a bit unstable and had a period of depression that put you on the Prozac. You‚Äôll learn no matter what you do you‚Äôll always be wrong, to someone, somewhere....  as the FBI call into you, to have you come out with your hands up, you thank God you‚Äôre in America and that you listened to some ridiculous subreddit about why you should acquaint yourself with theredpill.... since only then will you understand that there are some of us out there defending the Constitution.... unfortunately for you, the only real fear you now have is regarding your jury. Will there be one red pulled person there? Will there be someone with the sense to say, they may not believe with you on your ideology but they will do the right thing-even when they don‚Äôt want to.... will your ideology have you swept into a newly established gulag that the person you voted for pushed for and wrote the legislation on. At some point you‚Äôll realize how authoritarian the feminist are, how the left is. How they only seem to care about more and more control over everybody‚Äôs thoughts, minds, lives. At some point you‚Äôll learn there‚Äôs a difference between their flavor of feminism and women who want equality for everybody. You‚Äôll realize familiarizing yourself with theredpill gave you more confidence, removed your feelings of not belonging, empowered you, clarified many things to you. You‚Äôll understand that familiarizing yourself with theredpill didn‚Äôt harm you, it helped. You‚Äôll realized that bit of spiteful advice made to make you standoffish, angry, and crazy, has made you standoffish and angry at them for lying to you. You‚Äôd be very surprised how the tables have turned.

We all need to be able to recognize this type of toxic behavior. 

Some tips:

Be aware of backhanded compliments, lying and criticizing in any way ( no guy should feel the right to do this to any of us) . There is no GOOD reason.

There needs to be No name-calling whatsoever. This is a Deal breaker like YESTERDAY.

There should be no shady behavior from him with his cell phone. This is a part you can observe while spending time with them. If they are fucking around with other girls it's impossible not to notice this.

There are more but the main thing to remember here is:  PAY ATTENTION HOW THE GUY MAKES YOU FEEL. Trust your instinct. Your initial feelings are on point here.  And, don't rationalize his behavior because he is  nice to the old lady down the street. Or just because he was nice to you today or a week  ago.",Miss904,2019-09-21 15:30:20,2019-09-21 15:30:22,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d77lp9/beaware_of_these_tactics/f0yvs39/,t3_d77lp9,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

The truth is that there is nothing that will keep a guy from a woman he wants and those excuses are just that: excuses.

I advocate practicing cutting men off so that it becomes easier in a situation where your emotions are high. Practice involves accepting dates from those men with whom you know it wont work, but you otherwise think are safe people. During the date practice your conversation on him to see what does and what doesn't get men interested (this is useful feedback on what qualities you have that are pulling men in) and at the end of the date practice the cut off text message that it wont work for you. Once you've cut off a dozen men or so, you will be bolstered for when you need to do it, and it is more emotionally fraught.",RicochetChez,2019-09-23 13:52:50,2019-09-23 13:55:21,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d7xxds/cutting_men_off_an_underrated_strategy/f17q9gh/,t3_d7xxds,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

If you're young, this is a particularly good way to spend some free Saturdays.",RicochetChez,2019-09-23 13:41:59,2019-09-23 13:44:03,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d25s73/what_are_some_red_flags_that_hes_not_worth_your/f17ooad/,t1_f12pwar,FemaleDatingStrategy,1
6684,"The assumptions are all yours.

This is a forum for advice for women in dating. The counter-party will therefore be men. It's not that men value things differently when presented under differing conditions, it's that humans do. Men are humans.

My background is consulting. I have no idea what chimpanzees do. The famous example of selling a piece a jewelry that the business is having trouble moving is not to mark it on sale; it's to raise the price and surround it by pieces that are unavailable or not suitable for your target market. This is a very simple example in the many many example of pricing strategy. That's all I did with my friend.

His value is irrelevant to me or the forum because my friend has indicated she is interested. I am not here to question her interest. This is a forum to help women like her... not debate his value or concern ourselves with his equality.

&amp;#x200B;

To the ladies who might read this: men absolutely appreciate your ability to initiate. If someone came over your house and dropped off a suitcase of money you would appreciate it too. If that person came back 3 years later and demanded your first-born child in exchange for said-suitcase that you've already spent, you would rightfully scoff that no such arrangement has been made. Stop concerning yourself with what men appreciate and position yourself so that you are protected and placed at an advantage. No one is going to do it for you; and clearly the moral police has clutched their pearls at one of my least-devious schemes.",RicochetChez,2019-09-23 13:35:13,2019-09-23 13:36:47,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d2lg9t/girl_game_pt_1_males_monogamy_and_mateguarding/f17nrh2/,t1_f16s39e,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

I've read it several times. 

&gt;she just came out of a breakup. So she doesn't want to be single

Wait, what? You're assuming someone coming right out of  a breakup *doesn't* want to be single? Most people like to take breaks in between relationships. And just because she wanted to be in a relationship with *that* guy doesn't mean she wants to be in a relationship just for the sake of being in a relationship. 

&gt;And she's on tinder looking for dates, not sex. What does that tell us?

She seems to be looking for dates *and* sex. I'm not sure what makes you think she's not looking for sex. Maybe she feels safer meeting in public and maybe enjoys going on dates.

I was a late bloomer, I was kinda dumb kid, I listened everything my parents told me, they were hard catholc and made me feel ashamed of my sexuality. Let me tell you that dating for men isnt easy either. Its harder as fuck, than for women. Stakes are different, I do agree on that one. But to be ""sucessfull"" you need to be at least average looking, have to have style to look, have to know how to smalltalk and be smart to have meaningfull converstions, you have to be responsible to have serious talks. You need to have some goal in life, so you are going somewhere, planing something. You need to know how to have fun, and when to be serious. You need to be friendly if you want her friend to like you too.

Do you think all of that came to him from some stupid forum post? Bullshit. He talks what he imagines he is, not what he is actually.

There is lots of psychopathic behaviour pattern that are there to MANIPULATE men into liking them and it has become a norm. Men don't usually have this kind of information on how to attract the woman, specially if they are raised in a feministic environment. It's really hard to separate facts from bullshit.      
Most pickup gurus talk about self confidence and how to BE that man woman likes. Not how to trick them but how to become that man who is naturally attracting woman. I think it's a good thing for men to read and gain knowledge on how to become more self confident! They preach on going to the gym (instead of plastic surgery). They preach to face your fears (instead of makeup). They preach to threat woman with respect they deserve. They preach on being honest with themselves and others.

And do you think a women who has slept with 50-100 guys should be less valued then a women who has slept with 5-10? Or would you all just like to live with other women and have men around only for sex? That is what these comments sound like to me. Sounds like segragation would be best. And that interaction between the sex's is just for sex and resources and not much companionship. Sorry your views seem short sighted and slutty whether you are a male or female dating in this manner. You are playing it like a game and there are winners and looseres.

6932,"Yep and there is no real evidence that a child is better off with a father and a mother to raise them. What makes you think a man you are together with would want to help use his resources for children who are not theirs? Some men will and that is admirable under certain circumstances. So you are saying you have a child from a donor and you find a male partner you would not take any of his resources either money or time to help raise your donor child? And that if you did get married and it did not work out, you would not ask for any alimony or child support? So tell me the upside please? Is this just because you really dislike men and think they are all bad. Or do you just want to use men for sexual gratification and have dozens of partners? By the way just to let you know I have been with my wife for 31 years, we have 2 kids and we have never cheated on each other. Oh and we still have that sexual spark I read people talk about. No it has not gone away. It may ebb and flow according to how busy we are or due to menopause for my wife. We are in our 50's. Not bragging by the way. I know many couples like us. So I guess I just don't understand the younger generation. Either gender by the way.  I also do not believe you can compare us to apes and primates. You may believe we are on the same level I do not.

Only difference is historically women didn't have many opportunities. 
Also acting like obesity is ok is not ok. Fat shaming bullying discrimination that's not ok. Promoting an unhealthy lifestyle is also not ok. This is partly why most Americans are overweight now. 
Explain how simply being a man is oppressing you &amp; supporting the oppress all women system.

You say Trump being in office is ok because it doesn't affect you. That's typical woman solipcism. Only giving af about yourself.

All men are trash? Women are naturally manipulative. Women are solopstic, women are hypergamous. Most women are willing to do things to the people they say they love that men will not. You have women out here using marriage children &amp; divorce as a means of income. Women out here going on dates for food &amp; validation only. Disgustingly selfish.
Women value emotion above all else.
But men are trash? Men build &amp; defend civilization. Women hate men once we make thing comfortable for you. When you need us all of a sudden were not so bad. It's not all or even most men. But when women don't need men, now y'all look at us like the enemy.
When you need a man to defend you at night from the rapist, the human traffickers, the organ harvesters, the sadistic psychopaths, when you need us to protect you from the terrorist.

I‚Äôve always heard my male friends tell me not to get married and all that but at this point in my life being that I‚Äôve been single almost all of my life besides being in a shower relationship twice and left twice by the same girl (said she came back because she couldn‚Äôt handle not being with me and then she got me trusting she wouldn‚Äôt leave again and at random she ghosts me).

I guess there is nothing more that I went but to find the right girl and it doesn‚Äôt seem possible as so many females around my age don‚Äôt seem to want to settle down. They want to hook up and party. But I‚Äôm looking for something more. I couldn‚Äôt handle being with a different person all the time. I would love to meet someone that I truly can trust and tell anythjng to without being judged and now that I‚Äôve had that and lost it twice. Even though everything was going great and she seemed so happy, she ditched without a reason as to why. Told me she was in it for the long haul this time. But I guess despite having everything anyone possibly could have in common and from what it seemed she loved me very much, she didn‚Äôt want anything serious even though she basically hunted me down to talk me into believing that. I just want that again so bad and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll never have it. I wish so bad I could somehow talk to her. I really want to know what I did wrong. I am kind of starting to believe that I will never find anyone. I don‚Äôt use dating apps and I don‚Äôt really date. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it

I hope that there are still people that want someone and only someone as in one person to be with. I am starting to lose faith in people. I was such a open, trusting, loving person just at the beginning of this year but after having my heart ripped out by the girl of my dreams I can only call myself decent enough these days. I just wish that I could meet someone like her or I guess someone like me then again she was nothing like me but at the same time she was. Eh i don‚Äôt even know anymore since I really didn‚Äôt know her obviously.

I do wish you the best though regardless of what you want or what you hope to find in this life, this life that is over before we know it and goes by within a few blinks of our eyes.",Onemoa,2019-09-26 12:31:20,2019-09-26 12:31:31,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/czsg3o/not_even_marriage_though_they_have_women/f1hufsa/,t1_ezahzwj,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

At first i almost felt offended she didn't trust me (it was a few years ago btw, before the metoo spread awarness), but i immediately realized dating someone you don't know very well can be scary for a woman and i just said ""sure go ahead""...so just do the same if you are worried, i'd say a man who wouldn't understand is not worth dating anyway.

Wrinkles on women at 40? Horrendous. But crow's feet and pronounced laugh lines on a guy at 27? Hot, mature, blah blah blah. Men sit around using body soap as face wash, if anything at all.

I'm 23 and was recently with a 21-year-old, and he already looks 28. Not to the point it's unattractive yet, but he said he gets 'you look much older' a lot. I would never peg him as 21. We went to the beach and it was blazing, yet he didn't want to touch sunscreen because he was 'too pale' and 'needed to tan.' They really think they're invincible and don't have to do anything.

'I hear women tend to be interested in older men, but OLD proves otherwise.' Probably because you're one of those gross, ugly losers looking for women 19 to 23 when you're pushing 40. And you don't sound very appealing otherwise. Men are so fucking delusional. You still have to be attractive. Age doesn't make you attractive, weirdo.

7301,"There is men out there that date women, fuck them and never want anything to do with them again. In some of those cases the women know fully of whats going and its just a no strings attached hook up. But there are cases where the men misrepresent them selves to want more which makes the hooking up process easier. I think they call this ‚ÄúPlating women‚Äù These cases are dishonest and they are treating the women they see unfairly. 

I think op is the female version of this.  If the men are aware that you just want a free meal and will provide them friendly conversation during the meal and they are down then great. Everyone is getting their needs met. No harm no foul. 

But I have a sneaky feeling many of your marks fall into the former group. I dont know how many of these men really are aware that you just want a free meal and not there for intimacy or a relationship. If this were true you would be on equal footing with the guys that fuck women and drop them just using them for their own purposes.

It usually comes down to choice of photos, quality of photos, lighting, and what you are doing in the photos. Dating apps are a very visual medium and it's important to maximize how great you look in the pictures. I'm not very photogenic but I've often used a curling iron on my hair and volumizer mousse to make my hair look extra good, since it's so important for framing the face. I'm also planning on hiring a photographer for a photo session to get some extra nice pictures. If you have a friend with a DSLR camera you can ask them. I'm more likely to swipe right on guys with more focused/hi-res photos I've noticed. I also like taking pics somewhere windy because your hair flying around automatically makes your face look good. Sunhats also make people look better, and even earmuffs to a certain point (the earmuffs have to match your hair color tho). I have a lot of techniques, so if you wanted to try uploading your pics again I can help. A lot of it is self-improvement too. Women tend to be rated the most attractive at a BMI of 19-20, which is usually on the slim side. I definitely got more matches after losing 15 lbs.",bearded_dragonlady,2019-09-30 15:34:08,2019-09-30 15:46:29,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/db732m/what_do_you_do_in_a_dating_dry_spell/f20bd1u/,t3_db732m,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

9740,"YES GIRL I LIKE YOUR THINKING.

&amp;#x200B;

 **'Pervasive Patriarchy &amp; Misogyny lessens the burden of male mate competition. Why? Because it‚Äôs easier to bully a woman into submission and cripple her ability to be independent of men in society than it is to fight off competing males.**

**Enforcing Monogamy and dependence in females lessens infighting between males and increases infighting between females.'**

&amp;#x200B;

I've been chewing over this for some while, cos I'm a naturally loyal one to one intimate kind of person if I'm down with someone I do feel bad just talking to guys all the over the place (Only if theres a real spark), but wayyy too often men I meet are quick to try take me off the market...cos they know men are noticing me and like you said they know there's competition so they will mate gate you whilst they're still keeping several girls on their roster. Of course this suits men but it handicaps a woman, when the dude barely a few months in is wanting you to be exclusive to him...they will always mention that first, without bringing up whether you're a priority to them.

And trust me, even ur nice and loyal bf will keep a few halted options aka 'girl friends' around for that reason, there always the ones they run to when u have an issue/break up. He will want u to abandon all guy friends tho...entitlement

Let em know you're into them, but don't rush to play good girl, they need to earn the exclusive title.

What happens when a month later you realise hes just on the bullshit...now you're thinking about that tall hot guy at the gas station you blew off because of your non official bae's sweet talk. 

Its hard for us women to rewire our brains to this sometimes because of the adam and eve shit...we've been told its bad and immoral for women to keep their options open, that its shady. Meanwhile men are getting satisfied round the clock, cos when sally plays up, he has jane to go to for a good old time

But I think being sat there for 8months at a time legs crossed, waiting for mr right (whos gonna be another 12 mistakes later if that) whilst men are going out enjoying their youth, is a patriarchal mindset. Ofc u need to be safe and on contraception, and sometimes chill out but you really won't discover good sex, or get to know whats out there, or available to you in terms of standards/treatment if you're sat being prude and  loyal to some guy you've known a month. Men are rarely ever doing that out of good will for women, only when they CAN'T get access from other women.

I also think its a great idea to let men see you getting other attention, it keeps them on their toes. Men aren't like women when it comes to compliments....too many and they start thinking 'ooo I wonder how much better I could go to impress my brothers'. Honestly, even if they're not v attractive and u went for the personality, their confidence will start to creep 'Ooo I;m funny enough to pull that hot latino girl even with my gigantic beer belly'. So u have to keep them grounded, because chances are there is a hotter, richer guy willing to dine you &amp; them even getting a whiff of that is great for you, because they realise their foot needs to stay on the wheel with the smoozing etc. Excellent strategy!!

I used to play myself down so much for guys (&amp;bitchy women) being 'down to earth' making jokes of myself trust me it really didn't work in my favour they just see you as a bargain on the clearance shelf and they're happy to oblige because who doesn't want one? You will be getting messed around by some bummy unattractive guy because people taught u to settle and humour any guy thats remotely nice. Its much better to let them know u know what you're working with, and they're not the only ones interested in it. Let them know they have to step up to the plate not just dip their fingers in .

I agree with all the points you made in my 20s now especially, monogamy is definitely for marriage not just the new guy who's thrown u sweet talk for a few months. Why corner yourself off before u know whether thy are legit, whether they're going to reveal something that clashes with your values etc? If they seriously want to be considered exclusive they will pull all the stops out to impress u, cos they know your worth and know u know it too.",modernmedusaa,2019-09-13 15:08:05,2019-09-13 15:08:16,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d2lg9t/girl_game_pt_1_males_monogamy_and_mateguarding/f04gz4m/,t3_d2lg9t,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

I think because you guys spent so much time together during your internship and now that you are back in school or doing your own thing you miss that companionship and are not really attracted to him.
Anyways my take OP, don‚Äôt try to get with him, you will very likely regret it, if this feeling passes in a couple months well and good it was just that but if it doesn‚Äôt may be there‚Äôs more to it than you know.

9878,"He shaved off 6 years! This was 1998 and we met online in a travel forum, he was Irish and I was going to Ireland so I was in the chat room asking where I should go, etc. He lived in NYC. This wasn‚Äôt a dating chat room at all but somehow we were drawn to each other just through our conversations. Meeting someone online back then was a crazy concept. I was 24, he was 32 but said he was 26. I found out later he had serious anxiety about aging and turning 30 had sent him into a major panic attack. I think it was more about his own fears than getting a younger woman because all of his exes were his age. 

Regardless, he was really unstable and put me through so much grief and suffering. In the beginning he was really charming and attentive. But things got so bad that he would order food for just himself and I had no money at the time having recently moved to NYC from the Pacific NW to live with him. I had to go without food some nights. When I found a course of training to become a legal proofreader in law firms, he went into a rage one night and ripped up my coursework. I had to be honest with my teacher, she was so pissed at him. At the same time, I started attending college and again, his abuse affected my coursework and I had to tell some of my professors why. I was stuck in an abusive relationship. It took me years to get out of it, and he STILL emailed me a few years after our final break up, by then I had a husband and a baby and made of very clear I never wanted to hear from him again. 

I hope someday to write a book about it, but it still sometimes feels too painful to revisit too deeply. I hope that for now at least, I can share what I know about men after all my many trials with them. Definitely lying at the outset is a huge red flag. I know some men who I don‚Äôt think would ever lie. Some do to avoid conflict but most do it because they have serious internal issues they will never face and they learn to lie as a mode of survival and self-preservation.

If you haven't realized it yet, all women are always at fault to these losers. 

Feminine women who looks like models? High maintenance, expensive, gold digger, bitch, etc.

Feminine women who are mothers/ want to? Nags, unfun, prioritizes kids over the husband/bf therefore less exciting/sexy. If she wants some break from the kids? Irresponsible, while the man sits on his ass playing games on his free time. Matronly women are unfun and unsexy, they're Karens y'know?

Women who know what she wants and do things on her terms: bossy, bitchy, liars, misandrist.

Women who don't care about men and fiercely reject men? Bitch, misandrist. She'll die alone and bitter.

A fuckton of men die alone and bitter (hello MGOTWs?) but their choices are never questioned.

Don't listen to these losers, early marriages in general have highest rate of divorce. Losers doesn't seem to realize that married women in their 30s are divorcing their waste of space husbands and want to insist that women who don't settle in their 20s will never have relationships anymore. They're full of shit and not factual. Most instigator of divorces are women. It's men who are afraid of dying alone, old, and bitter who need a maid to wipe his ass so he can sit on his ass all day.

Think about what you have that women his age don‚Äôt and think about what may be his flaws compared to other men of his age.

9951,"I would agree with being yourself and expressing how you feel. I get angry with men sometimes.

10120,"I‚Äôm not trying to be critical as different stokes for differing folks and sure all strategies could/should  be tested and tried. 

But what I keep coming to back to here, is that this sounds like a guide to attract the lowest self-esteem ridden unattractive men possible that have such few options for themselves that they would stick around for these areas.

Just .02$ and not said critically at all. 

1) I don‚Äôt know any man that will stick around for much more than a few dates if sex isn‚Äôt involved or at least  on the table. None. Because men of value tend to have options, and physical connection is important to those guys. This seems silly. So if they don‚Äôt see that physical relationship happening, onto the next. And quick. Really low value guys though? Yeah they might stick around cause it is all they are going to get and they know it. 

2) Men often don‚Äôt want to go on a date to events with tons of other men around. Why? They have friends to go watch sports with. They have friends to go hit a heavily crowded bar with. 
If they are want to date a women, a reason is often to do things they can‚Äôt do with the guys.  (Movies, Nice dinners, theater etc) 

Unless that guy is a total pushover (read: low self esteem) or has really few guy friends. 


3) Monogamy: Again, A man with a high value of himself usually thinks it‚Äôs pretty gross to be sleeping with someone or engaging physically in any way, shape of form regularly when they have others that person is doing the same with, Men with self respect don‚Äôt want to picture same weekend sloppy seconds. Men that have no other options will take what they can get however.

On the Marriage aspect, for many men the point of monogamy prior to marriage is to see if their potential mate can be trusted and can develop inimtacy with one person. If that person can‚Äôt men don‚Äôt find them marriage material (usually just sexual material) this is a good way to never get married.",Wandering1015,2019-09-25 03:58:51,2019-09-25 03:58:52,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d2lg9t/girl_game_pt_1_males_monogamy_and_mateguarding/f1dh4um/,t3_d2lg9t,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

Instead of what society tells you to be; a piece of meat for men to battle over. It's a waste of energy on both peoples parts. The real goal is to become a good person; attract another good person; and flourish together. But no.

10210,"Hey OP, just wanted to chime in here. I responded to a comment a second ago, but I‚Äôll say what my thoughts are on ethics in what you described.

First off, screw ethics. Do what feels right for you. 9 times out of ten it‚Äôll be beneficial for most involved. Personally, I like to communicate to get a feel for what‚Äôs right/not right. As a guy, I realize that‚Äôs a rare quality in us men; frankly, I have my failures in communicating every so often. Nobody‚Äôs perfect, and no act is perfect. Ask yourself, will it hurt someone if you sleep with this other guy? If you and the inexperienced guy have agreed upon your guys‚Äô relationship, and it isn‚Äôt monogamous, then you‚Äôre well within your rights. You two aren‚Äôt for sure together, and sexual frustration is a bitch that you do not deserve to deal with when you‚Äôre extremely in the mood. 

My advice? Talk to these guys individually, let them know what‚Äôs on your mind, and see if they‚Äôre down to continue in some kind of open relationship (or whatever you‚Äôd like). If they‚Äôre mature, they‚Äôll communicate with you and be honest. Otherwise, yeah you‚Äôll have an immature guy on your hands, and might have to end things with one of them. I imagine you feel as though you‚Äôre cheating on him, hurting him in some way? That‚Äôs totally natural, if you‚Äôre an empathic/outgoing person typically. But if you communicate and be mature about it, then I‚Äôd say you‚Äôve acted ethically; but what will ultimately matter is what you feel is right. Ethical dilemmas can be contemplated on for centuries, but if you wanna decide you‚Äôll have to go with your gut. Ultimately, you‚Äôll have to decide what to do.",knightgod1177,2019-09-27 07:56:42,2019-09-27 07:56:43,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d9kr7i/dating_ethically/f1lvcpn/,t3_d9kr7i,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

This has everything to do with OP‚Äôs willingness to be selfish. She‚Äôs paved her way to being able to sleep around by telling this guy they‚Äôre not exclusive; that‚Äôs all she can say, it‚Äôs up to the guy to handle how he feels.

‚ÄòThe more honest you are about your real desires and your standards, the more men will respect you and treat you like girlfriend material.‚Äô

Absolutely. Women are taught to be afraid of losing or offending men&amp; this is how manipulators get you to settle. Truly, men have x1000 more respect for women that call them out on BS, have clear boundaries &amp; refuse to pander. 

When they sense no fear in you, when you give off the vibe you‚Äôre good with or without their attention, when you aren‚Äôt codependent, you‚Äôve matured, you know yourself...you command the respect of the ones worth your time. Truly men do not respect bimbos, handmaidens or some1 they can pull the wool over. Especially if they‚Äôre after a strong mother to their child

They know they‚Äôre messing with a woman that knows what they want &amp; most importantly feels it‚Äôs within her grasp to get it. 

I also advise ppl to date outside of their hometowns, races &amp; cultures. You‚Äôd be surprised how much more compatible u are with ppl different to what ur used to. You may also find your experiences of dating certain men strongly dispel the stereotypes..even ones u held yourself or had been curious about  

I am constantly warned against dating Arabic men- but in my personal experience, I have never got on dating white British men &amp; was even raped by one. Literally countless incompatible relationships with white British men have taught me I don‚Äôt have much in common with most of them &amp; im not particularly fond of how they approach dating . That‚Äôs fine. Ironically the last 2 Arab men I dated were the most respectful &amp; closest to what I am looking for in a man. V family orientated &amp; didn‚Äôt leave me unsure about my status.

Sexual selection is what created homosapiens. Without women being strict about who to mate with we would still be chimps.

You little girls have no clue what youre missing out on by just fucking strangers and not finding a magical connection with someone. I've made love with my soul, and intertwined it with a woman... And she threw it away... And regrets it. Has a kid, single mom, and miserable. But we could have been a family... But no.

10245,"I absolutely agree to NOT waste time on the wrong men so we can say YES to the right ones.

A joke that is not appropriate and out of the blue can hurt your feelings - it may be easy to blow off - but please don't.  It's highly likely the person making it is used to making those types of jokes often and it's not only with you. You are just not that special. So ask yourself:  Do you want to be with a man who habitually makes those types of jokes ?! He surely won't change...

Maybe go for a man that has a similar sense of humor as you do - so you can BOTH laugh and have a great time!

Let's be honest - it takes at least 2 months for the cracks to show and for people to show their true colors ( &amp; the process of getting to know others takes even longer). 

But once that's established , the negotiable parts are just being flexible (not rigid) with each other; being accepting and loving of the person in front of you.  And when people feel accepted and loved for who they are - they are motivated  to grow to be a better person in general and as  a part of the couple.",Miss904,2019-09-27 03:54:09,2019-09-27 03:54:10,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d9t6c0/know_what_your_standards_are_and_stick_to_them/f1ljfzl/,t3_d9t6c0,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

It's an epidemic :(

Repeated use gives them dopamine hits the way being with a real human doesn't. It changes their brain, they have less empathy - they don't give a shit about women's pleasure. It's the same kind of passive entertainment as gaming and social media scrolling. If a dude's gaming for 8 hours, he's probably a porn user too.

They learn dick-dentric man-pleasure sex from thousands of hours of headless porn stars moaning and screaming. It's not like they're watching tutorials on finding the clit and reading her facial expressions.

The addiction is half the actual porn (high quality airbrushed bodies), and half ""the habit"" - so settling into his crusty gamer chair and turning on the laptop, or laying on his back, or sitting on the couch begins the arousal process. A lot of men can only sustain an erection on their backs in ""wank position"".

Going around to a woman's house, standing in the shower with a real woman who, I dunno, expects him to be present and active.. is none of his triggers, so .. no boner.

If I ever start dating again (lol probably not this year), I'll have 2 immediate deal breakers. Enthusiastically go down on me unprompted, and can gain an erection while standing.

His dick doesn't work

He's been texting you less

He's admitted to being unstable and incapable of being alone by getting women to move in after 2 months, but played this off by making you think you're special by NOT moving you in (what a rollercoaster)

He's wishy-washy and a bad planner

He declined to see you because ""cold"", but schedules dinner with friends, and graciously allows you to be his nightcap

His car doesn't work

He's on other dating apps

He's brushing you off

You're texting, planning and chasing the shit out of a disinterested guy

And your only standard/reason for continuing with this fuckmuppet is ""he said he isn't sleeping with anyone else""

10380,"I think this is the completely wrong subreddit if you are a Romantic at heart.

Finding that ""Special One"" is NOTHING like a Job Interview.  Basically, if you follow most of the advice around here expect to grow old alone except for a couple of dozen cats lol.

I have been happily married for the last 25 years to the same woman and I am also an Employer.  They really are NOT the same.  

Depending on how many women (and some men), I come across a day, I get hit on by anywhere from 1 to 30 women.  I can proudly say I have never even considered taking any of them up on their offers (some of which can be quite crude), even when my wife and I were just ""Dating"".  My wife is quite attractive and USED TO get hit on a lot by Doctors at the Hospital that she is an RN at.  I say USED TO because a couple of the Nurses she works with started to spread the rumors that I have killed people in the past.  I did 4 Tours in Iraq, of course I probably killed people..... DUH.  

But if we go out, we both do get hit on and we both laugh it off unless someone hit on me with my wife standing right with me and then I get mad as I believe that is very disrespectful to her.  My wife and I both know neither of us will take some cheap clown up on their offers so we don't worry or display any of the traits they talked about in the post.  Granted, my being someone that still works out with weights and cardio 6 days a week as well as being 6'7"" and weighing 265lbs seems to curtail her possible attempted suitors anytime we are out together, but I still have no

Love, Communication, Trust, and Faithfulness are some of the biggest aspects of a Relationship and/or Marriage.  They are basically telling you here to cut out the Communication part, at least being able to go deeper into it in favor of ""Skimming"" the surface to weed out any supposed undesirables.  It's like a job I had one summer during college as a Cable TV Door to Door Salesman.  They wanted us to talk with the people and explain the different channels and services they could order.  Essentially you were going more in depth and educating them on what was available and how it might benefit them.  That way, they could make an informed decision.  

What they didn't want us to do is essentially what they are recommending here, which is Cherry Picking.  They didn't want us to run from house to house, ring their doorbell and when they answered ask them, ""Do you want Cable TV?"" and if they said, ""No"", then simply turning around and running to the next house.  Because Cable TV was new to this area, these people didn't really get all the information they would need or want to make an informed decision.

Trust me, Romance is NOT Dead, Overrated or something to be trivialized.  It's the ultimate Aphrodisiac and necessary in any successful relationship.

10445,"This post is so ironic and backwards it's hilarious.  Everything you are saying is wrong with men is the complete OPPOSITE.

&gt;I‚Äôve been active on that sub for a year and now all of a sudden I see men insisting women have no issue dating and shouldn‚Äôt have issues dating. I don‚Äôt agree with this sentiment at all

If you can't get a man it's because you're fat or have bad hygiene.  Bottom line.  These are super basic issues to deal with, no one else can do it for you.  You don't need to be employed, you don't need to have friends, you don't need money.  All you need to do is not be fat.

&gt;followed by the same asinine comments about how men are just so disadvantaged and they‚Äôll try and defend their issues but the thing is that their issues are fixable. It usually goes back to them being ugly. 

80/20 rule applies.  It's been studied.  80% of women only pursue the top 20% of men 

&gt;If you have a hard time online dating and getting matches, it‚Äôs usually because the profile and pictures a god awful or you‚Äôre shooting for people way way way out of your league (yes, leagues are up for debate, but if your profile consists of car and mirror selfies, you won‚Äôt match with someone with good photos and a headshot). This has to be right or I‚Äôm massively wrong...

Guys do this because they aren't trying to scam anyone the way women do with manipulative photos.  It's being honest, genuine, and humble.  No, I'm sorry, I don't want to take some ridiculous ""Glamour shots"" just so some girl can be impressed by technology (though in her mind she has no clue she's being manipulated)",FemaleWhoreStrategy,2019-09-28 00:40:52,2019-09-28 00:40:54,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/da7nqp/so_ive_been_using_reddit_since_2011_and_ive_seen/f1o0dcs/,t3_da7nqp,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

And if you think about it logically, the more attractive he is, the more options he has to choose from, so there's less incentive for him to wait around for months on only the expectation that it MAY eventually become sexual.

There's no way I will take this newfangled increase in misogynism lying down. At the very least, I will support and encourage my sisters.

If this was about color, we'd have the whole world by our side, but we are ""just women"" and the only ones who will help us are ourselves.

One of the best ways to protect our well being is to stop having sex with low effort men! Any woman who has fucked one of those knows it's a total waste of time. A vibrator, heck even your fingers, is just 100% better. And you don't get so depressed that you want to die afterwards.

We also protect our freedom is by being *obsessed* with becoming or remaining financially independent. In an ideal society, people would respect a stay-at-home-mother's contributions, but that society never existed and doesn't exist yet. You *might* get lucky and meet a man who appreciates that kind of sacrifice but I wouldn't count on that happening. 

Also, every woman should take the time to mentor and be kind to a younger woman and remind her that she has worth. On paper they are high value by virtue of being young, but in reality they are the most vulnerable segment of society, constantly chased, abused and assaulted by creepers.",whycantweallgetal0ng,2019-09-28 06:30:59,2019-09-28 06:30:59,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dacchs/repost_ive_noticed_an_uptick_in_incel_and_redpill/f1omvt1/,t3_dacchs,FemaleDatingStrategy,1
10496,"I've noticed a lot more ""I'm dating a lazy manchild and I explain simple concept to him (overwhelmingly - finding her clit and the dirty clothes hamper, lol), but he just doesn't get it"" and the comments/conclusions are that he's a selfish narcissist, but I don't think that's true.

I think a ton of women my age (40's - 50's) had shitty, strict, rigid childhoods with Depression Era Baby Boomers for parents, and decided they'd ""make life better"" for their sons, so they overindulged and coddled them. Smoothing things out, zero consequences for bad behaviour, excusing away their laziness because it gives Mummy something to do, not letting them learn, explore and fail.

So they have no internal incentive to learn, no care of the harm they're doing to others, and they only care when it affects them. Sitting on your ass gaming is smooth and easy while frustrated bangmaid sticks around.

So telling a dude ""don't do that, it hurts my feelings"" - they don't give a shit until you break up with him, because then it's a problem for *him*. Because Mummy never enforced shit, she was always around, she would always love him unconditionally and forgive him without him ever being held accountable or apologizing.

If you don't have woman_zero telling you to stop being a lazy little dickhead, and you have the top man in power telling you life is good as a mysoginistic asshole, you're being socially and relationally crippled from both sides.

The uptick in incel (who wants to fuck a lazy mama's boy who can't find your clit or the hamper?) and redpill (Mummy said I'm God's Gift and girls will love me just how I am, I deserve an instagram model simply because I exist) is because of a severe failure by those in Authority. Mummy not telling them to wake the fuck up, and President telling them to unleash their misogynism and entitlement.

The perfect test of ""overindulged?"" - teach him something once. If he has no interest in doing it how you showed him, fuck him off.

If you tell him something is a problem for you, and he doesn't care, fuck him off.

If he only cares when you're at the end of your rope and make it a problem for him, fuck him off.

Life with a manchild where you have to hold a gun to his head to get him to act right fucking sucks.

If his Mummy failed, don't get sucked into being his new Mummy.",ino_y,2019-09-28 06:27:19,2019-09-28 06:27:20,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dacchs/repost_ive_noticed_an_uptick_in_incel_and_redpill/f1omq0m/,t3_dacchs,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

10570,"I know by first hand experience that guys who fetishize your race are fucking disgusting. My boyfriend, who I should have dumped a LONG fucking time ago before I got caught up in my feelings for him, fetishizes non-white women, particularly Asian, Latina and Black women. I'm Puerto Rican and Black and a few days ago I saw that his Tumblr account was chock full of porn of non-white women. 

Him fetishsizing my race had me jealous of women of my own race, smh.

I had his Tumblr deleted, which was futile because his Tumblr being deleted won't stop him from being a fucking pervert.

Not only that, he was following a lot of porn cuckold porn blogs and some of them are called ""black cock in my white wife's pussy"", ""fuck my wife"" and he was even following shemale tranny porn blogs and blogs showing black dicks. He is of German descent (born to German parents in America) and a Trump supporter who says that he is conservative. I have no idea why he's looking at that shit; I'm hoping he's following that one tranny blog out of some kind of innocent curiosity and I hope he's just following those black dick blogs because he feels bad about his dick size and not because he secretly wants to try black dick for himself. He is not confident in the size of his penis; he is 7 inches long. He asked me could he try some cock sleeve on me while saying, ""I want to put this cock sleeve on so I can feel bigger inside of you. I want you to feel like you're being fucked by a huge tall guy with a big dick!"" I tell him he is the perfect size for my but he probably thinks that I'm lying.

He's into cuckoldry and a man like that is just so weak, sick and passive to me. Usually men want to be territorial over you and a man who wants other men to fuck his woman is just weak and submissive and that's a huge turn off for me.

http://the-love-compass.com/2014/02/22/understanding-the-needs-of-the-anxiouspreoccupied-attachment-style/

If you find yourself putting the ""winner"" on a pedestal, romanticising and daydreaming about your future together, eagerly awaiting his texts, and dude hasn't done shit to earn your devotion and loyalty, you need to keep talking to other people to keep yourself grounded and objective. If that's not what you're doing and you really did find a great guy (did you?), then awesome.

I don't agree with ""finding 5 dudes off Tinder and upgrading them all to Date Guy"".

A strategy I'll be using is to join meeetups and attend them consistently, at which there should be a few men who become acquaintances, and then upgrade some to casual friend as I get to know them (over months). I have a terrible picker, so I'll also be crowd-sourcing other women's opinions of the men.

Jumping in the deep end and being rushed into sex (false intimacy) within a week is a terrible strategy and leads to getting stuck with a predator who knows how to love-bomb and demand exclusivity (isolation).",ino_y,2019-09-30 02:01:23,2019-09-30 04:51:00,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dayy03/opinion_wanted_thoughts_on_dating_multiple_people/f1y3tz2/,t3_dayy03,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

10593,"Not at all. Here‚Äôs a good explanation, courtesy of u/BuilditMakeit:

It takes about 2 months of dating to get to a place where someone feels safe enough to start thinking ""commitment"".

The issue is -- people can hide their flaws and put on a fake personality for up to 90-days before the cracks start to show. So especially with someone that's a narcissistic personality and is looking for a victim to drain, those first 2 or 3 months, everything looks peachy... they're putting on a show for you, they seem like the best person in the world... and suddenly whamo, the toxicity and abuse starts.

The mentality of dating multiple people (not necessarily sexually, but just getting to know them), is that you want to take dating seriously because you are looking for the RIGHT partner, not just someone who puts on a good show for a little bit. And if after 2 months of dating, that person who you thought was decent, but is actually a narcissist whose cracks begin to show, you're going to peace-out... and you don't want to be like ""ah geesh, I became exclusive only for it to go nowhere, now I have to start all over... 8 weeks wasted...""

If you're dating 2 or 3 people at once, you can get the best use of your time... you can go exclusive when you feel like the timing is right, NOT when someone else forces you into it.",sweatydeath,2019-09-30 01:27:49,2019-09-30 04:22:12,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dayy03/opinion_wanted_thoughts_on_dating_multiple_people/f1y01of/,t1_f1wfvst,FemaleDatingStrategy,2

10685,"""This is why repeated failure makes men homicidal/ suicidal."" 

Would you be suprised if i told you that isnt just men? Its a part of psychology, your brain needs dopamine and serotonin to stay happy, and repeated failure of anything will starve your brain of them. And when your brain doesn't have enough, you become depressed and suicidal. And when someone of any gender becomes severly suicidal they will try to end the lives of those who wronged them before killing themselves.

Do you know why suicide rates are higher for men than women by a lot? Its because of shit like this, men being treated like actual pieces of garbage just because they are men. You might think men have it all but in reality its the opposite. Every thing is in women's favor. Every single problem women face is also faced by men, but when men try to get help they aren't taken seriously, they're told to ""man up"", ""stop being a bitch"",""take it like a man"", or ""that can't happen to men"" and they get laughed at, and made fun of.

And while men go through that whenever they tell the truth about issues they face, women can get away with ruining a mans whole life with just a accusation of rape. Even if it isn't true just the accusation can make them lose their job, make their family hate them, make them lose their friends, their future job opportunities, and sometimes cause them to lose their wife and kids.",ConnectConcern6,2019-09-30 13:41:44,2019-09-30 13:41:55,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/db76fj/girl_game_pt_3_dont_turn_pinocchio_into_a_real_boy/f1zvsmg/,t3_db76fj,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

And with the encouragement of gender fluidity, women are behaving with more aggression, and promiscuity.. even though It isnt giving their lives any value, they are behaving more like men.. Feminine traits are good; but to understand that men are not attuned to them is understandable. But that won't be the case forever. The new generation of children are being introduced to a very confusing world; and we need to understand that what we NEED to do right now is to eliminate the bad feminine traits that are arising, and also eliminate the old masculine traits that are detrimental also. (By which im referring to the fact women initiate divorce much often than Men, that women are practicing hypergamy on a massive level, that men are still being abusive and manipulative..) But simultaneously understand childhood trauma, mental illness, diet and biology play large parts too. So we can all do our part by learning about psychology, understanding red flags from others, and avoiding those people. The problem is that those types of people breed; and continue the human condition down the bloodline. If you dont want hateful men to exist; then stop women from having kids with aggressive, dominant men. (Genghis Kahn was a psychopath, and he ended up having hundreds of children.. You dont think that affects our species, putting that much psychopathic prone genes into our society? Think again) And so maybe in 200 years men wont be so controlled by their biology.

15376,"More like Steak House vs Walmart. People go places because they are looking for something. The mere place in which you meet someone tells you already a vague idea of what they are looking to find there. Those are little moments in which they go outside their everyday routine, to look for what they don't usually find there.   


Some people are just looking for fun but expecting people to notice them, so they go to nightclubs. Others go for talking in a non-formal manner, so they go to bars. There is people that go hiking, looking for peace and quiet. Other go for movies or museums, craving for a creative experience. You get the idea.   


The more specific are the things that you can do at a certain place, the more it tells you about the people that gather there. So, if you meet someone at a place you enjoy, it's more likely that you'll be looking for the same things. But when areas are more diverse, you should ask yourself ""What kind of expectations does he has about the people at this specific place?"". You don't go to a soccer match and think that you'll have sex right after the match. Like you don't go to a club and expect a long lasting emotional connection with someone that is just there to get drunk with friends.

The biggest takeaway is that you need to value yourself first and men will follow. That women should relinquish the role of sacrificer, nurturer, and martyr (i.e. the toxic gender roles that have been placed upon women). That we should not give our affection or attention to a man until he has demonstrated value and commitment.

**Most of the advice of you have been given in these threads is rooted in these books**. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúmanipulation‚Äù, it‚Äôs a change in in your behavior to have more self-respect and restraint, and for good reason. 

The fact they you‚Äôre so concerned about making it a little harder for men access you and use you, because you fear ‚Äúmanipulating men‚Äù is also worrying.

15477,"I read this a few times. I think if you want to look at it a different way, from a different angle, I have some ideas.

I, too, feel like I'm being watched &amp; judged all the time. A lot of that is patriarchally influenced. I especially relate to ""Up on a pedestal or down on your knees, it's all a male fantasy;"" I relate to that because in my sexual life I've tried to identify as a gentle femdom. Yet I still ended up being too 'nice' or conforming to my partners desires. It really does seem like when they want you strong they still only want it within their ideas &amp; concepts. They just don't let you lead ever really. I think women up to this point have not been allowed creative freedom, especially in the sexual realm.

You could reverse the genders though. Then you could think about it like that it's a very beautiful thing that both genders deeply desire for each other to the extent that they are haunted and paranoid by it. By their innate, even insane, desire to be what the other gender wishes them to be. This *reliance* on each other could actually be looked at as beautiful, philosophical, and psychedelic. The tension &amp; existential dread that comes from first considering it can be eased by just realizing that others around you have the same self consciousness. It's shared. If you believe in this; you believe in interconnectedness, than you can feel hopeful. Others feel self conscious because of their need to conform to the wishes of others. That's a trait that should be fostered and looked at as beautiful, helpful, and *strong!*

I'm not saying the patriarchy doesn't still exist. Or that it shouldn't be revealed, analysed, and completely demolished. I'm definitely a feminist. I'm only putting forth the idea that if you can accept this self consciousness is shared than you can see the beauty in caring so much. You can see the beauty in anyone desiring to be reliant on someone else.

He‚Äôs young and probably not bad, just stupid. Maybe if you explain things well he will grow out of this. Hurting others is never good.
