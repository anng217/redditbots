Female energy is different. Whether it's innate or learned via our socialization, at this current moment in time it's simply different. Most likely due to the fact that we've all suffered like you're suffering now.

Be around women. They understand, even if some of them are more traditional. I'd take a traditionally minded woman over a ""progressive"" man any day of the week.

Spending time with other women will show you just what we're capable of. We're not as strong, so we're forced to be way more clever. We can't just push the boulder, we have to devise systems and use tools to push it.

We have far, far better problem solving than men. They just hit things until they get angry enough to destroy it completely, or they get bored and give up because brute strength didn't work and they're out of ideas.

Men are garbage; don't admire a garbage bin full of anger, porn and misogyny. Don't wish you had the shittier, weaker, inferior immune system, stamina, and resiliency.

Having children isn't what makes women powerful. It's having the ability to do it and choosing not to. Having complete control over whether to bring a life into the world is true power. Men don't have this, they never will. This is why they hit and beat us. This is why they rape and kill us. Fear.

When men think of pregnancy, they literally cannot imagine being the pregnant one, they always picture themselves as the fetus. The primary reason they oppose abortion is out of fear of the power women have over the continuation of men.

The very idea that his mother could have simply decided to abort him—and he never would have lived to experience this glorious male kingdom full of porn, video games, and weed—fills the man with such great terror that he reacts out of stupidity and fear in the only way he knows how: with anger, rape, and violence. Not just physical violence, but a very violent type of control in the form of reproductive legislation.

Don't be like them. You are the actual powerful one. Dumb animals can smash things all day long. Gorillas are ridiculously stronger than us, and we're not afraid of them in the least. They sit in cages and we look at them for amusement.

It's not about strength, it's about cunning. It's about human ingenuity and creativity, which thankfully comes in far larger doses in us women.

Men have become so numbed to reality and dumbed down by porn. They barely exist these days. They're literally growing moldy, fusing to their computer chairs, one gnarled hand permanently fused to their limp, abused, crusty shrimp dicks. Women are surpassing men in almost every field these days because men have become like the people who live in the Capitol in The Hunger Games. Men are seriously so infatuated and obsessed with their dicks that they aren't even noticing how much we're getting the upper hand.

You're part of this new generation of women. You're young enough to see real change happen. Celebrate that with your fellow women.

Thankfully you're female, so you have enough room in your brain for sexual pleasure AND intellectual pursuits. You're female, so you have the ability to stay calm in stressful situations, you can control your emotions way better than males, you can think far more logically and rationally to problem solve things instead of beating it up. You have the intelligence and aptitude to execute complex projects and tasks. You're better at ""multi-tasking "", at least as far as humans can actually ""multi-task"".

You're capable of so much more emotional depth and feeling. You think deeper, you dream bigger, you heart is more open to new experiences, your mind is more curious, your vision is clearer and more perceptive. You have the capacity to love people for who they are instead of how you can use them. You see people as people instead of objects. You have respect for others, which men almost completely lack.

&gt;When women are not taught anything about sex–that it should be pleasurable for them, that their partners should listen to them and care about their needs, that they are allowed to say no, that they should never be coerced, guilted, or forced into having sex–women go into the sexual phase of their lives completely unprepared. It leaves them very vulnerable to being used, manipulated, and abused.

When your dad tries to guilt trip you into visiting him: “well I guess I’ll just spend the weekend all by myself...”

You say “glad to know we’re on the same page.” Slowly, he will have to adapt to just outright telling you what he thinks instead of playing mind games.

When your friend tries to hint that they’re mad at you without saying anything: “Oh, I’m fine, clearly you don’t need to worry about me,”

You say: “I’m glad you’re doing well. Call me if you want to talk, though!” Soon enough, they will accept that they can’t be passive aggressive with you.

When your boyfriend says: “All your friends are great, I really *love* \*insert male friend\* especially.”

You say: “I’m so glad you like my friends! I should invite them back soon.” He needs to understand that if he has a problem with your friends, he needs to just voice his concerns instead of being sarcastic and accusatory.

As someone who has lived through several toxic relationships and has an abusive father, I think one of the most important manipulation tools a toxic person has is excessive subtext and hidden meanings in their conversation. It hides all of the actual fighting from the eyes of onlookers while still hurting you, which is scary and makes you feel like you’re making it all up. Don’t put up with this bs.

The tone stops being about self worth and more about criticizing and insulting people of differing ideas. I think that as a person everyone has worth. For example: why should my life be more valuable than someone I hate? They have people that love them and have arguably more potential for growth to become a better person. This is less about degrading yourself and more about understanding that people have the capacity to surprise you with their ability to feel emotions convey thoughts and work past their limits to help others. No one should be used for personal gain. Everyone should be respected.

Is it worth the time you could be spending to make yourself happier? I'm just saying that maybe if we accept that people are going to be shitty and that even if a lot of them are shitty there has to be someone that thinks rarionally? Is patient? And genuinely cares? It cant be all bad out there, right?",819,Hi.,0,2019-08-24 08:10:58,,

Just try not shaving, going barefaced, wearing comfy clothes, not doing your hair. If you truly tried and prefer to do feminine things then I applaud you and support your decision! I’m only saying that you should try it. The hair can be shaven and plucked, makeup can be applied, tight spandex can be worn; all of these things can be quickly amended in a couple of hours it’s not something you have to do forever.

It starts with innocuous comments by family members : 'Oh, she's so pretty!' 'Look at how cute she is!' 'A beautiful little princess!'. During childhood, it's : 'Isn't she pretty in that dress?' 'She's such a sweetheart' 'All the boys will fight for her'. And then, during teenage years, it's : 'You'll never find a man if you dress like that' 'You need to be pretty or no man will ever want you' 'Such behavior isn't pretty for a woman'.

Girls hear and internalize it all : their existence is reduced to that of a decoration. They need to be pretty.

But that's where it gets insidious : no one ever told them who they're meant to be pretty for. Notice that teenage girls comments always involve a man? But who that man is isn't specified. Are girls supposed to be pretty for their grandfathers, fathers, uncles, cousins? Or is it their teachers they're meant to seduce? Their classmates? Random men on the streets?

Girls don't know, so they come to the only logical conclusion : they must be pretty for everyone. Terrified of being seen as ugly, they start performing beauty rituals to conform to what they've learned is 'pretty'. Everywhere. Always. For every occasion - going to a party, attending schools, going shopping, out with friends, even sometimes inside the house. This warped form of seduction becomes ingrained behavior.

But that's what it's meant to be : a seduction. And why would girls want to seduce anyone? Later in life, why would women want to seduce anyone they're not attracted to?

This is it, this is the message : girls, embrace being ugly. Your family, teachers, classmates, friends...it doesn't matter if they find you ugly : none of your relationships with them should be in any way connected to your appearance. You do not have to perform beauty rituals for them. You do not have to be pretty for them. You do not have to be pretty for anyone.",792,You do not have to be pretty for anyone.,0,2019-08-23 11:53:07,,

Every time I see another girl I knew from high school/childhood get married and take her husbands name my heart breaks a little more.  
It breaks even more when they have a baby and they don’t even have their mothers name. The woman who birthed them doesn’t get to claim the baby under her name. It’s her husbands baby. And she is also her husbands.

What fucks me up about this even more is even if you keep your name, that name was given to you by your father. Even if you changed to your mother’s maiden name, that name was given to her by her father.

No, being depressed or stressed at work is not a valid excuse to cheat. Even people in happy relationships with supermodels cheat. Even people in happy relationships cheat.

What do I say or not say tomorrow if he tries to get together?


Hey everyone! First post here.

Met a man on Bumble 2 years ago. We didn’t end up going on a date as I met someone else who swept me up faster.

Fast forward to now. This man from 2 years ago has a mutual friend with me. She and I get on the topic of him and I let her know how I had met him. Takes it upon herself to ask him if he’s still interested, to which he replies that he is. 

She arranges a get together at her home- we both go and there seems to be a few sparks. He is sweet during this event and does a few little extra things like go out of his way to be chivalrous. We flirt a little but mostly talk. He hugs me at the end- pulls me in tight and says he was glad to finally meet. 

Within 30 min of the event ending he texts me and says that he was really glad to meet me and would I like to grab coffee sometime? 

I say that I would prefer to do something else and so we decide to go on a date instead. 

I realize he’s had a hard week (struggles with his son having to do online school home alone- he’s 9) but making plans takes two seconds 

This is supposed to be tomorrow. He hasn’t confirmed anything specific. It’s 1 am here and I’m over it. Whether he tries to arrange something tomorrow it’s a no for me. It sucks cuz he’s very cute and seems like a great dad but I know my worth and I recognize a LVM when I see one. 

But my question is... do I let him know that I’m not interested or just leave on read? We have a mutual friend and will see each other again, so I’d rather not be awkward. Part of me wants to let him know that it’s inconsiderate. But I’m not sure if it’s worth it.",90867,Dropping the ball before the game- how would you in this case?,0,,,

Some ways it can happen:

- (personal example) Was forced to do threesomes by my first boyfriend and it traumatized me. When I told my most recent ex about it, he was sympathetic. Eventually he started asking for threesomes, because he’s “never had one with two girls before” and “i did it for my ex so why not him?” Despite me saying over and over again that I was TRAUMATIZED by watching my first bf basically fuck other women in front of me. 

- If they’re super shitty, they will think “oh so she dated a guy who did X and Y to her and still didn’t leave as soon as he did it, so I can get away with doing it to her too”

- they will see you as damaged goods and “ruined” or tainted or some version of that. Daddy issues or whatever. There are actually YouTube videos like “ways to tell she’s been damaged” or “how to tell if you’re dating a damaged girl.” That’s right boys, gotta get a fresh, untraumatized one right out of high school so you  can traumatize her YOURSELF!",90822,Never tell a guy you’re dating about your trauma / past abusive relationships,0,,,

Well, it's been about 3 months. I check in on her to see how she's doing and try to give her the best advice from what I learned when I went through my own break-up 1.5 years ago. I've tried to ease in FDS concepts so that she switches her focus from him and what he did to healing and leveling up herself.   


Recently, I asked if she had blocked her ex yet, hoping she said yes. It's been 3 months since she found out that her LDR of 11 months was actually a sham because he had been cheating on her with multiple women. She told me she doesn't want to block him because she ""wants to know that he changed"" and ""wants to believe that he feels bad for what he did."" She said she believes people can ""change and be transformed"" and is giving him that grace because it's part of her faith as a Christian. This irks me so much so I just decided that she can make her own decisions and whatever I say wasn't going to get through. She'll have to learn the hard way.   


FDS has really helped me realize that so many people around me engage in pick-me behavior. It's so frustruating!!!!! Do you have any stories about giving a friend advice, them ignoring it and then having to learn on their own?",90819,Hesitating to Block,0,,,

&gt;  
&gt;For context I’m a black woman and my husband is white. I have 4c hair and I wrap my hair in a satin scarf to go to bed. For those of you who don’t know what that means, basically my hair curl pattern is really tightly coiled so my hair texture is kinky and easily tangled and easily breakable if not taken care of well.  
&gt;  
&gt;I used to sleep on a satin pillowcase when my hair was shorter and had a lower chance of tangling while I tossed and turned in my sleep. But recently I’ve added oils to my nightly routine and since my hair is a bit pass my shoulders now, the chances of it tangling are higher and I don’t want my pillowcases to get soaked with oils so I started wrapping my hair up again.  
&gt;  
&gt;First night I wore it my husband said that I looked like a slave which- ok was a little bit funny and a little bit true in my scarf and nightgown combo so I let him have that one. But since then, it’s the little comments when I get into bed. Like “are we doing the slave tonight?” Or “should I help you into bed grandma?” Little things like that. I’ve explained why l do it, and I think he understands that but he simply doesn’t like it and my hope was that he’d get used to it by now.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last night I was getting ready for bed and I couldn’t find my scarf anywhere so I asked DH if he’d seen it and he admitted that the hid it but wouldn’t tell me where. He wouldn’t stop joking around even when I got visibly upset and said he wished he could run his fingers through my hair or something along those lines and I snapped and said if he wanted that he should have married a white woman.  
&gt;  
&gt;He got really quiet after that and told me where he hid it. We haven’t talked much about it but there’s this air of awkwardness. The only times he mentioned it was this morning when he said that we should look into counseling for our “race issues” and that I made him feel really racist and I didn’t think about it that way.  
&gt;  
&gt;I thought he was upset because I yelled at him but I didn’t think it was the statement itself (granted I probably should not have brought race into it but I wanted to illustrate a point.) Now he’s suggesting couples counseling to get through our “race issues”? I don’t think it was that serious and I don’t want to go through all that. AITA?

On third date he mentioned I’m so busy and that he can’t just see me once a week... (that’s what I’ve kept it at) he pointed out that he would forget me if he only saw me this little... I told him it’s my way or the highway, I don’t know you enough to see you more than what I’m willing to. 

He got a little bit irritated... but he didn’t say much... he then asked how many dates he should inv me out to until I’m willing to go to his apartment, I said there’s no way to count that... when I FEEL comfortable I will go. Right now I dont know you enough to do that.

I texted him today telling him I can’t see him on the date we scheduled today, due to my busy schedule. 

The truth is; he’s a scum and “a bare minimum, type of guy...” and I’m planning to die this out slowly...

So he answered: planning dates with you has been like a rollercoaster, so annoying.

Whenever men ask about my ideal type and pet peeves, I used to give a brutally honest answer like...

“My pet peeves are being cheap, shallow or inconsistent.”

“My ideal type is a person who is financially stable, (But I don’t care how rich you are...if you’re going to be cheap, you are cheap.), consistent, good at cooking, and good in bed.”

But this might sound too direct I guess. I was tired of having to filter so many junk questions so I’ve become very cynical this way.

But I want to HINT them that I have standards, not give off an aggressive vibe.

So you don't have the luxury to be like ""I dOn'T liKe To pLaY gAmEs"" because most men you are talking to are playing games with you.

Let's say you are talking to your mom or sister (assuming you have a good relationship) or a good friend, you can pretty much say whatever you want very directly and she will know what you mean. She can also speak to you very directly and you know what she means. There are no ""cOmMuNiCaTe"" issues, you are not confused, they are not confused, it's all straightforward. Because your mom, sister or good friend have no agenda or ulterior motive. They are also women with women's empathy and women's communication standards.

This isn't true of men, especially random men you might meet off of apps, social media or even in real life. They have lower empathy and generally worse communication standards, but more than that, they just lie by omitting information and/or by being unreliable narrators. You can't even directly ask them something in most cases because he can just lie some more, or he might get hostile. Men are generally unreliable narrators and they usually frame every narrative in favor of their own interests and their own sympathy. Women who are unaware that men do this are taking huge risks when they date or talk to men. 

So what should you do, if men are dishonest, have low empathy, bad communication standards, are unreliable narrators, omit information, make bolder lies when confronted and/or they get hostile if questioned? You have to read between the lines-- part of this is paying attention to actions. But as Mark Twain said **""Action speaks louder than words, but not nearly as often.”** Actions are always the best way to judge a person's character but there are less opportunities to observe actions in today's world. This is where reading between the lines, deducing motivations/possibilities and making educated guesses comes in. 

Reading between the lines-- what does he NOT say when he says something? Is what he is saying matching with his energy and body language? Trust body language and energy more than language because language is easily manipulated, body language is almost impossible to fake. Do you feel confused by him, do you think he is ""complicated""? All warning signs. A man who does not have nefarious intentions who isn't a manipulative douchebag, won't make you feel confused or like he is too difficult to understand. You can also spot psychological manipulation attempts, ego trips, attempted power plays, etc by reading between the lines. A good way of practicing this is by just observing males in general and noticing how predictable they are. 

Power of deduction for motivations/possibilities &amp; making educated guesses-- you can't know for sure 100% who a person is or what they are about without being a fly on the wall, but you can use power of deduction reasoning skills to come to educated guesses. Giving a man the benefit of the doubt instead of using your critical thinking skills works great for predators, fuckboys and abusive men who want to trick you, but it does you and fellow women ZERO favors. You can use power of deduction with great success by being a good observer, by examining possibilities and coming to conclusions based on known facts. If information is lacking on an individual, you can in most cases assume a person is NOT an outlier and WILL conform with his collective demographics general patterns. For example, if a guy looks, walks and acts like a fuckboy, he probably is one. You are wasting your time and energy if you put a lot of resources into trying to find out 100% if he is or not-- he probably is, he is likely not special. Another example is if let's say you're dating a divorced dad who has complicated feelings about his ex and has an addictive personality but is ""sober""-- it's an educated guess to come to the conclusion that his life and mind are too messy for it to be worth it for you to entertain him as a potential partner. He is most likely not the rare exception.

Women are largely discouraged from thinking critical thinking skills because we are conditioned to be people pleasers, to endlessly give men the benefit of the doubt despite the known risk and danger we when we do so, we are also shamed for being ""judgmental"". It can be hard at first to think this way, but after practice, after observing, it becomes easy because humans naturally think this way. Our ancestors had to think critically in order to survive their environments, to find food and shelter, to know what could possibly be a danger to them or not. Once you get used to it, it becomes easier and easier.",88341,"Vetting strategy: How to read between the lines, use power of deduction to read motivations/possibilities and how to make educated guesses.",0,,,

He asked for my number, I said sure. 

Then today he asked if he could call me and I said yes as I am always up for chatting on the phone (I like it more than texting and I can get a feel for the person). We spoke on the phone for about a half hour. He was nice but I honestly think he was a little weirder than I initially thought he was via text. He didn’t say anything raunchy or lewed. But he asked me about my previous relationship. Like how long I’ve been single and asked about my ex. Which I felt awkward by and I thought was a little too nosy tbh. I don’t think a person should ask something like that until much later. It felt invasive. 

He immediately asked to have a date with me this weekend after just matching yesterday. I declined saying I was busy. Oh and he asked if we could “FaceTime” instead of a phone call. I said no. He said he’d call me tomorrow but I just found myself cringing at that.

I’m asking this because media keeps repeating how porn can be used to enhance a couple’s sex life, but um, how? How does that even work? 90% is catered toward men and focused on women being objectified in uncomfortable positions and they’re perfect looking while the men all look like they’ve been rode hard and hung up wet. 

Porn is supposed to be a fantasy but Most male porn stars look like some greasy scrote you could find hanging out at your local gas station. 

There’s no fantasy involved in that.  You can get gas station guy any day of the week. Hell, just ride past your local bus stop and pick up some rando and they’ll probably be as attractive as the men in porn and the sex will be just as contrived, formulaic, male centered, and unfulfilling as any porn video.

&amp;#x200B;

After viewing the ever-popular sequel to the Kissing Booth series, I felt compelled to write an article with my opinion on the movie, on the protagonist and on the relationship messages in general. As FDS supports we know women deserve better media displays of healthy relationships and movies like KB2 can teach us some valuable lessons on how NOT to lead a relationship and not get played. 

&amp;#x200B;

For those not familiar with the movie, it follows high schooler Elle who has a best friend (Lee) whom she shares a special connection with. They even have a list of friendship rules to follow. However all of that changes when Elle breaks an important rule and dates Lee’s older brother.

&amp;#x200B;

Without further ado, let’s dive into the topic of lessons we can learn from Elle, the Flynn brothers and the other supporting characters in the series.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

🌟 1) SHE IS NOT ‘JUST A FRIEND’

&amp;#x200B;

One of the most jarring misconceptions in modern society is that men and women can just ‘be friends’ with no strings attached. This is rarely the case and depends on special circumstances. However, the KB2 does not show one of them. When Noah, Elle’s boyfriend moves to college, she notices him cozying up with a gorgeous female classmate. However Noah assures her they are ‘just friends’ despite all the evidence showing otherwise: playful kissing, touching, google eyes and shared outings. Despite the ending suggesting otherwise, ladies do not be fooled if you thinking that there was just friendship between them. 

&amp;#x200B;

🌟 2) DO NOT BUILD YOUR LIFE AROUND A MAN

&amp;#x200B;

Poor Elle is conflicted. She promised her best friend to go to the same college after graduating as their moms became friends there. Her boyfriend Noah wants her to come to his college after graduating. Whatever will she do? When faced with the impossible decision, stop , pause, breath, then choose what will work best for you.

&amp;#x200B;

🌟 3) NO COMMITMENT = NO SPECIAL TREATMENT

&amp;#x200B;

Elle falls into the category of the typical Pickmeisha girlfriend. Throughout the series, she tries so hard to be accommodating to her best friend, boyfriend, parents that she completely forgets herself. After her boyfriend moves to college, we catch glimpses of her change into a 👑 queen, however all of that is quickly dissolved at first storm. The truth of the matter is, if he doesn’t put a ring on it, you don’t owe him nothing. Elle ends up losing out on a new connection with a classmate who loves and supports her and isn’t able to properly convey her feelings about Noah’s cheating allegations because she is too stuck in her desire to keep the peace.

&amp;#x200B;

🌟 4) HE DOESNT LOVE YOU, HE WANTS TO CONTROL YOU

What happens when a guy calls the school pretending to be your dad so that you could talk to him. What about when he lies about his whereabouts because he doesn’t want you to get jealous. What about when he gaslights you for finding a female earring in his room? That’s right, you dump him. However this movie highlights that men can ‘make a lot of mistakes’ and sometimes ‘there are misunderstandings’ and that none of this evidence should overshadow his love for you. Ladies when the evidence is so glaring and when you keep asking yourself if you are going crazy, know that you are being manipulated. He doesn’t love you, he wants to control you. 

&amp;#x200B;

🌟 5) ACTIONS OVER WORDS

&amp;#x200B;

It was quite interesting how one of the most sympathetic characters in the movies was Rachel, Lee’s girlfriend. Boy does she get played again and again. From being put as the third wheel continuously as her boyfriend and the protagonist are so wrapped up in their friendship to notice her- to the lack of awareness about her boyfriend being emotionally unavailable....Rachel gets the short end of the stick from the first scenes of KB2 to the last. If your boyfriend keeps apologizing again and again for his mishaps and continues to lie to you and put you last. If he doesn’t understand the severity of his actions , but then runs back to you as soon as you break up with him. If a breakup is the only way to get him to listen - he is NOT the one.

&amp;#x200B;

🌟 6) IF YOU MEET SOMEONE ELSE, AND YOUR NOT MARRIED, GO FOR IT!

&amp;#x200B;

So many ladies think that BF/GF status is equal to a marriage contract. They serve and are faithful to their BF as if he was their husband. Ladies 👏🏼 wake 👏🏼 up 👏🏼! If there’s no ring on your finger, there is no commitment. So if you find yourself annoyed and unsatisfied, if you find that you are starting to like anouther man who is better suited for you....GO FOR IT! You don’t even need to explain! I cannot tell you how much Elle played herself when she chose her shady boyfriend over her classmate Marco with whom she shared a genuine connection, chemistry and hobbies. For what? For her boyfriend who didn’t give a damn about her feelings? For her boyfriend with whom she couldn’t even be genuine with? You got played sister!

&amp;#x200B;

🌟 7) HE AINT YOUR FRIEND

&amp;#x200B;

Our beloved side character Chloe is a hot shot. She is gorgeous, smart and has enigma and charisma. She is interesting to Noah and his friend group. She could have any man she wanted. Instead- our sister gets PLAYED by the man himself! She drapes herself on Noah knowing full well he has a girlfriend. She comes to thanksgiving dinner with his family in order to spike jealously between Noah and Elle. She gives Noah all the benefits of a girlfriend without any commitment. Now tell me- what kind of a friend sees that you have feelings for them and let’s you play yourself this hard? What kind of friend doesn’t draw the line? That’s right, one who doesn’t give a damn about you. So if you have a man in your life who is reaping all the emotional benefits off you , you can tell him where to go and what to do when he gets there. Or else you’ll find yourself falling for a man who will only break your heart.

&amp;#x200B;

🌟 8) SOMEONE WHO DOESNT LET YOU BE YOURSELF DOESNT LOVE YOU

&amp;#x200B;

KB2 is a prime example of toxic friendship. From the friendship rules to the constant need to apologize for doing what makes you happy, it prioritizes control over freedom and happiness. If you have a friend in your life who is making you choose between your happiness and then, they are NOT your friend. If you have a man who is pressuring you to do what he wants (cough, join his college) despite you having your own desires he is NOT a good partner. Spare yourself the heartbreak and delete these people out of your life : literally and figuratively .

I've always thought I was bisexual and I was just more into women than men, but lately I've been wondering if I even like men. 

I had a few crushes on boys and girls when I was in middle school and high school, but with boys it just seems like I attracted for no reason. I don't know how to explain it. I've only had crushes on a few guys and one of them was on my ex boyfriend and I was obsessed with him. I was extremely sexually and physically attracted to him, but everything seemed so rushed. We never even took the time to know each other. He was really flaky and emotionally abusive. Looking back I'm wondering why I decided to date him in the first place.

The only times I remember being extremely attracted to him is when I was in my teens and I had a lot of traumatic things going on during that time, so I'm thinking maybe I just gravitated towards him to get some attention? (I know thats not good and thats codependency). The last time I felt an extreme sexual attraction to him was when he would get attention from other girls (I know pickme shit) I'm just wondering if I just had sex with him to fill some empty void. 

We had a lot of sexual tension, but when we had sex I didn't enjoy it at all. I'm really not here to bash him, but it doesn't make it better that he wasn't good at having sex. I just thought their would be a spark when we had sex, but I just didn't get it. I don't even think I like looking at dicks..their starting to look weird to me.Years before I had sex with him I had sex with girl friend of mine and the chemistry was a lot better. We actually took our time to know each other first before and the sex was a lot better, but that relationship turned toxic, so I had to cut her off. 

I've been actively scrolling and commenting on this sub for a while now and I always thought I could see myself marrying a man, but now I don't know. Most men I see I'm not physically or sexually attracted to. I don't know if its because most men aren't attractive or what. I've only been sexually attracted to a handful of men in my life. I think I might just like the idea of a man more than a man lol. 

What really made me write this is I kept saying myself for months that I really don't care if I end up with a man or not. I've never been in an romantic relationship with a woman and the thought of it kind of scares me for some reason....I've been scrolling through these post on how to get an hvm and I really don't want to do all of the steps.  I honestly could care less if all men fell off the face of the Earth tomorrow even the ""good"" ones. I hope this doesn't seem like an,"" I hate men,"" rant even though most of them are sick. Even though I was in an abusive relationship I'm not running towards women some sort of coping strategy I've already liked women for a long time I'm just confused if I like men at all. I'm still in my early 20's so I'm sure the advice is going to be to keep on exploring I'm just really confused.",90655,Being on this sub is making me realize I might not be attracted to men,0,,,

He's a nice guy, but he's a supervisor of maintenance and I think is used to a male dominated environment. Anyway, I was available to answer questions while he was getting settled. I'm very friendly, chatty, and laugh easily. He even called me ""his unicorn"" which struck me as odd. I've made an effort to distance myself from him. 

He's not my supe, but I'm involved in his department. I work independently and don't need supervision but I really had to stand up for myself ever time he insinuated I would act in an assistant type role with him. I'm guessing he got that idea from his boss, who used to be his boss elsewhere, and is pretty disconnected from the actual workings of individual employees. But I've literally had to put my stop sign up so many times already and it's frustrating. My actual supervisor (a woman) hasn't responded to the one email I sent about it and I had already expressed a concern before he was even hired that the new guy might have ideas of my role since I am a woman. Once he even said in response to my assertion that I don't work with him much and I'm not his assistant.. ""But what if I have stuff to file??"" /facepalm. I'm in acccounting dude.. file your own stuff. 

Anyway I've kept a friendly attitude about it while standing up for myself. Doesn't come easy to me because I don't feel comfortable asserting myself, but I also won't let a man walk all over me. A couple weeks ago he asked me to walk with him to the coffee place and I'm like Uh no thanks.. Then he makes a comment to me later how ""he's sensitive"" and then there I am reassuring him it wasn't personal. We're both in our 40s, he's married, I'm not. I'm not going to start creating a personal anything with a supervisor at work, let alone a married one. I'm sure he just thinks he's being friendly but the misogyny is ripe. He even apologized once for not introducing me to his family when they were here because ""you're social distancing"". Okay? I don't care whether I meet them? 

So I'm feeling good about standing my ground but I need to get better at keeping it more business like, less friendly. But it's just who I am. I made a joke on a call with him this last week that ended with ""But really I'm not sure so check with so and so.. I'm kinda just pulling it out of my ass"" and he cracked up SO HARD while saying ""Oh my god I like you so much!"" It weirded me out. So anyway what led me to write this was today. He calls me to ask a question and mentions how he missed our scheduled talks while I was at home because ""You're so in the background I forget about me"". Huh? Now I'm feeling like he's trying to manipulate me into being like ""No I'm here! Don't forget about meeeeeeee"" where instead I just laughed and said ""I do most of my work independently and like being in the background."" I don't even know that he's doing it on purpose. I don't get a ""oh he likes me and wants to cheat on his wife"" vibe but then again I'm not very good at spotting interest in a guy anyway. This got long, but I'm curious your experiences working with male higher ups, especially in a male dominated environment. Am I tripping about feeling like he's being manipulated or is this my gut saying ""pay attention""?",90643,"This isn't about dating, but it is about how men treat women",0,,,

He currently lives with his parents whereas I own my own place. He is in the process of buying a place but won't be complete in 6-7months. Usually I would have nexted but he had a clear plan to get there so I thought I would keep him in my rotation and take it date by date. 

Earlier we had a conversation where we were joking around and I said ""yeah you can come over"", then he says ""really?! It would be a bit odd as my parents would wonder where I'm going"". Which led me to ask if he lives in Alcatraz or has a curfew (he's 33) and also I asked about his previous serious relationships. He did answer but then got pretty upset and said my questions had re-ignited his insecurities that he lived with his parents and had some shitty relationships in the past. He also said he just didn't want to be asked any more tough questions! 

I just said I didn't mean to make him feel bad and wanted to understand what I was dealing with but didn't have to discuss it further. He said he would rather tell me about it face to face (we have a date coming up that hes planned and organised). I just ended the conversation and tbh feel put off the guy. It's one thing to say you are in the process of leveling up but still have confidence in yourself but it's another to let your insecurities out with a woman you are meant to be impressing and trying to be with. Surely a large part of dating is asking difficult questions and learning about someone! Why make me feel guilty for doing something so normal?! 

I've dated men with insecurities before and they end up pulling me down or using me to be that emotional labourer and reassure them that their situations are fine and acceptable. I don't have the strength for that anymore, this sub has helped me do some serious leveling up from my old Pickmeshia ways.

However, for the first time in human history, women are becoming the dominant sex in society. This transition is happening before our very eyes. Society has moved in a direction that is simply better suited to the modern woman, as women are thriving and excelling in the modern age by all metrics. Men on the other hand, are going into a serious phase of decline as their social status dwindles and men become increasingly obsolete. This is why we encounter so many LVMs today. I expect there to be a widespread emasculation of today’s men over the coming decades, as men are embarrassingly shunted to the lower levels of society and women assume control. I will set out the reasons for this shift in power.

Firstly, girls have have been outperforming boys in the education system for the past while. Girls results in second level education is much higher than the boys, and the gap in performance continues to widen. Furthermore, girls both outnumber and outperform boys in third level education. More than 60% of college graduates in the US are women, while 66% of those obtaining PhDs will be women. So for every 2 men who graduate from college, 3 women will graduate. Many expected the rate of graduation to level out at 50% as sexism is removed as a factor. However women not only greatly surpassed that level, but the gap is continuing to get larger, as more and more highly ambitious, successful young women are going to, and excelling in college. Men on the other hand, are graduating at lower rates than before and are withering. Girls also significantly outperform boys in almost all school subjects, even the STEM subjects, across almost all western countries. We are providing the same opportunities to everyone, girls are simply outperforming the boys. Women also outperform men in college, which is a continuation of the trends we have witnessed. 

In addition to this, women are beginning to establish their dominance in the workplace. Men’s median hourly rate of pay is still higher than women’s, primarily due to the antiquated levels of workplace misogyny that have yet to be stamped out in some areas. While men may cling on to this, they will not be earning more for long. The current cohort of young successful women in their 20s earn significantly more than men of the same age. This can be attributed to female outperformance in education, which is directly translating into the salaries they earn. As more and more of these women who are outperforming men move from education into employment, women at every age level will be earning more than men. Women are also prioritising their careers instead of staying at home to look after children while men go out and work. This is a thing of the past. If you are a young girl/women in your teens or 20s, you can expect to earn significantly than men in 20 years time. So if you get a partner or get married, it is more likely that you will be the breadwinner and the higher income earner. Men will feel incredibly humiliated and emasculated by this revolution, but it is the uncomfortable truth they are going to have to accept. 

Finally, it is painfully obvious that men’s physical advantages have been made completely obsolete. Physical violence is no longer part of our society, as it was in the past, so it removes the advantage men held for so long due to greater strength. A huge number of men’s jobs are going to be wiped out by AI, particularly manufacturing jobs and low skilled labour. This will be devastating to many men, as it will leave them unemployed and relying on society for support. Women on the other hand, are robust and thriving, and as part of the service based economy they will be able to easily brush off increasing automation of jobs as they will not be affected nearly as much. 

In conclusion, it is clear to me that we are going to see a new, thriving matriarchy developing over the coming decades. We are already entering into it right now. The feminisation of society’s values (which is very much a good thing for everyone) means women will be much more prominent, while masculinity has been rightly criticised, ridiculed and grilled. The decline of men onto the fringes of society is going to be incredibly emasculating, which will likely result in more LVMs being around. But for us women, it is a wonderful time to be alive! We will get to experience a society in which women are the ones dominating, so let’s enjoy it 💕🌸

It's pretty great.

HOWEVER, since quarantine, LVM will apparently ogle over anything they perceive to have a vagina. I have two places I go to unwind: my community garden plot and my gym. At both spaces, I was openly OGLED by older men. At the gym the other day (which has windows onto the street - WHY DO GYMS DO THIS?) a man stopped to stare at me while I was exercising, even giving me a thumbs-up when I flipped him off. This was annoying but not nearly as bad as what happened at the garden yesterday. My plot is on the edge of the garden, which is surrounded by a fence. There are vines growing all over the fence. A man sticks his head literally through the vines to stare at me while I was working. And he just stood there. For about 20 minutes. Watching me. I ignored him and even started fake-coughing in his direction, hoping to scare him away but nope. He just stood there with his hands on the fence, head through the vines, watching. 

The worst is that when I went to go get some tools, I saw another man working in the garden who clearly saw the man watching me. He kept looking at me, and then over at the man, as if he was considering saying something to me. But he didn't. He just kept doing his own thing and casually on-looking while this guy was being a total creep.

We just broke up yesterday. I was “addicted” to him and obsessed with him. He was actually great in bed, and he could be so charming and sweet when he felt like it...key term “when he felt like it.” I’m much younger, I am 20 and he is 28.

The rest of the time, it was highs and lows, ups and downs. He would blow me off and ignore me. He would cancel on me for no reason. I’d cry almost every day trying to figure out why he was mad at me, I’d send him endless texts trying to talk to him. Sometimes he’d be super mean for no reason. I made mistakes too, but I feel like ultimately I was loving and supportive to him. 

I felt worthless when things were bad, elated when things were good, but honestly there were more bad days than good days. He’d randomly be “totally in love with me” and talk about living together for like a week, then switch back to being cold and mean. I now know this was “love bombing.” 

He didn’t used to do this, but in the past few months he started asking me for money constantly, asking me to buy him small things and I did. I regret that. In the past few months he really was just using me. I caught him on Tinder so many times but he always had an excuse, he never apologized. I don’t know why things got so bad in the last few months but he started acting sick of me.

We finally broke up yesterday. He broke up with me. I hadn’t seen him in over a week because he had been “working.” Then I found out from his sister that he quit his job over a week ago, so he was just lying. She also told me she thinks he’s cheating on me and I deserve better. I made a fake Tinder account, found him on there, and catfished him then blocked him. 

I went to pick up my stuff from his house yesterday and he was cold, smirking and laughing. Yet for some reason, he hasn’t blocked me and still wants to continue playing an online game with me. We played last night and he kept talking to me in the chat, said we are “friends” now and kept repeating that. Not sure what that’s about.

All in all, I feel stupid for putting up with that for so long, I think he must be a narcissist or sociopath. I know he lies to his closest friend and family constantly.

That’s not the case for me personally, though.  I literally was using birth control only to prevent pregnancy and allow me to not use condoms with a partner (lol, yes I was stupid).

I’ve decided to 100% go off of my birth control in another show of a) committing to waiting a long time to have sex when I begin dating again and b) prioritizing myself and my own health over the pleasure of a man when the time comes that I do get intimate with a man again.

I’ve been on birth control of some sort for over a decade.  I even almost died from an ectopic pregnancy because I didn’t know that antibiotics made birth control ineffective (I was 19).  I have such a poor semblance of how my body functions without constant unnatural hormones coming in. I just want to know what it feels like to be a woman without birth control in my blood stream.  

I honestly never thought I would get to this point. I know it sounds lame but it feels so freeing.

I used to work for this hiring agency. Multiple times a year we would attend these job fairs and they'd put me there as a salesperson. The idea was to collect a lot of cv's from individuals looking for a job, but also to network with companies who were looking for partners who could help them with their HR needs.

When I was there, my colleagues and I would encounter a number of different people. But one type in particular is engraved my mind. This was an individual who would feign interest in the company only to walk away with a free goodybag without losing ""face"". We had to deal with these people from most common to least common: 

1. Looking for a job.
2. Browsing around collecting free stuff.
3. Browsing around collecting free stuff but feigning interest. 
4. Exchanging business details with other companies. 

The other day I was doing mental gymnastics because I couldn't figure out this guy that I was talking to. He would pretend to like me. He would swear up and down how much he likes me yet his actions show the complete opposite. I didn't get it. He was so hell-bent on telling me how he likes me everytime I tried to cut him loose. Action-wise, he would just throw mediocre breadcrumbs my way. I just didn't fucking get it. Let me go, just be normal about it. Why are you being completely deceptive and lying about how you're actually feeling? I had to figure it out or at the very least make sense of his behavior, especially because it's not uncommon at all. 

When you work in sales you deal with all kinds of people and placing him in the category of the guy who wants goodies for free but doesn't want to be judged for it, it all makes sense now. 

These were individuals that would ask questions about our company, would ask when it was established. Elaborate a little on one of the services (""oh you provide training courses too? What kind?""). But in the end there was absolutely no point to him asking any of these questions. It lead nowhere. They would just extend the conversation for as long as possible while their eyes shifted between the colorful bags and me until I suggested ""hey would you like a bag?"" and for them to thank me, cut the conversation off and move onto the next booth. Wham bam thank you ma'am! People like this exist and this analogy sort of makes me understand fuckboys a little better now.

In general I don't like letting even my friends/family pay for things because I feel guilty. I do pretty well financially for myself so I have no problem paying for things. 

In my last relationship for the first 2.5 years he didn't work (at first was a student but then just took forever to get his shit together) and I did so I ended up paying for almost everything. Even when he had a job he would always make comments on how much dinner cost, etc so I ended up still paying a lot because I couldn't handle the guilt. I hugely regret my financial investment in that relationship because he ended up cheating on me and we broke up earlier this year. LVM!

Anyways, I'm dating a great guy now. Definitely HVM. Super sweet and understanding of me wanting to take things slow because of my ex but also made it clear very early on that he wanted to be in a relationship with me. He has a good job and always offers to pay for everything. I still offer and have paid here and there, but I feel so guilty still. He has never complained and even when I do pull out my wallet he makes a point of beating me to it. He is planning a place for us to go out to dinner tonight and I love that he is making the plans but I immediately felt guilty that he's going to pay. How the hell do I get over this?

However, what isn’t helpful is to dismiss the very valid feelings of sadness and lingering attachment. It’s completely normal to cry over a LVM. It’s completely normal to even want them back. Love works in a very similar way to addiction, and healing takes time. If you feel sad about the end of a relationship, it does not mean you are weak or stupid. It means you have the ability to love and invest in something you deem to be worthwhile. Not everyone is capable of doing this. For anyone who’s going through a breakup or another disappointment, it’s okay if you don’t feel happy or okay right now. Sit with your feelings. Grieve. Cry if you need to. It’s better out than in.

It’s okay if you haven’t reached your potential as a HVW yet.

In order to effectively work on yourself, you need to let go of the shame. None of the above means you’re a terrible person who will never be loved. Work on how you talk to yourself. Practice re-framing your thoughts (I love cognitive behavioral psychology). Read the handbook over and over, and re-visit it from time to time.

Loving yourself doesn’t mean you should let yourself go and indulge yourself in harmful behaviors that feel good only in the moment. Loving yourself means you want to better yourself so that you can be fulfilled and be proud of what you can accomplish for yourself.

How do you love yourself if you don’t? It’s not an overnight journey, of course. Start by taking care of yourself, even if it’s just small steps for now.

I cannot take this anymore. I got recommended some Hot post on r/awfuleverything, which was talking about the Brock Turner case, one of the most blatant instances of rape culture in our legal system and injustices on behalf of victimized women. The case where a man was CAUGHT in the act by two people, raping an unconscious woman, but was only given 6 months in jail. He got off 3 months early for good behavior while his victim will have to live with what happened to her, and the trauma of her trial (""what did you have for dinner? What did you have to drink? What were you wearing?"") for the rest of her life. 

&amp;nbsp;

She's obviously not the only one. This happens to millions of girls worldwide a year. It happens TO US, NOT MEN. AND NO, THIS RANT WILL NOT INCLUDE ADDITIVES SUCH AS ""it happens to women most of the time"" or in any way make note of the exceptions where a woman rapes a man. I'm sick to fucking death of EVERY conversation about women's issues being derailed and overriden with scrotes just because it can happen to them too. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE, THIS IS ABOUT THE RULE. Lets not forget that even when it does happen to men, it's almost always committed by another man. 

&amp;nbsp; 

BUT PLEASE, LETS STOP THE WHOLE THREAD TO TALK ABOUT HOW WOMEN CAN RAPE TOO, HOW RAPE CULTURE IS ALSO MISANDRY, HOW THERE ARE MEN DOING TIME FOR FALSE ACCUSATIONS, AND HOW WOMEN NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE. 

&amp;nbsp; 

#SHUT THE FUCK UP

&amp;nbsp; 

MEN, NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT YOUR ""WHAT ABOUT THE MEN"" TWO CENTS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU. THIS IS ABOUT RAPE, VIOLENCE AGAINST US, AGAINST WOMEN. RAPE, A CRIME THAT HAPPENS PRIMARILY TO US, BY PRIMARILY YOU. This is about Chanel Miller and what happened to her and millions like her and you HAVE to make it about you. You HAVE to make it about the 1 in a thousand times where a woman rapes a man instead of what happens every fucking day--MEN RAPING WOMEN AND GETTING AWAY WITH IT. Every fucking time men have to make sure the rest of us acknowledge that it's not just about us because they can't fucking handle the thought of something being their fault. 

&amp;nbsp;

#RAPE CULTURE IS NOT MISANDRY. IT IS MYSOGNY. IT IS BASED OFF THE IDEA THAT WOMEN'S PURPOSE IS TO BE USED AS A HOLE TO BE FUCKED AT ANY TIME BY ANYBODY. THAT IS OUR DEFAULT STATE.

It's not that I'm very attractive (but  I'm still more attractive than most men, because I take really good care of myself), I have typical masculine hobbies and I guess that's why  lots of men swipe right. Obviously, I'm a catch, but they don't know  that yet.

My problem is that I  have lots of men greeting me. Obviously, I'm not answering those that  write me 'hi' or 'hello', when I have multiple especific hobbies they  could write about if we had any of those in common. It either shows a  lack of effort, or that we don't even share one of those in common (but  mostly lack of effort). Also, I'm not answering those that ask me for a  picture of my face (I only have a picture of my hair and back for  professional reasons), because I feel they are not looking for a long  term partner and only care about the sex.

But  how do I optimize my time answering to those that actually put effort  in the initial message? At this point, I'm not sure I want a BF right  now (I was broken up with after a 7 year relationship a few months ago).  I'm enjoying worrying only about what I want and focusing all my energy  on me. I guess I've also become cynical about love, after being dumped  like that. I could want one if I met the man of my dreams, but I won't  put up with losers. I absolutely don't want casual hook ups or friends  with benefits. I'd really like friends, though, and I know that Tinder  isn't the app to look for friends but none of the other apps for friends  that people usually recommend are used in my area.

What I'm looking for in a BF? I'm looking for qualities that I also have. That means:

\-Someone tall.

\-Professionally  ambitious (which is going to prove tricky as I'm in the 99.99% of  earnings for people my age), that means that his earning potential is on  par with mine at least, and it's currently earning a decent amount, as I  refuse to bring down my quality of life to match his or to pay for him  (I funded my ex and I still got dumped, so no, thank you).

\-But  also, I'm unwilling to sacrifice myself for his profession. Mine can  only be done in the current city where I live, so obviously I won't be  moving anywhere else.

\-Family  oriented, but not the typical guy who expects me to rip my body popping  out his children and then to also take care of them. No fucking way  that's happening. I want an equal partnership (hahahahaha, impossible, I  know).

\-A highly educated and  cultivated person, which I am. Must like travelling to historical  places, and have money for it (I refuse to pay for anybody else).  Similar hobbies (literature, history, cinema, TV series, geeky things  like gaming and D&amp;D).

\-Somebody  who is not intro drinking, smoking, drugs,partying or lifestyles more  than hobbies (vegans, surfers, climbers...). More introverted than  extroverted.

\-Someone good and generous at sex, and with no weird hangups (like BDSM) and doesn't watch porn.

\-A  good person, which is honestly something very difficult to know. I fell  in love with my ex because I thought he was a good person and... he was  for 6 years, until he fell out of love with me and dumped me out of the  blue, instead of trying to work in the relationship.

\-And someone who treats me like the queen I am.

I've  read the handbook, but I still have trouble sorting out all the guys  who write to me. I guess I feel like it's violent to ask them these  questions when they are asking me what my favourite film of 2019 was or  talking about videogames. And them there I am, wanting to know how tall  they are or what job and education they have. As I'm also looking for  friends, those wouldn't be necessary qualifications for a friend.

But  I hate spending time on Tinder, I have a million more interesting  things to do. I'd love to talk to them in person, if I could verify they  weren't creeps. I can't really know if I could become attracted to  someone if I don't know them in person. So far, someone asked me to go  to watch a movie with him, but honestly? I don't think that's a very  good first date. You can't get to know someone that way, I had already  watched that movie and I'm not spending 3+ hours with someone I don't  know.

Is there any dating strategy  you can recommend so I can sort out guys and know who I should be  focusing on? Thank you FDS, you've changed my life.",92686,How do you weed out men in OLD?,0,,,

Hi Ladies - !

We are still getting requests to sign up for, [TheRealFemaleDatingStrategy.com](https://www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com/), and we are overwhelmed by the response - thank you!!

Thank you for bearing with us through all the changes we’ve been making on the site!

To make the sign up process smoother - we have consolidated the 8 digit code request form and the sign up form into one single form! 

**As of August 1st, 2020 The new sign up - process is:**

1. Enter your desired login username, password, and email address in the Sign Up Form

2. Choose one platform from the drop down menu to verify your account (Instagram, Reddit, or Twitter) and enter your social media user details 

3. Click ‘Sign Up’

4. You will receive an automated email after signing up verifying we received your application

5. Send FDS a direct message from your social media account on your platform of choice (Instagram, Reddit, or Twitter) 

6. FDS will reply to your message with a 9 DIGIT CODE

7. Reply to your automated verification email with the 9 digit code sent to your social media account 

8. FDS moderators will review and approve! 

***If you were given one of our old 8 digit codes and have not yet signed up, then please follow the instructions above and reply back to your automated email with the 8 digit code you were given***


**A FEW NOTES:**

1. **We are only accepting 9 digit code requests through the website.** If you PM me or any of the mods on Reddit, Instagram or Twitter we will be redirecting you to the website. This helps us keep track of all the requests in one place. [Click here to request an 9 digit code.](https://www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com/8-digit-code)


2. **Use Instagram or Twitter for an expedited approval process.** Our reddit requests are backlogged and many of you are far too new for us to verify your account on the website. For expedited sign up, please apply with your instagram or twitter accounts.

3. **Please make sure you can receive DMs on your platform of choice.** There were some people we tried to send codes to who had their Direct Messages disabled, so we had to pass. If you are unsure, please DM the official FDS twitter or instagram accounts so we can respond.

4. **Please be patient! Due to demand, We are on about a 5 day lag on sending out 9 digit codes.** If you are not an existing sub member or someone we can easily identify as female from your social media, OR we can't reach you, you will likely be passed over for someone else in the queue.

5. **If you do not sign up within 60 days of receiving your code, you will be bumped from the approval queue completely and will have to start over.** We have some members who we've sent codes to who as of yet have yet to create an account. Please do so ASAP!

6. **Our website is now available via the Wix app!** It can be dowloaded for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wix-app-website-builder/id1099748482) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wix.android&amp;hl=en_US)! Use the code ""WZBOVG"" to join the app page **AFTER** you have requested and received your 8 digit code. If you join through the app without the 8 digit code, it will be rejected.

**FORUM:**

1. **Once you are approved, please log in** [**and say hello in the Forum!**](https://www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com/forum) We just want to make sure it is working for everyone. All new members are restricted to one post per day for their first week of membership to make moderation easier for us while we get the website off the ground.

2. **The Strategy subforums and Sex subforum on the website are for members only** \- this is to protect the privacy of our members who want to ask sensitive questions.

Then they had to leave and the third guy hung back to talk to me some more outside which was fine because I was smoking a cigarette anyways. Then he said I want to show you something and see what you think and handed me his phone. I took it thinking it would be innocent because, well, he came over with missionaries, sooo...
Nope, it was his nasty dick and balls. I about dropped the phone and made a look of disgust. He just laughed and said sorry, my girl told me today I was on the small side and wanted to know what you thought. 
I gave him his phone back and said well, you misjudged this situation entirely. And then I went inside and locked my door. 

What. The. Fuck.

I’ve had LDS kids over for these cooking lessons for like ten years now, they are in a cult, they miss home, and I enjoy being friends with them when they basically have none.

These are people who have a secret crush and do all sorts of things for someone. Oftentimes they go way out of their way to help or minister to someone, but all along the way, they have ulterior motives. Then, when the “target” does not return the affection, they feel hurt and act like a victim, as if the target had done something horrible. All along the way, the target thought that they were “just friends.” 

There is nothing wrong with being friends and getting to know another person to see what kind of relationship you are going to have. Sometimes relationships that begin as friendships turn into more and are some of the best long-term relationships. But that is different than having clear designs on someone and deceiving them long-term while you have another agenda. 

Certainly you don’t have to put all of your cards on the table very early when you have a crush on a person. But devious designs and appropriate shrewdness are two very different things. Don’t act like a friend that you are not. The best way to tell is to ask yourself, “What will happen if this does not end like I desire?” If you can honestly say that you will be very happy continuing to be friends and will love the person as a friend, then you are being honest. If you say, “If they do not want me back like I want them, I do not care about being ‘friends’ at all,” then your friendship is a scam. Only you know for sure.""

I can both feel empathy at how hard dating can be for anyone, and also be strong and clear in knowing a guy who’s so in the habit of being rude he’d show that side early on even to a woman he’s interested in is so not someone I’d be happy with. I never let me empathy for his feelings override enforcing my boundaries with something so important for my peace of mind. I don’t make excuses for why it’s understandable to be acting disrespectfully. 

**What are some other dealbreakers you have especially early on, when you haven’t had much time observing him? **

(Just to be perfectly clear, I strongly feel we really have to know how a man behaves over an extended period of time to get an accurate sense of what kind of man he is. Some of the most abusive men can start off acting like the nicest guy you’ve ever met, and maintain that act for awhile before his true colors are revealed.

So I've been slowly watching season 2 of Umbrella Academy this week, and last week I updated myself on season one.

Here are some characters I think are HVM, and why:

**Luther:** Wow. I'm watching the episode where Luther finds out&gt;! Allison married another man in 1960,!&lt; and his reaction, while pained, was so HV. He told her &gt;!he was glad she wasn't alone for the apocalypse!&lt;, and ""no one is allowed to tell you how you should handle the end of the world.""

He is also protective, smart, and kind. He is one of my favorite men in the show.

*Questionable:* **Hazel:** I just loved the relationship between Hazel and&gt;! Agnes. !&lt;He's protective of her, kind, giving, and loyal. They stayed together until &gt;!she passed away!&lt;. **However,** when he was partners with Cha-Cha, he was a doofus. Cha-Cha was the brains behind their missions, and Hazel was often a liability due to his recklessness. However, he did provide some muscle when needed, and he was cunning in later episodes in season 1.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a character I think is LVW, especially in season 1:

**Vanya:** Vanya is a straight-up Pickme, and this leads to &gt;!horrible miscommunications with her siblings, and, well, the apocalypse, ultimately. !&lt;She never listens when there are tons of red flags about &gt;!Leonard. !&lt;However, I understand&gt;! she was neglected and abused as a child, and she never had experience with men. !&lt;We've all been Vanya, to some degree.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear your thoughts! There's a lot more to be said about the show.",88086,Umbrella Academy discussion: HV and LV characters in relationships. [SPOILERS],0,,,

In addition to this, she drives him to and from work, and lends him money. She's planning on moving out with him and paying 100% for the bills. She would cry about the situation every 6 months, break up with him, then get back together with him. I hope one day she will leave him and find a partner, not a parasite.

I was reminiscing and reading through my old posts, and I cringed my face off when I read my very first post on that account. It brought back memories I had repressed.  

It was from around five years ago.  I was 28 at the time.  I had been with my NVM for less than a year.  I made a post on the gaming subreddit asking how I can improve at video games, because my boyfriend told me I was too bad at games to play around him, and he said he didn’t want to play around him anymore.  And get this—in the post I said I got “a little bit” jealous when his female gamer friend came over because he would play with her but refused to play with me!  By the way, this woman was his former FWB who lived with him rent-free just four months before we started our relationship.  How the hell did I allow myself to be conned into letting them hang out together alone?  

I am still embarrassed and cringing at the things I put up with in my Pickme days. However, it also made me realize that I’ve come a LONG way in those five years.  

I recommend you take some time to reflect on how far you’ve come in your leveling up journey.  We’re frequently hard on ourselves, and feel embarrassed about how low value we were and the Pickme traits we exhibited.  But it also feels good to realize how much we’ve grown and the progress we’ve made.  Maybe take a look at an old account, read some of your old journals, or just spend a few minutes with your memories and reflect on how much of a queen you are now.",88050,"Sisters, I recommend reflecting on how far you’ve come in your journey from being a Pickme to the Queen you are now.

I thought it was normal and a way to ""express"" my sexuality, and that people shouldn't be shamed for watching porn. I didn't know about how horrible the industry is, and how it is a sickness to our society that people do not want to discuss. I didn't know that I was contributing to the rape, degradation, abuse, and trafficking of women and children. I didn't think about the woman in the video, and how oftentimes they were coerced into doing it, and even raped on camera. I didn't know that women only lasted an average of 3 months as porn stars, because of how terrible the job is not only for their bodies, but for their mental health. I didn't know that many of ex porn stars suffer from PTSD. I didn't see the ""actors"" as humans. 

After watching Hot Girls Wanted and diving into radical feminism, I was absolutely horrified. I truly didn't know or think about these things, and after I couldn't watch porn without thinking about how the girl in the video is probably suffering. 

So yesterday my female friend made a joke about porn and I told her that I don't watch it because of the reasons above. She felt uncomfortable and didn't really seem to care about the facts I presented to her. It breaks my heart that even fellow women don't care about other women's wellbeing, and will willingly jerk off to what could be child pornography and rape. 

I truly want more people to stop watching porn because if there is less demand, there will be less supply. I want to contribute in the ways that I can to end such a horrendous industry, that hurts the actors and society collectively (porn is normalizing violence against women). It makes me angry to the core to see something that should be shamed, being celebrated and openly accepted. As someone who was raped, it infuriates me that people willingly jerk off to women being raped on camera.",89121,Even female friends refuse to listen to the horrors about porn...,0,,,

I said I was looking for a serious relationship, he fed it right back to me. On the third date, he tried to get me to come back to his house. I politely refused, and he put up a huge fuss. He made physical moves on me in his car, started feeling me up, and I shot him down firmly, saying I wasn't interested in hooking up. He said he really wanted to have sex that night to ""see if we were sexually compatible."" I said I wasn't interested in having casual sex and reaffirmed that I was looking to date more seriously.

This dude lays it on thick. Says he is also looking to date seriously but wanted to ""enjoy the experience"" and ""ensure we were a good match in bed"" and that ""how could we be sure we were a match without seeing our chemistry?"" I said that it was nice, but that nothing he could say would change my mind and that I wasn't going to have sex with him tonight. He asked if I would have sex with him the next time, and I said honestly, I take a long time to warm up and I would only do so when I felt comfortable. He continued to try to convince me right up until he dropped me off, saying that ""I could trust him."" 

Yesterday, I received a text from him, essentially explaining he has been dating another woman who he has discovered he has a ""better connection with and is more sexually confident"" and was going to choose her since ""he wasn't sure if we were compatible or not yet,"" and that he ""hoped I understood that he didn't want to date two women at the same time for a long period of time.""

Right. So he wanted to sexually sample us like Baskin Robins, pick his favourite one in bed and make his choice based on that. He didn't even try to get to know me as a person before getting in my pants- so much for connection! The other poor lass probably hasn't a clue.

The first date was really nice, we had flowing conversation and we were laughing and I felt some sort of chemistry. 

He did pay for the date and texted me when I got home. We scheduled another date three days later. 

The second date went really well too except for one thing. My horny and tipsy self (we shared a bottle of wine at the restaurant) invited him over to my place and we ended up sleeping together and he spent the night. 
I didnt stay to cuddle with him when I woke up I got up directly and took and shower and prepared my coffee. He left right after after kissing me goodbye and telling me he would see me soon. 
So I thought to myself ok may be I didnt follow the rules by sleeping with him but it will be okay. 
Its not. 

I didnt hear back from the guy for three days after that. 

I regressed and proceeded to ask him out on a park date later this week, to which he answered me that he was pretty busy all week and even had plans the week end. I sent him an oh ok to which he left me on seen. 

I didnt hear back from him for the rest of the week. Two days ago I decided to take him off all my social media which in our day and age is a pretty straightforward message. 

The guy did like me and was attracted to me but not enough. He only wanted sex and once he got it his interested faded away. Im sure I was gonna hear back for him some time later they always do that, but I dont get breadcrumbed or hit up anymore. If 100% interest is not there since the beginning it will never be. And the fact that he blew me off is a turn off. What kind of woman would I be if I accepted to go on a date with him after he blew me off like that. 

I get that he could have had plans or a busy week, but not even a text to say hello or anything is a stretch and that shows lack of interest.

So fds is 100% right. I wont be sleeping anytime soon with a guy until I see commitment and 100% interest, and no more asking men out. 

Still learning from my mistakes!",89099,Im learning everyday with fds,0,,,

I’m a virgin and I started exploring my sexuality a few months ago. Which meant watching porn and having my first orgasm. But also... exploring some darker things that I definitely would NOT be into in real life.

I don’t know why I have these fantasies, but I didn’t used to. It used to be vanilla and loving, usually about people I had crushes on. 

I’ve changed a lot, and have started to fantasise about sex as more of a physical thing than an emotional one. This is partly because I don’t have any crushes at the moment and have decided to just focus on myself.

But now vanilla/ romantic sex seems boring and I keep getting off to weird shit. I’ve lowered my porn intake but now I just fantasise about this shit instead.

I don’t even know if I should describe it. I don’t want to be hit, but I fantasise about “CNC” if you could call it that 🤮

But the thought of it actually happening makes me sick to my stomach.

I think because I’m so open and accepting of sex it almost makes it boring? Like I don’t see regular sex as taboo or “naughty” so I seek out stuff that is. 

How can I be in touch with my sexuality while also not having disturbing fantasies? Should I just stop masterbating for a while?",89050,Help for a virgin kinkmeisha?,0,,,

I’ve (35F) been with my boyfriend (42M) since two months, after years of him courting me. He did everything to get me, expensive gifts, thoughtful dates, a lot of small gestures to let me know I’m important - so I know from experience, FDS is right, if a guy wants you, he would collect the stars from the sky for you. And he did it for me. Since he proved himself right, I let myself believe in this relationship. 

But a couple of weeks ago I found out he has a friendship with a girl, who is accidentally also my enemy from my previous workplace (they also worked together years ago). She is 8 years younger than me, and I think she is a women hater narcissist, who made my time at that workplace really miserable. I’m not the only one whom she made suffer - she is usually nice with the boys and mean with the girls. She has a really nasty personality, I hear stories about her fucked up things from others in our professional field all the time.

They exchange a lot of text messages, and I have the suspicion my boyfriend tried to hide them from me. His phone doesn’t display the sender of the incoming messages, but couple of times I was able to see that she texts him a LOT.
I asked him if they would meet behind my back, but he said no. (They also share common interests in sports I’m not practicing.) I expressed to him that this situation bothers me, but he definitely protected the evil girl, saying she is not that bad, she had a hard life, and she knows she made mistakes in the past, and she is really sorry about it (but she never actually said sorry to the colleagues she hurt..). He says he is kind of a “father figure” to this girl (yeah I know, I just vomited in my mouth too), they are just friends, and she stood firmly there for him, when he was heartbroken because of me. So he can’t end this friendship just because we are dating now. 

So I tried to move on and forget about it. But Yesterday she messaged him several times while I was giving him a back massage. You can imagine how that felt. 

What should I do? How could I handle this situation with dignity? I don’t want to seem desperate or jealous. But this makes me weak. I kept checking her social media, until I blocked her because I started to feel insecure. 

What would a queen do? 

I don’t want snooping, I don’t want to be controlling, I don’t want to check his phone. If she was just a random girl, I might try to be her friend, but because of our past this is out of question. We can’t get along, and I think I see her for what she is, a really evil, destructive person. Can I ask him to choose or that would be a psycho thing to do? Is this friendship really that innocent, or should I listen to my guts? When this starts to count as emotional cheating? 

Thank you, Ladies, for your fierce and wise advices in advance.",90601,My boyfriend’s friendship with my worst enemy - is this a red flag forest or am I just jealous and overly sensitive?,0,,,

-realizes that porn altered his mind and stopped watching it. Had the confidence and courage to be the one to bring up the topic and discuss it in a healthy way with me. (I was not the one to address it at all. Didn’t think there were guys out there like this who weren’t incredibly religious.)
-Asked me what books I was reading at the time a couple weeks into dating, asked if there were any on my list I was interested in...BOUGHT THEM SO WE COULD READ THEM TOGETHER and wrote me a little note in the front covers. 
-in my four months of dating him, not one time have I opened my own door. 
-no sneakiness with other women. 
-loves spending time preparing and enjoying healthy food with me, and is excited about recipes I want to try. 
-if I cook, he cleans, or vice versa. (I love love love that the housework is evenly split and that I don’t feel like I’m picking up after a little brother or child.)
-when we have sex it’s obvious he’s not in it for himself, and the enjoyment is from seeing me happy and satisfied, which in turn makes me feel happy to take care of him. 
-he’s incredibly attractive physically.

He’s not perfect, but when my last relationship ended, there were a few very specific traits I told myself would be deal breakers. This guy. Ugh. 🤗 

Guys are black and white. When they want something and they are compatible with you, it is easy to recognize their effort early on. You don’t have to outline every little thing that you wish he would do. If you find yourself doing that, keep it movin’ sis!

It felt so freeing to finally let go of him, block every trace of him and try to move on with my life but parts of him have crept back in completely out of my control.

It all started when I began having nightmares about him where I would wake up back in his apartment as if leaving him never happened and then in reality wake up in absolute terror because I thought the dream was real. This happened once a month when I moved back home but has happened more frequently lately. These nightmares serve as reminders of the emotional pain and terror he caused me and probe me into spiraling through reliving these awful traumas. Today's trauma was when I lost my virginity to him. I feel like it doesn't bother me as much as it should but it stings because it isn't how I wanted it to be. We had dated for 3 months and planned out how it would go because he knew it was my first time. He was gentle and everything but it just hurt so bad that I couldn't do it. At first, I had him take breaks and keep trying again. I tried so hard to just bear the pain, but it didn't get better and wasn't happening. When I told him I didn't think I could do it, he ripped off the condom, threw it down, and screamed/sighed in frustration. I remember just laying there thinking ""hmm, this isn't how I imagined this would go."" 

I truly think this relationship gave me some sort of PTSD so I get that I can be fixated on certain issues he caused but I've lived through his awfulness for 5 years that I just want to be done with this once and for all already. I want to let go and stop reliving the past because it's just miserable. With this certain event, I have thought about ways it could have gone differently but it's out of my control. How do I free myself from the reminders left behind of a bad relationship and move on?",90546,How do you let go and move on from the trauma of a past relationship?,0,,,

Firstly, it’s great exercise and one of the best ways to keep in shape. It is also really good fun and one of my favourite hobbies. And finally, one of the best things about it is that skills and technique is much more important than size and physical strength. It’ll be tough at the beginning before you become skilful, but once you have practised long enough you will find that you are able to submit opponents much bigger than you. This is incredibly useful for protecting yourself from LVMs who think it is okay to sexually assault in case you ever need to protect yourself. As well as this, due to the skill based nature of the sport, it means you’re easily able to physically dominate men in training once you become skilled 🥰🙋🏼‍♀️

It is by far the funniest when you see these new LVM guys coming into the gym, fuelled with arrogance and toxic masculinity. They expect to wipe the floor with every woman since they think their sex is superior. Then you start grappling and they end up getting dominated by you, it’s one of the most satisfying feelings 💕

The reactions are hilarious as well. Most new guys don’t feel comfortable tapping out to a woman and they act all shocked and emasculated when they inevitably lose to a more skilled female opponent. It’s honestly my favourite part of the sport you have no idea how fun it is dominating misogynistic LVM types, making them tap out, and then watching them squirm and get all uncomfortable after being emasculated 🥰🌸",90430,Why all women should take up BJJ,0,,,

In fact, many of these so-called romantic or feminist movies I would actually consider outright horror movies, because they describe situations I'd do anything to escape.  Spoilers for the movies below, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

**Entrapment**

Investigator Virginia Baker (played by the goddess Catherine Zeta-Jones) is investigating MacDougal, a professional thief. They play a game of cat and mouse with each other, as she pretends to be another thief in order to draw him into a major art heist. Throughout the narrative, Virginia is presented as a woman with some unresolved daddy issues. 

Let me point out that Sean Connery is playing MacDougal, the male lead. Predictably, even though they could develop the relationship between the leads as an unexpected father-daughter one, in which Gin is mentored in thievery by the dad she never had, the screenwriters decide to make them a romantic couple. At the time of the movie, Sean Connery was 68 and Zeta-Jones had just turned 29! This horrendous age gap is one of the worst things I've ever seen, and I've seen footage of colonoscopies performed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Passengers**

Oh, boy. Jim Preston, a mechanical engineer enroute to Homestead II, is prematurely awoken from cryosleep by a ship malfunction. This is a problem, because the ship has 80 years to go until it reaches Homestead II and the ship's A.I, designers and crew (and writers of this piece of shit movie) are so dumb they haven't planned for this event. So Jim has no way of getting back to sleep and no way of contacting anyone for help. 

He is facing a whole lifetime virtually alone on the ship. On the brink of committing suicide, he sees Aurora (like Sleeping Beauty, get it??) in her cryopod. He decides to sabotage said pod so that she will wake up and be a companion to him. He LIES to her about doing this and they eventually form a romantic connection. This is rape by fraud, my friends. At the end of the story, Aurora has the chance to go back to cryosleep but decides not to because she's got cockholm syndrome.

&amp;#x200B;

**Knocked Up**

A woman gets drunk and has a one-night-stand with a slovenly man. She gets pregnant, and decides to keep the kid. Throughout her pregnancy, the male lead fucks up everything and anything. He is painted as the lovable protagonist while the female lead is portrayed as a horrible, high-maintenance bitch. Her behaviour is amplified via the supporting leads, a married couple in which the woman is totally humorless and the man is a long-suffering free spirit. The lead actress, Katherine Heigl commented on the horrible portrayals of women in this movie:

*“It paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys. It exaggerated the characters, and I had a hard time with it, on some days. I’m playing such a bitch; why is she being such a killjoy? Why is this how you’re portraying women? Ninety-eight percent of the time it was an amazing experience, but it was hard for me to love the movie.”*

Predictably, people (men) got pissy about these comments and Heigl's career circled the toilet not unlike Megan Fox's did when she called Michael Bay a nazi. (Personally, Megan Fox can call Bay whatever she wants, his movies suck and he introduces all of his female characters ass or titties first.)

&amp;#x200B;

**50 First Dates**

A woman with an incurable form of amnesia is wooed every day by Adam Sandler. If this fate wasn't horrible enough, the movie has a truly sinister ending. Drew Barrymore's female lead wakes up to find a recording by her now-husband explaining who he is and how they have spent their lives together, falling in love every day. Apparently, they now have children. Now, the movie plays this as a romance but let's think about it. 

Imagine waking up pregnant with no memory of how you got that way. Would you be too happy about that? Imagine waking up, thinking that it was a day like any other, and then suddenly enduring the pain of childbirth? This guy has totally taken advantage of a woman with literal severe brain damage. I can't imagine what compels a man to want to marry a woman who can't form new memories, but it's probably nothing good. In fact, 50 First Dates reminds me of another shitty movie/book called 'Before I Go to Sleep' which has a similar premise but at least plays the sexual and psychological coercion for horror. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Bridget Jones' Diary**

Bridget Jones has good friends, a cute flat and a nice job. Unfortunately, she's also a rampant pickmeisha which means if you watch this movie, you'll have to endure 1.5 hours of seeing a woman bumble around without a shred of dignity. This character was originally hailed as some sort of feminist answer to the shitty romcoms of the past, but, crucially, the character is obsessed with finding love. She seems to think that being single (and over 30, OMG) is the worst thing EVAR and reeks of desperation. Here's a tip, honey, men can smell desperate, and that's not a good stink to have. 

Later in the movie she finds love with Colin Firth, although he pulls  LVM stunt on her at the very end by walking out of her apartment without a word and forcing her to run through the snow in her panties and slippers. He then turns around and tells her he just left to buy her a new diary - couldn't he have told her that without making a scene? She kisses him, music plays, this movie is shite.

I'm sure I can think of more examples, but this is the cream of the crap (off the top of my head). What are your FDS horror movies?",91829,Romantic movies that are FDS horror movies,0,,,

Pleas call me out if I am being unreasonable here.

So first off I want to say that I am a 25f. And my bf (32m) we have been together a little over a year and a half. For the duration of the relationship he has paid for almost everything rent, food, ect. When I entered the relationship I told him that I was a student and that I was struggling to even support myself. I was super skeptic of even entering the relationship because I didn’t feel like I had much to offer. Him being a sales manager of a dealership took on the financial responsibility and let me know that he could take care of us. For a little bit I must say I did abuse this and took advantage by not working or contributing just going to school. I even fell into depression and dropped out of school. Needless to say I wasn’t doing anything for myself or us for a about a year. He didn’t start complaining about this until a year ago. I did finally get a minimum wage job at Amazon and tried to contribute with it but the job became toxic to work around and eventually I quit. I was out of a job for about 2 weeks until I found my recent job.

So I recently started working for a spa company as a receptionist here in Seattle a minimum wage job. On my way to work one day my car breaks down. It was already pretty old and had so much mileage on it so I wasn’t terribly surprised. 

So I call my bf and he comes to pick me up and drive me to work. We leave the car at the gas station where I was able to drop it off. After work my bf picks me up from work, and I mention my car. He wines about it and says how shitty  it is and how it’s not even worth picking up. I tell him I still want to try to get it home. So we go back and of course he has major attitude. We try to get it back home but only make it home half way and forced to leave it in a parking lot. Haven’t gotten it since btw. 

So here I am  now stuck with taking the bus, which I have no problem with.  The weather has been great and I haven’t been stuck with having to walk in the dark or late by myself. My bf and I our schedules does not align to where he can drop me off and he works about an hour away. I have to leave out about an hour and a half to catch two buses to make it to work on time. I’m pretty fortunate to have good coworkers and friends that have given me rides from time to time. But I’ve accepted the situation. 

Every time I mention finding a new car my bf says that he is looking but can not do anything until I have the funds. He is also expecting me to contribute with this new job. Also when I mention my safety he tells me that I am complaining, and that nothing is going to happen to me. Is it wrong of me to be upset for him not understanding how I am feeling and wanting more out of him as far as helping. Am I being unreasonable?",91732,Am I being unreasonable?,0,,,

We added each other on Facebook but we didn’t become friends or anything, just acquaintances. One of the guys in the group kept messaging me for the following years and I just ignored him and would reply sometimes with a simple ‘Hi’. One of those times (this was back in 2017) he proceeded to tell me his cousin was an orthopedist and was doing a survey on feet care and he asked me some questions to which I replied wanting to help him out, he then asked me for pictures of my feet, I was naive and just wanted to help him out, so even though it seemed odd I didn’t think any of it and sent him the pictures, for the following months he kept asking for updates and I would ignore him most of the times but did send him more pictures at least 3 more times. He kept messaging me once or twice a year but I just straight out ignored him. It wasn’t until yesterday I was talking to my bf about how many girls are currently selling their feet pictures and how I find it very odd, then it clicked me that those pictures I sent were most likely not for an orthopedist but for the pleasure of that guy, I felt stupid for having shared them and not telling anyone about it even though I felt uncomfortable with the request. Out of a huge coincidence I woke up to a message from this guy and decided to confront him asking him for the ‘orthopedist’ office number to verify his story. He then proceeded to block me. I found his girlfriend’s Facebook and told him what he had been doing for the past years and to warn her since I feel she could be in danger, knowing very well she might deem me as a crazy person trying to ruin her relationship. She replied very kindly thanking me for letting her know and that she’ll take the appropriate measures with him (I hope it’s code for dumping him). I called my sister and she said she also sent him pictures years ago and I just feel so sad that we both fell for it and even though we felt uncomfortable we didn’t speak about it.

Here’s a few reasons why, and feel free to add your own. 

-He experienced severe trauma as a child, and other difficult challenges, but didn’t use it as an excuse for his behavior. He acknowledged his past, and engaged in various forms of therapy to address it. 

-He lived by “the code”, and had a strong sense of morality. Dexter had enough self awareness to know he’d never outrun his demons, but he could control who would meet his “dark passenger”. 

-Family came first, and he did everything he could to help or protect them. He might’ve had awkward interactions, but he cared about those close to him. 

-Reliability. Dexter almost always answered his calls/requests for help, even during the most inconvenient times. He never showed annoyance even when he was interrupted with trivial problems. 

-Cleanliness. Not only was he tidy and organized, he always cleaned up after himself. Whether a kitchen or a crime scene. 

-Drive. He was hard working, intelligent and channeled his passion into a respectable career. 

-Effort. He tries his best to blend in, and adapt to normal society. He’s sincere and always remains true to himself, even if people think he’s a little odd. 

-He’s used to blood, so he wouldn’t freak out if you got your period during sex. 

And one of the best qualities compared to the majority of men.... He wasn’t a manipulative sex obsessed, porn addicted creep masquerading as a nice guy. He was too busy hunting down scumbags instead of jacking off all day. The only death grip he had was on his victims, not his dick 🤣",91717,"Just rewatched “Dexter”, and realized that a literal serial killer is more datable than 95% of men on OLD",0,,,

When I was 18 - 23, I had a relationship with a very HVM. He showed me how an equal, save and awesome relationship looked like. I have always been someone who doesn't really care about looks. He was not very handsome at all (understatement), but it didn't matter to me, because he gave me everything I needed in a relationship. He was 100% the ambitious beta. He was the kind of guy RP guys think we only 'settle for' in our 30s. We broke up amicably because we had very different life goals (such as children), but he set the standard for me regarding what a HV relationship should look like - for me -.   


Because my positive experience with my boyfriend, I never took looks into consideration when I was dating afterwards. I just wanted an ambitious, marriage minded, respectful partner. This led me to various long term relationships with LVM in HVM packages. When I called my little brother that I was leaving my cheating fiance he literally told me: 'Thank heavens, about time. Me and my friends could never phantom what a girl like you would even do with that uggo. Have you seen his face?'.   


I was raised with traditional gender roles and was a huge people pleaser. On top of that I am often described as a very beautiful woman. Practically a Red Pillers wet dream. Never did any of this save me from being treated badly, cheated on or having my heart broken. I've done - everything - by their playbook and it still didn't do me any good.   


I believe a lot of women on this forum are successful, kind and generous who dated down when it came to looks, careers, emotional maturity and morals. We're just fed up with this and decided we should actually enforce the standards that we want. There's nothing wrong with that.   


I was already changing my life around an changing my ways when I found FDS, but it's save to say FDS is a necessary daily reminder for women who are leveling up. We are the only internet forum where the advice we give each other aims to benefit and protect our sisters.   


Even if we do everything 'by their book', it won't do us any good. Might as well do good by ourselves!",92652,The notion that attractive women only go for 'chads' in their 20's and settle for ambitious 'beta's' when they hit the wall is a lie. It puts the blame of bad male behavior on women and also doubles as a narrative where single women are punished for not choosing LVM (the narrators) in the 1st place.,0,,,

Now, don't get me wrong, reproduction should both be the couple's job, but if your mAn thinks he can do whatever he wants just because you're in pills, then don't bother spreading your legs to him.

Do your part, take care of yourself and if you have a mistake on getting pregnant over a wrong man (please read the handbook hopefully none of this happens to you), be the first one to suggest a paternity DNA test to the man and his family.

It's like Angelina Jolie filling for divorce without asling for moneu from Brad Pitt. Have ovaries of steel to take what society has been putting on you and slap it on their faces.

Counteract their power play against you, and see who gets humiliated first. Remember, some people will not hesitate to use power play when they have the means and the ego to do so.

I’ll admit - I skim about a sentence of these and trash them because they’re all more or less the same thing. A bunch of NPCs endlessly echoing the exact same sentiment: “My perspective is UNIQUE and SPECIAL and you’re DISCRIMINATING for not letting me shit up your meticulously curated space with my MALE TEARS!”

We don’t respond to these directly as a policy because there are far too many and we’d be wasting our time. Pearls, swine. All that. But I want this on public record so you have absolutely no excuse to message us with your concern-trolling asking “bUt wHy CaN’T mEn pOst??”

Look, boys, we know every facet of society reinforces the bullshit notion that men are the “logical,” “intellectual” sex, but I’ll tell you what your mommy obviously didn’t: **There is literally nothing you can say to us that we haven’t heard before. Your thoughts are not special or unique. You have nothing to say that hasn’t already been said to every woman here thousands of times before. Your patriarchal constructs, male perspective, and “devil’s advocate” arguments have been shoved down our throats from the day we learned to speak.** There is no perspective you can offer us that we simply neglected to consider. 

We know this may be a completely foreign concept to you, but, unequivocally: your opinions, no matter how “well reasoned” you *believe* them to be, are not welcome here. They are not valued here. 

Banning men isn’t “discrimination.” You have never faced discrimination for your sex in your entire life. This is the same reason why the BET channel exists and it’s not discriminatory. The equivalent “white entertainment network” hypothetical you all like to trot out is called *literally every other fucking channel on television.* Similarly, every other subreddit (including the so called “female-oriented” ones) is dominated by men. Your voices drown ours out *everywhere we go*. The social contract dictates we suffer your inane, ill-informed arguments and narcissistic perspectives in every other space for our whole lives. We will not suffer it here. 

We don’t give a fuck how “polite” your post is, either. Violent, dismissive, misogynistic rhetoric is couched in “polite” words all the time. Also, you’re transparent as fuck. We know damn well you don’t care about “equality.” I would gladly stake my very life on the odds that you’re not messaging the moderators of the male-only MGTOW, RP, or Incel subs to complain about them excluding women. Who do you think you’re fooling? We made our own space on what you *thought* was your Super Secret Boizzz Clubbb website and you’re salty about it. Reddit is the 7th most popular website *in the fucking world*. It’s not “yours.” Grow up. 

Let me spell it out for you in plain English:

You are not entitled to use **OUR platform** to spread your misogyny, no matter how “well intentioned.” We know, we know - men have been standing on the backs of women and taking credit for the work we’ve done since the dawn of time. We won’t allow it here. 

If you really believe your truth is so insightful and valuable and that women just *have* to hear it, you’re welcome to create your own sub. If what you have to say really resonates with and validates the *lived experience* of half the population, you’ll have no problem creating the most successful subreddit of all time. You won’t even need to come here trying to bother us anymore!

Please, I beg you. You just go right on ahead and *try* to tell these women what’s what. 

I’m sure it will be *very* popular.",92485,Dear Men: Your Opinion Holds No Value Here. Did We Fucking Stutter?,0,,,

He’s switched on her over the past week, and is now being moody and withdrawn. If she was following FDS (I’ve shared the handbook with her), she would know exactly what she needs to do. In fact, she would be prepared for such a scenario, as one of FDS’ core principles is to not get emotionally invested early on. Don’t get me wrong - it sucks when another guy turns out to be a dud, but the more you practice cutting men off at the first sign of bullshit, the easier it becomes. No more agonising or psycho-analysing men. No more begging men for crumbs or begging them to treat you with a shred of decency. Instead, you will become a Queen that knows her worth, and that confidence will carry over into other areas of your life.

So my boyfriend and I have been together for just over 7 months now and he is a very HVM and everyone in our lives loves us being together. Lately, marriage has been a big deal in our circle of friends because two of our closest friends are getting married in about a month. 

We have briefly discussed the idea of marriage and he has jokingly stated that “It’d be a good 3 years before I’d think about a ring.”to his buddies , and when asked where this relationship was going he said “I want to see how this relationship develops; I want to take the time for us to really know each other.” He also thinks that a year is too soon for engagement, even though our friends got engaged in 4 months of dating.

I understand that it’s extremely important to get to know each other before a huge commitment like this and while i’m not trying to rush or push anything, I do have a timeframe of a maximum of 18 months before engagement which I haven’t yet communicated with him. 

I’m very curious about how to explain this to him without seeming like i’m trying to rush because I’m not, although I am firm with where I stand on this and I need him to understand that. Also, what do I do if he disagrees or won’t compromise? Should I walk away if we don’t agree?",87584,Advice needed: Setting boundaries on an engagement/marriage timeline.,0,,,

Let me tell you how much of a fool I was. We were in a talking stage for 3 MONTHS. That's right. THREE (3) MONTHS, 12 WEEKS, 2190 HRS I'll never get back of my life. This was due to covid which was my first mistake. Do not date or entertain someone you will not see within the next week or 2 at most if you're both busy.

I'm the talking stage itself, he was very inquisitive, funny and respectful on a surface level. But he never made a crazy amount of effort. Tbh I wasn't sure if I was even attracted to him, he just ticked boxes in terms of his ambition, long term goals and common values. I found that I mostly had to keep the entertainment up whilst he asked questions that I could only respond with a closed answer. On the surface, things seemed to be going okay but I didn't even know if this guy liked me. Did he once mention his attraction to me? Nope. Did he once express his feelings? Nope. I get it, we could only speak so much but I found myself second guessing everything. That bad b I was a few weeks prior had been slipping away. Back then, I knew my worth. I didn't take sh*t from any man. Made them always pay. Had incredibly high standards (and rightfully so). Men were so easy to gain at one point because they were attracted to the unattainable me.

But this guy, despite trying my hardest to keep things casual.. I found myself questioning everything, especially my own worth. A damn shame if you ask me since I had other guys wanting my attention but I gave it to this guy under the illusion that he was a HVM and he ""needed time to open up"". 

F*** that. 

After 3 long months, we finally met and I had built him up so much in my head but by the time we met, we spoke so much already we had *nothing* to talk about in person. It was an OK date at most. Supbar even. And yet I still thought to give him a chance because maybe its the first time that makes it awkward. Made so much excuses for this one guy - it's cringe looking back on it. This was not who I am. Who knew quarantine could soften me up and make me a pickmeisha within a few weeks? 

One thing I learnt rereading the FDS handbook and about dating itself was the simple rule of ""if he is interested, you will know"". Looking back, he was in the beginning but it fell off way too soon and we both kept beating a dead horse for the sake of not wasting all that time spent talking and getting to know each other. From now on, this sh*t will NOT be tolerated. I have reminded myself of the queen I have always been and my standards have since been reestablished. A long break from dating is where I am at right now since I'm loving my own company. I will not waste my time further.

Honestly, this FDS handbook really slapped some sense back into me again - we will not have our time wasted anymore ladies ✊🏽


Tl:Dr - wasted 3 months of my life in a talking stage that went nowhere. Wasn't even sure if I was into the guy or vice versa. Kept making excuses for him until I finally saw sense and mutually ended things. Happily single as before and reestablished my worth thanks to the FDS handbook",87572,This page really smacked some damn sense into me lately and I'm eternally grateful,0,,,

I've got my queen shit together in most fronts, but I discovered this weekend that in practice I am way too anxious about whether a man can keep themselves in check in difficult to banister situations. The anxiety of 'what will his reaction be' is about to be SHUT DOWN LADIES.  My post is for all you queens currently in the process of setting good boundaries and holding down your standards.  It can be difficult but it's so so worth it every time.

I just got out of a 7 year long relationship with a HVM that backslid into LVM behaviors- we have a daughter and I'm VERY prod of how I handled everything. I cut it off swiftly without much drama and I can tell you right now that the respect I have from him now is more than I've seen in the past 4 years.  We are amicable, have an agreement for financing and time that we created without needing to pay for lawyers, he has expressed regrets in the way he treated me which I appreciate and we are working on our co-parenting skills and friendship. it's the best case scenario for loving someone deeply but cutting them off when i am not being treated like the queen I am, especially with a kid involved.  She is happy and healthy and well in her way to overthrowing the patriarchy.  Proud mama.

Anyway, I started dating this guy who has been amazing.  Asked me to be his girlfriend after 3 weeks of dating- sharing music, stories, laughing A LOT, he shared a lot about his life and I shared just enough, and he bright be on several amazing dates.  He's helped me around my house with various projects, proceeded to make me handmade pine bookshelves, continued taking me on high value dates and has been extremely kind and complimentary....BUT.... He's sober.  This doesn't always have to be a definitive red flag imho bc I believe in the power of reform and growth. many of us are former pickmeishas, and besides that I just personally hold the view that anyone can better themselves.  BUT, the FDA hand book is clear about addicts and even though I was willing to look past his past, I'm not willing to accept addict behavior just because he's still learning.  you show growth from that through your current actions 100% in EVERY scenario.  Sobriety wasn't the issue, it was his insecurities that came out like a bat out of hell when he went down on me and I told him to do it differently.

The whole weekend digressed from there. He couldn't get a boner the rest of that day and the next day I could tell his ego was bruised but he wasn't connecting it.  We eventually had great sex because I figured out how to boost his ego, get a boner and have great sex, but at that point I was aware that my body was betraying me (oxytocin crave!! I reeked with desperation bc he want giving it to me!!).  Now, I'm glad I got off because I couldn't think straight 😂 but the next morning he threw a temper tantrum when I brought up that he needed to work on why he was feeling insecure- and not with me.  Please note, he had already expressed that he was feeling insecure and that's why he couldn't get a boner, so it wasn't me being harsh it was me circling back in our conversation in a point blank way. he just didn't connect that it only started when I 'criticized' his down town techniques.

When he left in the AM he did so with a huge fucking tantrum.  There was some other factors to this happening, I have 2 insecure pickmeishas friends who both happened to come at me with passive aggressive bullshit (specifically that I shouldn't be dating this guy because it takes away from me giving them attention...🙄) and so that morning I was DONE and wanted to be fucking left alone.  I'd actually requested to be left alone the previous night but he slept over because it was too late to drive the hour home.  Either way, he had 2 options ladies: 1) recognize that I needed space because that's what I said I needed and feel secure that me talking that space would only strengthen our relationship-AS WELL recognize that maybe he's not ready for a fucking relationship or sex and should maybe take some of his own space to understand what was going on with him 2) have a tantrum and project on me that it's not about his sobriety.

I journaled a lot last night, am focusing wholely on my daughter this week and weekend, and writing this out has helped with the mindset shift in me.  There's a soft dull voice telling me to text him that I 👏am 👏 shutting 👏 down 👏!!  The only thing I will get from that is more BULLSHIT.  Oh and darlings, you should have seen the dance he did trying to leave my house in a huff like I was going to chase him... When I didn't he kept coming back to me like - this is it! I'm going to leave! This is your last chance!   And I went stone cold bitch, let his ass leave and had a great day.  I'm officially distancing myself from him and both of those friends.

My friend is a HVM (20), attractive, tall, sexy accent, intelligent, absolutely fucking loaded, but more importantly he's respectful and caring towards friends and strangers.

He has helped me (21) through a mental breakdown/panic attack and I was surprised and impressed by how sensitive he was to not only keeping me safe but making every effort in preserving my dignity/honour/reputation while I was out of it. I don't think this was special treatment, I think he would do it for anyone. It still made me notice him, though. 

This being said he's incredibly hard to read most of the time. He's never checked me or anyone else out visibly ever, and very rarely makes eye contact unless it's to psych you out in a game of cards. He's awkward with girls. At first I thought he was deeply in the closet but now I don't know anymore. 

A few nights ago we were watching a movie together because we needed to stay up to drop our friend off at the airport who was sleeping off a hangover. It was about 2 in the morning. I was falling asleep on his shoulder and he stopped the movie and invited me to cuddle him. He kind of sighed and with mock annoyance in his voice said ""come over here I know you want to cuddle""

I was slightly in shock. We have cuddled and massaged each other before but it was directly before my break down and I assumed that little disgraceful episode had completely turned him off me. Anyway I figured he was probably just being polite and caring and ""letting me"" cuddle. I was down for a platonic cuddle to deal with the awkward tension we had going on so I obliged.

Then, after a while, he started feeling around. I didn't know what to do at all. I went along with it a bit. Took off my shirt but didn't let him go down on me or have sex with me. I let him finger me a bit and I had a very mild orgasm and I gave him a hand job. But it was really really awkward.

I kept double checking things with him. Like if he was drunk or if he wanted anything in particular. He said he didn't want to have sex and he didn't want to start a relationship. Which is good because I didn't want to have sex or start a relationship either. But then later when I called him to talk about it he said he didn't want to be friends with benefits. But he did say he wanted to do it again at some point.

So I'm just so confused as to what he wants. I know we aren't going to see each other again for at least a few months. He said I can call him whenever if I feel like it but he doesn't generally call people unless he has a reason. I probably won't call unless I have a reason to either. 

I can't tell if he thinks I'm bottom of the barrel and wants a low effort booty call or if he is a commitment phobe trying to slowly seduce another commitment phobe into a relationship neither of us really want or know how to handle. We've been friends for a really long time so I'd like to think he wouldn't treat a friend like trash. Also, he has proven he cares for me in a lot of little ways and one big way, taking care of me when I was crazy. Is he just awkward? Am I just an opportunity fuck to him? I honestly don't know how to read the situation.

I like him and want to see him again in a sexual/romantic context. But more importantly I want to keep him as a mate and not change the dynamics of our friendship group. 

I don't know if you guys to TL;DR but here you go.

TL;DR had an awkward low effort hook up with a HVM friend. I was caught off guard and wasn't very smooth or graceful about it. Some wierd history in the mix. Don't know where his head is at now/what his intentions are.",87534,Had an awkward hook up with a HVM and don't know how to continue,0,,,

Aside from the handful who do find good and compatible partners through what I believe is *pure chance*, I truly think OLD is a massive waste of time for women in general, regardless of how successful, beautiful, interesting, and otherwise desirable you are as a prospective partner. I'm honestly starting to suspect the women who hack it are the statistical margin of error. The whole game is rigged. We aren't the problem, the men are. 

I used to think of it as a tool to widen the pool of men you could meet, because even if you are very social, you can only go out so often, what with the time you need to devote to work, friendships, hobbies, etc. Now I think it is primarily a way to expose yourself to more gutter trash and traumatic bullshit than you could ever imagine with meeting and vetting men in person. 

I have had a couple of stints of being on apps/dating sites for a few months at a time over the past \~5 years, and each time it just makes me so sad about the state of humanity that I'm forced to take a break. I've tried OkCupid, Tinder, CMB, and Hinge in a major US city, and at this point, truly don't think it's worth trying any online method of meeting men again. Aside from me, all of the women I know who have any experience themselves or witnessing what their friends have encountered on OLD acknowledge it is a miserable needle-in-a-haystack slog, literally all of them. I haven't been on ""selective"" apps like The League, Raya, etc, but suspect from all I've heard that the men who self select into those communities are almost all narcissistically inclined, if not outright narcissists.  

The mere amount of swiping/browsing through gross, overly confident LVM/NVM you need to do to find even 1 person worthy of speaking to is fucking bonkers, we would not accept these skewed numbers for any other endeavor (except the lottery). And as you learn more through experience how to spot red flags early, the number of men worth engaging with shrinks. Because the bar for acceptable male behavior is so universally low, and LVM/NVM know they can always find some poor pickme willing to tolerate their bullshit, men in general have zero incentive to improve themselves. 

The odds are good, but the goods are almost all the human equivalent of factory rejects.

At some point I just point blank said: I don’t care about random men’s compliments. And some other women were just nodding their heads agreeing. 

The amount of shocked faces was hilarious. “But... but... what do you mean?” 

Which ended in explaining that I don’t think men’s compliments are worth anything. I’d rather have a woman compliment me on my looks than a man. A man usually has some sort of motive for complimenting me. 

“I can’t tell you how beautiful your eyes are?”
“Well duh I know they are? Not very creative. What’s the point of you telling me?”

This is how all of my breakups always go. I break up with a LVM, he blows up, stalks me, harasses me, drags my name through the mud, tries to make my life a living hell, etc. 

Today, I realized that this kind of reaction isn't normal or warranted. 

Because of this beautiful community fo angels, I now see that I am a pickmeisha who lets LVM stick around for way too long. This community has taught me that LVM truly believe that I deserve this kind of harassment and cruelty. What a terrifying thought. 

I am going to block this guy and never look back. I will study the FDS Handbook, and I will learn how to spot these LVM before the first coffee/drinks ""date.""

Do you believe in giving up your last name and changing it to your husbands or do you think this culturally misogynistic as the tradition itself came from a bride’s father transferring “property” (the bride) to his husband? 

I don’t think it’s cute. I think it’s gross. I love my last name, and no man no matter how good he is to me deserves my identity. 

And in my experience, telling guys that you refuse to give up your last name for them makes most of them FURIOUS. A guy I was dating actually dumped me for this reason a couple of years back, because I said I wouldn’t ever give up my last name. 

Am I wrong for feeling this strongly about keeping my name?",87986,Breaking Surname Traditions,0,,,

So I've met this guy through friends, I don't know him very well yet, but so far no red flags. He asked me to send him a poem I mentioned I wrote recently, that's how we got talking over messenger, I can't see him until later next week because of my university deadlines, but I am really interested in him. He's autistic and has ADHD (so do I) so he is not the kind of person to have some ulterior motive or be manipulative, he's very open. I've spent a lot of time around his friends (some of whom have known him for 14 years) and everyone has had nothing but lovely things to say about him. He has also gender transitioned (female to male) so I believe he has some understanding of the difficulties we deal with as women.

He writes poetry, does a lot of creative writing, just finished a masters degree, and he published a book of his poems two years ago. I bought and read it, it's really beautiful and emotional, from having the same neurological conditions I related to his poetry so much, I wanted to strike up a conversation with him over messenger about it but I feel like maybe I should leave it until he messages me something or that I should talk to him about it in person.

I'm not assuming he's a HVM, I will continue to keep my guard up and won't be afraid of walking away, i've read the handbook. Is it LVW behaviour to strike up a conversation like that? Or should I wait for him to message me about anything? I don't know if I seem too interested by initiating a conversation.",87834,Would this be LVW behaviour?,0,,,

I wanted to post a small excerpt/example argument from Lundy Bancroft's inisghtful book *Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry, Controlling Men*. I think this is a valuable list to add to our repository of Big Ol' Red Flags^TM.

I think this example argument &amp; following analysis clearly demonstrate and lay bear the insidious twists and turns of common verbally abusive tactics, which can seem very muddled and confusing in the moment.

**He doesn't have to hit you, sis. Verbal abuse is still abuse.** 

&gt;**THE ABUSIVE MAN IN ARGUMENTS**

&gt;I will begin by examining in detail an argument
between an abusive man and his partner, the kind
that I hear about routinely from my clients and
their partners. Jesse and Bea are walking along in
their town. Jesse is sullen and clearly annoyed.

**BEA**: What’s going on with you? I don’t understand
what you’re upset about.

**JESSE**: I’m not upset; I just don’t feel like talking
right now. Why do you always have to read
something into it? Can’t I just be a little quiet sometimes? Not everybody likes to talk, talk, talk
all the time just because you do.

**BEA**: I don’t talk, talk, talk all the time. What do
you mean by that? I just want to know what’s
bothering you.

**JESSE**: I just finished telling you, nothing’s
bothering me…and give me a break that you don’t
talk all the time. When we were having dinner
with my brother and his wife, I couldn’t believe
how you went on and on about your stupid
journalism class. You’re forty years old, for Christ
sake; the world isn’t excited about your fantasies
of being famous. Grow up a little.

**BEA**: Fantasies of being famous? I’m trying to get a
job, Jesse, because the travel agency jobs have all
moved downtown. And I wasn’t going on about it.
They were interested; they were asking me a lot of
questions about it—that’s why we were on that
subject for a while.

**JESSE**: Oh, yeah, they were real interested. They
were being polite to you because you’re so full of
yourself. You’re so naive you can’t even tell when
you’re being patronized.

**BEA**: I don’t believe this. That dinner was almost
two weeks ago. Have you been brewing about it
all this time?

**JESSE**: I don’t brew, Bea, you’re the one that brews.
You love to get us confused. I’ll see you later. I’m
really not in the mood for this shit.

**BEA**: In the mood for what shit?? I haven’t done
anything! You’ve had it in for me since I arrived
to meet you!

**JESSE**: You’re yelling at me, Bea. You know I hate
being yelled at. You need to get help; your
emotions just fly off the handle. I’ll see you later.

**BEA**: Where are you going?

**JESSE**: I’ll walk home, thank you. You can take the
car. I’d rather be alone.

**BEA**: It’s going to take you more than a half hour to
walk home, and it’s freezing today.

**JESSE**: Oh, now suddenly you care about me so
much. Up yours. Bye. (*Walks off.*)

&gt;The lives of abused women are full of these
kinds of exchanges. Jesse didn’t call Bea any
degrading names; he didn’t yell; he didn’t hit her
or threaten her. Bea will be in a tough spot when
the time comes to explain to a friend how upset
she is, because Jesse’s behavior is hard to
describe. What can she say? That he’s sarcastic?
That he holds on to things? That he’s overly
critical? A friend would respond: “Well, that
sounds hard, but I wouldn’t call it *abuse*.” Yet, as
Jesse walks away, Bea feels as if she has been
slapped in the face.

&gt;**WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS ARGUMENT?**

&gt;We will look first at what Jesse is doing and then
examine how his thinking works. The first point to
illuminate is:

&gt;THE ABUSER’S PROBLEM IS NOT THAT
HE RESPONDS INAPPROPRIATELY TO
CONFLICT. HIS ABUSIVENESS IS
OPERATING *PRIOR* TO THE CONFLICT:
IT USUALLY *CREATES* THE CONFLICT,
AND IT DETERMINES THE *SHAPE* THE
CONFLICT TAKES.

&gt;Therapists often try to work with an abuser by
analyzing his responses to disagreements and
trying to get him to handle conflicts differently.
But such an approach misses the point: His
abusiveness was what *caused* the tension to begin
with.

&gt; Jesse uses an array of conversational control tactics, as most abusers do:

- He denies being angry, although he
obviously is, and instead of dealing with
what is bothering him, he channels his
energy into criticizing Bea about
something else.

- He insults, belittles, and patronizes Bea
in multiple ways, including saying that
she likes to talk all the time and has
fantasies of becoming famous, stating
that she should “grow up,” and telling
her that she accuses him of stewing over
things when it’s actually her.

- He tells her that she is unaware that other
people look down on her and don’t take
her seriously and calls her “naive.”

- He criticizes her for raising her voice in
response to his stream of insults.

- He tells her that *she* is mistreating *him*.

- He stomps off and plays the victim by
putting himself in the position of having
to take a long, cold walk home.

**Discussion questions**: How might these tactics present themselves early on in a relationship, especially during the talking or dating stage? What FDS strategies and advice can help women identify these red flags and protect themselves?

Please feel free to share any experiences you have had encountering abusive argument tactics, how they made you feel, what the outcome was, etc. and any advice or support for women currently in similar situations or trying to heal from one. ❤ Stay strong, Queens!",88666,The Abusive Man in Arguments,0,,,

I’m a new member of FDS but I’ve been lurking for a while and recently started reading the manifesto. It’s brilliant *chefs kiss* thank you to the ladies who put it together. 

I’m in my 30s and a lot of what I’m finally realizing about men are things that I’ve subconsciously known since I started seriously looking at men - most of them are subpar and will waste your time if you let them. It’s such a hard pill to swallow. Especially coming up in the OLD era. I’m from NYC and quite frankly, I never plan to OLD here again. It’s just way too much garbage to sift through and it’s not fun at all. The quality of men here is really terrible. But that’s not why I’m writing today. 

I’m writing today because it has taken me damn near 20 years to realize that men aren’t your true obstacle when it comes to dating - other women are. Other women’s standards, or lack there of, will severely poison your mind if you let them. It seems like when you make the decision to hold yourself to a higher standard other women will go through all types of mental gymnastics to discourage you or flat out tell you that your standards are too high. 

A few years ago a friend of mine and I read one of GL Lambert’s books (if y’all haven’t gotten into his work I really love how cut and dry he is about women raising their standards) and we both realized it would take a lot of discipline to fully reap the benefits of becoming a Spartan. It also means the timeline for meeting quality suitors will become significantly longer. 

Again. I’m in my 30s and I don’t have kids. I would love them but the idea of being with anyone for the sake of children never bode well with me at all. A married cousin of mine recently asked if I didn’t have them soon if I would consider having a child alone and I spazzed on her. Hell no. Why tf would I do that? But that was *her* fear talking. Again. Other women’s fears and limitations will try to poison your mindset. 

I do realize that if I want to meet someone of quality they most likely will not be in NYC; the cost of living is very high and men have the illusion of choice here. I’ll most likely have to move to put myself in a better position but for now I’m enjoying running my businesses, growing in my spiritual community, teaching myself new skills and staying sucker free. 

I just can’t talk to intimately about these things with a lot of the women in my life cause I don’t need anyone salting my outlook on the future. 

Thanks for making this subreddit. I really like it here!",88641,Thoughts from a newbie member,0,,,

I just finished watching How to loose a guy in 10 days and all the way through I'm noticing the tropes that are played off as romantic and what the man is putting up with. Both characters are as bad as each other, they're bad for each other and ignoring red flags for their own pursuits and ulterior motives.

They both in a round about way end up getting what they want and suddenly the guy realises it realy was love all along and goes chasing after the girl. Then HE ACTUALLY STOPS HER (THE AUDACITY!) from going to a job interview for somewhere she's actually done for herself and all because ""she can write anywhere"" so she can write where he is based...

But when I text with my normal style I come across as completely disinterested. I can't strike a balance and its so frustrating because in person I do pretty great but I can't get there if I scare the guy off with my texting habits. In general I try to let the guy initiate all texts early on but when he asks me a question such as how am I doing and I answer the question honestly I feel like it ruins the mystery. Does anyone have any texting tips? I only tend to do ok with guys who are great at texting and lead so all I have to do is follow their lead.,88559,Does anyone have any texting advice?,0,,,

Toxic didn't give a like to this picture but he did like a twitter screenshot that said ""I hate when bitches have boyfriends that aren't me."" In a discussion about why many guys stop liking a girls' pics after they start talking, Toxic was of the opinion that liking a girls' picture is the equivalent of studying after passing the test and that it's ""pointless validation.""

One time I was meeting the ex demon for one of our walk around ""dates"". We usually met at the same spot near a restaurant. I was about a block away from the spot and I turn down one of the usual blocks thats on the way. There is this mental homeless man there and I walk by. He starts saying things like ""hi"" and ""ohhhh pretty"" so I walked fast past him and then I noticed he starts following me (we weren't the only two on the block but still there weren't that many people on that street). So, I cut through a side street and make it to a busy busy street full of people and stores. I go into a random store kill some time and then leave and go a long detour route to avoid the other street. 

The NVM ex-demon texts me to tell me that he was approaching the spot where we meet. I reply telling him that I would have been there before him had it not been for the creepy dangerous mental man that harrased and followed me.

You know what this dusty waste man says?

""Ohhh you must be looking hot today!!!"" ""i can't wait to see how hot you look""

Then he feigns concern and says ""but are you okay?"" 

Then...

When I finally get to the spot he looks at me up and down and says ""oh?....hmmm you look normal. I thought you had on a new outfit or something""

The fact that men think we owe them a relationship if we show any slight interest and when we aren’t interested to pursue things romantically they reject friendship and all communication. 
It might not seem like a big deal but I find it digusting, demeaning and plain rude when I genuinely like someone, they misread my messages and start avoiding me like I was the one who did something wrong. 

In fact this happened to me last summer, I rejected a guy at work who thought I was into him because I laughed at his stupid jokes ( are we not allowednto laugh at jokes orrrr???) and he told me he was really upset and avoided me for the next day. Last time I checked I was an adult, not a fucking child. 

Luckily I know my worth and this situation just shows the true intentions of most men. Too bad the girl in this post didn’t get the message :/",88952,Men thinking we owe them a relationship,0,,,

Back in 2019 I did not know about fds and was prowling OLD messing a lot of guys trying to give them a chance. I foolishy agreed to snapchat or text some. I'd delete some numbers but didn't block a few and they popped back up, and they got blocked. One had the audacity to send me a video saying why I shouldn't move to the area I had always dreamt if moving ... months later after I walked out on him. 

Then tonight another old scrote popped up through snapchat which I barely use. At some point in 2019 I had matched with him on OLD and we messaged a bit. Even before fds I could see from his texting and snapchats he was a dead end job looser, leaving me on read and just wanted to hangout. In the short time I snapchatted him I already felt like a last option but apparently I forgot to block him. Now literally a year later he apparently saw my story using a technique for repairing old things (which can be easily googled) and he sends me four messages and photos boom boom boom one after another asking about it and how he has old stuff he wants to fix and he wants my help. I was leaving him on read to simmer and then I caved and sent him a message ""didn't realize I still had you here ill fix that"" and he claps back ""oh well you couldn't chill with me or said you just want to be friends or something I can't remember but you never wanted to hangout. I just want to know how you fixed those items I have broken one""

I hit that block button. 

I am so grateful I found fds. In these moments where my past comes back up even with these scrotes I never even bothered to meet in person its embarrassing and hurtful. I am humiliated I used OLD in the past and was giving some guys chances even if they were brief chances. Its so hurtful to associate even for fleeting moments with anyone especially scrotes that think so little of you. I am so tired of being treated and thought of like dog shit. I am so embarrassed because look what happens even when you give  the scrotes an inch. All they do is take and gaslight and belittle you. I can't believe this man I barely spoke to crawled out after a year and actually wanted me to teach him a mending trick! Then he quick tries telling me that I didn't want to ""chill"" and just wanted to be ""friends"" admitting he doesn't even remember! I

Learn this lesson no matter where you are in your leveling up journey  make sure that you go through your contacts and actually block the scrotes. Open up social media even ones you barely use and BLOCK them, dont just delete them actally make sure they are blocked. Most if not all of them will resurface and in their desperate filth try to belittle and gaslight you more. How dare he try to disturb my peace. Here I am in a new state in my own apartment finally thriving and they dare try to treat me like I am so worthless piece of shit. 

If you are in the vetting process, please use a fake phone number. Alrighty my rant is done.",88923,The old scrotes keep popping back up ... go through your contacts and all your social media make sure they are blocked everywhere.,0,,,

Essentially,  I had my heart broken from being a naive 21 year old, almost 2 years later and I’m still struggling from it. (I’ve learnt my lessons now , but it still hurts.) 

A typical story of “reading too much into things” and getting very emotional invested with a guy who I thought was good ... turns out he wasn’t. Cue my delayed reaction to understanding this.... 

Since then,  I have had very poor self esteem due to being somewhat rejected / felt like I wasn’t good enough etc. I now constantly play the comparison game and feel very shy.

I’d love to hear your thoughts so, bare with me if you can

On this journey to better myself I find that the last thing I need to let go of is the most challenging 

One of my dearest friends is a full on pickmeisha who believes her life has no real value without a man

I know, I know, I know. I need to drop her and I’d tell every single one of you who sought the same advice to do the same,but let me explain. 

This woman has been a close friend for 25 years

Let me explain the good:

She’s kind hearted and loving and has always dropped whatever she was doing to help me whenever I needed it 

She runs a worldwide foundation for disabled children and devotes most of her time and money to it. She lives and breathes it. She doesn’t just talk the talk, she walks the walk. I fully admire her for this. 

She is the first person I call when I feel down and she always makes time for me

She couldn’t reach me on 9/11 ( I’m a survivor) and she drove around my mothers entire suburban neighborhood because she couldn’t remember which house my mom lived in (she’d only been there twice). When she found it, she showed up in tears, completely broken, and asked my mother if she’d heard from me. She was literally more worried than my own mother

We have the exact same sense of humor and can finish one another’s sentences. It’s really hard to find people like this. She’s the same to me as one of my sisters. 

The bad:

Full on pick me who has never not been in a relationship. Like, ever, since she was 17

Has a very kind and generous boyfriend but he has anger issues and lashes out at her. He keeps lying to her about supporting his deadbeat brother. Huge red flags that she refuses to see, no matter how hard I try to convince her that he will never change and things will not get better

Has an abusive ex husband who I tried to convince her for years to leave and she only did once she found this new boyfriend 

Constantly complains about her deadbeat dad ex and drags me down with her emotional baggage

That’s the gist of it

I have been doing a soft grey rock technique where I fend off the worst of it by saying nothing will change until she changes and refusing to get pulled into her self pity. I avoid her phone calls that come in the middle of the day, that seems to be her witching hour

it works most of the time, but I’m getting worn down  and I know I need to eventually let go, but it’s sad and very difficult 

Anyway, this has been cathartic. 

Please feel free  to drag me. I’ve come very far in my journey to level up. This last thing is a painful and difficult stepping stone in the process",88839,Those pickmeisha friends who are hard to let go of,0,,,

I’ve lurked here for a LONG TIME and but I have finally very recently started commenting but anyways. 

My boyfriend has a younger sister who I am very close to and she’s growing up fast. She doesn’t have any older sisters and talking to her mother about these things is not an option for her so she comes to me for advice.  She’s 12 and is going to be starting 7th grade soon. She’s a very intelligent and beautiful young lady and the boys have taken a notice to her. I went through a lot as a young girl and getting attention from the older boys while I was a middle schooler was so cool to me (yikes) but I have talked to her before about how it’s okay to have those feelings and the feeling of wanting to be someone’s girlfriend but it’d be best for her to find herself first before she wastes her time on some boy. 

I am in the process of starting to tell her about don’t send nudes and don’t do all of these other things but I feel like that might be too much for a 12 year old to process. So I want to start her on like a starter-FDS for younger girls but I don’t know where I would start. I give her my word that I’ll keep her secrets but I’ve noticed that some high school boys from her school have started chatting her up and I tell her all the time to not give them the attention but I remember being her age and in this generation of instant chat and social media everywhere I know she’s feeling good about herself bc she’s getting this attention from guys but I want to make sure she’s going to be okay and not get hurt. 

Part of me wants to tell her everything bc I don’t mind taking “The L” just so she can have a better head start but I don’t want to terrify her about how most men and boys her age (especially in our porn-cultered generation) really are since she’s so young. 

She sees all this sex positive pickme shit on her For You page on TikTok and I know it’s making her think and feel a certain way so I send her FDS positive things and when she likes them it changes her algorithm just a bit so the things that I see she will see as well. I know this is a big ask but if any of you ladies can help me out I’d really appreciate it!! 

Thanks, lilac :)

Okay, so my(18) boyfriend(19) usually replies late when we’re having a conversation. Like 2-6 hours late. It really irks me when he does that because he gives no explanation so I’m just left hanging. The other day I noticed he was only replying when it was convenient for himself or when he wanted something from me or had a question. I get he’s busy. But I find it kinda rude how he doesn’t put effort in his texts and just replies when he wants something. So I reciprocated him and replied late like he does because I’m not about to kiss ass. He’s not usually like that. So yesterday we had a good conversation and I liked his message to end it there because at that time he usually doesn’t answer my messages and it’s a pet peeve of mine when I’m left hanging. 40 minutes later he texts me saying ‘are you serious?I don’t know what’s wrong with you these days. if you don’t want to talk then say so’ I was so shocked. Like? He just proved all my gut feelings right. I feel like he purposely ignores me for an ego boost and uses me. I have no idea honestly. But I replied ‘what?’ And he didn’t reply even though he’s online. I’m so tired of these games he’s playing. Opinions?

(Forgot to include, I texted him yesterday, ‘thanks for not replying I really appreciate it’ because he always cuts our conversations short and never offers an explanation, and he just ignored my text and said ‘hey’ acting like nothing even happened. I just feel so fucking dumb.)",89763,Is he playing with me?,0,,,

While it’s been coming close to a year over being dumped by a LVM and I’m currently seeing someone who thus far appears to be miles better, I still struggle with bitterness and anger. 

While I don’t at all have feelings for him anymore I think because he was my first boyfriend, dumped me over a huge insecurity of mine, and we dated for over a year it’s hard to get over. I can’t help but be frustrated with myself for how much of a pickmeisha I used to be and all the wasted time, tears, and money.

I’m a recent university graduate who is struggling to find a job with everything going on. To make myself some money while job hunting, I decided to start my own tutoring service for elementary school children, as I have lots of experience working with kids. I designed a really cute flyer and posted it on NextDoor (a site that helps connect local neighborhoods) and included my email as a way to get in touch with me. Big mistake.

I woke up to an email from OnlyFans thanking me for making an account and giving me an authentication code. I told my mom and started crying. My email address is linked to many job applications, my resume, and other personal things.. I am just so heartbroken that someone would take my good deed (helping kids/families) and use it for something so disgusting and potentially harming my reputation. 

I took the username this person created (it resembles a name), typed it into Facebook, and found a 50 year-old man with the same name and two mutual friends. This doesn’t fully confirm that this is the same person, but I have reached out to OnlyFans Support to hopefully get the IP address of the person who set up the account and will contact my family friend in law enforcement to pay him a visit.

All you ladies come from different walks of life / backgrounds / parts of the world, so it is understandable that you handle your lives in different ways, but I come from a different background than the majority of those living in my current geographic area. 

I have to say: Majority of the users on this forum are clearly from Western countries/cultures. Probably North American. Again &amp; again, too often, there are countless members whose posts reveal:

\- They keep speaking to / continuing communication with males that are random nobodies they ""met"" off of dating websites etc., even if this guy is blatantly being rude &amp; a disrespectful piece of shit. Yet, every time the woman posts screenshots / tells a story / vents about a scenario that just happened to her, she is always continuing to ""debate"" with &amp; carry on talking to these types of guys. Why do you do that?

\- Which brings us to the next issue: if you do this because in your culture you feel it is ""impolite"" / rude to stop conversing with a person, even if he is going to town with gaslighting/negging/mocking you to death, you need to start critically thinking about how the boys in your environment act this way because YOU are letting them. If you STOP + if a collective amount of women would just STOP letting them talk/act that way, they wouldn't DARE to be \*\*so shameless &amp; bold\*\* all the time.

\- Yes the men from my culture &amp; other countries can also be rude, they are imperfect human beings after all -- but they would NEVER do even 50 percent of the horrendous shit I see/and now have to experience the Western men in my current country of residence doing. 

Want examples? OK - in many other countries, guys would \*\*NEVER\*\* . . 

\-walk up to a couple of random female friends at a social event &amp; tell them they are ""so hot looking, you 2 would make amazing lesbians""

\-refuse to pay for a motherfucking $5 coffee (let alone a dinner) on dates

\-overtly &amp; constantly leer at other women whilst on dates &amp; then gaslight the poor girl escorting them on the date that she doesn't have the desired look/hair colour/body type he is after (this was told to me by my female friends here ALL the fucking time to the point that I sick and tired of hearing it)

\-insolently tell a girl they \*\*NEVER MET\*\* that she should drive for HOURS to meet HIM in HIS fucking locale while he sits back &amp; laughs about her desperation with his friends (sound familiar? this was posted in this subreddit many times now)

\-expect women to carry the conversation + pay for themselves on dates + do all the work in a dating situation.....

&amp;#x200B;

And on &amp; on I can go. This is all EXACERBATED by the \*countless\* women I see living here who FULLY SUPPORT these poisonous attitudes, including the mothers who failed as parents and bred these disgusting attitudes into their male offspring. It's not funny at all, it's not normal, and it's not something you should all keep accepting as the norm. I understand culture &amp; society is complex, but you CAN do things to make a difference &amp; demand respect in your personal life.

Yet when the roles are reversed people always tell the man to leave. As a matter of fact the man almost always leaves without a second thought. The women is called a bitch or heartless or it is said she doesn't appreciate having ""such a good man"". 

But women don't cheat foe the same reasons men do. 

I recently read a post about us all waking up from all the disney fairytale mind frame and how shattering it is to realize the truth of it all about love and relationships and maneuvering within it.

Any way I'm sort of venting but also would like to discuss this atrocity of a double standard.

I just moved into my new luxury apartment, and I’m very proud of where I’m at in life. I have a high paid job, and my career is taking off atm. 

But having all this, is sometimes lonely... specially without someone to share it with. 

I’m questioning and asking myself often now, shouldn’t I be having someone to call whenever anything great happens... or someone to hang out with in the weekends. 

Finding a HVM really seems like winning the lottery. 

I’ve tried tinder, tried asking friends, I’ve considered someone from my work field but I’m scared to shit where I eat etc. 

I don’t know what to do. All men I meet is LVM, only wants to hook up with me or wants to keep it casual...

I’m trying not to focus on it that much, but I really don’t want to spend holidays, weekends, new year, etc alone.

What can I do to increase the chance of meeting a HVM?

Please help me 🙏",90039,High value woman can’t find a HVM.,0,,,

This post is pretty much all about FDS-approved strategies taken straight from the actions and mouths of men in my life.

There's my father, who would tell me to dump a man if said man happened to breathe wrong. My dad is also all about my financial indpendence outside of a man.

I found my first love at 11. This boyfriend (emphasis on boy at that age) refused to walk through a door that I was holding. *He* would always rush to open *my* doors. I was told by him and other males alike to simply let my young beau do such things for me. A lot of other FDS tips came naturally, but I started to feel a bit suffocated too easily on accepting pure generosity like opening doors or gifts. I was bullied and just ""used"" to being treated like crap. My young beau protected me from bullies, and I honestly didn't even realize how much he did until later on in life. He was a good guy, and we reconnected shortly before I got engaged to my now-husband. My former beau gave me some FDS-style encouragement. ""If you marry a worthless human being, I will find you and pimp slap the both of you. You for being too nice, and him for being worthless."" Note that ""pimp slap"" was a playful reference to what I used to say in our younger years, and note that my ex never actually met my now-husband to judge him. It was well-intentioned advice to be careful before committing, or at least that was how I chose to take it. The reconnection ended painfully, mostly because I remember how genuine this goodwill he had for me. Is it normal to hate how I lost such a friend? Is it normal to wonder why it had to happen that way? 

My HS junior year ""boyfriend"" is still a friend to this day. Can you be called a boyfriend if you dump your girlfriend within a month for some girl who is ready to put out? Anyway, he gave me some FDS style advice at least twice in my life. When we were first trying to go back to being just friends, he told me that I shouldn't be going to movies with guys like him because what he would try is no good for me. 9 years later with the tension and some individual therapy behind us, he had me repeat out loud that ""I am an independent woman who doesn't need a man."" He became a good friend to me agaisnt all odds.

When I wanted to pay my own way on dates with my HS senior year boyfriend, he didn't like the idea and told me it made him uncomfortable. He decided to allow me to pay because of my insistence, which I appreciated. I was raised in a very generous family, so it just felt wrong to accept others' generosity consistently, especially from a high school boy who was starting out. Honestly, I am 50/50 on whether or not I did the right thing there. Maybe being more FDS would have helped better the relationship, but also maybe we weren't compatible so he had no business investing in me. I know that other missing FDS things contributed to the eventual breakup. He never tried initiated a kiss in OVER SIX MONTHS, and his whole plan for our prom was literally abysmal. Prom aside, his plan for some of our other dates was high effort and thoughtful. He also never properly asked to define the relationship exclusively. I really should have just bailed sooner.

In university, I had an off-again-on-again casual interest (okay it got pretty intense emotionally, but it never manifested into anything too tangible). He went out of his way to insist on paying my part during most occasions. I feel like acting on such a principle is a form of giving FDS-style advice. Oh, this same guy also promoted waiting for sex and no-fap. He was basically a tradcon. Now that I know about Reddit and some of the buzzwords, I can see how I was ironically getting FDS-style advice from a possible recovering manosphere type!

I met a friend who I think liked me at uni, but he never asked me out. I started to date my now-husband, and one day we all met up in the cafeteria. Me and my stud muffin rolled up with me holding my favorite soda pop. My friend asked me if I paid for my own soda pop. I said yes, so my friend turned to my now-husband and said ""you're not doing your job."" 100% FDS approved comment lol.

My husband often reminds me that the motives of a male friend are almost always ulterior. My husband is 100% against porn and disrespectful leering/comments in a relationship, so that's definitely FDS approved. My husband also believes that romantic gestures are supposed to be a thoughtful surprise. While it is 99% FDS approved for a man to do the work and ""wow"" the woman, it still isn't always right to surprise, and I will tell you why. He did not even tell me that he finished our wedding vows! He refused to answer if they were done, so I left mine at home. I just said ""I love you"" during the ceremony, and then this cheeky man entirely upstaged me! I appreciate the gesture, I really do, but give a lady the slightest warning sometimes so she doesn't look like a bumbling idiot clipping off her own vows. It wasn't until a year and a half later when we were watching a movie and husband said to the screen ""you're not supposed to tell her you're writing a love letter!"" that it dawned on me what he thought he was doing lmao. I told him I was onto him about the vows, and he admitted it. We had a good laugh.",91349,FDS encouragement from men in my past,0,,,

A stranger at a bar who had bought my friends and i a round of drinks, after I tried to buy him one out of feeling obligated, looking at me like I suddenly had three heads: “Thank you, but no. And  please don’t ever buy a man a drink, that is not how it works. Go and enjoy your night with your friends”. 

A man on a message board, responding to me when I said I hated porn but accepted that all men watch it and I can’t ask them not to. “What? Where did you learn that? You have every right to ask your partner to not watch porn. Jesus, why have men tricked women like this”.

Did you think this is authentic or do you think this is just marketing ploys? The reason I ask is because a lot of women who claim to be bisexual have never actually publicly dated any women. Not that they  have to, but it seems weird to no point be seen with an actual girlfriend. The only time you see them with women is usually just taking sexy pictures for the gram, or in videos where they want to seem sexy, which makes it seem inauthentic.

This has honestly come as a shock to me because my Mum was super busy studying when me and my sister were younger and my Dad worked really odd hours for us to get by. My Dad would always change and bathe us. I got a lot of UTIs as a child and my Dad would tell me how to pee properly. In an absolutely non creepy way, just as my parent. In the same way my Grandma would make sure I was aware to wipe front to back when using the toilet. I wet myself a lot at school because of the UTIs which my Dad always helped with. The only other option would have been to leave me soiled til my Mum got back.

I have a Tik Tok account mainly to see what’s going on with Gen Z over there &amp; the messages being spread. Aside from the obvious sexualisation of teen girls on there these days, i’ve seen a much concerning trend. 

The number of very young teen girls I’ve seen uploading multiple videos with their younger siblings left unattended is astounding. How do I know? Because they randomly follow me! There is tons of them. I click on their profiles &amp; just think ‘where are your fucking parents?!!’. They look about 11 and they’re there uploading multiple sexy dance videos for anyone to see with their 5yr old brother/sister in the background. These are ordinary girls with not tons of followers...they are more of a target. 

It’s pretty clear their parents aren’t supervising them when they’ve managed to upload 33 different dance routine videos by themselves. Sometimes they’re uploading multiple a day. I look at their followers &amp; there’s dodgy ghost accounts in there. This implies their parents are not taking enough notice of what they get up to. 

Sometimes they’re doing ‘sexy’ dances &amp; poses to songs with explicit lyrics as well. Dressed in skimpy pajamas etc. They may think it’s harmless fun bc they’re young &amp; naive, but pedos are thinking something different. 

Please block /limit the sites your children have access to &amp; monitor their social media use. Talk to them about online safety. Only allow them access to accounts you’re aware of so you can check what they’re uploading/have visited. 

Tik Tok will be full of insecure teen girls from unstable homes/arguing parents. Pedophiles go targeting them. The less they appear to be supervised, the better...because they know these parents aren’t paying attention to what they get up to..

&amp;nbsp;

#OH MY GOD STOP. 

&amp;nbsp;

Look, I agree that men are hating on this song for the wrong reasons. These women don't deserve hate or to be attacked. But let's not get it a damn bit twisted: they do NOT deserve to have this song supported. They SHOULD be held accountable by feminist communities for the way that they are actively negatively impacting the culture for women, ESPECIALLY black women. 

&amp;nbsp;

I think in our efforts to combat internalized misogyny we often support women who do not deserve to have their actions excused. WOMEN, ESPECIALLY WOMEN WITH A MASSIVE PLATFORM, CAN ALSO REINFORCE PATRIARCHY. They can encourage distusting attitudes. They can throw other women under the bus. They can spread an abuse culture. They can be Pickmes. And something we forget, in an attempt to protect women, and baby them and assume they can't be held responsible for enforcing patriarchy. Everyone wants to defend Meg and Cardi because men are going after them, but we should be having a major issue with this for our own reasons. You can shut down the misogynist complaints without ignoring the feminist ones.

&amp;nbsp;

I am willing to give women a lot of wiggle room. I know many of us have gone through decades of misogynist brainwashing and haven't unlearned it. But for me the line is crossed when you start infecting others with your Pickmeisha ways. There is no better way to do that than with pop music and social media. WAP is literally Porn, The Song ™️. How many of our underaged girls and boys are hearing WAP, being told it's empowering to tell men to fuck your throat until you're gagging, to cause you pain, to have your mouth spit into, to be called a whore? It's easy to feel disgust when a man says these things, but now we are saying about ourselves? If I'm being honest, it IS worse for women to say this stuff than men, and no one wants to say that because of men saying the same thing but for their own completely unrelated and incorrect reasons. It's not worse because women shouldn't be speaking about sex, or whatever, or because they use bad words. It's worse because it's a betrayal of our own worth as women ourselves.

&amp;nbsp;

It is not misogyny to hold women like this accountable, it is misogyny to shift the blame away or ignore the problem. The problem is bigger than just men and the disgusting way they see us. The problem *includes* women who put this message out to validate patriarchal attitudes. Cardi and Megan aren't sex workers. They aren't victims. They aren't being exploited, they're purposely putting a disgusting message out about women and our sexualty so they can profit off of what the patriarchy decides is popular. They deserve to be called out for it. If every woman stopped speaking about herself like she's a walking, sopping vagina, if every woman said no and fought back against that message, we would be so much closure to putting patriarchy down. Men will never be on our team. The LEAST we can do is be on our own shit and stand up to those of us who try to speak about us in a way that hurts our place in society. We should never ATTACK them, but we should never support, excuse, or tolerate. We can't make excuses for Pickmes especially ones who influence this for money from their male and naive pickme consumers. 

&amp;nbsp;

In short, these women do not deserve support. They deserve to be called out by other women, like yesterday, for these awful messages. Do not tolerate Pickme attitudes. And seriously, boycott this stupid fucking song.",91245,Stop Defending Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion,0,,,

I have a child who’s in school and I co-parent with his dad, so I'm pretty tied down to this area during the week.

I told myself that I’d never live with a partner before marriage again. I realize that this is an unpopular opinion, but I’ve had two 4-year long relationships during which I lived with my partner and they didn’t work out. 

I just think there’s a huge difference between moving in together with a lifelong commitment made at the outset rather than moving in with the typical “try before you buy” mentality. Knowing that you’re both committed to getting through rough times together it is what marriage is about to me (because to me it isn’t a matter of if, but WHEN things get rough, for one reason or another). Besides hard and fast dealbreakers like religious beliefs, whether or not you want kids, etc., I think compatibility is an achievement of a good relationship and not a prerequisite.

That being said, I’m finding myself feeling more and more anxious about us playing house. We’re both happy and I love having him around every day (he's a HVM and is helpful the house, how refreshing) but I worry that this situation will play out like my previous relationships. In my experience, cohabitation just encourages me to provide all the benefits of a wife without any of the commitment, so marriage offers little to no incentive. Men don’t want to buy the cow when they can have the milk for free. I don’t want to be a forever gf, I want to build a family and life together and I’m not getting any younger here. 

At the same time, just in terms of sheer logistics I don’t see how we can NOT live together, unless we’re okay only seeing each other on weekends. Further complicating matters is the fact that his love language is quality time, and I know spending weekends together isn’t going to cut it for him and I want to be sensitive to that. Spending time together is so important to him that he currently wakes up everyday at 5 AM to drive an hour and a half to work when he could just stay at his own place and have an easy commute (and save literally hundreds on gas each month!). 

We've only been together for 6 months so I seriously doubt he has any plans to get engaged any time soon. I don’t really know what to do. Any advice? What do you think? Is cohabitation a good idea? Am I anxious for no reason?",91238,Would moving in together be a bad idea?,0,,,

Whenever someone says ""I'm so jealous that you x y z"", that is not a compliment. It is a huge tell they are immensely envious of you and are not safe to have around you.

True supporters and friends in your life are going to be very happy for you and let you know that. They won't make it about themselves. Be aware jealous frenemies who are looking to one-up you in the future, you don't need that in your life. 

If you struggle with jealousy, please understand that when you are happy for the happiness of others, you attract the same things to come to you. Have hope that you too will have the same in the future. 

Also look out for those who only contact you when

* they want/need something
* want to brag about themselves/one-up you
* they do not check in to even ask you how you are but to gain info about your life (for gossip-spreading purposes)
* they do not care about your health or emotional well-being
* they cancel plans

Unreliability, flakiness, self-absorption, jealousy. These toxic traits go hand-in-hand. Become a good judge of who you let into your life.

This woman wrote a whole-ass article detailing her divorce and foray into hook-up culture, trying to convince readers (and probably herself) that you will find sexual empowerment from being choked to the brink of death in bed. From the article:

&gt; Troy and I didn’t slap or hit each other. There was a quieter intimacy and a quieter threat of invited violence at work here, in the way in which he slowly put his hand on my neck just to either side of my windpipe. The way, sometimes, he knew I couldn’t breathe, and pulled away just in time. That was trust. That was intimacy.  

No, that is not intimacy. That is a man, in that moment, using you as a sex doll to fulfill his violent rape fantasies, no matter how well he pretends to treat you before, after and even during sex.  

Finally, the icing on the cake:

&gt; He read my cues, put his fingers down my throat. He could have killed me. I loved it. 

Wow. 

So many women internalize men's hatred of the feminine and project that onto themselves and other women in their life. Women can live out their entire lives and die without ever realizing this. They convince themselves that some men's perverted, eroticized hatred of women is erotic for them, too.  This is a perfect example of an otherwise successful and talented writer being led astray. My heart breaks for these women (as much as they make my eyes roll to the back of my skull.) 

Most of all, it makes me sick that some women and girls will read this article and think they are not ""sexually liberated"" enough. Shame on the author for every woman who puts herself in a life-threatening situation because of it.

Women are also conditioned to believe that the bare minimum is a sign of a potential knight in shining armor.  

Even a HVM won't be your knight in shining armor, he will be a solid partner who has your back, loves you, supports you and adds value to your life. No one can save you or make you happy like that. You have to save yourself and be able to make yourself happy, or at least satisfied. A HV relationship DEFINITELY will make you much happier and will make you feel more secure, but it can't save you, give you a sense of self, or make you happy and feeling like you have a sense of purpose.

I think few women consciously search for their knight in shining armor, but they subconsciously look for it and it just doesn't exist. 

A great way to break free from this conditioning is to check yourself when you internally blow smoke up a guy's ass with your imagination, and think that the overwhelming odds are that he is not a knight in shining armor, but most likely he is a miscreant scrote wearing a tin foil hat. Break free from this conditioning, it is so so damaging and your dating/screening efforts will be futile if you are just not in the right headspace to see things and people for what and who they are. It can be hard, women are aggressively conditioned to endlessly give men the benefit of the doubt because of this knight in shining armor/kiss frogs until you find your prince fable.",91679,"Women search for their knight in shining armor, and instead they find scrotes wearing tin foil hats.

I’m not exactly sure what lifestyle I want, but I grew up poor so financial comfort is important to me. He told me to wait for money to come, and made jokes about “what if something happens to me and you need to take care of me” but we don’t date potential.

Insecure about my looks, fear aging.   
My entire life, I was brought up with the idea that women are doomed to be fat after kids or once they're older in general, and all people are destined to be fat and unhealthy as old people in general.   
""Don't eat too much, it will catch up with you when you're older."" ""Oh, you can eat that much now but some day you will pay for it."" These are things I was told as a skinny, tall child.  
I was very strong and fit at one point about 4 years ago, with a muscular instagram fitfluencer type bum. I lost those muscles when I was severely depressed for a couple years, and now I am getting them back. I gained weight within the past year or so, but I have literally never been overweight, just skinny fat. I lost all the extra pounds this summer in quarantine, and my work is showing now that I have build the intense muscle again.   
I am honestly overall stronger than I used to be, I have a cool mind muscle connection as a gym newbie that I didn't have the first time, but I don't look as good. My waist is not as tiny, I don't have a big strong butt.   
I'm also just about one inconsistent year into returning to fitness, compared to more than 2 years of consistent lifting which I did in the past to look that way. So I know there is time and I will get back there.   
I am feeling sad that I lost those gains. I look at fitness girls and I feel so lame. I could look fucking amazing right now. I feel pissed that 18 year Olds look like sculpted, strong Greek goddesses, and I'm once again trying to sweat off a dumpy ass and the last of my love handles. How will I ever compete with those girls?  
I'm disappointed at how much my mental health has held me back and disadvantaged me so far in life. I'm not trying to have a pity party. I am leveling up all over my life, yet I still have nothing true to show for it. Not yet finished with a degree. All the mental work I did to get over issues which plagued me, but this does not have any visible effect in my life. I feel like I have been in the negative and am reaching zero finally.   
This is all manifesting as: I'm feeling like, I'm crappy because I should at least be as hot as possible since I'm as young as I'll ever be, but I'm squandering my youth and looks by being average, or maybe slightly above average because I do go to the gym every day.  
I compare myself so much, I am so jealous. I try not to let people see that.  
I know someone else here must have felt these sorts of ways at some point.   
Can anyone offer me a mindset to replace the crap attitude and beliefs that I have been holding on to?",91632,"25f, I'm feeling insecure, that I will nEveR bE gOoD eNOuGh because I am not as fit and attractive as I could be. I feel like I am wasting the pEaK oF My yOuTh and BeAutY because I'm not iNsTaWoRthY. Fears of losing value as I age. Help me change this silly attitude and replace these shit beliefs",0,,,

We planned to meet today. He’s been really nice, very respectful, the whole 9. He sent me a pic (of his face) yesterday. He looked really cute. I sent one back (of my face), where I’m sitting and you can tell I’m wearing shorts.

Then this happened:

So before he sent the last text, he called me, and tried to hit me with a “oh I’m not one of those type of guys and I’m
not sure what happened in your past but it’s no big deal.”

He continued with “it wasn’t my intention. I was just kidding around. I’m a dad of two young women, i would never objectify a woman like that!” 

I nicely read him for the shit he was but after he sent the “apology” text, I thought maybe he deserves a second chance. (I need to stick with my intuition.)

Welp.. besides a good morning text I haven’t heard from him all day. Safe to say we aren’t meeting up.

I am highly intuitive and can sense a guy's personality or intentions just by something he may say or a slight action. Oftentimes, my observation based on my intuition is proven right.

 Another thing is that I find it extremely important for a guy to be intellectually compatible with me.this means that I seek someone who can hold a conversation on a date, and can be deep. I understand that being deep is not something you can have 24/7 and on every date, but I think that if someone can't have interesting conversations at the beginning, it's hard for me to stay interested as that's what attracts me to a man (his intellect).
There's a lot of other stuff.

I want a guy who dresses appropriately for dates. A guy who can keep in touch with me between dates. Someone who makes dating effortless for me- asks me out, initiates communication, plans dates.

CONSISTENCY. 

Yet, my family and friends keep criticizing me for asking for too much, having high expectations, and making men nervous. I'm so tired of feeling bad for what I want. 

I've way too often settled because my family/friends told me I'm overthinking things, only to get hurt for the exact things I settled for.

I see posts once in a while where some of you women discuss your dating experiences and how many of you often walk out on dates. This honestly seems like the most badass thing to me, but I've found myself unable to take that leap in the past. It feels like I have some sort of obligation to seeing through at least one hour of the date, but I know many of you seem to have no trouble leaving much earlier.

How do you get to that point? Is there a way to do it politely?

So randomly I found a guy who was 17 and _seemed_ cool, we talked a bit and he wanted to study the same thing I did at the time. So I thought “hmmm it would be nice to have a _*friend*_ with this same interest”. Oh, boy. 

Well, the thing is that he literally started to show his true colors A DAY after we began talking, he really wanted me to send him a selfie and asked me “what was I looking for in the chatroom”🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️  This all was suuuuper weird/creepy for me but I didn’t want to seem rude so I kept answering innocently (🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️)

Then, I really didn’t have anything to tell him so I just reply him with emojis and he said “Omg why are you so rude with meee”, so I said “that’s just the way I am”. Well, he proceeded to use the ultimate incel neg move saying “You must be living such a sad life if you find joy bringing other people down. No one will ever like you” (he literally was projecting himself lol). 

Obviously, I was like “what the heck” since it was the first time someone said such a thing to me, so then he had the AUDACITY to become the Schrödinger’s douchebag and said “Oh it was meant to be a joke. Sorry I didn’t measure my words”.  🤡🤡🤡🤡

The next day, he messaged me again inviting me to join him at his friend’s birthday when we was already there. I finally came to my senses and blocked him. 

The worst thing was that when I shared this story with a few people, they all said it was my fault for “leading him on”. Smh you literally can’t win with scrotes🤦🏻‍♀️

The biggest problem with the faux veneer of “equality” on all the “neutral” subs is that we can never speak our truth, because the truth paints men in an ugly light in comparison. 

FDS gets banned for “extremism”  and “hate speech” on other subs because of how we suggest women deal with men, but is it extreme? Or is it just a completely rational response to the objective reality of the things we all have repeatedly encountered in real life? 

Not all people want to sit around waiting to being victim under the veneer of “gender equality” nobody really believes exists.  

Pretending you can treat men and women exactly the same is stupid and literally NOBODY ON EARTH does this, but when you draw attention to this clear objective reality, everyone suddenly gets offended.

Everybody online wants to virtue signal, but in real life it is a different story. 

Okay, sure, all you “woke” bastions of gender equality, riddle me this:

if you’re walking alone at night are you equally afraid of being abducted by a woman as a man? 

You’re just as comfortable leaving your kids with an unrelated middle aged male babysitter
as you would be a middle aged female sitters?

When you hear about mass shootings are you EVER shocked it was a man? 

All the “woke” people who judge this sub are full of shit.

EVERYBODY enacts these little judgments against men to protect themselves DAILY because WE ALL KNOW THEY’RE MORE DEPRAVED AND DANGEROUS but then when we say it out loud on FDS suddenly we’re the “femcels that hate men”?

Or maybe we’re just the only ones not in denial and not afraid to call men on their shit? 

We’re not going to be nice and we’re not playing fair because the stakes are in no way equal and to the extent that anybody pretends otherwise is a testament to how much men have co-opted feminist language of equality to their own interest. 


**And if you write “NOT AAAALLL MEN” or “WHAT IF IT WERE BLAAAAACK PEOPLE” in the comments I’m gleefully banning the fuck out of you.  Race is not real but sex IS real and just because it’s not ALL men doesn’t mean it’s not MOST men or if it’s not MOST men, it’s still not overwhelmingly men in comparison to women.

I found a 2 year old car with all the bells and whistles and I love it!

Yesterday, as I dropped off my daughter at my ex-husband’s house, she was raving to him about our new fancy car. He looks at her and says, “I don’t think that’s your new car, it’s a rental”. It was worth every penny to look at him and say, “No, she’s right, I bought it”. 

He still lives with his mom and can’t drive. It may be petty, but sometimes it feels so great to flex on him and let him know how capable I am and how great my life is as a single woman.",92142,The look on his face was worth every penny,0,,,

I'm not gonna lie to you, I suffered with quite severe depression when I was in my early teens so I wasn't as hygienic as I am now but I always put A LOT of effort in whenever I'm going somewhere special (to meet people, interviews, church, etc) I was also a hugeeeee pickmeisha and kinkmeisha up until I found FDS (one of my favorite subreddit). This dude is a GAMER, about 2 inches taller than me, doesn't know how to dress, porn rotted, likes REALLY weird porns, he's stink stank stunk, doesn't listen to me, have misogyny kink and wanted me to become his housewife sex doll, picky eater, so picky that he doesn't season his food. The good things about him are...he has a dog and he...has a dog. This dude is not even a NVM, he's a ZVM and I can't believe I wanted to marry that when I was a wee freshman.

Ok so, I kept telling him to WASH UNDERNEATH HIS FORESKIN. I know I was underneath my clitoris hood. He said that he tried but it still stank. I told him to go get it checked. I always go to the OBGYN like twice a year for checkups to make sure I'm ok. I live in Canada so...FREE HEALTHCARE BABY! He REFUSED. Girl...I tried so hard to look and smell presentable and you have the audacity to be a slob. He always wear loungewear at school. I kept telling him no dude. Stop. He never changed for me.

I have MANY exes who are either stank, gross or both. Y'all need to take care of yourself pretty please. It's repulsive to the eyes and nose.

Lesson learned, NEVER EVER BE BARB THE BUILDER AGAIN! NEVER EVER SETTLE FOR LESS AGAIN! NEVER EVER HAVE MARRIAGE IN MY MIND EARLY ON A G A I N!!!",92088,Filthy ex boyfriends,0,,,

I just thought I'd share something that I did recently with an OLD interaction that helped me not get too bummed when the (predictable) decline in messaging signaled that the interest was dying out. 

As part of my overall level-up strategy, I am attempting to limit how much time I spend online outside of work. For a while I had stopped using social media altogether, but then I gradually relaxed that constraint and attempted to limit myself to only being online one or two days a week. 

So when I was interacting with people online, I would let them know not to expect any responses until day X or Y of the following week. That worked well, and for one person in particular, before I started this strategy, I had begun to get caught up in thoughts of them/us (basically premature attachment that I think is driven by frequent interaction and me projecting my ideals onto them). But by adding deliberate spacing into our messaging frequency, I was better able to remain detached, without having to maintain a scrotation.

Perhaps this might work well for some of you too! Please let me know your thoughts, and/or share any other strategies you might have. Thank you! :)",92042,Strategy to decrease attachment without a scrotation,0,,,

Hello beautiful ladies! I'm a full time veterinary medicine student (this will be my last year, 12h a day + a lot of independent study hours at home), I'm trying to gain some following on my bullet journal Instagram page and would love to start a YT channel around that (+ productivity, habit building, leveling up), besides that I'm in the ""process"" of building an app (without previous knowledge in java/building apps so I'm still in the learning phase) that hopefully I'll be able to incorporate into my vet school dissertation.

Those are my 2 main goals but also I really wanted to start to workout this summer (guess what? That's right I didn't) and do some school preparation work before the new school year starts (I haven't). And if that wasn't enough in the middle of all of those ""wants"" I found my self allured into the personal finances world, fire movement and investments because my profession in my country sometimes pays less than 15.000€ a year (sad) and I need to be smart and try to incorporate other sources of income.

The frustrating thing is that I am 100% organized in matters related to school/work. I've won 2 scholarships, I get all my study hours done religiously but when it comes to hobbies/ outside interests I get lost and seemingly get nothing done at the end of the day.

I've tried to incorporate a schedule, but (as an example) sometimes a bullet journal spread takes a whole afternoon to get done and I post every two days meaning all my scheduling goes to waste.

If any of you amazing ladies could share or two cents with me I'd appreciate a lot. Maybe I'm trying to do too much stuff at the same time and should prioritise more.

Thank you in advance.

The moment you slack off and let your guard down, his treatment of you will progressively get worse. Don't tolerate disrespect and a lack of effort. If something feels off, **trust your gut** and don't let yourself be gaslighted into thinking that your perception of reality is wrong. You don't have an anxious attachment style. It's your gut telling you that something is wrong and you should trust it. 

Even though you think that everything is going well, that he's your dream man, **always maintain that skepticism of him**. Some would say that this way of living is exhausting, but when you're able to be skeptical of the man you're seeing, you're able to detach emotionally from him as you please, and you won't be manipulated into gradually accepting subpar behavior and treatment from him. That, to me, is freedom. 

You never really know what a man is capable of. One day, you're dreaming about the future you're going to have with him. The next, he coldly dumps you in search of greener pastures. If you don't keep evaluating him and making sure he's treating you like a queen, he will hurt you.

Last year, when I was a year younger than I am now. I went through a rebellious pickmeisha phase. I was extremely depressed, a kinkmeisha, went through some traumas, abused substances, I hated my parents. This was pre FDS, pre Reddit and pre cat (the one I have now). I got a boyfriend who was a ""manic pixie dream boy"" if that even a thing. He was the highest value of the LVM stash in my life. But he is still trash. Just stinks less.

Pros: 
Handsome 
Talented
Adorable
A martial artist
Romantic
Funny
Likes cat
Protective
Took care of me when I was sick.
Doesn't use porn when we were together.
Walked me home. 
The bare minimum stuffs.

Cons:
Friends with people who bullied me.
Friends with this really toxic bully he had a crush on.
Never stood up for me until one day I begged him to stood up to this one molester.
Mama's boy
Daddy issues (in a bad way)
Too many female friends
Guy friends either have problems with me or do drugs and fantasize about wacking off to me. (He confronted that guy by himself though)
Put his dreams above me.
Sus vibe.
Said racial slurs. 
I found out from one of my ex bully turned friend that he told their friend group he had a porn issue months after we broke up. 
Collects used condoms he used with me that stank up his room.
Unorganized. Disgusting room. I lived there and I didn't empty the trash (don't know how to or where to do so) but I always cleaned my room and made sure it's organized.

There are so much more cons but I'll explain later

I went through so much that I got attached to this dude and moved in with him ONE MONTH IN. Ironically that he made me cry the most and sometimes I think it's my fault instead of his. The trash doesn't stink as bad, it's just toxic. He made me feel insecure, angry, gaslighted. Once, he lost his phone so he borrowed mine and logged into his Snapchat account and talked to the toxic bully he liked. Then he set my phone down to wait for her reply. The notifications beeped and I thought it was my notifications so I yanked the phone back, he was mad at he and yelled at me. I cried and told him it's my phone! He lied to me and said that he actually likes me living with him in the moment when we were horny. One day, his Christian mom found out that we had sex and was mad at him but didn't talk to me about it. When he got home from practice, I was so happy and rushed to him. He told me about the whole thing and acted like it was my fault. I felt like Eve when she handed Adam the apple. He told this girl in his club and talked to her about me which I found very um...humiliating but I can't explain it. He told her that tonight I'm sleeping downstairs. He kicked me downstairs into my ""new room"" and told me that I will NEVER be his inspiration for martial arts. I found that was SOOOOOOO narcissistic for some reason. I called my best friend and cried that night. I always called him my future husband and he called me his future wife but one day he told me he felt forced to do that even though he DID IT VOLUNTARILY. I cried for DAYS ON END. Imagine the man you wanted to marry just acts like he hates you. I cried so much I got sick and depressed. I abandoned my passion (I was in a school club) because of that. One day, things start to fade...he only wants to interact with me if it makes his pp hard. I asked him why then he said that I'm trying to sexually manipulate him. Bruh you won't love me if I didn't seduce you so...
I cooked, I cleaned, I waited for him to come home. I hung up his coat, I went to his performances, I told him I'm proud of him, I made him his favorite steaks, I tried to prove to him that I could be a good wife, I tried to prove to his mom that I could be a good daughter in law. His mom seems jealous of me sometimes despite the fact that I genuinely loved her. She made me cry and felt worthless after I made the entire family's dinner. It's not fun, the grease were hot, the stove were burning, I was tired. He never stood up for me, I had to ask her myself if she's mad at me. I mule, I slaved, I tried my best.
One day, I woke up quite early. (I wake really early). I wanted to go upstairs to cuddle with him. I decided to wait a few more hours because I didn't want to bother him. I finally went upstairs and he said that he's tired and wants to sleep a bit more. He didn't have issues cuddling with me in the morning as we sleep some more before so I got really sad. I sat down and tried to calm myself. Then I got up and kissed my hand then ""imprint"" it on his arm, but I did it a bit too fast so I accidentally slapped him. He got mad at me despite how many times I apologized. He was mad at me for DAYS ON END. I cried EVERY NIGHT. One day, he stopped being mad at me then only want to make out with me when I make his pp hard.
The next day, a few minutes after we were intimate (not sex) with each other, he broke up with me because I depended on him too much. I'm too manipulative. I was like ""ok"" then HE CRIED and made it about him. I went downstairs and cried. My stupid pickmeisha self decided to stay there a bit more because ""if I can prove to him that I love myself, he'll come back"". He never did. I heard a rumor (not true) that he's intimate with his female best friend and I cried, packed up, dipped. Before that, I confronted him and he humiliated me in front of his sister whom I love. I wrote a thank you note to her and her mom but only his sister actually hugged me and kept in contact. His mom got the note but couldn't care less. Now he's blocked on everything, no traces of him left in my life. 

Moral of the story. Don't do what I did. (Except the blocking) 

Thank you very much. God bless you all.
Stay safe and take care.",92410,Listen up teenagers! Never move in with your boyfriend! (This is a bit long),0,,,

Background: it’s from when I was 18 and dating a 31 year old BDSM-y man who constantly pressured me into threesomes. This conversation was from after our first one (back when I was still arguing against it and hadn’t just given up and accepted that I’d have to watch him fuck other women in front of me). 

https://imgur.com/a/GZv0m8s

This conversation was probably one of the only times I ever tried to actually lay down some boundaries. I was very meek around him and usually tried to hide my unhappiness. In this conversation, I told him I hated the threesomes but also didn’t want to lose him, which I knew I would if I completely laid down the boundary of “we will never ever do them,” so I hemmed and hawed when he asked me for a definitive answer. I also didn’t realize that by him saying I “ruined his threesome virginity” , and ignoring how I was emotionally *traumatized* by it,  he was shifting the focus from my feelings to his. Basically completely disregarding and ignoring mine.

It’s been several years, and I’m not 18 anymore, but I’m scared I’m still this girl deep down (see the last text in the conversation LMAOOO!) I really hope I never allow someone to treat me like this again.",92362,Found an old cringey pickmeisha conversation of mine. Long but worth it.,0,,,

I have depression = which makes it extremely difficult to take care of myself and to motivate myself.

I have acne = it appeared out of nowhere at 19 and I'm now 21 and its even worse I've tried dualec and benzoyl peroxide and I'll be starting antibiotics tomorrow. This also contributes to my depressive feelings.

I'm overweight= i feel extremely unhappy with my body I'm a size 16 and this is the biggest I've ever been. My weight is getting out of control ans i just don't know what to do. This also makes me feel worse.

Jobless= due to this I can't afford gym or nice things/meals to take care of myself and it also adds to that depressive mess.

I'm not good at doing makeup, frankly I'm terrible, the same goes for my hair. I've watched a bunch of YouTube videos and I'm just not getting it.

She overall reminded me that I was not stuck with them and that I could leave. That while it was great that I didn't need them, they (especially the last one) needed me and depended on me. 

As a fan of LTR, I incidentally fell vic to sunk cost fallacy and she indirectly pointed out a lot of what I see here (i.e. Kickhimout2020). She offered to bring her husband with her over the weekend in case my ex resisted.

Most recently, she saw me working myself to death when I didn't have to, and gently brought it to my attention because I had been ignoring it so strongly. I was tired, having memory problems due to chronic lack of sleep from my night shifts mixed with day ones, and my depression had worsened. Being like this kept me from wanting to deal with the issues and clearly waving 🚩🚩🚩🚩 of my last relationship.

This amazing woman walked me through breaking up with him step by step because I was so consumed with the usual crap mindsets like ""He's a dude and probably forgot. Just talk to him again. Remind him."" And even got as low as ""He doesn't put effort into building himself or helping you because you aren't worth it."" 😥

It was *bad*.

After she started talking to me, that was it though. In less than 24 hrs, he was out of my home. Sure, his crap was still in my house, but he *wasn't*. That new feeling of having the house to myself was addictive. Over the course of the next few weeks, I noticed a visible positive change in my cat's behavior. So he was probably mean af to him. 😡

By that point, all/most of my ex's crap was out and I had blocked him and his new mommy/gf.

My friend has a terrible boyfriend who has terrible double standards. He follows semi nude IG 'models' and constantly shows them to her. She COmMunIcAteD endlessly, but this guy doesn't give a flying fuck. He is worried she's checking other guys out, though.

My friend is not willing to leave him. I told her to, many times. She doesn't listen. I'm secretly thinking that she hopes he'll leave.

So our agreement is that we can only talk (rant) about him for 5 minutes and then we continue our communal activities.

She asked me for IG models. A LOT. She wants to return the favor. I'm not usually into 'getting back or even', more about throwing the whole man out.

First red flag: having your boyfriend move into your apartment after two months of being together.

All the other red flags: buying your boyfriend everything from a wallet, furniture and beer to his underwear and organising it for him. 

The worst of all, hundreds of people in the comments are defending her because ""her love language is gift giving"". Molly seems like a generous person, but this is humiliating. Doing so much, putting so much effort and spending so much money for a man who you barely know is just a NO-NO and common sense. It seems like she is purposely setting herself up for failure because now his expectations (even if there were no before) will fly through the roof. 

If not for this forum, I would have almost lost faith in women.

I think when I was acting accommodating, though it seems weak and feminine to do that, It's actual a male energy.

Actions I was doing to be accommodating: Suggesting date ideas, suggesting I come to him or meet in the middle, going dutch, going along with whatever he wants.

 For context on the last one listed there, He told me I was too accommodating. He said that he said that because when he called to ""discuss feeling disconnected from me"" I took it as only a break up, and asked if what he wanted was to end it. He said yes. And he called me accommodating later, in that context, saying he only said that because I didn't act mad or upset when he called. I suggested it and made it easy for him to end it.

So, being accommodating isn't keeping your boundaries either. It's ultimately a destruction pill for you. And you'll just be in pain.

In the past year I’ve been on a lot of dates, most of them went nowhere. The thing that sometimes bothers me is that I often find myself getting bored on a date when someone is not putting in any effort, but have no idea how to cut it short. I was raised to be very polite and accommodating and to put others before myself, so I have a hard time just saying “well it was nice to meet you, I have to get going now.” Even when the person is being disrespectful or I know for sure I feel no attraction toward them. And sometimes men would overdo it with the compliments and I feel so uncomfortable that I start complimenting them back with the same words just because I don’t want to be rude or whatever.

I usually have to sit through their rambling and boring stories or offensive statements until they suggest we leave, because I don’t want to make them feel like I’d rather be somewhere else. And at the end of a date when they ask when the next one would be and insist on making plans I usually go with it despite knowing I don’t want to see them again, just so I wouldn’t hurt their ego. Yes, I know that’s such a pickme thing to say, but at least I’m aware of it and trying to improve. This behavior is very harmful to me as I’ve even been in a situation where someone took advantage of me because I couldn’t bring myself to kick him out of my apartment despite extreme discomfort.

I'll be on a first or maybe second date with a man where I've shown zero indications that I want him to touch me or kiss me. We are not having a romantic moment, he will just get in my face go for it. Sneak attack kiss. Gross.

One time my date and I were sitting at the bar in a very nice restaurant in a highly visible spot, I was talking and had turned my head away for a moment to look at something to my left, when I turned back to him he was in my face and kissed me. I was disgusted. I had given no signals at all that I wanted this to happen. Similar situations have occurred at the movies and even walking down the street with a date. One time the guy even full on licked my neck and side of my face like a dog.

This is such a huge turn off for me. Needless to say none of these dates went any further. These men had no clue, no social skills and either could not read social cues or didn't care to. For context I am 52 years old and all of these men were in my age bracket. How the fuck can someone get to the age of 50 and be so clueless?

The only men I've been with who had good ""game"" ended up being LVM players. Most older men don't look so good anymore. They really need to have something else going for them in order for me to find them sexually attractive. It's as if they've all lost the ability to woo and seduce. It's not sexy and it makes me want to run for the hills. Ladies, it wasn't always like this. These are terrible times. :(",87312,Sneak attacks,0,,,

We couldn't meet earlier, restaurants in our area only opened up again recently.  I mentioned that I'm really craving a good piece of steak so he suggested a place. First red flag, he waited till late evening the day before to confirm the date, because we haven't settled on a time, only a day and place. 

When we got to the restaurant he at least had a reservation, so I thought there might be some hope for him. Second red flag came when we ordered. The place we went to is fairly expensive. He ordered the cheapest appetizer on the menu for himself, and then asked me if I'm still going for a steak. The steak was more than 3 times the price of the meal he ordered for himself, and also so much bigger. So I decided to also just stick to appetizers. Didn't want to eat a big meal by myself while the person I'm dining with is only eating a tiny plate of vegetables and a slice of bread. 

Conversation was really boring, it seemed like he had no idea how to talk. And also he was eating extremely slowly and admitted that he didn't know what pesto or hummus is. He tried eating it with a spoon on it's own, not realizing that he should spread it on the bread or dip his vegetables in it.  He claimed to have ordered that exact meal before and he loved it the last time, but he literally has no idea what pesto is for (his meal came with 3 different types). It was just weird. 

After I came back from going to the bathroom, his plate was suddenly cleared and I realized that this guy is incapable of eating in front of another person. When we were talking about cooking and recipes, he admitted that all his food comes pre-cooked from a nutritionalist and that he has a problem controlling himself when it comes to unhealthy food.  

I understand that many people struggle with eating disorders, but if that is something you struggle with then maybe a date in a restaurant isn't a good idea. It's just awkward and unpleasant for the other person. 

When we finally got the bill, he grabbed it and immediately worked out his exact part of the bill, then went on a huge rant about how this is the way he does things, he doesn't want to make things awkward between us by paying for my meal, and I shouldn't expect him to pay. Suddenly he was loud when earlier he talked so softly I could barely hear him. Even the tables next to us turned around to watch. 

I just said it's fine, paid my part, and left. Of course I'm going to block him after this. This was one of the most unpleasant dates I ever had, don't think splitting the bill was such a big deal for any of the other guys I dated. I just really needed to vent about this.",87281,Just got back from a first date where the guy have some sort of eating disorder and made a whole scene about splitting the bill. So awkward,0,,,

Tonight I logged into Bumble to look at his profile again and I saw that he had added a new picture to his profile - a selfie that he had taken and sent to me this past Wednesday. 

I feel deflated. Rationally, I know that we haven’t met and he has every right to continue to use Bumble. On the other hand, I feel as though he is likely matching with and talking to other women even though he told me he wasn’t. 

I was really looking forward to meeting him because I felt like it had potential, but now I’m unsure about whether or not it’s worth my time.

I’ve been a long-time lurker and a few months ago began participating in this sub and it has been absolutely life changing. 

The handbook and women in this sub have been like the older sisters and momma’s I wish I had before. 

I’m grateful that I’ve gotten so far in life and have leveled-up to be who I am today. I am confident in who I am, what I have to offer, and how I will never tolerate disrespect again.  I love my friends, job, hobbies, and my tome alone. I’ve been single for nearly a year (by choice) and have used this time to continue to transform myself.  However, sometimes I think about how the knowledge, growth, etc. had to come from being disrespected and treated like shit by an NVM.  I wish I could’ve figured this out without having to go through the crap I went through and wish I found this sub in my teens. 

I haven’t quite figured out why I feel sad about it sometimes. It may be because I’m hurt about the past betrayals from someone I trusted and cared so much for, or maybe I’m just ashamed that I ever put myself in that position in the first place.  I don’t know. 

I feel like I put most of the past behind me, but sometimes I look back and still feel sad about my past. How do you ladies deal when you do (if you ever) feel like this?",87110,I hate that the knowledge has to come from the “lesson” taught by dating an LVM,0,,,

I immediately got uninterested and unmatched with him. I thought it was funny but if you can’t even use that as an ice breaker, it means you just suck. A normal person would go “Oh wow! How about that. Yada yada”. Not “Cool... anyway...”

And I forgot all about the amount of matches who never message you. Delete delete delete. I think I’m just going to delete these stupid apps. 3 days and I’m out.",87711,Back on dating apps and forgotten how BORING most men are.,0,,,

Your crazy jokes that make your friends laugh, your childhood traumas and crazy stories, your academic achievements, your professional life and how much money you do or don’t have, self deprecating humor, childhood photos, your innermost insecurities and desires....

...why share such personal things with someone you’ve only known for a couple weeks?

What are you telling yourself about how you value your own stories and your own soul? You won’t have sex with someone right away, so why are you telling him about your childhood trauma on the third date? Why are you telling him personal jokes you’ve only told your closest friend you’ve known since middle school? 

Instead of observing yourself from his point of view, why don’t you observe him directly. Stop trying so desperately to impress with every word you say and instead see if he’s even worth spending time with.

Pretty good looking clean guy, seemed like he may be okay. I messaged him and he immediately wants to set up a video chat. Okay, fair enough. So, we talk for a while and he's very funny and charming and seems chill. Red flag #1 tells me his ex had issues and didn't appreciate him.. So, I'm like okay... maybe true. I've been there. Convo goes well and he tells me Red flag#2 You're the most ""normal"" girl I've connected with on here in a while. I wanted to chat with you to make sure I'm not getting catfished. So I ask him what his experience with catfishing was, and the tells me ""oh well some girls are 30 lbs heavier than their pictures."" Ugh, okay that's not catfishing, whatever. Rest of the convo goes great and I'm like, okay maybe he's alright. #3 Messages me after and says ""Go to dinner with me tomorrow night"". Doesn't ask. It's a statement. But I rationalize and go, okay maybe he thinks he's being manly or some shit. Today I message him after my final, as agreed, and he asks me if I wanna drive down to meet him for dinner near his house, which is like an hour from my house. That's #4. I say no that's too far, its almost an hour away and suggest a place more convenient in the middle. He says sure and tells me the name of the place he's going to take me that's nice. So 10 minutes before I'm heading out to go meet him, he sends me a voice message saying ""Hey, so let's meet down the street at the CPK, I don't even know if it's still there haha, but let's meet there and walk over to the restaurant so it doesn't look like we're meeting up for a date ahahaha""  WTF I send the guy a message after that and say ""Hey this isn't for me.

My friend asked me to pick her up from a party that she feels uncomfortable at. I get there and shes just gotten out of a 5 year relationship which was toxic and shes been drinking, so I'm kind of worried. Guys have been hitting on her in clearly weird ways and she thinks it's a compliment but I think it's disgusting. She begs me to stay for a little longer so we do, this girl is introverted so I thought I'd let it play out but watch her because I know what can happen to sad drunk girls at parties. Night goes on, the guy who invited her and his friends barely spoke to me but felt it was cool to just talk to only my friend. Not sure if I give off the ""don't fuck with me vibe"" but I definitely have a resting bitch face and voice (I wish I was joking). 

We finally leave. On the way home the guy who invited her who never even took her out for dinner but met her for coffee a week before .. decided to text her and tell her that he was annoyed with her for leaving, not kissing or cuddling him and not staying the night when he said she could. Me being an actual raging bitch at this point because of everything I heard about the night took her phone and called him. He didn't pick up, probably sensing it was me, that bitchy friend that won't let her friend get raped. I left a raging voicemail to this day I don't feel bad about. 

Something along the lines of:

- She doesn't owe you something for nothing
- She drove herself there and found her own ride home
- You ignored her more than half the night and flirted with other girls 
- You didn't even talk to said friend who came at her request because she was uncomfortable
- Your friends made gross comments to her a girl you had invited because you ""like her""
- You knew she was introverted but you left her alone anyways. 
- She texted me all night telling me she felt awkward and uncomfortable and was mostly alone
- She drank excessively for her because she was nervous and alone
- This was not a date and you're acting jilted
- Even if you're not ""being serious"" this is aggressive and disgusting behaviour. 

About a 3 minute long voicemail about how he needs to grow up and man up. 

Needless to say, things didn't work out with my friend and this guy. It took me 3 years after this to become a full FDS rule following woman, I have regressed in the past when I've been down, but I'm over that shit now. Only queen shit from here on out. 

Wholesome part of the story: 
After this voicemail I got got her large fries at McDonald's and we made a pact ""fries over guys."" More like friends before losers but it was symbolic.

Tl;dr: If you don't approve of a man treating your bestie inappropriately and are willing to tear him a new one, don't accept that behaviour yourself.",88470,"I once called out a young man for being a LVM toward my drunk friend, I only wish I remembered to do this for myself!",0,,,

 I was a little upset because I think that was uncalled for as I was just doing my job and I never interacted with this person before.

I was in a very abusive relationship with a LVM when I was 18. He was manipulative, mean, made my cry, stood me up, was cheating, and sexually assaulted me. We broke up 6 months in, but he manipulated me to continue sex for about 5 more months before I cut it off. It took me years to heal, I’m now 22 and fine. That relationship led me to want better for myself, and I discovered FDS. 

Well I got a message here on Reddit of all places. It sounded very manipulative, here it is:

“I know this will result in either being blocked or totally laced out, and I’m sure this isn’t conductive to either of our situations....but I just wanted to tell you I still think about you daily (my name). I’m genuinely sorry everything went to shit and I just needed to get this off my chest as selfish as it sounds. I just want to know you’re alright and doing well. Idc what happens after this, but I do honestly miss you, and I just needed to do this because it’s never gotten easier. Sorry to be so abrupt. Just please know I’m truly sorry and everything was and always be real what happened back then.”

I was so anxious. This could have only been sent by my ex given what he’s said. I paced and was anxious, confused and scared. But I’m so much stronger! I didn’t fall back into it. I might have years ago, but I’m never going to put myself through that again. Instead I said who is this? He replies with his name and a sad face emoji. Then he said:

“Let me know if you want me to go back to not existing... I’m sorry.” 

And I replied with what I’ve always wanted to say to that fucker:

“Every second I spent with you was an absolute waste of my time you manipulative piece of shit. You don’t get to know anything about me anymore. From the bottom of my heart, drop dead. Don’t ever contact me again.”

AND THEN I BLOCKED!!! Ladies I’m so happy I got to live out that power fantasy of telling him to fuck off. Maybe I should have just blocked right away, but I wanted to say something. I’m never going to be that weak again, and he never gets to know anything about me ever again except I’m too strong to be manipulated again! Stay strong ladies!!!",88808,"Ladies, I just wanted to share my recent victory.",0,,,

It never occurred to me all the sacrifices she was making to be with me. It took me all this time to realize that I was really lucky to have her in my life.
She had so many better options and she still chose to be with me.  I feel a whole lot of guilt for all she’s given me and so little I gave in return.

Then a year after he left us for booze and moved out, I started dating and got on OLD.  That should be self explanatory🤣 I did that for another year. Stopped dating altogether this past May. Too many unattractive and/or damaged men over the age of 35. Shocked to see that so many of them still angry at their ex-wife. It's like....grow the fuck up.

It took 2 years, but the brainwashing we all endure as women in regards to being in a RELATIONSHIT is cleansed. Yes, I had to go into the wilderness of dating to get to this point. I am 44 and I am finally free.

Since joining this sub I’ve maintained straight As for the past two semesters, started doing yoga and became more flexible, started working out and running, and started learning German and Spanish. Until recently I didn’t realize how much mental space romantic relationships and men where holding up. I feel more free and have so much energy. I’m graduating this December and I’m excited for the future for the first time ever. Thank you FDS!",89643,Thank you FDS for giving me my energy back!,0,,,

Basic issues were classic “if he wanted to he would” shit and his bad temper which, while he was not violent, was still triggering for my ptsd from a previous abusive relationship. 
To get to the point he knew my views on porn/prostitution and we had several casual conversations while we were only friends.  I’m an openly unapologetic radfem and everyone in our friends circle knows. His seeming respect for my opinion and interest in changing his own views were part of what appealed to me about him in the first place, but our mutual friends had told him he had no chance with me, that I was out of his league, and he apparently had a reputation as a fuckboy.
I resigned myself to never doing anything about the crush I had developed but we got drunk together one night and had sex. Fully unshaved, period sex, catered to my pleasure *fucking great right? He started to pay a lot of attention to me and asked me for weeks to go on a date with him. He was very sweet and patient and attentive so I eventually agreed. 
Everything was good at first but around 3 months or so of us seeing each other things started to get weird. The sex slowed down to the point that by the time we broke up he hadn’t touched me in 2 months. At some point some porn popped up on his phone and we had a conversation where I tried to establish boundaries telling him it made me uncomfortable in a relationship aside from my political views which he already knew. He offered to stop (I didn’t ask) and we moved on.
The sex didn’t get better and eventually I caught him shutting a laptop quickly. I let him know he’d betrayed my trust. That should’ve been the end of it but my old victim pick me mentality had resurfaced. Things sort of fell apart shortly after for a myriad of reasons. Maybe 2 weeks after breaking up I come to find out he’s already on tinder rubbing it in my face further the sexual rejection. 
So recently I’m hanging out with mutual friends and my bestie and I are talking about the abusive ex from before and him cheating on me. She asks if I thought new guy had cheated to which I replied casually “no, but I wouldn’t be surprised” this got back to him to which he took great offense because he’s concerned about his reputation or whatever. I’m now taking a break from everyone in the group as I’m too old for this high school shit. 
I never accused him of cheating but my point here is - just cuz he didn’t cheat doesn’t mean he was faithful. He did not dedicate his sexual energy to me exclusively and while I believe porn IS cheating most people don’t feel the same. Looking for some validation from y’all on my feelings because everyone else seems to be in a state of sexist Stockholm syndrome. What does faithfulness mean to you?",89613,Not cheating is not the same as being faithful...,0,,,

People are quite tribal, word gets around fast, that sort of thing. 

I went on a coffee date with a guy 3 years ago. We had known each other in social circles/through friends and cousins for 10+ years. He told one of my cousins that he was interested in me, the cousin got excited and was eager to be a matchmaker. Soon enough, a group of my cousins tried to set us up... 1) because they were bored 2) they were tribal/racist and didn't give a shit if we were compatible or not, they think that we just belong together because we're the same ethnicity. Other than that, they didn't have any real investment in any of this. I found it annoying how overbearing they were being when it didn't concern them. I tried my best to be cordial but it was difficult. 

Anyway, on the ""date"", he told me that ""we're both not getting any younger"", ""You're the only girl in our community not related to me"" and he also said that I should have asked him out before if I was interested. I got out of that date as quickly as I could. Told my cousins about it and they were shocked. Before the date, they kept telling me that he was a great guy, to give him a chance, just go on a date. They were shocked by how badly he blew it. Everyone let it go after that and didn't blame me for rejecting him. Although I know that they'd still be rooting for him and promoting him if he didn't blatantly fuck up so badly, they just couldn't endorse him after that.

He asked me on a 2nd date at a restaurant, I felt guilty but said no. I just knew in my heart of hearts, that this guy was more than just obtuse and socially awkward, something about him was off.

I was Facetiming with one of my cousins (let's call her Anna) the other day, and she told me that this guy's aunt called her aunt to ask about one of her relatives.  She said that ""He noticed her at Anna's engagement party"". Anna's engagement party was 10 years ago, and her relative was 13 years old when she attended. So he noticed a 13 year old girl at a party 10 years ago, thought she was attractive and thought it was appropriate to tell his aunt that, and his aunt thought it was appropriate to relay this information to her family? Anna's aunt ended the call feeling disturbed, the girl (who is now 23) was disgusted when she saw his pics (he's 10+ years older) and was even more disgusted when Anna told her about the coffee date I went on with him years ago. 

So yeah, I dodged dating a pedophile. I avoided getting guilt tripped into settling for a pedophile. Imagine if I had a kid with him, imagine going to a wedding or party with him and catching him leering at 13 year old girls who just got their period last year? I shudder with disgust just thinking about it.",89556,"Don't doubt your instincts, even when people around you try to make you doubt yourself.",0,,,

When I sheepishly tried to console her by saying “there are still a few good ones out there” she totally shot me down and said “NO mom, there’s not”. She’s extremely intelligent and I knew I had to stop arguing there even though there are a handful still but they won’t come in the full package most women look for. I feel so sorry for her generation and all the boys growing up with porn on tap. What does she have to look forward to? Certainly not a good, loving, respectful lover, breaks my heart. 

Then I went down a rabbit hole on Reddit and ended up on the r/teenagers sub where there was a big discussion about porn usage. Most of the guys seemed absolutely proud of their porn addictions, denied it was a problem, said it was normal and healthy, and wanted to know what got each other off. The fact that one guy said that becoming addicted to porn age 11 had eventually led him to be into scat, piss and rape porn didn’t even phase them. It was a super long thread and by the end I just wanted off this planet. 

Then today my bf opened up to me and said this guy he just met that was part of his sports community started recorded his feet and sweaty back and he got upset and asked him what the hell he was doing, the guy blatantly said he was going to put the videotape of my bf’s body on Fans only and make money. Now my bf is going to wait for that to show up then ruin this guy in front of the entire sport community that he is in, but he is also torn that he has to be seen in such a degrading light in the first place, presumably for the gay players of his sports sick desire to see his feet. I mean WTF. He really clung to me today. He isn’t part of this sick sexual sordidness that has completely overtaken and hypnotized the male gender. Even one of my oldest male friends has been making lewd comments to me via text lately and it’s made me sick to my stomach that he crossed that boundary with no apparent shame.

They can’t blame the lockdown, or women, or feminism, or the state of the world - they can only blame their weak selves and the choices they made to make porn, masturbation, degradation and exploitation of other humans the cornerstone of their existence. I for one wish they would keep it to themselves and not involve my daughter, myself and even my boyfriend in their sordidness. Ugh. Really just don’t know how much worse it’s gonna get but rest assured men will still continue to find crumbs about how women are just as bad (HA!) and continue their atrocious behavior.

A man doesn't necessarily have to be abusive to engage in abusive behaviour is one of the toughest pills I've had to swallow. It is important to set boundaries from the VERY BEGINNING. Some of these red flags can be spotted from when he first starts speaking to you. Don't try to explain to him that what he's doing is wrong. He knows it is wrong, he is just trying to gage how much of his ""wrong"" behaviour you will tolerate.

Make sure you always assess the safety of a situation first. If you believe it will be dangerous to put him in his place and you're both alone, do your best to just leave the situation first.

**If he tries to negs you:**

\- backhanded compliments such as ""you're \_\_\_ for a girl/POC/your major/whatever""

\- ""you're the second/third/eighth prettiest girl I've seen""

ROLL your eyes, sigh, or tell him ""oh, you're one of *those* people."" If he tries to continue talking to you, just walk away. He wants your attention, don't give it to him. People that have to try and take you down a peg know that they aren't worth your time. 

**If he speaks down/condescendingly to you:**

\- ""Just let me help you sweetheart""

\- It's actually quite simple...\*uses buzzwords/terminology that's too uppity\*

If he calls you a pet name which makes you uncomfortable, you have to very firmly (like you're talking to a dog) say ""no, don't call me that."" Be condescending right back. The tone of voice is a weapon often used against outspoken women in particular (I personally have experienced it). When you show them that their tone of voice won't cause you to waver in your confidence, they'll think twice next time, at least with you. (Unfortunately, some men will just go find another victim).

**If he doesn't respect the boundaries you set up:**

\- I know you said no to that drink, but I got you a soda anyways

Tell him ""I told you X times that I don't want it. I appreciate your persistence but it is unneeded.""

AVOID THE ""that's nice of you but."" It takes away from the main goal of the statement, which is to make him feel ashamed for trying

Niceguys do this a lot. The difference between an actual guy who's nice and a niceguy is that a niceguy won't back off after you say no once. They often pull this shit in social situations where you'll look bad if you decline his advances. 

**If he tries to tell you you're ""not like other girls""**

Ask him what the other girls in his life did to him to make him feel that way. If he says that they were all crazy you need to run. No explanation for this needed.

If he feels this way towards other girls, you will become other girls when he gets bored of you.

**If he says ""I'm not worthy of your love/affection/whatever""**

Leave him. Don't even bother responding. When men are attracted to women they MAKE themselves worthy. If he's going to wallow in self pity he can do that without going around trying to make women sympathize into fucking him.

**If he says ""oh so you'll cook/clean/do my laundry for me?""**

If his first response to hearing you like to cook is if you'll do it to serve him instead of something that's actually related to your interest in cooking (""what do you like to cook? When did you learn? I cook too! I've been trying to get more into cooking. Tell me about it!"") he sees you as something to use, not someone. It's also the lamest line in the book. Ask him if his parents never taught him basic life skills? (Avoid blaming ""mommy"" because it inadvertently affirms the idea of women being in charge of the kitchen at home.)

These are just some of the common ones. I also lurk this sub a lot so forgive me if I restate something someone else has posted about earlier! Just let me know who said it and where/when and I'll provide credit.

In both college and community samples, sexual assault perpetrators report consensual sex at an earlier age, more one-time only consensual sexual partners, and more positive attitudes about casual sexual relationships “without strings” as compared to nonperpetrators (Abbey et al., 2011; Abbey, McAuslan, &amp; Ross, 1998; DeGue &amp; DiLillo, 2004; Koss &amp; Dinero, 1988; Malamuth et al., 1991, 1995; Senn, Desmarais, Verberg, &amp; Wood, 2000).


Positive attitudes about casual sexual relationships (Hendrick, Hendrick, &amp; Reich, 2006) was used in this study to represent the impersonal sexual motivation construct. Although the items used to assess positive attitudes about casual sex do not have an aggressive tone (e.g., “Life would have fewer problems if people could have sex more freely.”), multiple studies have demonstrated that men who score high on this measure are more likely to engage in sexual aggression (Abbey &amp; Jacques-Tiura, 2011; Abbey et al., 2006; Nguyen &amp; Parkhill, 2014; Zawacki et al., 2003).


These men are likely to have strong expectations for sex from women they do not know well, and to feel that they are a good judge of which women are likely to be interested in having sex with them. Thus, they may become frustrated and aggressive when their advances are rejected, given that the rejection is unexpected (Kelly, Dubbs, &amp; Barlow, 2015; Wesselmann, Butler, Williams, &amp; Pickett, 2010).

He committed early - in fact very early - he said all the right things, he wanted me to meet his friends and family, he seemed serious. He is well educated, athletic, artistic, charitable. He complimented me a lot, made effort to keep in touch. We spent a lot of time together. He did find it a bit weird I suppose that I don’t like to get intimate with people early on and when I asked if that’s an issue he said he doesn’t know. This year he had a history of dating lots of people/hookups (I’m not sure which) and even met women at his workplace which I found a bit odd (he’s a health worker). 

At one point he almost left me because I told him a non negotiable for me is someone who binge drinks/goes to clubs (he had 2 binges just before we got together where he forgot where he was - but that’s it). Anyway after the intensity of it all, he started getting way more backed off and at times really snappy towards me. I told him he’s upsetting me and he said ‘go to sleep’. He would just find anything I said wrong. If I told him I miss him, he would just say okay. When I sent him a link about how men should appreciate women (referring to me) he said I’m being a bit arrogant. the night before it ended he said he loved me. Then the next day he said he’s not sure and doesn’t love me and then left. 

I guess I just feel a little bit disposable or I could’ve done better. I was really guarded until he seemed sure of his feelings but it seemed as if as soon as I let my guard down or showed I cared, he bailed. I keep thinking one day he’ll be perfect for someone and maybe he’ll change or be good to them. I followed FDS to block and delete but I’m just hurt and thinking he could do better.

Generally, I like it and can see it being helpful for let's say, every other area of your life EXCEPT for some relationships, and in particular relationships with men.

My therapist does not seem to see this, even as a woman.

I explained to her - I have been dating men for close to 12 years now. I have tried online and in person dating. The quality of men has not improved, and many relationships with men have really compromised my self esteem, time and relationships with other women. She seems to be of the opinion I just need to persist with online dating and hope for the right guy to come my way, which makes sense, but she does not understand - women were always expected to LOSE themselves in relationships with men, and the principles of acceptance of commitment therapy e.g. living a life within your values, seems incompatible with most male-female relationships I see. Most, not all.

Whilst my value is 'don't settle for a loser male who lacks empathy, integrity and willingness to work hard for his family' I cannot help but feel annoyed at some therapy styles because they put the onus on the individual as the agent of change, but ignore the wider societal influences that impact personal agency. PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN. Men can be like 'I want to find a good looking, nice woman' and find her online the next day because that is what society has programmed women to be.

Tell me I am not going insane?

Do I fire my therapist or ignore the whole dating/relationships topic with her?",89925,Struggling to follow through with psychological therapy due to the overarching gender/societal influences on women that impact on individual agency or 'self-efficacy.' What to do?,0,,,

I was going to try to forget this little incident but just listen to how apparently  men from all over the world (Europe here btw), specially educated ones (or seemingly so) are ugly creatures with huge egos who seem to believe that when they reach 35 magic happens and suddenly the most beautiful and younger (above all) women will kiss the ground they walk in.

I’m 26yo , currently doing residency in a medical program and as you can imagine I deal with massive pickmes and   the typical asshole who believes women are entitled. I was chocked because the following episode happened with two supposedly “good guys” and colleagues. One has a forever girlfriend (since they were in high school) and the idea of marriage is not on his plans “for now”. The other is single and I was told by some women in my department that he is a very good guy (beware...).

Me and another female colleague were by the coffee machine and were joined by these two. I can’t quite recall how the conversation went this root but the single “good guy” said that the male sexual value is the highest at 35, therefore he still has a couple of years left.  When he gets there “he will have more wealth and be better resolved as a men”. And then “oh and opposite goes for you too...in fact you are already declining”. The one with the forever girlfriend gave him a shy smile. Me and the other woman were both speechless. 

We are both 26 and take quite good care of ourselves, both quite feminine and definitely not lacking in the looks department.  These are short men and the single one stutters, who does he think he will be when he reaches 35?

I don’t know if they are insane or women really are dumb enough to fall for these pathetic excuses of human beings?",89894,Male coworkers negging you,0,,,

Was seeing a dude that had been cheated on by his ex - according to him things seemed fine and then he came home one day and she’d packed all her stuff and left him for another guy. And I sort of laughed about it at first (cuz I’m an asshole) like ‘surely things didn’t SEEM fine up until this, like did y’all not talk at all?’ Lol. But didn’t really press further to be respectful of boundaries.

Come to find out later there’s a pattern of all his long term girlfriends cheating on him. At this point his real self is starting to show and we broke up. But like these girls leaving him for other guys should have been a clear warning sign to me that he was low value. What’s the common denominator?

Stereotype is that men cheat out of lust; women cheat because they’re unhappy. Right? If a woman’s needs are being met she’s not going to cheat. Maybe in very rare cases or way back when the dude was going for LVW.

But if he’s spinning you that sob story of betrayal and heartbreak....he ain’t it.",91162,Women don’t cheat on HVM,0,,,

Ooh, you're moving too fast (fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast)  
Ooh, you're moving too fast and I don't think it's right  
I'm not giving you my love tonight  
Now, ooh, you're moving too fast  
Better sit back, relax  
I'm not giving up no love tonight

Made a sound, no understanding  
Boy, I know what you're demanding  
And it's time for me to let you know (mmm, mmm, mmm)  
Never be without hope to play this game  
Not too serious within the same  
Stop it please 'cos ain't no possibility  
Won't you put your dirty hands, dirty hands on me",91127,UK FDS Song,0,,,

The woman keeps giving shoddy explanations about getting back with him, saying he is good to her. But having been in an abusive relationship without being treated well, I know I stayed because I thought it would be more dangerous to leave than it would be to stay in the relationship, you hope compliance would spare you more indignity. Most times I am nice to problematic and invasive men is to prevent some extreme persecution from them. 

Also the podcast is such a great example of how we raise women to be scared and comply with our abusers. Her mother and the sister (who got murdered) both loved Billy(the sister’s husband) and John. Even after the sister got murdered the mother said that she still loves him because God made her that way. If you see problematic behaviour in your mother be hyper-aware of your own behaviour. Even if you know what’s right for you, take a beat before responding to a situation. Do not resort to politeness, you don’t need to be aggressive but don’t sugar your disinterest. It’s so easy to fall into the loop of pleasing men who neg. Despite knowing what was happening to me was wrong, I went on autopilot and fell back on the trait I had inherited from my mother of not rocking the boat in the hopes of self-preservation. 

This is a great lesson for me. In all situations where something is being asked of me, I’ve slowly learnt to step back and take my time in responding. Know that your compliance with manipulators and abusers only fuels their belief that that’s the correct way to conduct themselves. THINK! Connect before indulging him as opposed to after, analyse him ruthlessly. Assholes are assholes for the get-go.",91123,The ‘Dirty John’ Podcast.,0,,,

This is my first time posting. I’m not sure if this belongs in this subreddit but I could use some help if you all don’t mind. 

So I’m a 29 year old lesbian who still lives with her mother and doesn’t have a car. I’m overweight and work a minimum wage job. I don’t dress up because I genuinely like to wear jeans and a t-shirt. 

It’s obvious that I need to get my own place and car/fix myself up physically, but how else can I level up? Maybe it’s my attitude, but then again, I know people who are worse than me who still get dates so.....

I don’t approach women because I know for a fact that they don’t like me. How do I know? Because if they did find me *at least* a little bit attractive, they’d talk to me. But they don’t. 

So I’m just wondering what else can I do to level up, besides the above, that can make me more attractive to other women?",91043,How can a lesbian like myself become a HV girlfriend?,0,,,

I didnt realize how horrible this whole experience was, until a year ago (this whole thing happened 3 years ago) I cut off ties with him several days later, but not for that reason. I knew I had feelings for him and he didnt, so I just couldn’t continue to see him. He said that hes sure I’ll meet someone who would be  more compatible with me, who would treat me better bla, bla, bla. Whatever. Im angry that I was so polite and didnt call him out on how he treated me, and he just got away with it. What hurts the most is the way I lost my virginity, not because this scrote couldnt see my worth. He has good reputation among his friends, and is always described as a nice, cool guy 😒 Anyway. I wrote short letter describing how awful he treated during my very first intimate moment. I thought that if I expressed my feelings in letter, then never send it, this would be enough. But its not. I wish I was more assertive back then. I know I will come off as pathetic and like I’m still hung up on him if I send this text. He probably will just shrug it off and won’t care.

I have a Masters, Bachelors degree etc and I ave been working in my field for 6 years. It's an incredibly competitive line of work. At the start of the year I took a position at a new site. Like all new employees I negotiated the social and cultural complexities of a new environment as best as I could. I didn't want to rock the boat. During my time I encountered two LVMs in particular, who are the focus of this discussion. One was my line manager, and the other was a same level employee.


Previously there have been instances at work where my line manager took credit for my ideas and hard work, and then physically presented it as his own to head office and other staff. My response previously was to complain about it to other staff and then send him an email, where he refused to acknowledge what he did and give me any recognition. Head Office gushed about it and I moved on. Well yesterday he pulled the same trick. Only this time I called him out on it in front of other staff in an innocent way, and he blushed and admitted to stealing my ideas ""because they are so good"". I overheard him excitedly telling a colleague about my.newest  idea (his idea) and how he was going straight to Head Office. This morning I sent a well articulated and excited email this morning to Head Office about my idea and something along the lines of ""I wanted to make sure my line manager shared it with you"". Boom. Take that, you little weasel. 


The other win for me in the workplace, is with another LVM who throughout my time there has made inappropriate compliments about my appearance which undermined me professionally. Yesterday he did it again, and I finally put him back in his little box and said if he ever does it again I'm reporting him. He tried to gaslight me and act innocent but I was not overreacting. I'm not letting someone do that to me and belittle my professionalism with over the top comments on my appearance.


All boundaries in our dating life, need to cross over into work. Don't let anyone walk over you, but build yourself up. You don't need to step on others to get anywhere, you need integrity, a good work ethic and don't ever put up with workplace bullshit. Surround yourself with strong women at work with the same values and support each other.",91012,Winning against LVMs at work,0,,,

I tried twice but didn’t like it because I felt bad leaving my cat and it threw of the Routine I have. He told me my lifestyle is still very “single” life and I need to make him a priority in my life. I’m 25 btw and maybe because I haven’t had many relationships I’m not familiar with this, however it caused much anxiety in me. I felt guilty if I chose an activity over him and I hated it. We did spend Saturdays together hiking but he always wanted me to sleepover after at His place and I didn’t want to.

In it, a woman chronicles how she discovered that her fiancé, a rising **dating and relationship** blogger/journalist, was cheating on her just 130 days before their wedding with *MULTIPLE* women... She even posted the screenshots she found of his texts to these women, and frankly, they're disgusting. They made my stomach turn just reading them.

To give you context, this couple was in the public eye. His proposal to her was featured on Good Morning America. And their relationship also contributed to the brand image of ""hopeless bachelor to happily married man"" aesthetic he was peddling.

I did a little more Googling and found an essay he wrote on Medium reflecting on how her highly viewed and publicized blog blew up his life. He's been unable to hold down a job because all his potential employers find this post whenever they do a simple Google search. It seems like he tries to take responsibility for his actions by admitting to his narcissism and repeating multiple times how he's turned to church and therapy, but his ex's blog already predicted he would try to manipulate the public with a ""reformed boy"" image.

I think this is important reading for all women here. Narcissists are master manipulators and ignoring red flags will likely lead to you getting burned. No matter how much career success a man has attained, no matter how adored he is by his readers or fans, no matter how much clout he has, it's likely all a facade when coming from a low value man.

Contact became so sparce that we were barely friends let alone long distance dating. In general he doesn't talk much, he'll text me saying hi, ask how I am, then the conversation will pretty much end there, despite me asking a bunch of other questions that he could keep the conversation going with.


Other than him leaving the country, this is why things didn't work out between us, he literally just never spoke and when he left the country its like I stopped existing in his life because if I texted him I'd get like a short sentence in response if I was lucky.


Anyway, I had high hopes for our relationship, and I really liked him and really enjoyed the time we spent together and wished that it could be long term (I even saw it being long term because I thought he was a good guy) before he dropped the bomb that he's leaving the country. 


Since February I've come to terms with what happened and am pretty much 100% over him and everything about him, but like every month or few weeks he'll text me out of the blue and then I'll start feeling sad out of nowhere after I reply to his ""how are you"" texts. Like I'll start to think of what could have been, and like ""what if"" and all of that stuff, because we had so little time before he left we didn't really get the privilege of being able to see the best of each other.


Tldr: When I start feeling down because of my ex texting me, I start to lose motivation to work on myself, level up and move forward. So I'm asking, even though he's done nothing wrong, and I wanted to consider him at least a friend and have him in my life, is it better to just block him and remove him from my life for the simple fact that he distracts me from my goals?",91977,Should I block an ex for the simple fact that hearing from him makes me sad and hinders my self improvement progress?,0,,,

Pretty sure I’ve been being gaslighted .

Okay so I want to know if I’m just overreacting and overthinking . My my boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years. We are both in college and his college is about 20 minutes away from mine. He just transferred to a university from community college last Fall in September. 
   We’re not people that have had a lot of experience drinking or anything so we’ve tried to avoid doing that especially in public , when we’re not with each other,  as we don’t know what could happen. We had an agreement as well about him not hanging out with all girls and me not hanging out with all guys, unless we’re with other friends . So, October last year he tells me he’s going with his friends to a girl’s house. He doesn’t invite me . And a day or 2 before that ,  he also went with his friends to a guy’s house, he did not invite me to that one either. Mind you I invited him to all of my friends gatherings and I thought it was weird he didn’t want me to come . He claimed that the first one they went to would be all guys there ( there wasn’t per his Snapchat) and afterwards claimed he did not know girls were going to be there. Still I thought that was weird cause like , how do you not know who is going to be there? And he was so against bringing me because it was an “all guy thing” yet hee girls happened to be there as well. And he was drinking there . For the second incident where girls were present, I was doing something that day so I brushed it off as that’s why he did not invite me. 

  When I watched his Snapchat I saw a girl singing and he kept zooming into her face and other girls faces , thought it was weird , disregarded it . A few days later we go to target and a BUNCH of girls come up to him hugging him and they were so pressed over him, excited to see him. They were like “Hey (bf)!” “OMG (bf) I missed you” and just being extra in general . I was looking like wtf and felt so awkward and embarassed as they completely disregarded me. I asked him about it and he gave me some shitty explanation like “ oh I don’t know why they did all that I don’t even know them like that, never interacted” . I’m like now why in the world would a bunch of girls come up to you acting so familiar with you if you don’t know them and you guys had no ‘connection ‘ at the party? I asked him if maybe he had talked to them at the party , he said “NO”. I wouldnt have even had a problem with that tbh. I was just wondering what connection did they have at that party that would make a bunch of girls you just met so excited to hug you and “miss you” . It was so  weird to me. Fast forward to today, I was looking in his phone ( I know thats wrong )and ended up just looking through some old photos not looking for anything wrong anymore . I saw he had videos of him with the girls at the party... One was a video of what looked like a girl singing to him while he was standing with  another friend, another video of him dancing and another girl closeby dancing ( not on eacjtoher but kinda like looking at each other dancing and laughing with eachother) . And after looking through his snap messages with his friends, I found a group picture of him and all of those girls ( who came up to him that day in target) in like a bathroom mirror and one of the girls was wearing a short crop top and was turned posing , with her stomach pressed against his side , which looked highly innaproproate. He also had his arms around all of the girls and one of his guy  friends was in the photo as well , as he was the one taking the mirror photo( not touching the girls) . 

Later today,  I confronted him about the situation again asking again did you have any connection with those girls ? Maybe sang along ,with them danced, along with them? Why would they be so excited to see you?He says he doesn’t know it’s because he was being “a good Dj for the night” he thinks they just liked the music. I brought up the picture he was inalong with the videos of all of them together and he had no good explanation for it , just that he didn’t remember all that, and made excuses that they weren’t necessarily dancing or singing together. What hurt me the most was when asking him about the picture he said “ what me taking a picture with a bunch of girls ??” Like he didn’t see the issue in the picture, he literally looked like a pimp with a bunch of hoes around him... and thing is I don’t even have much a problem about what I saw but it’s more so , why did he lie about those small things ? What else happened at that party he’s not telling me about ? Why would a bunch of girls hug you and be excited to be around you if you so called never spoke to them there and played around with them? I’d also like to add he’s told me about his friends passing those girls around sleeping with them and how promiscuous they are , but you’re hugging in a group photo with them at a party,? 

It’s driving me crazy right now because he keeps lying about it and I don’t know how I can find out the truth . And there’s other situations with girls that don’t add up too that  I feel like he’s lied about. Idk what to do . Can someone outside the situation tell me what you think about it and if I’m just “over thinking things “ like he says ?


TLDR: boyfriend lied to me about not interacting with a group of girls at a party( these girls approached us before hugging and greeting my bf), tI looked through his phone found proof he was interacting with them at the party, he claims otherwise , gives shitty explanation,  and says I am overreacting. Am I overthinking the situation?",91899,I think my boyfriend cheated on me months ago and is still lying about it,0,,,

My first relationship started when I was 18 and he was 21. By the time he was 25 he wanted to marry but I wanted to study further and 22 seemed just too young to settle down. 
So eventually we broke up because I didn’t see myself getting married until 28-29 at least and he didn’t want to wait that long. 
My question is that if he had waited, I would have been labelled the forever girlfriend and so many people would have assumed he’s stringing me along. 
Sometimes it’s the woman who doesn’t want to marry too young. I don’t think marriage has ever been a priority for me. 
While I understand that most men string women along for years and marry the next woman within 6 months, perhaps the thing that is required for a good long lasting relationship sometimes is patience and wait until someone is ready. Especially when you commit so young. Is marriage the only logical conclusion of a relationship for most people?",91522,On “forever girlfriend”,0,,,

The only issue with dating older men I have found is that I feel like ive got no power. They made all the decisions (even wether we stay together or not) and it was their way or the highway. It was frustrating and made me feel helpless.

While dating older men, how do I maintain my power? My sweet nature makes me susceptible to abuse.",91501,How can I date older men while still maintaining my power?,0,,,

Ladies, PLEASE read the comments, they are mainly from people 50 and up and contain very useful anecdotal examples from women who have lived through the romanticised ""marriage and 2.4 kids"" phase and have either been widowed or divorced and who would choose to NEVER remarry or cohabit with a man again for the rest of their lives and the reasons are ones FDS warns about over and over. Also there are comments from women stating that many women who sacrificed their golden earning years to work AND look after kids and husband only to get divorced often end up as the elderly poor if not in hypergamous unions and many of the women say if they knew when young what they know now they would NEVER have married or not just for ""love"" etc and these women are now living their best gold years filled with packed social calendars and female friends!. And lastly it is as expected, filled with angry and delusional elderly men who STILL can't accept the universal truth that they need us more than we need them-even when sex is not the main motivator!

Many of the silly male commenters throw out embarrassing retorts like ""well there are plenty of younger women interested"", lol LOL! We all know that is nonsense without them being super rich but when this is pointed out the men admit that they know this and are more than happy to pay for the privilege of a younger nurse/bangmaid-I mean partner :). Bottom line, men know we have the power and will pay when they care about impressing you, know you know your worth and/or they cannot use the carrot on a stick of marriage or the leverage of them being young and attractive enough and of a similar age as the women they are courting during her child bearing years if she wants kids. But the biggest take away is men do NOT change, their desire yet simultaneous resentment towards woman due to their dependence on us does not change and most women who make it to old age who have lived the so called dream of marriage and kids would never go back to living with a man full time unless it involved an incentive on her end-aka financial security and considering most of the world’s poor is made up of women and children it makes sense. Read all the comments ladies, it may just change your mind or at least educate those of you still on the fence or in denial on the realities of the ""dream"" the society sells women as if it is in our best interest when it usually turns out to be quite the opposite...It is men who truly fear getting older and dying alone and If you do want to get married , especially if kids are involved be realistic and prepared, don't overly romanticise and make sure you will benefit financially as a priority and there is no shame in that!",91498,Women Over 65 Don't Want To Live With Their Partners...,0,,,

It has really helped me remember my strength and immutable worth, it’s make me laugh, it’s made me angry on behalf of my fellow women and the absolute trash that we’ve had to endure and are sold as “acceptable”. 

I’m interested in opinions on situations where FDS rules are just inadequate, or cannot be applied to all situations without nuance. 

The first that comes to mind is one I’m grappling with currently, that we should under no circumstance ask a man out. I think there are rare situations where it may be ok or even necessary to be a little more direct with a man. Let’s say he’s shown consistent interests for an extended period of time, every single day, and you’ve received and sent every non-verbal cue in the book including flirtatious touches, but has yet to utter the words “Would you like to go on a date”? He’s successful, handsome, treats you with respect, seeks you out...but sometimes appears nervous around you, goofy even...like he’s unsure (despite you sending all the signals) whether you like him back, or whether it would be appropriate for him to make a move for social/work/friendship reasons. Is it really the end of the world in such a situation to say something like “Here’s my number, if you’re interested let’s go on a date sometime”, leaving the ball in his court. It also communicates that you’re confident and able to ask for what you want but not bothered if it’s not reciprocated. I believe I heard the term “strong vulnerability” in a school of life video, and it really resonated. The problem with pickme tendencies is not that interest is shown, it’s that it goes well beyond that and turns into manic dependency. 

I am well aware of how horrible some men can be, and I’ve dated a fair few of these unfortunately. But there are good men out there, and sometimes they’re the ones least likely to ask for a date, emboldened by toxic masculinity and an inflated sense of self. What of the quiet men? Or the shy? Or those who genuinely feel you’re out of their league or excuse away the signals you send that you like them out of disbelief? 

Is throwing the first ball into their court really all that bad?",91490,"Exceptions to FDS rules, and the problem with dogma?",0,,,

I've been introspecting a bit and I've been curious on what you ladies would have to say about this. I am going into my second year of college and I tend to go for guys 2-5 years older than me. I have never had good experiences with men too close to my age so I tend to avoid them. 

When dating guys a couple years older, they tend to be either just finishing up college/uni or be in a position where they have just started their careers. With this, they tend to be a lot more independent than me (having their own place, car, having finances somewhat in order). They are a lot more knowledgeable than me in regards to these topics, and as someone who wants to become more independent, they are a great resource for me. I often ask them questions about them and get advice from them. 

As most of these dating situations never progress to exclusivity, I end up just ""using"" them for any advice they have and then rejecting them once they screw something up or find some incompatibility. Is this a bad idea? My female friends my age are at the same life stage as me and don't have much advice for me. Especially in regards to moving out or getting a car, for example, and trying to find the exact answers to the questions I come up with on the web can be quite laborious. My parents do not support me becoming more independent so they don't help me.

I worry that asking for too much advice might create a weird dynamic should the relationship hypothetically progress... As in him developing a superiority complex over me or something. Is this a true concern? Should I just stick to using Google?

Thank you in advance!",91430,Is this a non-issue?,0,,,

Here are some points my friend and I discussed they other night about this exact topic.

1.	⁠Men who fail to hide their misogyny, post freely in forums that encourage that mentality. They degrade women down to their looks (SMV) amongst other superficial things (n-count) that have no direct impact on the woman’s character. But in society, when guys are being guys, the woman is for having standards and preferences therefore she is seen as disgusting.

2.	⁠Outside of Reddit, this sexist attitude is still prevalent and it’s easy to spot when you interact with men. Guys will use women for their bodies, and turn around and say “she slept with so and so, she’s a hoe” yet, these guys friends would still date and sleep with said “hoe”

3.	⁠The “hoe” dresses provocatively and dates men- (which is totally within her right), and regardless men hate her and drool over her. They will cat call her, make lewd remarks, do stupid shit to impress her just to shoot their shot. 

4.	⁠Men claim that SMV, N-Count, and promiscuity are deal breakers, but will still sleep with anything that has a pulse if no one would find out. They claim these women are not relationship material, but they still choose to pursue her. Men, who have crazy vapid physical standards go for women who are so out of their league, that the ONLY logical reason why the  woman entertained them in the first place was for their status and wealth.

5.	⁠If they’re rejected, she’s a gold digging hoe. If the woman accepts their advances, she’s a gold digging hoe. But for some reason it’s totally cool for men to use women for their resources ( sex, affection, companionship, and ego boost) - but I guess since these resources aren’t material in nature they get a pass 🙄.....  but god forbid a woman wants a guy who is tall or that practices basic hygiene 

6.	⁠Men want a “decent women”, but aren’t even open to a relationship They say it’s because there is no one worth it, but they have a woman right in front of them that is interested for the RIGHT reasons, he will still pass her up. Excuses range from (I don’t want to be tied down, I want options, I just want sex for literally nothing in return) oh AND I’ll lie to you to get it. Aka, I’ll take and give nothing in return. You’re garbage, that deserves to be disposed of accordingly.

7.	⁠Men continue to seek out women, using dishonest tactics, to get more women. Woman catches on, woman drops his ass. Man implies woman is worthless and not high value enough to treat as a human with thoughts and feelings. Shamelessly I might add....

8.	⁠Man blames women and the cycle repeats.

This happens in all cultures across the board, men condemn women for their sexuality. But the man, who freely displays his, is a stud and a “Chad” who is some how better and out of every woman’s league so he can’t be tied down.

Think of Jeffery Epstein, Harvey Weinstein, Bill Clinton, Hugh Heffner, Dan Balzarian, etc.

Each of these men were “alpha”, they had access to resources, education, money, power etc....The former powerful men of the world had access to all the women in the world, you’d think surely they could find ONE woman that was “wife material” ... and even if they did, they’d still cheat on her etc. 

OR, even the average dude who is Muslim let’s says... he dates women outside of his culture knowing damn well he plans on marrying a woman of his culture. Regardless, he uses the woman for his benefit, and then after the fact lets on to the fact that he can’t date anyone outside of his culture because of religion etc.... 

It’s always, you aren’t good enough for me and I see you as a second class citizen. Even other women of the same culture deal with mistreatment and overt misogyny that has been normalized as “family values” or “cultural values”

Men who have their shit together, and who are mistaken as viable partners STILL chose to exert their power over women, by objectifying them, degrading them, by emotional or physical abuse...

Men view women as objects!!! As possessions! They think women are inferior in the workplace, at sports, in academics and in their private personal lives when it comes to dating! I would say they’re all misogynistic because men are inherently predators!! They create a power imbalance and prey upon it.

As the saying goes “men are as loyal as their options are” .... meaning, if they have the opportunity to engage in whatever weird shit they wanted to, they would!!!

(Not ALL men do this, but this is my experience as woman who is in their early 20’s and dating, same with my friend too)

At the women’s expense always.",91426,Are all men are misogynistic,0,,,

I think the majority of LVMs tend to either be anxious, avoidant, or a mixture of both, which can make dating them hell. 

I personally used to attract anxious attached men in the past probably because I used to be an avoidant. This is important to note because similar attachment styles (besides secure attachment) tend not to date for very long. I think the majority of women who are a pickmes tend to be anxious, so they date avoidant men. 

This is important to take note of because these couples have a pursuer-distancer dynamic. Since I used to be avoidant, I was naturally always the one distancing. This didn’t mean my relationships weren’t better though because anxious men are just as insecure as avoidant men. I was always stressed because I had to constantly prove that I wouldn’t abandon them and that took a lot of emotional labor on my part. 

So, overall, what I’m saying is we need to pay attention to our attachment styles and those of the men we’re dating. Leveling up means working to achieve a more secure attachment style. This is critical if you want to have higher quality relationships because HVMs will most likely be securely attached individuals. 

Luckily, it’s possible to change your attachment style. I did it unintentionally by practicing positive self talk and making sure I didn’t putting myself down in moments of rejection or disappointment. Overtime, my confidence boosted and this helped me become less afraid of being open with people and of rejection entirely. Now that my attachment style is more secure (attachment styles are on a spectrum) it’s easier for me to date at my standards because I’m secure with myself. This means when I meet avoidant or anxious men, I steer clear from them since they are incompatible with my attachment style.",92244,Attachment styles are really important to take note of in yourself and the men you date,0,,,

I recently blocked over 8 male friends. 6 I had no problem blocking because all they wanted was sex. 1 I was close friends with, but he kept treating women like shit. Another was really lonely and I felt bad, but I kept on having to put up with really subtle negs (only realized what they were after). 

My feelings? For 5 of them, total indifference. For 3 of them relief, and for one of those, I even felt so much relief that I felt frustrated with myself that I hadn't done it sooner. 

The one guy I ""blocked"" that I regretted - I kicked him off a group chat for being inactive, and he messaged me saying he was active but on a long vacation. He understood it was normal clean up and was glad to be added back. So - if you make a mistake but you had good reason, reasonable people will understand your decision anyway. 

So, here are some questions:

1) Why have you recently blocked someone?

2) How did you feel when you've blocked people before?

3) Have you ever regretted blocking someone?

Personally, I had a hard time starting the process of blocking people. But once you pull the trigger it's pretty easy.

I'm queer/bisexual. For many years I dated women exclusively although for about the past 6 or so it's been just men. I saw the was a lesbian dating strategy sub but there isn't any info there really. How does FDS apply to women dating women?

I see the wariness about men who watch porn. And I get it. But what is the view on women who masturbate? Read erotica/romance? Surely that's not the same thing at all?

I'm staunchly childfree and 40. And I think I will get my tubes tied in the next year. So when would one bring this up according to FDS? And even the subject of kids? I don't want to date anyone with kids either.

My lovely nex gave me herpes. When would be the time to disclose this according to FDS?

I'm focusing squarely on myself for the foreseeable future bc I'm getting over a brutal discard after a 4 year relationship. So I'm focusing on leveling up. But I am really into the idea of FDS and for me it seems like the logical way forward. So I am curious on these points.

Maybe this can spark discussion and cultivate positive energy/ help us all get a gust of hope going. I have been reading FDS for about a year now while navigating through a less than savory relationship. Along the way I have become a shell of myself doing all the text book suffering and trying and so on.
Recently I was able to get out of my situation for a minute due to work and got a little clarity. I was successful on a work trip like I haven’t been in a while and got the courage to lean in to my fears and lean out of my relationship. Im going to relocate myself, become a land lady and  buy a new home where I want to go. I spoke it out loud last week and sent a request to transfer today. I got tenants the day I started looking for them and found a private property in the sticks I can heal and grow in. Now I’m waiting my bosses reply, therapy says to seek the “ what if it goes exactly how you want” mindset so that’s what I’m doing. A yes means a new life and a no just means a different strategy.

His abuse and discard schtick doesn't work on her because she has high standards and won't put up with it. She leaves him at the first sign of disrespect, cuts of all contact and never speaks to him again despite ever manipulative tactic he pulls. It completely destroys him inside because he knows she was a good woman and it sinks in that he lost her forever and it's all his fault. He is kicking himself, crying, a total mess. It takes losing this wonderful woman for him to finally see the light. Then suddenly, the LVM has a metamorphosis. He cleans up his act, works on himself and his goals, excels in his career, goes to therapy, gets fit, cuts out bad habits, etc. It takes years. He seems like a changed man after. Then he meets a great HV lady who is attracted to all these good qualities he now has. 

My question is, should the woman give a chance to a recovered LVM? Should she judge him based on his past of being a disgusting scrote who used women or judge him for who he is in the present? Do these types of guys really change? Or is that LVM mindset still dormant within him and will return if the circumstances are just right?

I know becoming FDS is a really big change for a former pickme so it must be even harder for an LVM to become an HVM. I've met guys who seem to have really turned it around but having a past of disrespecting and using women like objects just isn't something I can easily overlook. I would be worried about residual LVM tendencies. Thoughts??",92218,"Do you think LVM/NVM can really change and become HVM some day? If so, should we give these men a chance?",0,,,

Not sure if this has been posted here before. I feel like it would have been but I couldn't find it. Nevertheless I am speechless. I've seen this reposted many times over Instagram and Twitter and without fail every male in the comments section has been defending it the scrote's behaviour. They all have the same points:

* ""It's HIS money - he doesn't have to spend it on anyone else!"" But he had no problems living off his fiance's money for 4 years... 
* ""All women care about is health - gold diggers!!!11"" Where in that post was she asking him for yachts and Birkin handbags? Not that there's anything wrong with that but all she wanted was for him to contribute to the finances and his own fucking dog's surgery so she wouldn't be miserable working multiple part time jobs.
* ""Well she didn't cOmMuNiCaTe for him to contribute."" I'm not even going to bother refuting this one. If males are so stupid that they need a woman to communicate to them that they shouldn't be unemployed bums then they shouldn't be allowed to be in positions of power. The LoGiCaL GeNdEr my ass. 

Imagine having over 200 million and watching as your fiance suffers physically and mentally and not doing anything about it. If I had that much money I'd be paying all my friends' and loved ones' rent and making their lives as easy as possible. If I had that much money I wouldn't even think twice about paying for a fiance's dog's surgery. 

Like are males even capable of love or empathy? Shit like this makes me doubt they even are. The fact she had to work 2 jobs so they could afford food, rent, utilities etc while he sat on his ass all day not working, not doing anything about it, and then had the audacity to ask for a prenup disgusts me. And of course all the males are saying ""you hoes are all gold diggers"" - and the scrote isn't a gold digger for scrounging off her for 4 years?",93345,Scrote makes his fiance work 2 jobs and sell her dead mother's violin so she could pay for his dog's surgery while he's unemployed the entire time.

I can finally see that he totally love bombed me in the beginning and all the rules and boundaries I had for myself got busted because he seemed perfect and I was in a vulnerable position. But now, frustrated as all hell about him not delivering on what he presented at the start, not really showing interest in me, and not putting in more effort than the bare minimum once I agreed to exclusivity, I realize he’s self-absorbed, possibly narcissistic, and lacks empathy in notable and intolerable ways. 

Ex: I told him I felt really nervous and unsafe when he would text and drive or drive without his hands on the steering wheel. His response was, “but I’m a good driver” and “I’ll try to compromise with you if you try to trust me”. I asked him if he would still drive like that with a baby in the car and he said yes. Note: he’s been wanting me to marry him since very early on and he’s really upfront about wanting kids with me - this did not convince me at all that he should be the father of my children. How does he think I would ever want to have kids with someone who doesn’t care if their own partner feels safe in the car?

Anyway - Dude, no. No way in hell will I learn to TRUST someone to drive without their hands or attention on the road. That was the moment that I was like “holy crap, his empathy is messed up and his priorities are all wrong”. He did scale the handless driving back after I told him I felt that he didn’t respect my feelings at all, but I don’t appreciate being made the hysterical one when I make a reasonable request that requires NO sacrifice on his part. Oh, and when it rains, he rarely turns on the wipers. I asked him to turn them on and he said “I can see fine” and still doesn’t use wipers with me in the car. Ladies, this wasn’t a sprinkle. It was moderate rain. This was no overreaction on my part.

When my birthday came a couple weeks ago, he told me the day before that we could plan to celebrate for the weekend since he couldn’t get time off after going away with me for a small trip. I was like “okay, makes sense” though just hours before I was fuming because he hadn’t made plans or told me about any plans for the day OF my birthday. 
The next day, I got surprise flowers!....from my best girlfriend! And a lovely happy birthday video from another girlfriend.
From him? Nothing on my birthday or beforehand. I think it was the next day that he told me he ordered my gift the day before my birthday and didn’t realize it would be late because he’s “used to amazon shipping times and this other company takes longer” — sure, if he hadn’t ordered stuff off of different websites in the previous week, I’d be more inclined to believe it. I think he only really got me a gift because it’s expected - he’s never given me a gift or flowers before, so it makes sense to me that his frugal ass didn’t really want to despite how he impulsively orders a lot of food when we go to restaurants and doesn’t bat at eye at paying for that. Food is okay, but gifts, flowers, anything to show your girlfriend that you value her? Nah.

Anyway, I told him I was going to the city to get myself a birthday dinner and he said he would go with me. But when we were together, he didn’t do or say anything to make it feel like a birthday, like I was special. It felt like he was doing it because he knows he’s supposed to even though I didn’t even hint about that. It wasn’t the worst time, but it was a letdown.

The weekend came and we went out to dinner, and the same thing happened. I was car watching and wondered aloud if I would ever be able to afford one of the nice cars we saw driving by. He said to me “let’s live a poor life and give our kids the expensive cars” and I told him, “no thanks, buddy, I didn’t take out all this student debt so I could live poor”.

The thing that probably wears me down most is this is also a guy who will text paragraphs about himself without acknowledging what I’ve said or even asking how I am or how my day is going (ladies, I’ve tried the information-volunteering thing and he ignored what I said until I got upset and told him he was only talking about himself again). He knows I prefer calls over text, but if I give him even a few texts with real content in a day, he might not call, so the relationship often feels empty and lonely. Because I almost left him previously about how he never asks about my day or shows interest in me, he’s been asking about my day over the phone. In the moment, I’m like “this is nice, he does care, his voice is warm and affectionate, yeah, this could work” but after a few hours pass and the loneliness returns, I reflect back on how it didn’t feel organic and go, “Yeah, he’s only doing it because he’s supposed to and he’s really just interested in the interest that I give HIM”.

Yes, yes, I can hear you queens saying “dump his ass, dump his ass,” and I’ve tried, but you know how they are — they turn up the effort when they feel you distancing or they have an entirely believable excuse like “I was eating this way because we’ve been in the honeymoon phase - this isn’t indicative of how I normally eat” (don’t worry, I learned my lesson). This morning he told me that he was considering his diet and lack of exercise and decided he’s going to learn how to cook and get a gym membership (after me expressing concern for months and months and him eating sugar and processed food around the clock) and I got so hopeful and happy and thought it was salvageable....then the loneliness came back after I didn’t really hear from him most of the day and what I did hear was centered on him. And something in me said, “He said it because you withdrew for a few days and he wanted to make you not want to leave”. I know some of you MUST be able to relate to how they say exactly the thing that convinces you/manipulates you into believing that they’re tolerable enough. I worry that if I do a face-to-face breakup, he’ll give me that stupid affectionate mesmerizing look with that warm tone of voice that convinces me that he cares because he’s not a terrible guy, but I think he’s terrible for me.

How should I break it off and what should I say? He does have a $200 wool blanket that I definitely want back, and I’d like my apartment key, but he lives 2 hours away. Getting those things would require face to face interaction and I don’t want to be sucked in again, which I suspect would happen if I see him in person. He’s never been violent or verbally abusive, mostly just emotionally neglectful, so it’s easy to not go, “He’s not a bad guy, he’s alright, give him a chance,” while my insides also feel like they’re being clawed at.

Note a lesson I learned: This guy has just about always done the initiating contact and plans thing, picking up the bill, etc. I thought I was golden to agree to exclusivity, but I let it happen way, way, way too soon. Never again will I let myself develop feelings for a guy or become exclusive with him until he’s proven that he will be consistent in his efforts and level of respect towards me.",93322,Need advice on breaking up...and a hug,0,,,

I’m in the process of leveling up which means identifying problematic behavior in myself and working it out. I would love your input on this: so my friend and I were talking about some guys we know. We have a big circle but she brings up these two boys that 1, I have had the BIGGEST crush on for two years and just ended, and the second one I find cute/attractive (no to little interaction though). She doesn’t know how I feel about either of them because she can gossip sometimes and I choose not to share too much. I know we’re friends so we could have similar taste but I felt bothered by it. She talked about how the male version of her is the first guy but bc of some issues they wouldn’t be great together. Then She said she flirted with the second one too, and I felt a bit down because I haven’t been going out due to covid and she’s gotten to see both of them because they all hang out in groups. I’m honestly not super bothered, but it bugged me and I’m trying to understand why. It’s not like she knew how I felt, neither of the guys were people I had anything serious with, but maybe I feel like I’m missing out on them? I guess I wish guys would be pursuing me/flirting with me and maybe I’m projecting my fantasy of these guys as perfect and missing out on them.

It made sense we were friends since I was the weird religious girl who wore conservative, ugly clothes and had a big mouth and she was fat, which was enough to doom her to being a pariah; we had similar traumas too, my father died earlier that year in the sixth grade and hers was an alcoholic.  But we were pariahs together, we bonded over our outcast status--the girls who sneered at her weight and my nunish outfits and the boys who laughed at us whenever it became obvious one of us had a crush.  The words cut deep, more than a decade later I still remember them--a girl's shrieking laughter when she saw me talking to one of the handsome boys in class; another girl asking me if I thought I could make it AP literature.   But every time I was attacked, I'd steel myself, don an arrogant expression and say something cutting and venomous right back.  I remember sitting down in the school auditorium and the five boys next to me got up and walked away.  I never cried in public; I was just driven to work harder, more intensely, dream bigger. 

 I would bleed--every wound bleeds--but I would stitch my wounds closed with the promise that one day I would be better than all of them---I would be prettier, smarter, more successful, and one day I would be loved and cherished by someone.  My Mom didn't let us have TV so my sisters and I spent most of our free time reading, and in my books I found joy, companionship, and solace.  Yes, I suffered, but so did all of the characters I had ever read about before they accomplished their goals.  Yes, school was rough, lonely, humiliating and wounding but so it was for anyone who had attempted a quest.  Yes, I was at the bottom right now---I had ugly clothes, ugly shoes, and I had no money for makeup, and nothing I owned could be called 'nice.'  I didn't even have money for lunch sometimes.  But every character from Harry Potter to Jesus to  started from the bottom, and that knowledge consoled me.  

I was both jealous of and resentful of other girls who had beautiful, modern clothes and not shapeless dresses, girls who looked put-together, attractive, someone who would go to an Ivy--and I was the picture of a poor, backwards, shabby immigrant girl who needed a handout.  I died a little, each time I caught sight of my reflection, especially when a classmate was next to me.  But my focus was incredible.  I was in the advanced classes and my best friend was in the lower-classes, so I only saw her at lunch and after school; I did not have video games, TV, or a phone, and I used a computer only sparingly.  I got good grades--one semester I got a 3.9.  I kept taking difficult classes, kept reading, kept getting mentored by teachers.  These things sustained me.  I would pray a lot.  Please God, make me beautiful one day, please God make me successful when I grow up, please God let me be loved by someone one day.  

Something I've realized is that you are the content that you consume.  I have Netflix and I watch TV now but I'm grateful that I didn't have it growing up.  The books I read, to this day, have given me some incredibly high standards.  I was very much a romantic and an idealist--I still am to a great extent, although it's tempered by time and experience.   Snape sacrificed his life for the *memory* of Lily, Heathcliff loved Catherine so much he was still driven by vengeance twenty years later, Syndey Carton died for his Lucie's husband---because he wanted her to be happy.  I wanted to be loved and cherished and pursued just as much as the characters I read about.  I wanted to have adventures like Frodo, like Susan in Narnia, and Hermione in HP.  I wanted to be as wise as Gandalf, or Dumbledore, or Morgan Le Fey.  Aching is the word I would use to describe my adolescence.  

I had a feeling deep in my bones that I would have a great future one day, I just needed to work for it.  And my best friend, we'll call her Bri, who I did everything with, confided everything to, lived very much in the present.  Even back then, I knew there were some crucial differences between us.  Bri didn't care very much about her future career, or her grades for that matter.  She cared about having a boyfriend immediately, and couldn't stand to be without one for more than a few weeks.  

Life for Bri was about maximizing the amount of time she could spend with other people.  Like myself, Bri also ached to be loved, but Bri had never read Wuthering Heights or Harry Potter or A Tale of Two Cities--she didn't read much at all actually.  Her boyfriend wanted to keep dating her while dating another guy?  Sure, I still love you, I'm a supportive girlfriend!  Her next boyfriend always hitting her up for money?  Of course, I'll help you!  I would argue with her, yell sometimes, try to persuade her---it didn't matter.  Time passed, and the humiliating purgatory known as high school ended.  After four years of grinding, saying 'no' to myself, and studying, the hard work paid off--I got a full ride to a private college.  It was what I had always wanted, and I even got to live in the dorms for free.  Bri went to go work at Petsmart.  

College was a dream--not having a curfew, going to my first dance, my first concert, having a real friend group to hang out with.  Wearing modern, cool clothes for the first time, doing my hair and makeup for the first time.  It was everything I wanted and more.  Nothing however could've prepared me for how quickly Bri changed after I left though.  After graduation most of her friend group had split--some to different states, some to trade school; most couldn't be bothered to keep up old ties.  And Bri, who could not stand to be alone turned to men--any man.  

As a morbidly obese 18-year old she gratefully accepted any man that wanted to fuck her in his car, aganist a tree, on a hot stove, as long as he would keep her company.  I told her to do something; go to beauty school, learn a trade, join the military, something.  Bri however, chose to wisely invest her money in fast food and anime merchandise.  More time passed, I graduated from college, traveled to Asia and Europe by myself, dated here and there, worked as a teacher and social worker and I am now starting med school this Tuesday.  In that same time Bri is still morbidly obese, still lives with her parents, did not get her drivers license, did not not get any kind of training or schooling, still works at Petsmart, and oh, knowingly slept with a rapist because ""she was lonely"" and cheated on a great guy who helped her out financially, and took her on trips.  She is now trying to get on disability because 'cashiering is too hard.'  We are now both 26.

We are not our inner desires and dreams--in that case everyone would be a millionaire and beautiful.  We are what we do and time makes us more of who we already are so be careful and be aware of what the things you do, the things you don't do, and the things you allow.  Because at a certain point it's not a phase, it's simply the adult you've become.",93126,The Sad Tale of The Girl With No Will-Power: A Warning For Younger Girls And Women,0,,,

I’ve been single since June. I used to date broke LVM and would always pay for dates, look past huge flaws “because he’s so sweet to me”, and had low expectations. 


A change has happened since this sub. I’ve realized I’m honestly a great catch. I’m in my early 20’s with a fantastic career, great pay. I pay all my own bills, drive a nice car, have a pet I love very much, and consider myself fairly intelligent with a sense of humor. I put a ton of effort into my appearance and will be hitting the gym again once they open with COVID restrictions. 


A guy who works in my facility on a different floor found me on Instagram a few nights ago and messaged me saying he thought I was pretty and asked me on a date. I noticed a few red flags: He’s newly separated from his wife just a few months ago and has a child, but ignored them because I’ve met him at work and he seems to have his shit together and is also in the same great career, so I said yes to a date. 



He’s been a bit overly flirtatious and I steered the conversation away from his advances. A few hours ago he messaged me and made a comment insinuating he “can’t wait to crawl in my bed later”. We haven’t even went on a date yet, mind you. Have only been chatting for three days, don’t even know the location of the first date yet. 


I messaged back “I’m sorry, you have the wrong impression. I don’t do casual hookups at all. Best of luck to you!” and BLOCKED HIM for wasting my time. 


I’ve never done this before. I previously would have went along with it in hopes of more dates and finding a companion, but now I know that would just be a waste of my time. 



I know what I’m looking for. I eventually want a HVM who wants to be a husband. Someone who is willing to work for it and take me on dates and put in some effort. Not a man who assumes he’s automatically going to crawl in my bed the first chance he gets.

After a dinner where he paid and two ""hangouts,"" I've decided that I really enjoy spending time with this guy. He's appropriately aged (21 to my 20), going to school, hard-working, wants to move away from where we currently live, polite &amp; respectful. 

He thinks I'm attractive and compliments me frequently in a very respectful way, he tells me all the time that I fascinate him and he finds so many things about me interesting/appealing. 

One of these things that he finds interesting about me is that fact that I don't drink. When we spend time together, he usually is drinking a beer, but I really don't mind because he doesn't try to get me to drink/pressure me in any way. Last night, we were laying on this rooftop listening to music and just talking while looking up at the stars, and he told me he looked up a non-alcoholic beer so that I could try something he likes, while still respecting my choice not to drink. He sent me a picture today and he drove all over the city we live in to find me non-alcoholic beer for when we hangout tomorrow night. 

For some reason, I just thought it was so sweet of him. He thought about me, wanting to have an experience to share with me, and went out of his way to make that experience a reality. 

The thing that gets to me as a former Pickmeisha™ is that we haven't kissed. We haven't even hugged or held hands. I haven't made him food or written a paper for him, all I've done is show up and spend time with him, and he just likes me for me. He does nice things for me because he likes me.

So, FDS, I am wondering would that be considered codependency, feeling bad when a person has hurt you (emotionally or physically) and apologizing for it? If not, what would this be called (if it has a word for it)?

I would like to add that the mother (who was telling the story) let us know the brother was also talked to about how he talks to his sister and what he said was NOT OKAY!

And yet, thus far, I’ve exercised, showered and washed my hair, put in a leave-in treatment, filed and shaped my nails, cleaned my shoes inside and out, made a booking to see my brow lady, mended a few garments, logged my calories and macros, worn sunscreen when outside, and right now I’m putting on a rosehip oil serum. That's pretty standard for me every day.

All that, to not see anyone all day. How do I look? Honestly, great. Without a shred of makeup, as well. It’s no accident or mystery: years of good skincare, evidence-based healthy behaviours like eating well and keeping my weight down, researching and refining my style and makeup choices, and investing in good orthodontics and dermatology mean I look nice all the time. I don’t engage in half of the beauty habits or routines that many other women do (though all the power to them), but I know that tinted sunscreen, a small amount of mascara and brow gel, and a touch of colour on my cheeks and lips can take me a very long way. 

Mad props to all the women out there who do everything they can to look great - and to the ones who reject the premise of beauty being the sole defining factor of our humanity and value who don’t engage in beauty. Regardless of your decision, I know you’re all out there showing care for yourself and others, and making your communities powerful and excellent places to be.  

I’ve been lucky to mainly work around HVM who are great dressers with good hygiene. Not all of them hit the genetic lottery - heck, I haven’t with many things - but they always command respect because they put the effort in and look great.  But what I notice and respect most about these men is that commentary about women's appearance doesn't enter the workplace. My boss, who excitedly shows me the shelving unit he designed and built for his wife's shoe collection, sings her praises at every opportunity, regardless of whether she's done up to the nines or recovering in her sweatpants from repeated bouts of surgery for ulcerative colitis. Every day he looks great: nicely polished and matching shoes and belt, well-ironed and flattering clothing, and meticulously groomed hair - and he values effort in all aspects of our work.

When I think to the greatest disrespect to my appearance throughout my life, it’s never come from men who put effort into their appearance. My ex-spouse, who has never owned an intact pair of underpants in his life, was always quick to point out how “artificial” my makeup looked, and how he preferred “natural” women. (Obviously, the women in the porn he watched were “natural”). Notwithstanding the cruelty of comments to a young woman who he knew didn’t have parents or the social support to learn to wear makeup well, it made me realise that the “I prefer women who don’t wear makeup” is perhaps a bigger tip-off of low effort and reciprocity than we might appreciate at the start. I’d argue it extends to other things you see weak boys complain about: “no instagram thots plz”, or “no fake plastic botox hoes” - both are signifiers of significant effort and awareness of appearance and reception, and this goes hand in hand with this advice.

It goes without saying that these dudes are obviously not looking for someone who puts NO effort into their appearance (or even someone who matches their energy when it comes to grooming). Demographically, the number of women with poor hygiene and grooming practices is going to be smaller than men’s due to socialisation, advertising, and a greater capacity to be mindful of the needs, desire and comfort of others. But even with these things in mind, I think if you’d ask the average LVM if he would actually be attracted to a woman who matches his effort that you’d already guess his response. Someone who isn’t shaving at all, only sporadically wears antiperspirant or deodorant, and with the kind of poor hygiene that typifies 40% of sad r/relationship_advice posts is probably going to be off-putting to just about anyone. So already, the “low maintenance” is a cypher: by that, the LVM means someone like me who generally doesn’t wear a lot of visible pigmented makeup with a natural hair colour. He probably couldn’t guess that I’m wearing makeup, by the by: years of the film industry, advertising and pornography has informed him that women are, in fact, born with eyeliner naturally on and eyelashes that can filter particulate in a shop vac. 

*Yes, yes*, you’re saying: *we know that this mainly means he wants someone who is naturally perfect because it’s ego validating to him that someone truly genetically gifted would want him*. And yes, all that is true. But there’s another dimension to it too: he doesn’t want to expend effort, and visible makeup and expensive clothing is a signifier of the effort he knows he’s unable to perform. 

Someone posted a comment the other day that I struggled in vain to link here because it’s bang on about my point (and if it was you, apologies). The main thrust is that romantic ideals and fantasies for LVM involve the premise of unquestioning acceptance of him regardless of his station in life and performance. That he will always be loved, venerated, respected as authority and accepted without question or complaint, no matter how unsuccessful, unambitious or underperforming, and that it takes maturity and resilience to acknowledge that desirable men contribute to their communities and families as best they can, and appreciate that demonstrating effort is critical to maintaining relationships. 

This is where the “no makeup woman” comes in: he fallaciously believes that the unpolished yet flawless woman will accept a similar degree of effort from him. He’ll never worry about disappointing her because he’s established the bar is painfully low: if the advertising is a Tinder profile talking about tacos, Netflix and travel, he expects that she knows what she’s getting into. 

Obviously, the reality is that LVM for the most part are not snagging Karlie Kloss sans fards. They get the low-maintenance woman that their bait attracts. Is he happy with that real low-maintenance woman? Hahaha. You already know the answer to that. He’s miserable, but he’s getting sex, ego validation, and someone to help him with his savings by splitting living allowances. He thinks he can do better, but the expectation is not matching reality.  

It also doesn’t help that she serves as a constant reminder: this is all you can get. This is all that is attracted enough to you. It’s why he feels entitled to degrading women and pornography - when realistically, he should be degrading and loathing himself in the hope that perhaps it might be the catalyst for self-improvement. 

When I head into work tomorrow, I’m wearing a beautiful silk scarf I bought in Chicago all those years ago and bright red lipstick. It will look perfect against my lovely skin. I’ll pull out my $2,000 handbag with inconspicuous branding that’s lasted me 5 years thus far due to meticulous care - and will likely last me another 10-15 year - and my mother’s Paspaley pearl bracelet. It’s a sign that I look good and I know it - and a warning to keep dusty dudes at bay. 

I hope you all dress tomorrow with that one little thing that keeps you feeling as powerful and precious as you are. Whether it’s Redwing boots or Ferragamo, I know you’ll kick ass.",92207,He doesn’t necessarily prefer that you “don’t wear makeup”: he’d just hate that you might expect anything from him.,0,,,

She married very young the first time and her ex had an emotional affair and she left him immediately. After that she had two LTRs and the second one nearly destroyed her (recovering heroin addict that decided to use on Christmas day and she had to resuscitate him). After that she went on a healing journey and found the book The Rules. She applied them and met her now husband. The man she just married appears to be high value. I am very happy for her and glad I got to attend this beautiful wedding. I broke off an engagement nearly two years ago now and I was worried attending a wedding would be hard for me. I'm glad to say I was happy to be there for them and to see family and celebrate the couple.

The thing that got me thinking was when they cut the cake. When I was planning the wedding with my ex and we talked about the cake I told him I didn't want to do the thing where you smash cake in each other's faces. I explained that I would be wearing my wedding dress, have my hair and makeup professionally done and wouldn't want to mess it up. He refused. He said but it's fun and why do you have to be so uptight and complained about missing the tradition. I was firm and he finally relented, but I didn't believe him. I just knew if I had gone through with that wedding (thank God I didn't) he would've disrespected my wishes and smashed the cake in my face. 

My cousin looked absolutely beautiful Sunday. Her husband and she gently fed each other a bite of cake smiling at each other lovingly and having their pictures taken. He knew what she put into looking good that day and did not smash cake in her face. They are a fun loving couple and I have seen them be silly together. But he understood the importance and formality of the day and respected her wish to not smash the cake. 

I want to find a husband that I will be able to trust enough to gently feed me the cake.",92179,Thoughts at my cousin's wedding,0,,,

I've been freaking out because I really don't know what to do or how to go about this.

\- Some background info first - ☕

We met 5yrs ago on a job, he was 19 and I was 23 and I think at one point I even had to train him. We hit it off pretty quickly despite the age difference because back then we were both heavy marijuana smokers &amp; into the same things. I saw him as a little brother and he looked at me like some kind of mentor. We had a mutual friend and together we were like the 3 musketeers for quite some time but then we both fell out with this 3rd person because he started to become quite toxic. So then it was just the 2 of us. 

He was there during some pretty major life events including some very traumatic incidents. He watched me going through abuse in a toxic relationship, move abroad and moving back, getting myself committed in a mental hospital etc. He stood by me through it all and never asked for the same level of emotional investment he was giving me. He knows pretty much everything there is to know about me, he even knows all about FDS and FDS logic at this point, he also agrees with all of it and even helped me vetting potential boyfriends. Our lives became very intertwined as I befriended most -if not all- of his close friends and he befriended most of mine, as well as my sister. My parents know him pretty well and we even celebrated christmas together one year. However we both seriously dated other people during the life span of our friendship.

I never considered him romantically or sexually because of the age difference but recently I found out that literally EVERYONE around us is hoping for us to get together at one point (&amp; pretty sure it is going to happen as well). We're 24 and 28 now so the age difference is less creepy than when we met and I'm not out-earning him anymore. I engage in psilocybin therapy on a monthly basis and one of recurring insights that come up during those trips since January is that I should be with him. I still don't really have romantic or sexual feelings for him but I can't see myself being with someone who doesn't value me as high as he does. 

Without discussing it with each other, we simultaneously developed a huge interest in spirituality. Since we found out this is -again- a shared interest we've been so invested in helping each other grow spiritually, meditating together etc. But since then, we're getting more and more signs that maybe we should consider becoming more than platonic friends (seeing the same number sequences, going to different tarot readers \*seperately\* and both getting a reading where the other person was pretty much described as our twin flame etc and while some of this may be too esotheric for some of you, we care about these things).

So last weekend we were a little bit drunk and I told him all these signs had me confused and that I didn't see him as a purely platonic friend anymore but not really as a potential partner either. Anyways  he was super happy to hear he wasn't 100% in the friendzone anymore and we kissed and he told me he loved me. A day later, when we were sober, we had sex. I'm still thinking I'm not physically attracted to him but at the same time I was able to get wet &amp; climax which are both things I haven't been able to do (sober) since I was raped in 2011. I was extremely comfortable being naked and sharing intimacy with him but still struggle to view him as sexually attractive so I'm definitely suffering some cognitive dissonance over here. I told him I don't want to claim him nor do I want to be claimed and I still have a hard time adjusting to the new situation. He understands and said he doesn't expect anything from me.

His birthday is coming up this Friday and I'm just struggling with myself. We're going to a fancy dinner and the next day we're doing psilocybin therapy together. I put together a super thoughtful gift but now I'm sitting here like 'is it TOO thoughtful?'. I always splurge on gifts for my friends but never on gifts for boyfriends or people I'm dating. It just feels weird to suddenly be less open or holding back on nice gestures now that we hooked up.

I know he is HV, he's proven that time and time again so I don't need to vet or anything. He never let me pay for anything (he treats his male friend the same), never expected me to be his parttime mom or therapist, has never been disrespectful and treats all the women in his life really well.

Yet, this whole situation is just extremely confusing and I don't know how to proceed. I feel like the FDS handbook is failing me on this one lol and I just have so many doubts and questions. Like sometimes I even ask myself if I have been grooming this guy?!

What do y'all think reading this? How would you guys proceed? Has any of you ever been in the same situation?

These things are on my mind and they're bothering me and i need to get them off my chest and share them with someone. 

I broke up with my boyfriend months ago but haven't been dating because of Corona and working out my emotions. I was with my ex for a very long time and this is my first time dating as an adult (29F). There are some total fuck-ups on my part that i'm going to list, but i'll add what i learned from it. In the situationship that just ended and only lasted 2 weeks, I learned a lot about my boundaries, what i want in a man and what i will not tolerate next time. Maybe they'll benefit another woman out there so we can stray as far as possible from ever being a Pickmeisha. 

I wasn't looking, he found me. He lives next door to me with his parents. His family left Cuba when he was child and moved to Florida and then here, so I overlooked the living-with-parents thing. Since he lived so close, he'd know when i'm at home and it'd be so easy for him to come over and end up spending the night, then all his stuff is right next door to get ready and leave in the morning. - I will never mess with someone that lives next door to me/works in my company/can't be sent away when i'm done. Now i'm gonna see this idiot at my house/safe place. I will never overlook a guy living with his parents, no matter the circumstances. They have a whole different mentality and i require more. 

The first night he came over, we kissed a minute and he touched me and then was like ""Get on top"" over and over. I did because i was excited to have sex after so long and he's attractive but i wasn't warmed up or really ready. Yet i spit on his dick and sucked it for a minute to get it wet. Ugh. - I will never take things fast like that again. No sex/my house the first time we hang out, and no one will ever skip foreplay again. I'll put my foot down and set i'm not ready yet. I will also never undress myself. Im the present, you undress me. 

We were supposed to go to his friends house one night and drink, but he ended up getting drunk early and lost his phone. I sat around at my house on a Friday night wondering what the hell is going on. The next day he made it up to me by going to get ice cream. - I will never be stood up again. First time it happens, they'll never hear from me again. I looked past it for fucking ice cream? Am i that damn desperate?

I told him the reasons why it didn't work out with my ex, how i wanted to move on and where my feelings stood on it. At the time it felt nice because he was giving me good advice on how to manage it and move on. - I will never share personal details about my feelings or life until i've completely vetted someone and trust them. Now he knows more about me than i'd like for him to. 

He told me about his goal of working in real estate and getting a bunch of money so he can retire by 40 and whoever is with him will get to live a great life. He borrowed $20 from me one day for gas money. ,e went out for drinks one night with his friends and i paid for my own drinks, wtf. - I will never lend money to any man again. This idiot revealed to me that he lives check-to-check. Whoever is with him will get to live a great life? Hmm, okay. 

I have a good job that is stressful, i'm in school working towards my Bachelors and i own my own home. - I will never be with someone that doesn't meet my standards. Even i know that i want and could do better for myself so i better be with someone who is doing the same or preferably...a whole hell of a lot better than me. 

He always said the ""school isn't for me, it's a scam"" bullshit. Fine, it's not for you but i'm in school so don't ever try to take away my motivation. This is a hard no for me. Don't support me going to school and I will nope you all the way to Nopesville. 

He also wasn't supportive of my job either. I work from home, enjoy my job and it requires a lot. Fine, come over for lunch but leave at 2 like i said. One day i finished work early and he came over 30 min before i was going to clock out. We started messing around on the couch and he was licking my pussy. It was time for me to clock out real quick so i said id clock out and be right back. He said ""really? you just ruined the moment."" I said ""you want me to lose my job? it's not like im even close to cumming anyways."" i clocked out and came back to him on the couch with his fucking pants down asking me to suck it real quick, itll only take 2 min and he just spent time on me. I told him no, i will not be guilt tripped or pressured into it. I said i needed to leave right after work today and i'm going to. He pulled his pants up and got super apologetic and said he would focus on my needs more. He ate me out the next 2 times and it was nothing exciting. - No one will ever come in the way of my job or disrespect. SO MANY of these moments should have been the last time. I should have put my foot down and fucking said no. 

Guys i'm embarassed to say this one but its anonymous right? Sheesh. We had sex without a condom, which i will never fucking do again. My pussy started to itch really bad and had a fishy smell that was so strong. My discharge got white and chunky. I immediately went to the gyno and guess what...bacterial vaginosis. This guy gave me a fucking bacteria in my vagina. omg, wtf? - Ill never have sex without a condom. If i get something, why the hell did i continue to sleep with him? While i was shooting medicine up in my pussy for 5 nights straight? So embarassing and will never happen again. what. the. hell. 

Argument 1: He stayed over and slept until 12:30 IN THE AFTERNOON. I get up at 8:30 on weekends and get my day started. I clean the house, pay bills and work through my to-do list. I have a life, goals and things to do. I woke him up at 12:30 and asked if he was ever gonna get up. He said it's early and normally he sleeps in until 2. I was so unimpressed it turned into me asking if he has any goals or a routine. I called him immature, irresponsible and lazy. I said ""I guess that's how it is when you live with your parents."" The next day he told me he almost dropped me for it. Something he loved about me was that i'm mature, calm and independent. Yeah ok, until it comes down to being with a woman like that and meeting her standards. - When he said he almost dropped me, i stopped speaking to him for 3 days. Drop me? Bitch, i'll drop you. - I'll never be with someone that weak. Sleeping in all day? Watching TV while the sun is out? LAZY AS FUCK. I will never be quiet in my own home so some idiot can sleep in my bed. 

Hes inconsistent with his decisions, buying a car then trading it for another and then trading it for a bike. I told him that i think ""Grown man shit"" is sexy - buy a nice reliable car and keep it for 3 years and focus on saving money and paying off debt. He went out and got the bike and it turned me off so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since he was spending the night, he needs to brush his teeth. He'd tell my dog all the time that his breath is kicking but this guys was so much worse. Y'all....I tried convincing this child on several times to brush his teeth. I was like ""i have a free toothbrush that the dentist gives out, you can use it...do you need that toothbrush? i have an extra"" so many times. He always said he would and then passed out with his nasty breath. Why am i parenting a grown man?? Like c'mon kiddies, time to wash your hands and brush your teeth so we can go to bed. 

I made food for myself and he happened to come over after. I still had leftovers and food sitting out in the kitchen. He was in the living room and said he was hungry, i offered him some of the food. I did not make the food for him. He kept saying ""just make me a plate."" I was like ""Idk how much you want, just come make it."" Hes like ""however much you think, it'll be fine"" and insisted. Guys, i made him the fucking plate and it pisses me off. I did it on two occasions. I made the whole meal and you cant even make a fucking plate?? Fuck off. You shouldn't be eating my damn food anyways. 

We had sex one night on the couch and after he said to bring him some paper towels. I got up and went to the bathroom to clean myself off. I came back without paper towels and told him they're in the bathroom or kitchen. He kept saying he needs some and i said to go get one. Hes all ""really? really?"" Umm, yes really. After i told him if theres a next time, he can clean me up. Im the prize and i will be treated as such. Changed my mind on having sex again, it was the last time. He said he had a headache and slept on the couch. I went to bed and masturbated. Nope, never again. 

That night, he slept on the couch with his headache. I got up around 3:30 and like an idiot went in there and asked if he wanted to come to bed. He said my bed hurts his back and told me to sleep on the couch with him. I was like no, i have a bed and im gonna sleep there. This dumbass wanted me to sleep on the couch in my own fucking house FOR HIM. Id be tired and cranky the next day so my head could lay next to this guy and his back wont hurt? Fuck that, i went to bed. I would have sent him home next door but he didnt have his key with him. 

""Will you do me a favor?"" NOPE. NOPENOPENOPENOPE. The last time we spoke he asked if i had any gas to start his motorcycle and i let him use it like a dumbass. We hadn't spoken in 2 or 3 days and after using the gas, he said we just dont have a connection. The sex is great but thats all thats there. Funny, cause he always told me how great i make him feel. I told him the sex is questionable since i never had an orgasm. He said his piece and walked right off my porch without letting me respond. I called him a child and walked inside. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, thats my rant of moments that have been bothering me. Several times ive found myself singing that song ""hell naahhhh, hell to the nah nah nah, hell naaaahhh."" Never again. I made some mistakes, but i think sometimes it takes mistakes to figure shit out. I will be a whole new bitch with the next guy.",92164,A rant about some things i've learned while getting back into dating,0,,,

One of them reached out to the group chat and asked if she could stay with any of us because she had a fight with her BF and needed space ASAP. 

A few of us dropped our addresses directly to her, but she came over to my apartment. After some board games and her getting to know us she started explaining what had happen.

Her boyfriend of a few years is a messy depressed alcoholic who doesn’t pay into groceries or contribute to house work. She has spent years in therapy (for other reasons) so she had the language needed to explain the value of emotional labor and how she is doing all the heavy lifting. He does not, even though he is supposed to be finding a therapist ( his insurance covers it)

They had gotten into a fight because she had a bad day and he brought home a bottle of wine to “help her unwind” even though she has asked him multiple times to cut back and she doesn’t really drink.

They start fighting and eventually he does something that triggered her PTSD and based on the text conversation she asked us to read. She: 1) apologized for being triggered in the moment 2) tried to explain what had triggered her and how it made her feel. He then in his own words said “and I explained that you were wrong” WHAT! This is where I flipped out cause I was trying to go in with a benefit of the doubt situation for her sake, but you can’t tell people their PTSD triggers are *wrong* they are the body’s physical response to remembering trauma!!

She then explained that she knew for a fact that he couldn’t afford his own place and that she had already tried to break up with him a few months ago but he “didn’t accept it” my roommate and I were super confused cause that’s now relationships work in our brain.

We talked it out for hours, assured her that her expectations weren’t to high, that what she was asking him for was reasonable and that the way she was being treated wasn’t.

After breakfast she told us that she was going to withdrawal the application she had for a new place with him and get her own place. She updated me and said they are “taking a break” for a year while he works on himself. We will see.",92160,First FDS Encounter,0,,,

I ask because I’m reading Why Men Love Bitches and it talks a lot about strategies to keep the initial spark/chase going - keeping up with your high standards even after you’re now dating. So would seeing them just once a week still be acceptable now that they’re your bf? Is it okay to sometimes have dates that are just dates without sex, or would that put him off? 

I wrote a list of my standards the other night for when I re-enter dating, and my inclination now is to only sleep over at his place after a considerable amount of time (6 months minimum) and to never let him sleep over at my place, or really even come over that often, so I can keep a sacred space for myself. But I’m worried that these things would put a guy off. At the same time though they’re my standards and if the guy doesn’t rise up to them then he’s not the one for me anyways lol.

I struggled to create a comment that would not make her double down and defend her partner's choices.

&amp;#x200B;

*"" How do I talk to my partner (33LLM) about lack of foreplay? We've been together for 8ish months. Sex has been rare lately, and when it does happen its not great. I've (26HLF) been avoiding sex as there is no foreplay, and when sex does happen it is not enjoyable for me. When we first started dating foreplay was basic at best and we had sex often. But majority of the time, I enjoyed it. Over the last 3 months, foreplay doesn't happen. Partner tries to put P in V straight away, often not putting a condom on (even though I'm not on BC and he is aware of that). His reasoning is that it ""feels better without a condom"". Lately, he barely even kisses me before attempting sex. His version of foreplay lately has been to grab my vagina, or a breast, or grind against my butt in bed. Sex has been in the same boring position, which doesn't last long and ends with the comment ""did you come?"" Previously, I have told him that I need foreplay first, his only response is ""I dont know how"". He also has to be drunk to go down on me as he ""doesnt like the taste"". I don't know how to bring up the subject of foreplay without getting the same responses previously given. I have always been the HL person in the relationship, and now I refuse him to the point he gets upset with me. But sex with him has not been enjoyable. I like sex, and this is effecting our relationship in other ways, sometimes I avoid seeing him (we don't live together) just so I don't have to refuse him.

My finger slipped. I never superlike men, this was just an oopsie. We started texting and I figured he seemed nice enough, no reason to block him just yet. Two days after we started texting (last Sunday) he asked about my plans for the day and I told him that I'm taking myself out for lunch and spending it in the company of a good book. He politely asked of he may join. I said sure. We had a lovely lunch, which lasted so much longer than I intended. We were the last people to leave the restaurant that day (While restaurants are open, there is a 10pm curfew in my country). He didn't even offer to pay, he just immediately took care of the bill when it came. 

He asked if he may take me on a proper date on Friday, but he would love to see me in the week as well. So he took me out for sushi on Wednesday. He was so generous. He asked what type of sushi and wine I liked, and then ordered 2 huge platters and several bottles of good wine. I took some leftover wine home, he ordered so much just to make sure that there is enough. The topic of who pays on a date came up and he said that he will never let the woman pay. 

Then Friday night came. Oh gosh, he pulled out all the stops. Took me to the nicest and most expensive place in my city. Formal dress code so he had his suit dry cleaned and bought new cufflinks and cologne for the evening. He bought me a beautiful silver necklace as a gift. Dinner was absolutely fantastic and he took care of selecting the wine after asking about my preferences. When the bill came he immediately took care of it. I saw a glimpse of the bill and was a bit shocked, he paid for one meal what was pretty much my personal food budget for 2 months. 

This guy is pretty average looking and drives a very modest car. However he owns a house in a very expensive suburb and has a high paying job. He lives about an hour away so every time we went out, he made sure that I didn't have to drive for more than 15 minutes. He said that once I am comfortable, he would like to make me a home cooked meal at his place and will have the guest bedroom prepared (he doesn't want me to drive that far alone at night, and public transport or uber is not an option). Until then he will meet up with me at restaurants close to where I live for as long as it takes. I am not used to men spoiling me like this but it is lovely. He said that he would like to be exclusive with me, knows what he wants and will do what it takes to get it. As far as I can tell he is not seeing any other women. 

I am cautiously optimistic, it is of course not possible to know if a man is really high value after only seeing him 3 times but time will tell. I just really wanted to share my experience with the other ladies on here. Don't settle for that selfish man, the are so much more generous men out there. I am curious to see how this one plays out. Our next date will be on Wednesday.",92901,About a month ago I posted about a first date where the guy insisted that I pay for myself.

My mother is quite a pick-me. was a forever gf to my dad for 12 years, proposed to him TWICE and he only gave in after they had me. she told me he never wanted kids or marriage because of the horrible divorce of his parents. then she goes on to tell me she was able to ""change him"" and is very proud of that. i always found that incredibly degrading and told her i would never ever do that which she cant understand at all. she prides herself by breaking her back for me dad and not asking for a lot of money while doing so. when it comes to his hobbies, she is all in for it, but doesnt get a lot of it back. my dad is not very hv himself, but he was a good father to me which i guess i have to take into account here. she also projects all of her trauma onto me. some examples : ""did your bf allow you to cut your hair short?? what if he is sad about that?""  ""if you dont kiss your bf good bye he will leave you!"" ""stop demanding so much from your boyfriend he is not an atm maschine! (even tho i never asked for this, he is just generous) "". not only this, but she is very controlling and makes fun of other women a lot. also, she tolerates my dad talking down on her body and making weird sexual comments about other women. therefore, she takes it out on me, calls me fat a lot as a bmi 19 teenager and caused me an eating disorder which i had to 'treat' all by myself. (my friends were a great support) making me feel bad for all my own choices etc. i daydream about moving out everyday when i make my own money. (i'm 18 at the moment and still in school) 
she is not horrible, and i love her so much, but she doesnt help me with my self esteem as she encourages behaviour that will only make me miserable.

if anyone has advice on how to deal with this, i would love to see your comment. my technique at the moment is to ignore it and hide in my room/ pretend everything is fine, but i dont know how longer i can do that. i'm already applying for a mini-job so i can earn some money for moving out.",92902,how to deal with a pick me mother?,0,,,

A few days later, David messages me and asks me if I still want it. He said he would be willing to deliver it to my new apartment and help me set it up. All at no cost.

Yada yada.

Anyway, randomly one day he writes on Facebook what his Instagram username is. I thought “He’s cute and seems nice. I’ll add him. Why not.” I follow him. He follows me pretty quickly after and liked several of my photos. Which signaled interest to me. After that I didn’t think about him much. 

A week or two later he posts on an Instagram story how he’s moving back to the east coast because he can’t stand California. I responded to the Instagram story and said “Hey where abouts are you moving to?” He stated around my area that I personally just moved to. I said “Oh cool! I just moved out there myself. It’s a great state.”

While he did respond everytime I wrote something, he just seemed totally uninterested. Like where you can tell the person isn’t putting in the effort like you. So after I just stopped talking and he never messaged me since. Another sign of disinterest. 

I asked a friend and they said it’s him playing games. Why like my photos and all that jazz if he’s not going to even talk to me? My friend was as stumped as me. Like I only made the effort because I thought we had a few things in common and he was cute and obviously he thinks I am, right? Do I need another reason? I don’t normally message guys first, but it was an innocent “Oh hey! See you’re coming back to the East. Where you moving to?”

Maybe she thinks that if she says or does the right things, he will improve.

He won't. 

It is not within your power to communicate, convince, coach, coerce, compromise, beg and plead, reason, or force a man to become a better person. 

What you see is what you get.

Cooking, cleaning, fucking like a pornstar, supporting him financially, and ESPECIALLY having a baby with him will NOT change who he is fundamentally as a person. It will NOT motivate him to value you, it will NOT motivate him to become a more considerate and high-effort partner. Or at least, not to you.

If anything, he is more likely to get worse over time as he gets comfortable and realizes that no matter what he does, you won't leave him.

Ladies, when you see red flags, you really only have two options: 1) stay with someone who will make you miserable, or 2) leave, be happy on your own, and find a better man. There is NO third option.

The choice is obvious.",92856,"Accept that you cannot control others. There is no magical combination of words that will transform a LVM into a HVM. The only person whose actions you can control, is yourself.",0,,,
