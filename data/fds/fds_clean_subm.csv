look at him and say in a very matter of fact manner: *'Do I look like a woman that pays half to you?'*, then raise your eyebrows. Literally make him feel ashamed to have even of asked, he will laugh it off nervously and get out that damn card.

Sorry, being real now, the only type of men that ask you to pay half are LOW market men going on tons of unsuccessful dates, therefore they wanna stay cheapskate cos they are not confident anything will come of it. I can tell you that for a fact

Who cares if he thinks you owe him sex........who CARES. Men are widely known to be entitled bullshitters, make him pay.

If you get too generous in the beginning don't be surprised sis, when he starts joking 'you gonna treat me' 'you get it babe' ''thought you were an independent woman'....then it'll be the 'I'm short have u got x'....'I'm broke' 'I got laid off'..'wanna help me drown my sorrows'. Men are v simple creatures, if they see an INCH of opportunity they will take a mile. Never be generous with them, they will not appreciate it.

The fact is it is almost always low market rejects or broke unstable men that will do this. A real man puts his money where his mouth is

I've noticed a few of the more attractive fuckboys try dipping their toes in joking about this stuff now (testing the waters bc of equality debates/menz rights bs), which I don't find amusing at all. I can tell u why that is.......because more pick me women are offering to pay half, in a bid to prove their 'Independence', aka men pleasing bs trying to spoil them with ZILCH knowledge if he's serious. A meal is not a CONTRACT him paying is him putting his money where his mouth is , showing investment and making it more expensive for him to fuck around. Why make it cheaper for him? **A MANS WORDS ARE VERY CHEAP. That is why they pay.**

I literally refuse to pay for a mans anything &amp; its never stopped me having longterm relationships. They are far more likely to BS you /cheat than vice versa. WHY would you be paying and pampering a man to BS you. You will end up looking v silly. A lot of these 'I SPOIL MY MAN' women , lmao, I can't even. Lets just say 9/10 they are being naive/being cheated on and the man is laughing behind her back about how much he gets out of her. He may be all lovehearts and rainbows on instagram, but not behind her back. Handmaidens do women everywhere a disservice. 

Only time you should be working out mutual finances is when you're years deep into a committed relationship and even then he must be well trained to know he takes the lead. Unless you want a scrounger, don't fall for this half, play fair business. Men rarely play fair",15386,DON'T SPLIT THE BILL: Millennial men creeping in the 'spoilllll meeee' bs,0,1570668065.0,,,0

You have to have patience and you have to really practice diligent self care and boundary-setting, but if you stick to the principles outlined here you will attract only high quality men. 

I was stuck in a four year relationship with a manbaby. I was a live in mommy essentially.  I was 27 at the time (he was 33) and he wouldn’t commit and he wasn’t what I needed or wanted.  

I had come across some materials from Sami Wunder (I took plenty and left plenty, I didn’t follow her program to a tee) and I decided to leave my ex. I also decided that I wasn’t going to be the forever girlfriend anymore and I was not going to settle for less. 

I stopped chasing. I stopped calling, emailing, texting, and all other initiation with men. I wouldn’t show up or ask to clarify plans if men only said “hey, did you want to meet up Saturday?”... if he never followed up with a time and place, he’d get scheduled over. 

I stopped texting entirely. If men wanted to date me, they had to call.  I flat out refused to be exclusive with men until I got a ring: I kept circular dating until my now-husband couldn’t bear it and literally kept me occupied the entire time. I didn’t even move in with him until we had a date for our wedding. 

I can’t tell you enough how these principles being shared here will change your life. I’m a new person. I got the most incredible husband.  I feel like the luckiest woman on earth.",15353,Where was this sub when I was single??,0,1570663002.0,,,0

**And that is female peers and family members who guilt trip you for not reciprocating sexual interest from a male friend** or staying with an ex THEY liked for you

The truth is, quite often this is coming from women that don't value themselves, have high esteem or many options. In fact I'd go out on a whim and say its usually coming from bitter women that have begrudgingly settled for beta's, most times. (Pssst- getting slightly bitter about men is understandable, however responding by committing to a subpar loser is submission). So they will view you as very uptight, or even superficial, for turning a man down, even if he's a low market square that repels 99% of other women he is attracted to. These type unknowingly think very similar to traditional red pill men in that you're going to 'hit a wall' and run out of options, but that is likely a past/present insecurity they are projecting onto you. They can't get their head around you being able to 'choose' rather than being 'chosen' . These women are still somewhat stuck in a patriarchal mindset, where women's agency feels foreign to them. Perhaps they've been worn down so much, they don't see any other way. 

The message sent out to women is: you have to be glad any man wants to commit to you, because men are playboys. We are taught to scramble for these average or less fuckboys as if they are a prize, and bend over backwards trying to get them to commit OR settle for these overly sensitive low earning man children rejects with no social skills or competent qualities. The thinking is, if you settle for the overweight prematurely balding guys that don't please you in bed and play video games all day , at least he's NOT going to cheat. That is how low some people set the bar for themselves &amp; its sad, because its mainly a matter of confidence but it has such a HUGE impact on the rest of your life. If you refuse to fall at the hurdles, and believe in your boundaries/getting what you want...you will. 

Many women like this forgo any sexual attraction and chemistry just to 'fall in line', but I can bet you a million pounds they are unsatisfied and resentful, and in most cases it leads to a dead bedroom/subsequent tension. These are women   you see shouting down at their selfish, socially inept beta hubbies in the supermarket, because the stingy bastard won't offer to contribute towards the shopping... but he can pay for his video games tho. Settling downwards, does not guarantee happiness, faithfulness or fulfilment. This is how women are tricked to serve subpar men, rather than weeding them out.

And as such when a male friend fancies you, even if superficially, you must submit like a good girl and feel flattered. You are not allowed have standards. I kid you not, some women have gone at me so much about some awkward male friends, its as if they wanted me to give the dude sympathy sex, literally fuck him out of sympathy. *Oh he struggles with women, that must make him nice!* NOT necessarily, women have good intuition. And if you notice, when you friendzone a guy, he's usually getting friendzoned by a lot of other women too. If he's so great, why is that? You don't OWE men sympathy sex on account of them being rejected a lot. Many introverted men can be just as toxic. A lot of these men are lazy social wise, and have no desire to step up and gain competence, instead they rely on garnering sympathy &amp; guilt tripping women out of their league. In fact once you scratch through the surface, you will find most have pretty entitled attitudes to women, and are full of insecure rage. You can't force yourself to be attracted to someone or have chemistry with them in that dept. That's your choice, your agency. 

This is also a particularly potent issue when girls are in their teens trying to impress oneanother and certain girls try to coerce their friend into getting with a guy, and pimp them out to their dudes friend (for the BENEFIT of the men). If you are not careful, you could end up in a very comprising situation being preyed on by a man you have no interest in, usually much older may I add. It is very important, especially if you are a teen, to leave a situation where you feel uncomfortable, especially if there is drink/drugs around..or you are travelling a car. Women who have a problem with your agency are a red flag &amp; not a good quality friend. 

There is nothing wrong with a friend introducing you to a male friend, but you should NOT be being pressured to like, fuck, or date him. Same with an ex, you should NOT be being pressured to keep it going, or get back with him when you know it didn't work out or he is toxic to u behind closed doors or you just don't see potential/feel the same. When one of my ex's cheated as a teen I had numerous mutual girl friends telling me how much he 'adored me' and was heart broken trying to guilt trip me as if I was the bad guy. So fucking what, he cheated and I had a right to leave. You know the nature of this man, your feelings and its your choice what you do about it.

That concludes my Ted Talk! Do not allow these handmaidens and clueless people pressure you into decisions you are not comfortable with. PERIOD!!",15319,Peer pressure &amp; Mr Friendzoned- You have a right to say NO!,0,1570656528.0,,,0

The commenter aggressively declared the woman's problem to be a simple one: She was obviously trying to date men who are **out of her league in appearance.** The purposed solution: **Lower your standards.**

In a way that makes sense. Apps are notoriously two dimensional. Unlike real world dating, it's all about how you look. It's normal to assume that if you are't successful maybe you are aiming too high.

Here's why I have a problem with this advice:

1. We can't know if the woman is only swiping for ""top tier"" men. Nothing in her post indicates this and unless you are literally sitting next to her, you can't know. What looks cute to me might not at all look cute to you.
2. The issue can just as easily lie with the men. The cliché of (below) average men who have impossible physical standards is legendary.
3. The commenter was hateful and aggressive in her delivery. **That's not ok.** We get plenty of hateful comments from misogynists, we don't need that among each other. 
4. Personally, I liked another woman's *much kinder* suggestion for OP to lower her standards in order to practice dating and conversation with men. 
5. Men will *never* tell each other to lower their physical standards (except in the context of dating practice). They understand that you can't force attraction. They also tend to have more self-esteem than women and don't see a problem with aiming above their pay grade. But they will also tell you that if you want more, you got to be willing to be and do more.
6. Last but not least, I didn't like the implication that we have to settle for men we are not attracted to, just because some social construct says that they are within our (completely arbitrary and temporary) league and therefore all we deserve. 

In my life I've seen many....many couples who didn't give a shit about the league concept. But those stories are not mine to tell. Instead

# Here are some famous couples who defied the concept of leagues:

**Huge Jackman** (50) and **Deborra-Lee Furness** (63). Yes, ladies. The Wolverine himself married to an older woman for well over 20 years now.

**Pierce Brosnan** (66) and **Keely Shaye Smith** (56). Former James Bond scandalously married to a ""full-figured"" woman.

**Emmanuel Macron** (41) and **Brigitte Macron** (66). French president married to a much older woman he relentlessly pursued for years.

**Matthew Broderick** (57) and **Sarah Jessica Parker** (54) former ""Sex and the City"" actress also known as ""The Horse"" among hatefully men.

**Clive Owen** (55) and **Sarah-Jane Fenton** (53). They've been together for 25 years now and people are still saying he's out of her league.

**Charles, Prince of Wales** (70) and **Camilla** **Parker** (72). He wasn't allowed to marry her because she was a divorced woman. He married a carefully handpicked beautiful young virgin. The marriage was famously a disaster. After her death he finally married Camilla. Say what you will, they're still ridiculously happy together.",15248,"Should you only play within your league? - And no, I don't mean baseball",0,1570645814.0,,,0

He was not talkative at all ... thought maybe it was nerves or just wasn’t into me. Yet at the end of the night he kissed me and wanted to see me again.. well now no good morning txts he is so short with me

A couple weeks ago, my (20F) boyfriend (20M) and I had a decently rough patch. We had some disagreements and lack of emotional contact, but we tried our best to talk it out and get back on track.

He always ends these arguments with “let’s forget about this and move on.” That was my first red flag, because clearly if we just “moved on” the issue would come back in a new form and we would start back at square one.

A main focus about our arguments have been how I disappear for an hour or two without responding to his messages. Usually it’s because of homework, but he still gets ticked off and he’s mentioned how he wishes we would talk more. It’s understandable to want more communication, and I admit I could pay attention to notifications more, but most of the time I make it clear when I have to do work but he would rather push and ask if I could join him in playing online games instead.

On top of these arguments, I’ve been relatively stressed trying to read his emotions. He makes it clear when he’s not feeling good, but that’s about it. I have no idea why or what to do, and when I ask if he’s okay, he always responds with “I’m fine” while making it painfully obvious that he isn’t.

I don’t think I see him in a love kind of way anymore. To me, we have fun as friends, but when it comes to actually being in the relationship, there are so many bumps and curves that have stressed me more than made me feel happy, and I’ve been considering a break up. Unfortunately, this is my first boyfriend, and would be my first break up. I feel guilty thinking like this because he’s the type to blame himself and himself only, which I don’t want to happen, which is where some of my hesitation is.

I'm a girl with high standards and there are loads of interesting things on here.

So I need a bit of advice. I'm 27 and I have next to zero dating experience. All throughout school, university, several jobs, hobbies, it's just passed me by and I've never met anyone I've been seriously interested in who has also liked me. I have been on a couple of dates through Tinder but they never got past one date. I'm fairly shy but not totally unwilling to make the first move. 

I have been using these apps for about 2 years on and off now and I feel so discouraged. I am picky about my swiping, only swiping on guys I'm genuinely interested in, but even so I get very few matches. Those that I do match with, they very rarely reply to my messages or just stop replying - it always feels like a one way conversation, and it's like I can sense how disinterested they are in me, like I was just one of the 100s of girls they swiped on barely paying attention. It just destroys my motivation trying to even get anywhere with them. 

I'm definitely not the prettiest girl but I dress well, take care of myself, have my own professional job and interests, and I'm well liked by most people I know. I have no issues talking to men irl, I have male friends, it's just when you throw romance into it I fail so badly.

I want a long term relationship with a high quality guy. I'm very independent, so he'd have to be great for me to give this single life up. But I'm so depressed and lonely and I feel like the odd one out with my friends getting married and moving in with long term boyfriends. There's so many guys on the apps, I have choice paralysis. I don't have the energy to date anyone who vaguely interests me because they might be the one. Sometimes I think 'my type of guy' doesn't like using apps, but then I haven't managed to meet one elsewhere in any other way. I need to optimize my methods somehow. 

I've been seeing a therapist and he thinks I need to increase my self-esteem (durr) and have a bit of encouragement/mentorship to push me along and out of my confines. So I guess that's why I'm posting here!

I'm new here but I've been a frequent lurker so I've learned several valuable things to consider from this sub. 

So I've been insanely down on my luck with men but its because my standards have been so low. The last guy I saw wanted to be exclusive but not date, and didn't make this clear until I brought up (for the second time) how I was really starting to like him. He told me he was unstable so I cut him off because I have stability and have dealt with being emotional crutches for men all my life. I just want an equal partner! The last date I went on was an hour late, it was a date in the park in 90 degree weather, and I don't know WHY I waited an entire hour, but he gaslit me the entire time when he got there because he was stuck in traffic. I cut him off immediately because he said I had a ""serious attitude"" for being upset over waiting in the park for an hour with no communication on his part.

I was down on my luck, seriously. This guy I met months prior came back into my life and I made the stupid decision of suggesting we be FWB, just because I felt like I couldn't handle dealing w another guy and his entitlement. Well it turns out this guy is actually really awesome so far:
-He doesn't waste my time ever: He communicates to me if meeting isn't a good time b/c he might be too tired and underperform. If he is busy or has plans he makes it known and doesn't cancel last minute, and because I'm a student and I work, he tries his best to work around my schedule and doesn't make me feel bad when I say ""no"" to him when I have shit going on.
-He is very polite and hasn't said anything with sexist undertones (this is normally where things fall apart with me and men; they think their sexist statements aren't sexist and make me feel like I'm in the wrong for demanding respect)
-I know this may be a low standard, but he doesn't talk over me or try to pick my brain (in a condescending way). He allows me to speak, he listens fully, and asks thought provoking questions about me. 
-Not to mention he is really attractive IMO (I don't think he knows how attractive he is), creative, and we have amazing sensual sex, and he always initiates foreplay and makes sure I cum before he does.
-He also has a nice job and is finishing up school, and has his shit equally together. 

I will say I completely judged him before meeting him because I thought he was going to be a douchebag who fucks around and doesn't know how to treat women w respect. I think I was just expecting the worst because I've been let down so much this year.

One red flag I will point out is that he was showing me this incredible art gallery in our city on his instagram, and received a DM as he was about to close the app that said ""show me ur dick"". just like that. Now I know his instagram is private so it couldn't have been some random person. I genuinely think he is also insecure  about his size and shape, but he works it well so its not a big deal to me, but it just doesn't make sense. I didn't ask because I felt like it wasn't my business. Now I'm kinda feeling like it is my business. He also told me he doesn't mess around with more than one person at a time and we agreed to let one another know in the case that something like that would happen.

To me that red flag speaks volumes, and I honestly am really starting to like him, and I am not in a position to want only a FWB relationship and am realizing that in hindsight. I guess I just would like a second opinion since I don't have friends to talk to about this. I like him, and could very well see this becoming more, but I feel like I screwed it up by suggesting a FWB. 

For a timeline, we met months ago in May, stopped talking because I was seeing a guy, started talking again in August, and have been texting since then.

I guess it'll be awkward since both of us agreed on meeting up next year at a convention. It's been about a good month now since I last contacted him, and I'm still trying to find reason as to why he might've stopped talking to me:

\- He wasn't interested.

\- He was being stalked by a fan, so maybe this is just him being protective. Honestly understandable. 

\- I have a pretty dark sense of humor, and made a anti-furry comment not knowing he was still a furry.

\- He's busy and just not ready for a relationship.

I have been single for about 2 years. My last relationship was toxic - lying, cheating, taking my money, physical and mental abuse, literally ghosted me for a married women in another country... 
I went 14 months without sex, then I had a ONS from a club. Another hook up from tinder, he was lovely and I think we might of worked, but he lives in another town. I started to feel super empowered and thought I was ready for a booty call. I got with a footy player, hot af. Just typical player so that I wouldn’t catch the feels and be the girl who fell when she shouldn’t of. He was nice, but also a bit of a weirdo. Can definitely tell he’s a hot dude who has never had to try (is personality not that bright). 

Anyway I have been sad today because I ended the booty call (only 4 times meet up) without actually thinking - ie there were little things that possibly were hinting at it going further. We really didn’t talk unless it was organising the meet and when we did meet it was late and sex and then some chat. He started to show interest the last time and my commitment issues kicked in. My main problem was me feeling like I was chasing him and unanswered messages - feelings that I felt with my ex. I know that’s normal for booty call and I didn’t expect more, but my past issues cannot deal with these feelings right now. 

But then I wiped my tears and remembered who the fuck I was because I asked a guy out at the gym yesterday! Looking like a drowned fucking rat. 
I go to the gym every morning at 5. Saturday I went later than usual (7:30) and the hottest guy I have ever seen walks in. I was messaging my friends about him because I have struggled to find males attractive since my ex. They were hyping me up to ask him, I chickened out. Sunday comes around, after my booty call boy leaves I go to the gym late again (7:30/8). The hot guy is already there. I figure this is a sign; late both days and he’s there. My friend was hyping me up again. I thought he was leaving the gym so I left, turns out he wasn’t. So I went back in after 5 mins and walked up to him and asked for his number and if he’d like to get coffee sometime. He said yes and put his full name and number in my phone. Turns out the number was wrong. I thought I’d be stitched up. My friends that night convinced me to add him on insta and message him if he accepts the follow because he did put first and last name. Anyway they write the messages because I’m freaking out that I’m full creep right now. He gave me his actual number, one number was wrong. I am thinking of waiting until a bit during the week to ask him for a coffee/ date because I want the fact I’m a weirdo to die down a bit. 

But if this doesn’t work out, and even if the number was wrong, I had the balls to do something I never thought I could do. I cannot even talk to a man drunk in a bar. I cannot even look at a man on the train. And yet I just queened the fuck out of life in a matter of a morning.",14669,I grew some balls and asked a guy at the gym for his number.

We went through periods of seeing each other basically every weekend or even 3 times a week. Throughout the summer he invited me over to hang out with his friends too at his place before hooking up. He still talks to his ex. He even invited me over one night when he was dog sitting his ex’s dog. Recently I told him that I liked him and his response was that he liked me too but “he needs to focus on his self to get the things he wants.” So I took that as let’s stop talking which really hurt my feelings and we didn’t speak for a couple days which I was totally fine with. Then he called me Saturday night to hang out. And my dumb self went to hang out with him and his friend. He wanted to be cuddly and super touchy feely and I wasn’t too receptive of it. But now I’m confused, he’s working on his self but wants to hang out? That was our first time hanging out without having sex and actually being social so now I’m even more confused.

Thank you so much for all of the tough love and wisdom. It was heartbreaking reading every response, feeling the weight of the truth slowly start to sink in... 

He talked to me in a parking lot for all of 5 minutes. And I explained my position, that downloading an app in an open relationship is not “lying” and that I felt he was wrong in how he was handling it. To everything I said, he called me a liar. I asked him if there was anything after this discussion, to which he said no, that I’ve lied and betrayed him, while pointing in my face. At which point, I said, “you’re wrong, and I’m sorry for that.” Picked up my shit, and left.

I feel overwhelming grief and relief. And overwhelmed facing a huge mountain of recovery ahead... y’all were right, my self-esteem is tanked and my standards are nowhere to be found. I’m a fairly smart, logical, and confident person in literally every area except for men, where apparently I just lose all sense of identity and spine. I’m crushed losing him... because *I* loved him. It’s growing so much clearer that the feeling wasn’t mutual... and I’m devastated.

Current Boyfriend: 

1. From date #2:  He wanted to be exclusive and official. Call ourselves BF / GF and update social media to claim each other. He planned nice dates and initially paid for our dates, but is no longer offering to pay after 2 months of dating exclusively. 
   1. I am planning to break up with him next Friday unless he does something significant to reverse this behavior. I have already begun cancelling plans and ghosting, and bracing myself emotionally to re-instate Tinder and meet new men effective 1 hour post-break up, next Friday. I am hoping I can keep him as a ""friend"". Happy to go dutch with ""friends"". 
2. He would plan extravagant trips to the beach and out of state, which were great. He put effort into planning fun things for us to do together, and he paid for these trips and that was amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ex-fiance: This man pursued me without playing games. 

1. From day #1, he asked me to be exclusive, in no uncertain terms, and wanted to spend a lot of time with me. He called me his girlfriend in front of his friends and mine. He'd call and text me first, daily, and would compliment me, call me beautiful, and assimilate me into his life. 
2. He took me on amazing dates, planned nice activities for us to do together, and would pick me up at my place, and pay for everything planned, every time. He'd ask me to sleep over at his place (he was my BF at that point), and we'd cuddle all the time. 
3. He took me on amazing trips out of state at least One weekend a month to visit family &amp; friends and we'd have amazing dates there. Dates he planned and paid for. We'd have at least one vacation each summer, planned and paid for by him, where we did something completely different for a few days and stayed at a hotel. 
4. He'd have flowers and chocolates sent to my office a few times each year, especially on my birthday and valentine's day. He would also pick me up and drop me off at work to help me out, and he'd get me thoughtful gifts and presents just because. He'd frequently take me out to eat at my favorite restaurants, and pay for everything. 
5. He was romantic and warm and easy to talk to. We were best friends and lovers. He'd do very intimate things for me like paint my nails and make dinner. He would help out with house chores like doing the dishes and laundry. He would ALWAYS do the laundry, and I miss this!
6. He was very manly and took charge in the relationship. He had no issues calling and texting first and frequently, and wasn't insecure enough to demand or mind me not calling first. He also took charge in bed and initiated all the time. I would ""initiate"" by presenting myself to him, or walking around the house naked, and he took it from there.
7. He did really manly things around the house like fix the sink, toilets, and bathtub. He'd also fix and work on my car and his cars. He also mowed the lawn, painted, and worked on the wiring.

He’s not like the incels or bad guy by any means. In fact he’s very caring and I know he loves me very much. I’m just wondering if anyone has felt they were in a position where they felt like they deserved more? 

He is younger than me and this is his first relationship so I know he’s not experienced with some things. I don’t specifically mean sexually, I just mean a relationship as a whole. So I feel like I’ve been in charge of everything cause I’ve had relationships before. It’s really exhausting. I have asked him to take initiative many times and he’ll say I’ll do better. 

We are in a LDR and I’m visiting him in November. We both live in the US but I’m still spending a good chunk of money bc rental car, hotels, and flight. I told my brother and he was like how come he never comes to see you? I’ve visited him twice and he has never come to see me yet. I gave him the reasons my bf gave me. He doesn’t have the money, he has never traveled alone, he’s still in school, etc. I kinda realized these all seemed like excuses. (I’ve talked to him about this now and he said he’d love to see me but has never planned anything like this so he asked for me help)

The same day he leaves me on read for like 3 hours. We go times without texting if someone has work or goes out but I always ask we tell each other so I’m not sitting at home like did he die? He started a bad habit of going to the gym or taking a nap and not telling me. He doesn’t need my permission, just say hey I’m doing this talk later and I’ll be like k sounds good. 

So he finally texts back and is like oh haha sorry I fell asleep. I’m like ... we literally talked about this the other day? Why can’t you just tell me you’re taking a nap? He says well I thought you’d get mad at me for napping so I took one anyway and didn’t tell you and decided to deal with you being upset later. I was so insulted. I was like that’s how you think of me?? Idgaf if you wanna nap wtf. 

I tell him I’m cancelling my plans to see him bc this is ridiculous! Which might seem mean but I’ve never threatened to cancel any trips before. He thought it was all cause of the nap thing but that kinda was the tipping point. Why am I spending hundreds of dollars and I can’t even be treated how I expect to be? I come up with so many excuses and apologize like haha sorry I’m so nuts sometimes but no I get nuts bc you can’t treat me how I wanna be. I’m doing all this work to make this relationship easier and coming to see you in person and all I do is get left on read. 

I wanna be with him, I really really really do. We have a great connection. Sometimes I feel guilty for nagging him so much cause I know he doesn’t know any better cause of his lack of experience. I just know I deserve way better. Why should I be the one doing all the work? 

This is kinda of a side note. This is kind of how my first 2 serious/long term bfs were too. Now my current bf is kind of the same. So I can’t tell if I’m picking the wrong guys or if I’m the problem and nothing will ever be good enough for me.

TLDR: bf not a bad guy, just lacks experience. I’m exhausting myself being the one running the whole relationship. I feel like nagging him is becoming a mute point.",14372,I feel like I’m doing all the work in my relationship.,0,1570468382.0,,,0

second, I feel like teaching sadly, except at university level, does not pay enough for a decent future family-middle class lifestyle compared to tech, engineering, law or banking.

A few nights ago, a guy I’ve been talking to said I should come over to his apartment. I was completely fine with that and thought it’d be fun regardless of what direction the night went in. I wasn’t super sure what he had in mind, since our interactions up until that point had been somewhere between friendly and flirty. Would’ve been down to just hang out, would’ve been down for more.  I said sure, just had to pick up a few drunk friends from a party and make sure they got home safe before heading over. 

Told him I was heading over, all seemed fine. He lives pretty close to a lot of bars/the football stadium, and a game was getting out so driving and finding parking was an absolute nightmare, especially with all the drunk people who would just kinda step into the street.

I let him know I was there. No response. I waited. And waited. Embarrassingly enough, I ended up waiting like 30 minutes, sitting in my car while it was raining. I should’ve just left after like 5. I was super hurt and confused, especially since he was the one to invite me over (and this wasn’t the first time, I just hadn’t been available other nights). 

I drove to a friend’s place that was nearby since I was feeling like absolute shit and crashed there. He responded to me a few hours later (at around 2 am) saying he passed out and that he was really sorry. I was skeptical, but my friend convinced me he meant it. Well, sort of. I was still pretty wary of the whole thing, but didn’t cut him off. 

Until a day or so later. I tried to start a conversation with him, and I was getting the DRYEST responses ever. I tried one more time. Same thing. 

Honestly? I probably did too much. I should’ve just left after 5 minutes that night and never talked to him again. I shouldn’t have even tried to start a conversation with him. I shouldn’t have worried about him feeling bad for HIS own actions. I had nothing to do with him “passing out”/ignoring me. But after my two small attempts at talking, I decided it wasn’t worth it, in part because of this sub. 

I’ve already done more than I should have, but at least I wasn’t in that deep. If he was sorry, I’d like to think he wouldn’t have just stopped talking to me... I still don’t really know what happened that night, if he was just trying to fuck with me and play some type of game. This is embarrassing, but there’s a chance I would still be trying with someone who doesn’t give a shit if it wasn’t for the constant empowerment on this sub. I’m definitely worthy of not being ignored and receiving basic attention, and hey! I’m going out with a guy tonight, might be fun :-)",13988,This sub continuously reminds me to take no man’s shit.,0,1570381234.0,,,0

40 y.o. female here. I am so excited for this thread. I realized I've been listening to the wrong sources (i.e. well-intentioned male friends) about dating and have been fucking it all up. They tell me, ""be aloof,"" ""be yourself,"" ""have fun,"" ""don't show them you like them."" It's crazy making. After all of that BS, I found this. What a blessing.

 My situation is a little complicated. Ii am positive for HSV2. I have the nutsack to be honest about it. But sometimes it is extremely uncomfortable to watch my dating stock value plummet when I am open and honest about it. There's such such a horrifying lack of comprehensive STD education in the US that creates a non-realistic binary world of ""clean/unclean."" 

Here's my story: I wish I had gotten it from fucking a football team or something because at least I would have a story. But, I got it from the third guy I slept with when I was 21. The guy that gave it to me didn't tell me he had it. He almost tried to fuck me without a condom (of course!). Almost. I had to stop and we got condoms.  Things progressed  We had a sex a few more times. He moved to Hawaii. Shortly after, my vagina blew up. I went to the doctor and was swiftly diagnosed with HSV 2. I confronted him. He said ""he forgot."" FML.

After my diagnosis, I \*assumed\* that I would never date again based upon the jokes and society's general bullshit surrounding herpes. So, I didn't date for most of my twenties.  I knew I wasn't going to have kids, so I never had the baby pressure.  Instead, I pursued other things. I took the path of a creative. Did things most people dream of doing.  I had a phenomenal time.

I had low self esteem before herpes, and even lower after.  After many years of not dating, at some point I realized that I had to work on myself and become bulletproof with this bullshit. Which meant dating and taking the blows. So I did. I would date and I would disclose. It wasn't as nightmarish as some other people may have experienced (some women are called whores, etc).  It sucks for sure, but some of the guys who rejected me I became friends with and later discovered would be incompatible because they had severe emotional issues and baggage.  Funny how that works?  

Physically, I don't even notice it.  I've heard more herpes jokes from hack comics than I have had outbreaks. My ultra painful periods from my IUD are far worse than any outbreak has ever been.

Emotionally and intellectually, I wrestle with it every day.  Society, and people (especially on Reddit) scream and demand that I disclose. But do you know who doesn't seem to give that much shit about Herpes? The CDC. And I quote:

*CDC does not recommend herpes testing for people without symptoms. This is because diagnosing genital herpes in someone without symptoms has not shown any change in their sexual behavior (e.g., wearing a condom or not having sex) nor has it stopped the virus from spreading. Also, false positive test results (test results that say you have herpes when you do not actually have the virus) are possible. Even if you do not have symptoms, you should talk openly and honestly about your sexual history with your doctor to find out if you should be tested for any STDs, including herpes*

They also say,

*Most people who have genital herpes have no symptoms, or have very mild symptoms. You may not notice mild symptoms or you may mistake them for another skin condition, such as a pimple or ingrown hair. Because of this, most people who have herpes do not know it.*

A standard STD screening generally doesn't have a herpes test (see above). Yes, that means it is likely that your std screening has never had a herpes test.  Truth is, most people have herpes. The statistics are out there. One out of six has type 2 and more than 60% has type 1. Type 1 is now being linked to genital herpes infections. In layman terms, mouth cold sores are herpes and these cold sores sometimes be transmitted to genitals.

What really bothers me is this. A common suggestion from people I have sought advice from say ""don't disclose."" They have told me people they know that have it know it and don't disclose. I am just not that person. I don't want to be like the chicken shit male who gave it to me. I've disclosed it so many times to grown men and it is SHOCKING how many guys have NEVER had this conversation. It's shocking how I have to conduct a sex education class on the third date.  

So, I am really only fucking myself in the end? I am willing to bet dollars to donuts that the guys that rejected me did not seek a herpes test to verify their status and are not asking every girl they fuck their status (with proof).  I also imagine any  male Redditer that's gonna call me a cum dumpster would not have the courage to go get a herpes test.  They would rather not know so they don't have to bear the responsibility that they are so willing to dole out.  I'm exhausted of this stigma brought on by big pharma, hack comics (thank Judd Apatow!), and ignorance. 

So my question is: How do hold your value to when you're a sexual pariah?",13982,Dating with herpes,0,1570379594.0,,,0

3.** Women go “WGTOW” all the time and we don’t need a “Movement”.** We just go get a couple of cats and be happy somewhere. Being a “cat lady” is 100% a choice and for most of these women quite preferable to be being bothered with a man. And most of us will have kids that will tale care of us.

4.** “Loneliness” is a male problem.** Women have vaginas. Bitch we can make brand new people whenever we feel like! We make ALL the people! The fuck men going to do without us?

5.** Old pussy is still pussy and therefore has value.** Old women still fuck! It’s the men who have problems finding someone to be bothered with their old decrepit ass which is why they’re always dying to get married at that age.

6. **Most women outlive most men**. So even best case scenario, women will likely “be alone” toward the end of their life. Even if you “do everything right” chances are he ain’t gonna make it. So why sit around and be bothered?

7. **Single Women are happier and healthier by every discernible metric**!

First date we had a great dinner and drinks at this nice restaurant then went to a bar and played darts and pool. I personally wasn’t expecting to have this much chemistry with him at all. Towards the end of the date he says we should hang out again the next day, I told him I’d let him know. The next morning he texts me and I end up going on another date this time we get brunch and play bowling and skee ball at this really nice place, then we go and watch this indie movie at a small theater because we both had that interest in common. We hang out a bit after the movie then head home. For both of these dates he paid fully, I did the whole pretend to reach for wallet thing but he responded with “with you’re with me you’ll never had to worry about that”. We held hands, shared Eskimo kisses and even made out towards the end of our second date.

This past week our texts have been a little wish washy and I called him out on it and he literally asked me when I was free to call me and apologize over the phone (which was really nice). Anyway, Thursday we plan our third date to the board game place which would’ve been really fun for Saturday night (today). I didn’t hear from him all day today so I decided to text him first to confirm if we were still meeting about 3 hours ago, and his reply was “Hey im so sorry. I am not going to be able to make it tonight :/“. My friends said not to reply which I haven’t. But I need a bit of advice:
1. Should I just take this as a lost cause and move on even though we had two amazing dates?
2. Should I reply to him or just wait for him to (hopefully) reschedule?
3. And overall, being a college student I though dating older guys would prevent this whole “cancel last minute sort of thing” is that the case based off of experience?

I’m fairly new to the dating scene and being a senior I’m college it’s tough because I feel like everyone in my generation is on the whole fwb thing. Which I like on occasion, but trying to find a guy who wants an actual relationship tough, my friends keep telling me to lower my standards so I could finally get a boyfriend but I’m too stubborn to do that. I’m also a virgin which tends to drive guys away a lot of the times. I’m fairly good looking, tall, although I could dress a bit better. Anyway, general advice is also appreciated.

They give each other advice with the goal of coming out on top and have built this comaraderie as a result. It saddened me that I couldn’t fathom women having something similar for themselves. 

I was initially over the moon when I found out about the existence of redpillwomen. I thought it was what I’d been looking for all along. I wrote many posts and got *some* good advice but as time went on, I realized a grave truth. These women weren’t focused on getting the most out of dating for themselves; they were focused on getting the most out of dating for MEN. All of their advice was given with men’s feelings in mind. While that’s all great and dandy, redpill men are definitely NOT like that. Actually, I’m pretty sure that the core of their ideologies is NOT giving a shit about women’s feelings. I couldn’t only stomach so much of these women protecting the very men who are disgusted by the idea of protecting them. Red pill men are for all for men. Red pill women are all for men. Who’s all for us?

* Please no MLM bullshit - no, we don't want to know about you being a 'boss babe' selling stupid vitamins. 
* Minimise the amount of food photos you post. Unless it's an absolutely Godly photo or birthday cake. Nobody cares you've had two cookies &amp; a cup of coffee at Starbucks on Tuesday and a croissant on Wednesday. 
* Don't overshare. No sappy vague descriptions - it looks like you can't handle your problems in your real life and need to fish for approval online. 
* Try not to make your page all about your relationship if you have a boyfriend. People come onto your page to see you, not your constant love-bombing - it makes you look like you're overcompensating. A real relationship doesn't have to be played out online. 
* Keep selfies to a minimum or avoid them completely - awkward photos taking from upward angles are just...not helpful for anyone.

I gave it a week before I unfollowed him/removed him from my followers and unmatched on hinge, but I still find myself thinking of all the things we talked about and second guessing myself. Like what if I hadn’t asked him out would we still be talking?? I guess I’m just really confused :( he checked off all the boxes for me and now I keep thinking that there’s no one else out there like that.

A Pick Me is someone who excuses, justifies, or even tolerates bad male behavior because they think it makes them desirable. A Pick Me seeks validation from men for her tolerance of low effort bullshit. She doesn't value herself, and gets her security from male attention. 

How do I know this? Because I was one, for a long time. I let men make demeaning and degrading jokes about women (hell, I made them myself). I put up with low effort breadcrumbing because any attention was better than none.  I engaged in sexual activities I didn't want because I wanted to be seen as *having value*. In short, I didn't like myself or care about myself, so the validation I received from men kept my self-esteem afloat (or so I thought).

**How to spot a Pick Me:**

* Trying to be *one of the guys*
* Selling out her gender (""yeah, bitches are crazy"")
* ""I'm Not Like Other Girls""
* Normalizing lazy, low effort, low quality dating tactics by men. Advocating approaching/initiating with men, agreeing to low effort dates, insinuating that you have to provide sex to ""keep him interested"". Nah, girl. 
* Criticism of non-traditional gender roles, putting down women that don't want children, passing judgement for working moms, etc.
* Only having male friends (not saying this is true for everyone, but if she can't keep female friends that's not a good sign)
* Readily takes on the ""mommy"" role with men (cooking, cleaning, being too appeasing or accommodating, putting up with bad behavior, makes excuses for abuse/gaslighting/cheating)

  
**How to stop being a Pick Me:**

* You have to recognize your own worth. Something is making you trust mens' opinions of you more than your own. Do some soul searching and get to the root of your feelings of inadequacy. Therapy, journaling, support groups, meditation, researching codependency, and building strong female friendships that will act as sounding boards and build you up when you need it. 
* Remember that if you don't value you, a man won't value you. Men don't like to constantly have to reassure their partner; it's insecurity and weakness and even the most patient man will grow tired of it eventually. Don't walk into a relationship half a person, expecting him to complete you. **Only you will ever complete you.** The best he could ever do is enhance the life you've already created for yourself.
* Don't change yourself for him. He doesn't care if you're, like, *super* into baseball. He has friends for that. If that's not true to *who you are*, don't do it. You can be a supportive and engaged partner without molding your personality to fit his interests and lifestyle, and you can show interest in what he loves without letting it define you. Unless you're actually into baseball, then do you, girl.  
* Take honest stock of the relationships and activities in your life. Are you doing what you love, and spending time with people who truly care about you? Or are you trying to cultivate a persona of someone ""likable"" because that's what you think you *should* do? It's not too late to become your most honest self.

I later told him I still have feelings for him. (obviously things didn’t work out last year and we wanted to try again this year after I said that) and for the first time, it felt like we were on the same page. And he said he wanted to try again and I wouldn’t get hurt this time (spoiler: I got hurt really bad) 
What happened was, he kept sending me memes back and forth and shitty auto tuned fuckboy music, for more than two weeks at that point. And he kept using me as an emotional punching bag and forcing me to absorb his daddy and mommy issues (I really did not mind but at that point if someone was going to be opening up to me on that level, I wanted to be in an actual relationship with them) 
And I lost it and said “look I want you to actually put in effort. Texting is not effort. I am asking for bare minimum” 
Bare minimum is what I wanted. 
Then I got messages like “you have school and I have work, your parents are too strict, we can’t make it work realistically” then “I choose to bury everything that makes me emotional” and then he had the nerve to tell me “I wanted to get high with you to see if we have a physical connection” “I wish I hadn’t opened up to you in the first place” etc 
I know I deserve better than this but bruh he did everything nearly right to make me fall for him so hard.  And I don’t know how to move on.

     Dating is a game ladies. Even in marriage, you’re still playing that game until you die. You always want to have the upper hand when your dating. You can love him all you want but it should not exceed his love for you. Every move you make is a STRATEGY.  You gotta play with his mind AT LEAST a little bit to stay on top. Don’t give your absolute all to a man because what else will you have for yourself? Don’t be too available, keep him on his toes, stay PRETTY, and keep parts of you a mystery. I’ve been in love before and still had the upper hand and power in the relationship because I did this.

I also believe your looks are a big part of your dating experiences. You have to dress and look like you can attract the type of man you want. Never do your makeup? Wear baggy clothes and sneakers? It may be a problem ladies 😭 it’s proven you get treated so different when you look polished every where you go; the difference after you level up is unreal!

Now I know we have all been guilty of this at some point, however if you analyse the average pickme out there, they are constantly doing this, wearing their awful relationships and rejections as a badge of honour *'I'm just too nice, why won't want anyone love me???' 'my last ex ghosted me'.* Just don't do it, even if you think its to 'compliment' him or because you think he's different. I used to do this in the past when I was younger &amp; naïve, *'my last ex was such a loser he cheated blah blah so I'm not looking to get messed around but you seem nice hehe!*' and every single time it came back to bite me in the butt. This is just handing the devil a map to your brain and its triggers. This is you telling him you have baggage, and he is possibly a rebound you’re not ready for, because you’re still hurt over your ex. To him this is you voluntarily putting a banner on your head saying ‘I have low esteem, validate me!’ whether you realise it or not. This just sets the bar low, he is thinking wow she was willing to put up with that, then she’ll probably fall for it again or at least put up with the bare minimum.

Lets introduce your new ex: He was a great guy, we had loads in common, same sense of humour/same morals, he was a gentleman and always taking me out, we did a few long haul trips together that he paid for...I felt really bad about ending it, cos I know he's a good guy but he just wasn’t *the one* for me, you know??

Super sweet and innocent. He’s thinking, OH he treated her well and she STILL cut him off, she must not be in a rush to settle? I respect that..I guess she really knows what she wants and is looking for something serious. Oh, I guess this is going to take some work then, If I want to stay in her good books, she's used to being treated well. He's also thinking, you must of been special for a guy to go to that length. Listen girl, we know no matter how nice and attractive you are, some men will attempt to devalue you and treat you like shit....but this new guy does not need to hear that. He needs to get the impression you're high value.

Now yes, this may scare him off and have him reconsidering if he knows he's low value and used to scraping by with his cheapo takeaway meals, half assed dick and occasional spurts of kindness, but that’s exactly what you want. If he's on the bullshit, he won't want to meet up to those standards its too much effort since he's just after sex. If he's broke he knows he won't be able to take you away somewhere any time soon and those fancy places you like going will soon make him reconsider because he's not trying to invest in you and he knows you'll wise up sooner or later.

I get it, it comes up in conversation and your telling a guy a long story about how bad some men have treated you in the past and how much healing you had to do yadda yadda .. 

This is a bad idea.

First of all, a lot of men don’t care about the abuse you went thru and it often does not add anything beneficial to your budding relationship. You’re essentially giving him the blueprint to you. 

Tell men how well past guys have treated you, how much your ex gave you and how much they were absolutely smitten with you. I often do this and it works (also because it’s true). It’s harder for them to devalue you and toss you out as damaged goods or whatever. You always want to seem like the girl every guy is lucky having.

I promise you, telling men your sob stories and vulnerabilities does not benefit you in the long haul. Of course they love vulnerability but it’s best to be strategic about what you reveal. I never told men I dealt with about my major depression and suicidal tendencies because... it’s not their business and they will use that to exploit you in the end; I’ve seen other women go thru it and it’s not pretty.",24668,"Ladies, don’t tell men about how bad your ex treated you.",0,1572281629.0,,,0

Let me know if this isn’t allowed 

Am I missing something?

Obligatory apology for my mobile use, I have no excuses for spelling and grammar.


So I’ve recently started seeing this guy who has been insanely nice and seems to really have all his stuff together. We’ve been on about 7 dates within the past month and a half and have taken it to the next level and are now sleeping together. We don’t get to see each other really all that regularly because we’re both pretty busy, but so far everything has pretty much gone perfectly.


So on to why I’m actually here. 


First of all, I don’t actually know how serious he wants to take things. We have a pretty big age gap and he has children and I don’t, so we had agreed to start seeing each other casually. Lately he’s loosely thrown around the bf/gf terms and has been using pet names (babe/sweetheart), but I haven’t met any of his friends or his children. I really do like him so I don’t mind it leading down this path, except for the fact that I feel like I’m missing something. That’s the main reason I’m posting this.


Now to catch you guys up a little, my relationships in the past have almost always been long term and pretty unhealthy. Because of that I also have minimal dating skills that are up to date. 


Since meeting him he’s been super polite, doesn’t pressure me at all and has a really calm easygoing demeanor. He has a stable career and what sounds like a stable support system with friends and family. He’s opened up about a few things that can be red flags but has been seemingly upfront and honest with those. My main problem is that I feel like I’m missing something with him. Now obviously I don’t know him really well, we haven’t been seeing each other all that long so I’m not talking about basic things, but more like a secret that’s like crazy messed up in one way or another. 


So to wrap up a way too long post here: Is this guy too good to be true or am I just so used to the men I’ve met being fucked up?

Fuckboys love GE Girls because they provide a semblance of stability and a steady stream of love, affection, and other benefits from a devoted woman while they continue to play the field. It's maximum reward for very little or no effort on their part. Fuckboys offer up all kinds of excuses for this behavior, saying things like ""I don't want to settle down right now,"" or "" I'm just looking for a casual thing"" or ""I only do open relationships"" (open for him but not for you), but on the other hand they will butter a GE girl up and tell her she's the ""special"" one out of all the girls he sees, or that he likes her best, or that she's the one he can see himself settling down with... someday. They are good at dangling promises of commitment without ever delivering.

The trouble with fuckboys is that they can be extremely charismatic, so women often end up as the GE girl without quite realizing what they've gotten themselves into.

Chill” is the most self sabotaging word a woman can ever adopt for herself. 

Chill will get you dick but won’t get you the man 

Chill will get you “u up” texts at 2am but won’t get you “would you like my help” texts when you’re preparing for an important presentation

Chill will get you “I’m just not looking for anything serious right now” type of speeches but won’t get you “I want to build a life with you”

Chill will get you plan B in the morning after regrettable sex but won’t get you Advil and Chicken soup when you’re doubling over in menstrual cramps 

Chill will insist you go Dutch while the woman sitting beside you has never had to even pretend to reach for her wallet on a date 

Chill will get you low effort Nate but won’t get you I’ll do anything for you Matt. 

Stop that nonsense and delete chill from your vocabulary. Men will only give you the level of respect that you give yourself. If you don’t require anything from them, they won’t give you anything. Adjust your mentality and treat them accordingly.”

First of all, I want to say that I love this forum. It is refreshing compared with tired advice that romanticizes settling for someone who treats you like crap or that regards male sexual desires as magically overriding any other elements of a situation. 

That said: I'm in my early 30s and am really struggling with being single right now. My family of origin hasn't always been so accepting and supportive. I have made really great friends in my 20s, but they have all scattered to different parts of the country and spend most of their time focused on boyfriends and husbands. 

The advice I'm asking for is this: Many sites about being a single woman emphasize how important it is to respect yourself and to be independent, not just for yourself but for womankind as a whole. However, I feel like some of my basic attachment needs aren't being met- needs for things emotional support, physical comfort, sharing of resources, and acknowledgement.

 Sometimes, I wish I had someone to lean on, not necessarily as a romantic partner but just as some form of family or friend who would be there for me more frequently. I'm sad that in this current society so much of that is supposed to be fulfilled by romantic relationships and eventually by marriage...when we all know how  crappy men can be about partnering with others in a non-exploitative way. 

 Sometimes I feel like the ""strong independent women"" thing is just another myth used by men to sneak out of their responsibility for holding out their half of the social bargain wherein people in a community need to give and not just take. At the same time, I realize that staying willing to ""go it alone"" and not settle for crap is the best I can do for myself.  But then I start to feel desperate and like my inner sense of worth can only bolster me so much.

Do any of you have advice about finding reliable social bonds even if you don't have a conventional male partner? Commiseration for how difficult this problem can be to square with advice about being independent? Are there resources and community available to single women that I may not be aware of?",34487,Advice: Reliable Attachments without a Boyfriend or Husband?,0,,,,1

I base this on my personal experience, because going through the process described below was somewhat of a catharsis for me, and it really did change my love life for the better.

I think we've all heard stuff like ""it's better to be single than in a bad relationship"" but I think many people don't truly experience it on a deep level.  Also, I know that so many young women and girls are haunted by fears for growing old alone, and this, as counter-intuitive as it may sound, is advice that is tailored particularly for them.

So, what I'll describe here is somewhat of a ""step-by-step guide"" on how to make peace with your single status and embrace it fully.

# Step 1: Accept the possibility of growing old alone (if you're looking for love, this is the hardest step)

I know it may sound awful to many ladies out there (especially those who are attempting to stop being a pick me) but this is extremely important. Just sit down with yourself, and imagine your future life without love. And notice all the feelings that come to you. Anger, fear, despair, loneliness, sadness, whatever... imagine yourself getting older and older, imagine your friends and relatives living their family lifestyles while you're alone, imagine not fulfilling any dreams you had of a family, a loving marriage etc, imagine growing old and looking back on what may seem as a life that wasn't lived to the fullest, dying alone... and notice how it makes your feel. And not just let those feelings flow! Face them, experience them, let them flood you! If you feel like crying - even better, cry your heart out! 

While this may seem as masochism at this point, it's not - it's about facing your negative emotions linked to the single status. And it's important to do this because **it's by running away from these feelings that you run into the arms of low value men who hurt you and/or only want to use you. Look around, most (if not all) bad relationships you've had, and others around you have had, probably come down to fear of being lonely.** However, if you learn how to face these feelings, as awful as they may be, at least they won't be haunting you and trapping you with low value men.

# Step 2: Plan your life as a single woman

If it's gonna be just you by yourself for the rest of your life, you better make sure it's a life spent in good company.  And this step may also carry some not so easy to swallow pills.

**Realistically asses all the downsides of being single for a long time (or forever)**. Now, this list of downsides probably differs from person to person, and the most important thing is to not lie to yourself. If needed, compile a list of all the things that would bother you, and **work on accepting them**. Acceptance doesn't mean that ""you love it"" or that ""you don't care about it at all"". No, you may very well hate it and care about it a lot - but if you accept it, it means that you are aware that it is what it is, and you have made peace with it.

Also, be aware of one thing: fact is, as a single woman past a certain age, you're going to be under the public eye way more than you would be as a man, especially if you're the last one single in your group of friends (though truth be told I don't think that single men past a certain age are left alone by people around them either) and it's possible that some nosy person may ask you something insensitive, or make a comment about something that you find particularly hurtful.

For instance, a thing that I found to be perceived as unpleasant by many single women - how will you react when they ask you when do you plan on getting married/having kids? Not saying you have to do it like I did, but my personal strategy here was to say something like ""never, I'm gonna be an old maid"" or something else that sends a clear message that using a bad label on me will not result in them dominating the conversation. The main point is - don't dread some bad label assigned by society, because that gives too much leverage to these nosy morons who think your relationship status is somehow their business; whatever the ""bad scary thing"" they'd throw at me was, I'd amplify it and laugh it off. 

You can find other ways to deal with such questions and comments, but be aware that this will happen and work on it not letting it get to you. 

Now, is it ok that some people think they have the right to meddle like that? No, definitely not. But they'll meddle anyway, and more often then not, the best medicine against idiocy is to depolarize it by laughing it off. Maybe they'll learn once enough single women start ridiculing their ""concerns"". But for the time being, it is what it is. It's likely that you'll either get asked unpleasant questions, or hear rude comments behind your back, especially if you live in a more conservative environment. Even if these remarks are about things you're bothered by, it sure as hell doesn't mean that they should derail you from your normal mood and ruin your day. **Be honest and 100% authentic with yourself. Discuss what hurts you with yourself first, accept it and make peace with it, so that others who attempt to discuss it don't hurt you nor disturb your inner peace.**

**Inner peace** \- another big thing that belongs in this step. It's important (I'd dare say crucial) to include it in your plan for your single life. Striving for inner peace is probably one of the best forms of self care. Your thoughts and inner monologues matter, so make sure they're bringing you peace and harmony. Don't force peace on yourself though, and if you have unresolved trauma or depression that you can't fight on your own, it would be a great idea to seek therapy. I would also recommend meditation (unrelated to therapy - if you have serious issues this may not be enough, especially if you're a beginner in meditation)

Now, the **outer aspects of planning your life** would definitely be about pursuing hobbies and activities you've always liked, reading, arts and crafts, hiking and other outdoors activities, gardening, finding a local group centered around something you're passionate about, etc... possibilities are endless and depend only on your personal preferences. Thing is, as a single woman, especially as you grow older, you will have more free time than your married friends (especially those with children) so it's important to make a plan on how to fill it. Make this extra time count, have something to show for it. 

Also **plan for the not so fortunate events of life** \- start a fund in case of an illness, decide who's gonna be your emergency contact in case of an accident etc (you know, the things that your spouse would normally help with if you were married).

# Step 3: Actually spend some time single

And by single I mean ""single and not looking"". Build a habit of doing things that fulfill you, not necessarily things that might get you a man. Create a mental space in your mind that is devoted to things you're passionate about.

Also realize that it's ok if you get a re-lapse, find yourself particularly moody or sad because you are not in a happy relationship. Don't beat yourself up about it, it's perfectly normal to want love. The goal here is to be fine without love, not to try to convince yourself you don't need it. It's important to clarify here that I'm not saying you should prefer being single to being in a happy relationship. However, HOW you are single is pretty much the only thing you can fully control.

So, give it a try. Control how you use your single status.

&gt;!It's very likely that this plan will become obsolete at this stage, because the mindset you have nurtured is by far the most guaranteed to result in attracting a happy relationship with a high value man.!&lt;

# Why is this important for your love life?

Because being ok with being single comes down to being wholesome and happy on your own, respecting yourself and truly loving yourself (I'm not talking about narcissistic self-obsession, which is often a mask for a lack of self love).

And **when you have this mindset, you simply won't match in any way with people who treat you poorly.** You'll have nothing to prove to them, you'll have better things to do with your time than to waste it on them, you wont ""click"" with them in any way, negative or positive. They will have nothing to bring to your life - while they'd bring a lot of very passionate negative patterns for you to live out in case you were suffering from fears and self-loathing, and trying to run away from it.

**Also, remember, even if you are miserable while single, it still beats being in a miserable relationship/marriage.** When you're sad about being single, you have one truly big problem - loneliness. It sucks but it's something that's up to you to manage and organize your life around it. However, if you're in a miserable relationship/marriage, here are the problems you may have to deal with: physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal and emotional abuse, manipulation, gaslighting, pathological jealousy, lying, cheating, lack of trust, threats of any kind, instability, your joy and good mood being sucked out of you on a daily basis, him not allowing you to spend time with friends and family, having to deal with his friends and family more than you may want to, anger issues, yelling and throwing things (bonus points if he does it in front of other people), making scenes, him not allowing you to work or grow professionally, him demanding/expecting that you financially support him while he does nothing... and I'm pretty sure this is not even the half of it. If you add children into that mix, it gets even harder to live through it. The worst part is, guys who are guilty of one of these things usually do at least some of the others. For instance, if he's a cheater, he's also gonna lie, there's a big chance you'll sense it so you'll go through trust issues, and he'll resort to manipulation to keep you in a relationship (which, if you pick up on it intuitively but don't listen to your intuition, will make you feel even worse).

So, if you still suffer from the mentality that there's nothing worse for a woman than growing old alone, it's time to rehabilitate yourself. For as long as you fear it, you run the risk of ending up with an asshole.

I'm certain that people subconsciously give off vibes to each other, and you simply won't click with high value men while being desperate to be loved, sorry. You may like them on surface, they may like you too, but it's not gonna work out for as long as there's that air of despair all around you.

&amp;#x200B;

And how did this work out for me? I'll just say that accepting my fear of growing old single was one of the best things I ever did. It healed a lot of really deep wounds (some of which I wasn't even rationally aware of) and it enabled me to meet my now boyfriend (future husband) with whom I have a relationship that's better than anything I ever even hoped for.

So, I know it may sound scary to a lot of girls and women out there, but it's really worth it.",34367,Being ok with your single status,0,,,,1

I have a male associate that Ive known for over 8 years. We met at my job, he worked in a neighboring department, and he had been trying for over 2 years to get my number or become my friend. So the first time he approached me, I was visibly livid, and taking a walk to calm down. He found this moment opportune to try to get my number, and ultimately try to fuck me. I told him to fuck off, and later that year or the next we became cordial and I gave him my number for whatever reason I cant remember. As years passed, I let him meet me after work for drinks, and since I dont drink much, he would drink more and offer way more information about himself than I gave him. He told me that at that time he was living with a woman that loved him but he didnt care for, and was using her to save money so that he can move out. He knew that he was breaking up with her 6 months before he actually did, and was basically using her to live rent free. Of course this made me livid, but I grit my teeth and maintained stature. More years passed, and I found out his level of slime had no bounds, the more I learned, the less I spoke on my actual opinion. The strangest thing about the whole ordeal is that he has been a stellar friend to me and I care about him (maybe I'm a massochist)

&gt;For your personal emotional health and resilience as a woman, you must choose to view the world of men through a new Cranky Old Bitch filter. Through this filter it soon becomes clear that men are simply too pathetic to waste your giant brain contemplating for too long.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sure, they lord their power over us, they cast their dismissive eyes on us, they attempt to jack off in front of us because they are sad deluded animals who always need a new fix to feel like more than nothing. It’s gross and it’s sometimes litigable but it’s also just hilariously unevolved.  
&gt;  
&gt;Imagine, the desperation of living that way! And sure, they might fire you if they catch wind of your total lack of respect for the way they operate. Many of them are in charge. What a hilarious irony, right? I mean you at least have to admire their tenacity. In spite of countless obvious deficits, they STILL find a way to stay on top.

He suddenly texts me again asking to hang out and I tell him that I’m emotionally unavailable right now and not interested in being with anyone.

For those not from Europe, on our continent we have group of Roma who live in mafia like societies drawing income from begging and scamming the mainstream population. While these individuals can be harmless, most encounters will result at the very least in a tepid demand for money but under the worst circumstances with an aggressive push to extract money out of you. 

As young women interactions with the Roma tend to be quite scary at first. However, exposure to such people has a salutary effect, it teaches women how to firmly say know. You see in the case of the gypsies, politely saying no when they ask for money gets you nowhere. They see the word no as an invitation for more pleading and pushing and the nicer they are the more aggressive they are likely to respond. The only way to get them to back off is to give a confident NO, and show nothing but anger and scorn if they don't back off.

This is the context in which my grandma's advice works so well. If you see a gypsy coming towards you, there is a small chance that his intentions are honorable. But in the vast majority of cases it will be to try to cheat/scam/harass you into giving something up to benefit them. The best way to protect yourself is to be on guard at all times. Never give up anything of value right away. If the gypsy gets pushy or aggressive, you need to show them that you are not gonna play their game and know how to firmly say know. Only if they are fully respectful and meek do you maybe allow them to impress you by playing a jig on their fiddle.",35896,Advice my Romanian grandma gave me: when a man first approaches you be on guard just as if you were in an empty metro carriage and a gypsy was coming straight at you,0,,,,1

It's my first book of Behrendt and Ruotola and it began tough, no nonsense, but still charming. The mentality seemed to boil down to: don't take dates too seriously, value yourself, look good, go on a bunch of dates, and voila! Dating problems solved, you are now married with five kids.

The first issue I ran into with this book is how incredibly dated it is. The book came out only 6 years ago, and it's already archaic. They only lightly touched on online dating, and still seemed to exist in a world where people meet in person instead of online (imagine that!) You could also tell that it was written by a couple who hadn't dated in a while, because the dating scene has changed dramatically since they were single. The principles are good but the application is spotty at best. ""Make him respect you and your time"" is great in theory, but what if you're online dating and the only messages you get are boring, low effort innuendo mixed with gaslighting and negging? Because that's what dating is now. That's ALL dating is now. Dating culture is hookup culture, and divorcing the two successfully could be an entire book on its own.

My second issue with the book was the repetitiveness. I feel like they took several very solid ideas and streeeetched them to fill an entire book. The letters from fans felt both fake, and like a distraction from the main message. There are really great and inspiring quotes in this book (I know, because I bombed my friends with them), but there is so much fluff to get through and some brevity would have been super great.

I would love an updated version of this book. I would love an updated version of this book from a person or couple who has successfully dated in the last 5 years. I would **LOVE** an updated version of this book that addressed the general fuckery of what modern dating has become, and how to navigate the murky ""wyd, u up?"" waters. How do you stand out when you're one of 100 matches, and 95 of the other matches are bots? What do you do if a man feels like going to dinner is ""too much commitment"" for him right now, and would rather just have coffee (or more preferably, sex)? **I NEED THAT BOOK.**

Men want to please women as long as it involves their penis, makes them feel dominant, is something they can brag about later, and isn’t too much work.🙄

And women communicate all the time but men are difficult to teach for a variety of reasons. And most of it is because they’re having sex at you and not with you, or focused on themselves. Teaching men not to be Selfish is not easy or even possible most of the time. And that’s majority of the problem.

I can attest that a common refrain that women hear when we protest is “well my last girlfriend liked it” like they can argue with you about your body.  Or they just straight up can’t or won’t last the length of time you need to orgasm. Or they start sticking it in way too fast and you constantly have to slow them down and then they get pissy and impatient. Or they think whining and poking you in the back is supposed to make you horny for some reason rather than repulsed.

Or they watch too much porn and can’t stay hard and can’t connect with real women. Or they just start off practically assaulting you because they saw it in porn. And then there’s all the “accidental” anal assault.  So then I gotta be like “please don’t choke me or slap me or vice grip my titties” which honestly I shouldn’t even have to fucking say but there’s a lot of porn addicts who can’t get off without sex involving abuse.

There is nobody out there nicer and more thoughtful than a man that wants to have sex with you but hasn't had the opportunity yet. The extent of what a man is willing to do to impress you, is not going to increase the moment you agree to be his girlfriend.

If anything, you will get more from a man as long as he feels like he is still chasing you, which is what causes the effort to start dying down once he feels like he tied you down and you are finally his girlfriend. 

All you really get out of agreeing to be someone's girlfriend, is the promise that he will continue to do all the SAME shit he was already doing while courting you, while also being monogamous and faithful to you until he one day decides to ""make an honest woman out of you"".

Which is not guaranteed, and ultimately does not mean much. YOUR chastity is worth a lot more than his. You have greater options as a woman than he does. You sleep with whoever you want to, he takes whatever he can get. He should get bothered about you seeing other people, you really shouldn't worry too much about what he is doing with his life. 

Yet for some reason, its usually women that chase after the GF/BF relationship more so than men even though men benefit from it more than us. They benefit from marriage more than us, as well, but marriage has a lot more benefits to women than BF/GF relationships. Yet women still fall into them.... Why? What is the point?

You get all the same things from a guy that you would get if you weren't committed to him, besides monogamy. In return, you have to beat men away from you with a stick for the rest of your life. Richer, more handsome men, that could probably treat you better, with at least another inch on their dicks. You have to say no to every nice gift or fancy meal you are offered, for a man who is still on the fence about whether or not you are wife material. You also get to perform some wifey duties, how much will depend on a lot of factors. If you live together, tough luck. You have basically become like a wife that is easier to leave, reaps no tax benefits, and isn't recognized by the law.

Here is an underrated strategy:

*You are either single or married, there is no in-between. Any man that wants you to commit to him has to put a ring on your finger first.*

**What that sounds like:**

Absolute insanity. You will never get to really know anyone this way. Only weird, low value, desperate men would agree to something like that. Men will run for the hills as soon as you tell them being their girlfriend is off the table. There is no way you can string someone along like that and get to know them well enough to ever be engaged to them eventually. You NEED to be his *girlfriend* for 1-2 years to know who he is. That is the ONLY WAY. This will never work in a Western society or on Western men! 

**What actually happens:**

Every guy you talk to is super excited when you first tell him you dont want a BF/GF relationship, because he doesn't have to worry about you begging him to be your boyfriend in a few months. Things seem great at first! He can swipe around on Tinder without feeling any guilt, things are going great....until they aren't. Until he realizes that you are also still active on the apps. Until he recognizes that as a woman, you have more options than he does. You are going out on a lot more dates than he is. Your snapchat everyday is at a new fancy steakhouse that he cant afford. You do not need him. Now, he wants you to commit to him. Little by little he starts filling up more of your time. The way he sees it, the more he takes you out the less time you have to go on dates with the rest of your rotation. Pretty soon he is taking you out 3-4 times a week or more if you let him. Time passes, its been 6 months to a year now. You are now the only woman he is talking to, because you take up so much of his time and money trying to keep you unavailable for other men, but you still have 4 other men on speed dial. He knows that, and it drives him crazy. He realizes that he has gotten to know you, as much as you will allow him to, under these circumstances and he can't imagine losing you now. He is now ready to propose, because the idea of another man having you keeps him up at night. He would rather take time to have a longer engagement and lock you down now, than continue to risk letting someone else swoop in and regret losing you forever. 

Now because you wouldn't accept a boyfriend, you got yourself a husband in the fraction of the time it would have taken him to propose if you let him superficially lock you down with a GF title for 2 years first.

**FIELD REPORT:** 

I employed this tactic my whole life because it was how my parents thought. In my family there are no boyfriends and girlfriends, and bringing one home is a huge sign of disrespect in my parent's eyes. So I used that as an excuse to tell men why I can't be their girlfriend. By the time I was in my early to mid 20s I had already been engaged twice but received multiple marriage proposals (first one when I was 18 the last one happened at 22). 

Then I fell in love with my best friend when I was almost 23 and decided I did not want to be engaged or married, I wanted to take things slow. I agreed to be his girlfriend. I dropped everyone in my rotation, until 4 years into our relationship when I realized I was ready for the next step...but he was not. 

I was shattered, but still ever so calculating. I played it cool and focused on myself for 7 months until our lease was up. By the time our lease was up, I told him I could not live with a man who couldn't commit to me and asked him to put everything he owns in the box to the left while I stood and watched in a pair of jeans that hadn't fit since I first met him. 2/3 more months pass, and I am now the tightest and leanest I have ever been in my life. I look incredible. I soft maxxxed the fuck out of my appearance. I end my nearly 5 year relationship. The feeling at the time was mutual. 

We don't speak for a month mostly because of me wanting NC. He reaches out and asks to see me and I agree. While we were out, I get a text from someone in my rotation and he notices. What happened afterwards was an absolute romantic shit show, but I never expected him to react that way. I did not plan to get a text at that time, or build up a rotation just to make him jealous. Now he was desperate to fix his mistakes and confess that he was wrong and is not over me. I was not having it. I refused to be his girlfriend, I told him he has the same opportunity every other man has right now. He can either put a ring on my finger or continue sharing me. I made it clear that I have not forgiven him for wasting my time, and don't know how or when I will. 

He is literally losing his mind right now trying to win back my approval and impress me. He has done more for me, the last 2 months of him trying to court me and win me back, than he did in the 4 years of me being the cool and casual girlfriend. The gifts I have gotten, the restaurants I have been taken to, everything has leveled up drastically. Every dinner out together is a $200 dinner now. He goes out of his way to spend time with me now, and he openly admits its because he wants to keep me busy so I don't have as much time to entertain my other dudes. 

After nearly 5 years of no planning on his end, he is now actively preparing for a proposal. I found out on accident, but he is proposing to me on an occasion that is coming up in 3 months. I don't know yet if I am going to say yes right now, but look forward to seeing what other hoops he will jump through from here until then. 

None of this would have happened if I didn't have an abundance mentality and did not focus on myself. None of this would be happening if I did not employ FDS tactics and stuck to them, even during times where he was being so impressive that part of me wanted to go back to the good ole days! 

But I will never let myself fall into that trap again. He is also not the only man in my rotation planning a proposal for this year, either. 

Even if I end up not getting engaged to either one of them, this tactic works and is the most liberating thing I ever decided for myself. As soon as the option of being someone's girlfriend was off the table again, my life has improved drastically. I don't buy my own food anymore, I go out to eat to a 5 star restaurant at least once a day. I have multiple men buying me clothes, jewelry, paying my bills, etc and I am not having sex with any of them for it. I couldn't ever imagine trading in this life, to be superficially committed to a ""boyfriend"" again. 

I can't find much online about other people that go the no boyfriend route, and I would love to hear from anyone else who dates in a similar fashion. Has anyone else tried this out? Does it work for you too? If you haven't tried it before, is this something you think you would be interested in? Or has science finally gone too far?",35656,"Underrated Strategy - Single to Engaged, no Boyfriends allowed",0,,,,1

The first date was super innocent. We chatted about life and he told me he was looking for a relationship and specifically told me he wasn't looking for anything casual (sure jan). We've had sporadic conversations since then with me occasionally not texting back due to his text being uninteresting or low effort and always waiting for him to text me first. I'm not really that stressed about him, while I like him, I have other prospects to focus on.

Fast forward to this week. We've been chatting on and off as he was due to start work in my city this week. On Saturday he asks if I'd like to go to dinner after work on Wednesday (today). I say yes, realize I have a party that same night and text him the next day to reschedule. He doesn't reply until Monday and says he has no other days available. I tell him we'll just stick to Wednesday because the party starts later that evening and I'm sure I'll have more than enough time for dinner. He thanks me and sets a time to meet.

It's the day of the date. He texts me at 10 am:

""Good morning. Something came up so I can't make it today, but do you think we could push it to December when I'm not super stressed out and trying to do a million things at once and I finally move in lol""

I haven't replied. I'm irritated because there isn't an apology in that text message..  He may have double booked the day and is trying to switch up the power dynamics so that I'm the one chasing after him. But I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid and conceited by not even wanting to reply

These tips are from a dating coach (Katarina Phang) whose ideas align quite a bit with FDS philosophy. I hope they help you too :-)
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


[**7 Texting Habits of a High Value Woman**](https://katarinaphang.com/texting-habits-of-a-high-value-woman/)

&amp;nbsp;

Texting is about how every relationship starts.  Your texting habits can reveal a lot about you. A high value woman knows how to use this tool to her advantage. She recognizes texting as just that; a tool in her dating arsenal. Not a measuring stick of if and where the relationship is going. She knows texting can fan the flames of attraction or throw a wet blanket on it.

&amp;nbsp;

**1. High Value Women Don’t Text Constantly**

One texting habit of a high value woman is she knows less is more when it comes to texting. It only stands to reason that a woman that values herself highly also values her time.  She has friends, a life, a job/career and doesn’t engage in all day textathons. She understands that texts are just words and it’s actions she values.

&amp;nbsp;

This is especially true for men that she has yet to meet or men who text more than put in an effort to actually spend time with her. I know women who will texts with men for weeks or months and have yet to meet them or only actually been on a couple of dates.They mistake this E-tethering for genuine interest when actually all it is is electronic maintenance that requires little investment.

&amp;nbsp;

A man that wants to text her all day long non stop sets off warning flags in a high value woman.  Does he have a life?  What is his hurry? She isn’t in a hurry. She isn’t starved for the attention.

&amp;nbsp;

One of the fastest ways to put yourself into friend zone is to text all dang day with a man you have never met.  You are offering up zero resistance, following a lame lead, and there is no mystery to you. You are always there, like his best bud.

&amp;nbsp;

A high value woman is not going to be worried what will happen (or not happen) if she doesn’t engage in this all day texting. So next time you get caught up on the instant gratification of attention do as Charlotte often says in Katarina’s group.  Slow your roll.  Stick your feminine energy (check [this blog post](https://katarinaphang.com/what-is-feminine-energy/) to know what feminine energy is all about).

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Texting is a Pacing Tool for High Value Women**

When you don’t engage in frequent texting, you are pacing the man, slowing him down.  This is the fastest way to see his true colors sooner rather than later. Ever been busy, maybe at the gym working out or out with friends and just didn’t hear or answer a text from a man?  How did he handle it?  Did he question you or start double, triple texting or even worse? Maybe you tried cutting the conversation off, or ending it(politely) and he keeps on texting.  Seeking your attention.

&amp;nbsp;

When you use texting to slow down or pace, his reaction is telling.  You will know if he is a good man or one of those [thirsty nice guys](https://katarinaphang.com/why-you-arent-attracted-to-nice-guys-you-arent-crazy/). Ever woke up to a text that said something rather smart assy like “Guess you aren’t interested”.  (If you get this kind of message, I hope you aren’t interested much longer). See the thirsty nice guy link above for further explanation.

&amp;nbsp;

I am not talking about game playing or just ignoring texts. I am talking about have a life that doesn’t revolve around a textaholic. I am pretty clear with men that I am not a phone person.  I forget to charge mine, leave it at home by accident and don’t turn around and go home to get it if I do. The horror of such a thought for many. It never makes it to my bedroom with me and usually lives a lonely life in my purse. Men learn this fast about me and those secure in themselves don’t mind.  I have had men that want more contact with me buy me new phones or a charger for my car. That may not be you, but I am sure you can find some way to drive this point across in a easy nice way.

&amp;nbsp;

One good thing about pacing a man is you are also pacing yourself.  You are assisting yourself into not getting attached to a man you don’t really yet know. You are giving your brain less opportunity for those jibber jabber, anxious thoughts that many women seem to have.

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Anticipation Builds Attraction**

When you do 1 and 2 above he can feel the mystery around you.  You aren’t anxious, you aren’t hanging onto his words and you aren’t prioritizing him…. yet. He becomes curious.  You aren’t like the other women.

&amp;nbsp;

When you do text, you are flirty, light, interesting and receptive to him. Less is more.  If you are texting constantly with a man, there is no room for anticipation for the next encounter. That lull in between builds that anticipation and anticipation is a huge attraction builder.

&amp;nbsp;

Ever had a man you like make a date with you for Friday night and it’s only Monday.  Think about how that feels.  You have an entire week to work yourself up.  Something to look forward to. Give him time to have something to look forward too, build that anticipation and attraction.

&amp;nbsp;

**4. High Value Women Text Men That Text Them**

If he stopped texting or hasn’t sent you a text in a week or more, there is no need to reach out and remind him you are still breathing.  He knows.

&amp;nbsp;

This one is pretty simple.  A woman that values herself won’t wonder if she did something wrong and she is certainly not going to text him and inquire about what happened if his pace slows or stops.  She simply observes. She is well aware that if he wanted to keep the lines of communication open, he would. As long as she has been open and receiving his efforts without going overboard, she isn’t concerned. She doesn’t initiate or put in effort when he isn’t or when he stops.

&amp;nbsp;

A little note here.  Men can only keep up the pace of constant texting for so long.  They can and do get bored and move onto a not so easy target.

&amp;nbsp;

**5. Timing of Texts**

As stated earlier, a high value woman values her time.  This means that she also values and respects his time. She isn’t going to text him when he is working, or out with the guys. She doesn’t stress if her text is not answered right away. She gives him space to live his life as well and she gives him the benefit of the doubt as opposed to jumping to assumptions and conclusions.

&amp;nbsp;

She also recognizes a man who doesn’t consider the timing of his texts.  If he is texting late at night, or trying to keep a conversation going when she is working or out with friends, she sees a flag.

&amp;nbsp;

I took a two day trip to see a very good friend that I hadn’t seen in years. The guy I had just started dating was constantly texting me. My friend, a high value woman, asked me wtf was wrong with him? I had years of life to catch up on with my friend and eventually just turned off my phone.  I wasn’t scared of losing him. He stuck around for 3 years.

&amp;nbsp;

**6. Do High Value Women Sext?**


If you have done any online dating, you have probably encountered the men that lead in with sex. The question I ask myself “Is this the behavior of a high value man?”.  Many believe that all men are going to try.  I have evidence that this is not always true.

&amp;nbsp;

If you met this sex leading man online and he wants to start off with sexting, chances are good you are not the only one he has thrown that bait out at. If you engage in sexting, it’s going to be difficult to cut that off if you want more.  Back peddling is hard.  You are telling him it’s okay. If all you are looking for is a hookup, then fine engage. If you desire a little more, don’t do it and watch and see how he handles it.  Better to know sooner rather than later.

&amp;nbsp;

If you engage, refer back to #3 in this post.  You are killing the real life anticipation or setting expectations that may not manifest once you go live. On the other hand, sexting once a connection has been established and you are actually moving forward together, sexting done in moderation can build anticipation and attraction. You know what turns him on and how to push his buttons.  It can be fun.

&amp;nbsp;

To summarize, always leave them wanting more ladies.

&amp;nbsp;


**7. High Value Women Don’t Text Deep Stuff**

One of the top texting habits of a high value woman is she doesn’t text about serious things.  She realizes that tone can’t be heard in a text and things can go south fast. She isn’t so anxious to solve a perceived issue that she has to text out paragraphs of how she feels or what she thinks.  High value women aren’t anxious.

&amp;nbsp;

A friend of mine who had recently been dumped by her boyfriend was sitting with me talking at my kitchen table.  At the same time, she and her recent ex were texting one another long feeling messages. Feelings and blame, back and forth. Between all this texting I convinced her to stop.  Just tell him “I am not talking about this over a text” and stop responding. They are married now.

&amp;nbsp;

Let go of that fear that you will lose him, you be the one who is easy to lose. Save the deep feeling conversations for in person or at the least over a phone call. A high value woman’s texting habits are flirting, light, fun or to say hey I am running late.

&amp;nbsp;

**Summary**

You see when you text with a man and it’s a good experience he craves more of the same. Less really is more. Ever had a guy that texts you and you just roll your eyes because he is so predictable?  Like the guy you aren’t that interested in but he texts you good morning and good night every single day. Don’t be like that guy. Maintaining high value texting habits will assure when a man sees it’s you texting, he will feel good.  Men fall in love with how you make them feel.",35624,7 Texting Habits of a High Value Woman,0,,,,1

""Marriage is a woman's grave"" is an old Japanese saying. 

The stats don't lie ladies. Get the marriage myth out of your heads. Getting married means you will do 100% of the emotional labor in your marriage, but get none in return. Oh you will listen to him bitch about his day, work etc, but when the time comes for him to meaningfully listen? Not gonna happen. 

You may not do 100% of the household labor, but you will 100% have to ""nag"" him, to ""remind"" him, and ""delegate"" stuff to him, and listen to the ""just tel me what you want me to do!"" spiel. This is called MENTAL LABOR...100% yours. 

You will get to listen to him whine about no sex, not enough sex, not the right kind of sex, nor not the right kind of response form you. Your sexual agency disappears. 

On top of this, you will be working a fulltime job hopefully. Because to make yourself dependent on a husband is suicidal. 

You will get to compete with porn or video games....and then have to pretend his limp dick is a thanksgiving turkey. 

Then when you get sick and need a partner....he is filled with resentment bc his dick isn't getting touched. Google the stats on what happens when wives get chronically sick. It's depressing. 

Of course, you don't HAVE to do any of things! And i hope you don't if you choose to get married. But be warned....if you don't do these things, then you will see what lousy partner he really is, and may conclude....why the fuck did I get married in the first place? 

Marriage benefits MEN only. It was to meant to upend the old polygamous regime and to ensure at least every man would have a slave/bangmaid. It was originally designed that way, and it is still that way.  Again, the stats prove that men benefit from marriage, and women suffer from it. 

There is lots of propaganda to get out of your brains. I've been married twice, and i will never get legally entangled again. It's not just a piece of paper, it's a fucking legal contract.

We had just started talking and I liked him as a friend so far. Not even a week into talking yet and he continuously asks these questions.

At first I thought it was a bit strange, but I answered them to the best of my ability because every person is different when it comes to the dating world. During the first day of me giving him my number (he messaged me on FB), he asked me if I was use to being flirted with. I am to an extent, but I’m only human so stuff might fly over my head. I told him this and we continued talking.

Over just a few days he continues to ask me if I understand that he’s flirting with me. I do, but I don’t have to respond with flirting if I don’t want to, right? I want to get to know him before all of that and if I don’t then it just feels awkward and forced. I am then told that I seem uninterested. 

Long, long, long story short, I felt like he was being needy and pushing towards liking him sooner than I would have naturally. I don’t like the feeling of being forced to think or feel something that isn’t really there. So, I put on my big girl pants and politely told him that I would like to just remain friends.

The dating world hasn’t treated me nicely. Before he messaged me, I was finally accepting the fact that I could be truly happy outside of a relationship. I still stand on my point that I do not want a relationship at any point right now.

This is my first time posting, so I apologize if it’s a bit all over the place.

I hope someone can take something from my experience and learn from it.

Don’t let people make you feel like you need to like them or be with them. Don’t allow yourself to force feelings that aren’t really there. My situation was very minor, but no matter what I told him, he continued to push.

My other friends are over an hour away and it takes a lot of planning to be able to meet up with them, and they are all very busy. So I am on my own pretty much all the time, except when at work.

I want to start dating again, even though I might not be completely ""ready"". I am pretty nervous about it, and I don't know how I'll ever psyche myself up to actually meet someone in person.

I feel that if I don't get back on the horse soon, I will just be sitting around forever, and not taking any action is only increasing my anxiety.

I actually had a night free but he was supposed to work late. He got off early and asked if I wanted to get dinner. I texted him FOUR MINUTES LATER and said yes but that I needed to shower and get ready. He said “when? If I get home I’m not leaving.” So I said, “I’m going to shower now”. He asked me to call him but I was already in the shower. I called him 8 minutes after he texted (I shower fast) and he called me and was like “I’m already home so I’m not leaving”. 

I got confused because he’s repeatedly expressed excitement about meeting and getting to know me, so the fact that he was so quick to write me off was disorienting. In the past, the pathetic pushover in me would have apologized profusely, begged him to change his mind, or offer to meet him at his house (which I already told him I don’t do on the first date). 

So I did what all of us Queens should do and said, “okay, goodnight” and hung up. Then I deleted him off the app, deleted him on WhatsApp and our text threads. The emotional people pleaser will want to text him and try and “understand what happened” but I know what happened. He disrespected me and I have nothing more to learn or gain from someone like that.

Should you avoid dating this guy? The signs will be there in the beginning. Namely

Narcissist is insecure, thinks the world revolves around them and lacks EMPATHY.

Signs of an insecure man is actually HARD TO SPOT. They’re like a chameleon. You need to be extremely discerning to pick up on a guy like this. But today I’m going to give you a HUGE PRO tip. The signs to watch out for AND how to “test” him to see what his true character is.

1. A sense of egotism. Watch out for the guy that boasts A LOT. This one is really tricky to spot. Yes he could be trying to impress you, but it’s also very likely he is extremely insecure.
2. A persistence to get their way. But this is very subtle and charming. Especially when you’re “unsure” or lack confidence in yourself. Is he regularly super insistent about what you should do, buy, eat, dress? Bad bad sign.
3. HATE being wrong. Eg. disagree with him about something on the first date and watch how he reacts? Does he subtly and charmingly try to manipulate your views so you “agree” with him? What if you stayed strong to your opinion or even flat out DISAGREED with him?
4. Bashes his ex or bashes any other singular or GROUP of people. Eg. calls his ex crazy, nuts, lazy, selfish, insecure, childish. Test him: ask him how he contributed to the end of that relationship? How did he contribute to being fired? How did he contribute to having money stolen from him? Can he hold any accountability for his actions? BIG ONE. Can he give specific details? Or is it something real general and generic. (NOTE: everything he complains about with his ex, will one day be the SAME complaint he has about you.)
5. He is 10x enthusiastic about you from the get-go. Talking to you for 8 hours a day. Spending all day and night with you after your first date. Moving in after a week.
6. He says ALL the right things. And you “want” to believe him - yet there is zero “long term” consistent proof of anything he’s promising you.
7. Lack of patience for your attention disguised as “care and concern”. Does he FREAK OUT if you don’t respond back when he wants you to? Test: don’t respond to him for one day and see how he reacts. Tell him you got busy, your phone died etc. I’m not for game playing, but this is one where you DO need to “test” him for.

The woman most susceptible to this kind of guy is a MASSIVE PEOPLE PLEASERS.

This is another reason why you should BANISH and STOP all people pleasing behaviours. It’s very low value behaviour, very fake AND you attract the most insecure, needy, narcissistic, emotionally abusive kind of men.

Be disagreeable, be yourself, stop people pleasing, and you will automatically spot this kind of guy so much faster.",12723,Signs You’re Dating A Narcissist On The First Date,0,1570158730.0,,,0

I just have an interesting question that I would like to hear your opinions and advice over because this question is constantly on my mind whenever I go on dates with guys but when do you feel is the right time to sleep with them or “go there”? I’m my situation I am not seeking hook ups or “casual fun” in anyway because I have found it’s not for me and I’m ultimately looking to eventually be in a relationship with the right person and I tell guys this straight off the bat before I even meet them. I also tell them I won’t be sleeping with them after the first date because I’m not the kind of person who just jumps in to bed with any guy who shows a bit of interest. The guys that are okay with this and want to proceed meeting me and continue on going on dates is fine but then if I don’t sleep with them after a few dates they do a slow fade and drop me even though I flat out told them at the beginning not to expect it for a while until I’m fully comfortable.

My issue is I don’t feel comfortable sleeping with guys after a couple of dates because in my eyes no matter how long our dates go and how much we’ve been talking they are still complete strangers to me. I’ve made shitty mistakes in the past of sleeping with dudes too soon after telling me that they are looking for a relationship and that they are serious about me only to find out 9 times out of 10 once the deed is done they slow fade me and tell me that they thought they were ready for a relationship and are only looking for something casual or they just complete ghost me lol.  And yes I know rookie mistakes I made! 

So with these things in my mind and reading a lot of dating forums I have read that most guys start pulling away after 3 or 4 dates if they ain’t getting any and will naturally assume I’m not interested or I’m a prude. So how long do you make them wait before going there?!",12586,When is the right time to sleep with him?,0,1570143110.0,,,0

I’ve been through a lot of painful shit these past 4 months, and these last couple of weeks have been the fucking worse....

I’m 27 and I met a guy on Tinder 4 months ago, who’s 59 and going on 60 in about 6 months. When I saw his Tinder profile he didn’t look 59 and he didn’t have his age displayed, he looked about 48 and now I realize the reason he didn’t really look his age is because he dyes his white beard. He has the facial folds of a man in his late 50’s but the beard dying made him look younger.

After being single for almost 2 years, I was so desperate to have someone in my life. I have extremely low self esteem and I don’t think that I’m physically attractive, so because of this I have been settling for any man who would give me attention. I now realize that I am better off alone than getting involved with sick and depraved men like the one I met 4 months ago....

From the beginning there were a million red flags that I ignored with my rose colored glasses on. I knew this guy was a piece of shit but I still convinced myself that loving this frog would make him turn into a prince eventually. Boy was I wrong...

A month after we were dating he started sending me very explicit porn pictures of other non-white women at 2:00AM in the morning from his Tumblr account which is chock full of porn (even cuckold porn which I now know that he is really into because he is a fucking cuckold himself), and he was asking me if I wanted to dress like these women. He claimed that he did not have a fetish for non-white women but his Tumblr account and the fact that he showed me that he watches porn called Cockasian proved otherwise; when I came over to his house for the first time he showed me a porn disc that was in his DVD player that read “Cockasian” on the front of it. If someone has a sexual fixation for certain races and is looking at pornography of certain races then they have a fetish for that race, plan and simple. Especially since he began to say fetishizing words to me, saying that I’m his “black queen with the hot black pussy” like wtf. He always tries to convince me that he doesn’t have a fetish... He looks at Sports Illustrated magazines of non-white women so how the hell can he say that he doesn’t have a fetish?

He cranes his head in the direction to look at other women in the streets and then deny that he wasn’t looking. And he even told me that when he watches porn he looks at other women’s genitals in a “clinical way”. Like he’s a fucking gynecologist, what a stupid fucking excuse to look at porn. 

He’s told me that he thinks it’s okay to be sexually attracted to his friends. When I asked him what race were most of his friends he said that they were non-white because he was not attracted to white women. 

Just recently I got into his Tumblr porn account and I saw him subscribed to a lot of porn blogs, even cuckold porn blogs called “black dick in my white wife’s pussy” , “fuck my wife”, and he was even following shemale tranny porn and porn blogs showing black dicks. He even asked me two times could I let another man fuck me and I told him no because that’s disgusting and fucked up.

My stupid ass got pregnant by him in July and he didn’t want the baby because he hates children so I went to go get a medical abortion thinking that was best for the baby. The abortion seriously fucked me up mentally....I was 7 weeks pregnant and I saw the baby fall out of me in what looked like a clear water balloon....I saw that the baby was in my sanitary napkin when I went to the bathroom and that was one of the most extremely traumatizing experiences I have ever had in my life..I don’t feel the same after having that abortion....I really wish I would have kept my legs close and I wish I would have never met this man.

He is porn sick and he got pissed at me when I was telling him how him watching porn made me feel disgusted, and he angrily told me, “all men watch porn so get used to it. The purpose of watching porn is to indulge in the fantasy of being with someone else without actually being with someone else”.

I’ve been feeling like it is too late for me to not settle for less and get a decent man because I felt like a good man will see me as disgusting for being with this sorry excuse for a human being that I call my boyfriend. This is the most fucked up relationship I have ever been in and I felt like I would be a defeating my purpose for wanting a good man when I knew better to not get involved with this piece of shit.",12508,Is it too late to want respect and not settle for less?

I know that may not seem like a lot, but it is what it is. My latest relationship ended out of nowhere, with the guy rebounding THREE DAYS LATER and is now in a long term relationship with her (someone we both knew whom he complained about a lot). I have a lot of frustrations, but mostly I’m frustrated that the men I’ve encountered expect the women they’re with to support them in a high-pressure and time-consuming career. However, when I need/ask for the most basic support, it becomes an arduous task for them! I’m a conductor (former band director) and my LTR my first couple years of teaching was really unhealthy (later found out by working with my therapist that it was emotionally abusive). I almost didn’t apply to grad school because of this guy. Every single guy I’ve dated has been a musician in the profession, so understands the demands of hours of rehearsals, having to be at football or basketball games for a long time, the pressure of putting on concerts, but for some reason there’s this double standard for when they need support versus when I need support! 

I feel like I am a solid person that would make a great partner, but I’m not willing to compromise what I want for my career. Maybe I’m looking in the wrong places, but I’m frustrated at not even knowing where to start dating! I’m trying to avoid dating other musicians, but honestly it seems like those people have the most in common with me. Any advice is welcome.

I've personally been on dates with guys who turned out to be married, guys who turned out to have violent criminal histories, and one guy who actually raped me. I'm not looking for sympathy, but I do want to point out some tips for you beautiful ladies:

**- Stay talking on the app.** It's a common TRP strategy to get you off the app and onto a messenger (text, whatsapp, snap) ASAP so they can unmatch you and escalate things sexually very quickly without getting reported. Don't fall for it. Keep convos on the apps until you meet in person, maybe even longer.

**- Observe how he responds to boundaries.** I posted about this yesterday, but I told a guy on Tinder that I wouldn't be meeting him in person for the first time at his home because that's not safe, and he lost his shit. He accused me of disrespect, and called me almost 80 times from blocked and unblocked numbers, whinging that he wouldn't be ""disrespected by women anymore"". Obviously this is an extreme case, but look for hints that he isn't respecting your boundaries or feelings. Things like negging, too much sarcasm (you'll know it when you see it), calling you a prude, badgering you for responses or criticizing slow responses, etc. All red flags.

**- Trust your intuition.** Gavin De Becker, in his AMAZING book **""The Gift of Fear""** said,  “At core, men are afraid women will laugh at them, while at core, women are afraid men will kill them.” Your gut instinct is a phenomenally powerful tool, and if something seems ***off***, it probably is. If he wants to meet privately and pushes back against meeting in public, block him. If he is dodgy about answering personal questions or is giving inconsistent answers, block him. If he gives you sketchy social media (i.e. a Snapchat that was made that day), block him. If he doesn't want to give you his last name or other identifying information that would make you feel more comfortable, he's hiding something. The amount of guys that want to **have sex with you** but don't want you knowing **basic fucking information** is too damn high. I'm not saying ask for his social security number, but basic info (name, occupation, general location) should be obtained before getting physically or emotionally invested. If he acts like that's too much, it's because that motherfucker has a wife and kids.

**- Ask the hard questions.** If you're looking for a hookup/FWB situation, don't let him shame you into not asking the important questions. Things like when he was last tested, his philosophy on condoms (pro-tip: ALWAYS FUCKING USE CONDOMS), his personal sexual preferences... These are all things you **should ask** and he should be **happy to answer**. If he pushes back against condoms or bitches about them, bye Felicia.

 **- Follow common sense.** If he plies you with alcohol, pushes physical boundaries too quickly, makes sexist/racist/demeaning jokes, or otherwise makes you uncomfortable *in any way*, GTFO. I went on a date with a guy who seemed cool over text. We met at a bar and immediately, everything I said he would aggressively counter with *""Is it because I'm black?!""* I would ask him questions about himself and he would keep going back to ""Is it because I'm black? That's why you're asking about what I do for a living? Is that why you want to know what my hobbies are?"" It was a huge indicator to me that he had some latent aggression, and it made me super uncomfortable (plus, if I were racist, why would I be on a date *with a black guy?*) Thankfully one of my friends happened to be at the bar so I made an excuse to go talk to her and he left. I say all that to say, you don't owe anyone politeness. You don't need to stay in an uncomfortable situation because you don't want to *hurt someone's feelings.* You bet your ass 99% of guys wouldn't stick around if they were the ones being made to feel uncomfortable, and it's time we women stop putting ourselves at risk or staying in a shitty situation just out of guilt. 

Feel free to add any other ideas y'all have. I love this sub &lt;3",12261,PSA: Don't let a man shame you for doing your research,0,1570109978.0,,,0

1. Mediocre and avoids risks   (hello dating apps are virtually risk proof. Especially with “unmatching” features

2. Trapped by daily routine, gave up on goals. (Any guy that logs onto a dating app DAILY is trapped in a daily routine. C’mon ladies) 

3. Never faced bullies, avoids confrontation (this has GHOSTING written all over it) 

4. Rely on others to make decisions (probably a mamas boy if you dig deep enough to find out) my last tinder date flatout told me he was a manchild. 

5. Physically Weak (most men in dating apps are alcoholics and drug addicts and to me that = physically and mentally weak)

6. Friend zoned (their on the dating app and not with the woman of their dreams for a reason) 

7. Can’t say no or stand their ground. 

8. People make fun of them. 

9. Does nothing productive, throws potential out the window and chooses to be lazy. 

10. Make excuses 

11. No style, borderline slob 

12. No eye contact (I was on a date looking the man in the eyes the whole time and instead of taking it as me being present and respectful, he said I was giving him “sex eyes” 🤣😂🤣😂 that was a first)!

13. Not getting laid much (something 99% of men on dating apps complain about) 

14. Big Ego (🤢) 

15. Not a leader (why would a leader be on a dating app? He’s not!) 


It’s very clear to me that there are many alpha females looking for alpha males in the wrong place. 

Watch the video and tell me if you think you’ve come across some Beta Males trying to disguise themselves as Alpha Males. It’s very clear to me that I’ve come across many on dating apps.

Classic cheater who also sexually and emotionally abused me from time to time (though I didn't realize it was abuse while I was with him). After finally leaving him, I started dating again. I took about eight months to try to repair myself, but I ultimately still had low self-esteem and self-worth after all I had been through with my ex.

This reflected in my dating life. The last guy I dated was a prime example of what you don't do. I chased, I texted first, and I put him on a pedestal. I was his therapist and dotted on him. I treated him to outings. I did anything he wanted. I was down to hang out whenever he wanted, even it was a last minute date. I thought about him all the time. I was eager and tried very hard to please _him_ without expecting him to please me.

What ended up happening? 

Despite being the nice, considerate girl, I was slow faded after we had sex a couple times. That sucked and I was convinced it was me. I was convinced I was ugly. I wasn't attractive enough. There had to be something wrong with me physically, right? Why else would a man you treated well and did everything for walk out of your life? Sure, I had men at work hitting me up all the time. Yeah, a man on the street corner chased me down just to tell me I was beautiful. But if I was actually attractive, it didn't add up. 

That's when I found this sub. 

Instantly, I totally overhauled everything. Everything I'd been taught. Everything I thought was ""right"" was now turned on its head. I immediately got busy. I started up with my old hobbies I had relinquished after getting serious with my ex. I started salsa dancing again. I rekindled my love for French. I connected with friends I was isolated from in my relationship. I lived my life for me. 

What ended up happening? 

The same thing that always did. 

Men asked me out. 

Only this time, I changed the way I approached the men who asked me out. 

I wasn't always available. I didn't stop time and space to go out with them. If I had plans already? I stuck to them. If they asked me out at the last minute? I turned them down. If they wanted to see me then they needed to show me they planned our date in advance. My time is valuable. I would not be available _whenever_ for their convenience. 

Also, I didn't put them on a pedestal. These were _just_ men. They had proven nothing to me. Had they proven their value? Had they demonstrated their commitment to me? No, and I could easily live with or without them. I had my own life to live. My world no longer revolved around the men in my life. I was no longer interested in chasing because I could take them or leave them. 

Last, and most importantly, I valued myself. As I got out into the world more and did the things that once made happy again, I realized how valuable I was. I was smart, I was interesting, I was healthy, and I was kind. Before, with the last man I dated, I did not feel that was enough. I felt that despite all I had accomplished in my life, I was still lacking something. And what did I do? I compensated by chasing him and doting on him. Hoping that he would overlook the false deficiency I made up in my head. 

Now, I knew my worth. I knew how much of catch I was. Instead feeling lucky to have a man who had proven nothing to me, I now felt that a man would be lucky to have _me_. This subtle switch in a my frame a of mind made all the difference. I had upped my standards I knew all I brought to the table. What did he bring? And more importantly, how was he going to show it?

So thanks to everyone for this sub! Thanks for the advice and the amazing book recommendations. In just a couple months, so much has changed. I went from depressed and doubting my appearance/worth, to having two high-value men chasing after me.

We, as women, practice self-care in our appearance. We take meticulous care of our skin, hair, and bodies. We are careful about what we eat and we exercise regularly. Most of us have had skincare routines since we were in middle school. We have always managed to make time to take care of our appearance, even between our education, careers, and hobbies. That being said, at thirty and beyond all that hard work pays off big time for us.

&amp;#x200B;

[Women practice self-care at a young age.](https://i.redd.it/pn9krtm7vtp31.png)

**Males on the other hand?**

The average thirty-year-old male already has a receding hair line. His face has begun to bloat from the excessive alcohol usage and poor diet. A flat tire is already beginning to form around his mid-section. He has pre-mature wrinkles, sun damage, and uneven skin tone because he washes with Axe-3-In-1 Hair, Face, and Body Wash everyday and as never picked up a proper skincare product in his entire life. Throw in the erectile dysfunction from excessive pornography consumption throughout his youth?

Voilà, there you have it folks.

**The Male Wall.**

&amp;#x200B;

[Women are far more meticulous about caring for their bodies. ](https://i.redd.it/8g5x6k0yutp31.png)

Not only do men hit the wall, but they hit the wall *hard* and *fast* because they have done the absolute bare minimum to take care of themselves their entire lives. The female ""hitting-the-wall-at-thirty"" propaganda, on the other hand, is an absolute myth. It's a lie they propagate to comfort themselves about being turned down by that twenty-something-year-old woman that is way too good for him. ""*Someday she'll be thirty and no on will want her*,"" he says to comfort himself.

We all know that's complete bullshit.

Men will pursue a woman at any age. We need only to look to the older women in our lives to confirm this.

**The reason men who brigade this sub like regurgitate that false folklore is simple.**

1. They are low-value males.
2. They feel threatened.
3. They are offended and angry that you have standards. (Especially standards they cannot meet.)

Males that propagate this myth want to grind you down. They want to make you afraid. If you fear ""maxing out"" at thirty you're less likely to have high standards and present yourself as high-value woman. You'll be more anxious and insecure, and thus more likely to settle down (literally, settle) for a male that has nothing to offer. Why? Because you fear approaching this *mythical* wall. Take a closer look at the context in which these men bring up this argument.

*Example From a Previous Thread:*

* Woman discusses wanting men to pay for dinner.
* Male gets offended and threatened.
* Male tell her not to expect such treatment when she turns thirty.

Now let's *dissect* this interaction:

* Women sets out an expectation/standard for men in her life.
* Man reacts negatively because he is a low-value man who is threatened by a standard he cannot meet (monetary).
* He attempts to make her insecure to lower her standards.

[Low-value men \(aka losers\) become angry when you have high expectations.](https://i.redd.it/szc5g9ztutp31.png)

**Keep in mind that the men who propagate this myth are low-value.**

The type of men who brigade here (MGTOW, MensRights, Braincels) are low-value males. They have little to offer women and thus prey on women with low-self worth. They pursue women who have low-standards and little self-respect. By implying that you will become worthless ""post-wall"", they are attempting to make you feel low-value. (If you feel low value, you're less likely to hold men to high standards.) These men are both lazy and entitled. They feel they should be able to sack a woman without in any real effort or investment. *They don't want to have to prove they are worthy, likely because they are not.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Never abandon your standards, regardless of your age.**

Now that we've broken down this myth, remember never to abandon your standards. By internalizing this propaganda you will only put yourself a disadvantage. The moment you stop loving and respecting yourself (by seeing yourself as approaching or past the *mythical* wall), you become insecure, needy, and seek male validation. You don't want that! You must always remember your worth. The wall does not exist. You are a high value woman and your value is not tied to a number. You are allowed to have standards always.

Real men respect and want women with standards, boundaries, and self-respect.

My last bf commented on how I look good without make up and added, ""at least to him"". The next day I told him how cute his dad bod is and how I only dated super buff guys before. 

Don't take shit from men. Give it back to them with a smile on your face.

**Questioning your intelligence and emotional stability -** Also logical thinking, education and knowledge of certain issues, because they feel threatened by smarter and more educated women.

When a man implies you're not rational/intelligent enough, remind him of some stupid, irrational, emotional thing they did or said. When my of my exes implied women are the emotional gender, I reminded him of the time we nearly broke up and he started crying, thinking I will leave him. 

**Questioning your abilities** \- For example, men frequently questiioning driving skills of women despite being much more deadly on roads. This is one of my favourite statistics. Ratio of men vs women involved in deadly road accidents is 9:1. Men are wreckless drivers who project their own lack of driving skills into women, who are much more careful drivers by comparison.

**Questioning your sex life and relationships -** judging you for sexual past, because they doubt their own sexual prowess and penis size. It's best to keep them in mist regarding this. If you speak of your exes, never speak in things your bf would be interested to know (too graphic and too sexual topics such as partner count and penis sizes). You don't want to put those images in their head unless you really want to hurt them and evade answering any kind of.  Men ask these questions because they're silly sometimes and like hurting themselves, but lucky for them, you're smart and you know how to deal with this:

Speak only about *behaviours* of your exes that you would or wouldn't like to see in your current bf - ""oh my ex really knew how to listen to me. I love men who are good listeners"" and ""my ex was a dear, but such a slob. His dishes were always dirty, I hated his apartment"". This will guide your bf in the right direction. 

**Questioning your world/political views** \- This depends on the intention. If a man is really interested in let's say, your feminism, and wants to know why you're a feminist, tell him about it. If he's obviously being negative about it, give him a specific reason for why you're a feminist. My reason is ""because women didn't try to gang rape me when I was 13, men did"" and usually makes them shut the hell up. 

If he continues to push mgtow/right wing/anti female bullshit, I keep my smile on, block him on my phone and never see him again.

Left wing men aren't necessarily great either since they're defenders of porn and prostitution, but they're better choise to date and far more flexible. Studies show conservative men are, on average, less intelligent and more aggressive. Since I want only the best genetic material, I avoid right wing men and choose left wingers.",24336,5 Common ways men gaslight you,0,1572271512.0,,,0

Hey ladies, 

I’m going to start a series on ways to be aware and counteract some common tactics that redpillers use to try to manipulate women and share with you some of my experiences and basically things that I’ve tried and that have worked to either shame them for their behavior or ways that I’ve used their foolishness for my own benefit. 

I’m a huge advocate of women being aware of the existence of redpill subs. When a woman asks me for any kind of dating advice, I typically find a way to mention it, tell her about the tactics they commonly advocate and use to get women to sleep with them and to take advantage of women. For some, I show them redpill subs and links. Sometimes, they have a lightbulb alert where they recognize that some of the tactics have been used on them, some of the common RP phrases seem familiar, and they share how they were confused about their feelings and weren’t sure how to respond. 

Again, the advice given on this series is derived from a combination of experiences I’ve had dating some highly suspected RP men and just from the things that RP men on reddit and other forums list as their tactics. 

Let’s start with number 1:

**Negging**

- “You look good in this light”

“You’re pretty for a black/Asian/Hispanic/(insertanyminorityhere) girl”

“You have nice hair...is it real?”

“You have pretty eyes, are they colored contacts”

“Your hair is stunning, but your roots are showing”

“You’re not my type but I can see why some other dudes would be into you”

Basically, a neg is a backhanded compliment, and the aim is to knock off your self confidence/esteem and make you feel less attractive or less valuable, so that you might possibly give him a chance. Men know that they’re low value, and so for a lot of them, trying to convince a woman that she is low value, is the only way she would consider having sex with them. Or sometimes it’s used as a way to get the girl to be the one to try and prove herself to him. 

The most important thing about negs is that you can recognize them. This is because I know that not every woman is witty enough to think of the best comeback on the spot. And so even though a comeback would be the best response, every neg might be slightly different and the context in which it’s said might be different. 

If you’re not the witty type, once you recognize that you’re being negged, the best thing to do is to say nothing while staring at him for a few seconds, smile and then walk away. It sounds simple, but since the goal of him negging you was to make you kinda insecure to the point where you accommodate him, acknowledging his neg and then walking away would make his attempt unsuccessful. 

If you are the witty type or you do want to say something and can’t think of anything else in that moment, a guy’s height is always a good never-fail target. Men get very insecure about their height. Making any comments about it, will drop their self confidence down a peg and have him try to prove to you that despite his height, he still has some kind of value. Even if he’s already a tall guy, making a comment about how your ex was taller, would knock down a few layers of confidence that he may have been deriving from being relatively tall in the first place. 

Here are some other examples of ones I’ve personally used:

“Your short height is so cute!”

“You’re wearing that? You must be confident in your masculinity”

“That’s a great story, would probably be funny if you told it better” 

“Oh” accompanied by a slight sad face/frown after he pulled down his pants right before sex. And then say nothing’s wrong when he asks. 

“Your hair is cute, I didn’t know men wore haircuts like that”

“I don’t usually date short guys, but for you I’m considering it” 

“I love that shirt. It hides your belly very well” 

“You’re cute but I bet a beard would make you look more like a man”

...stuff like that. Feel free to adopt any of these into your arsenal for whenever you’re being negged by a guy. 

Also, don’t listen to the men that’ll tell you that negging doesn’t work on guys. It’s a lie that’s designed to fool women so that male manipulative tactics have a better chance of working. A lot of men are dumb and very easy to manipulate. They’re very dependent on their self confidence and any hint or suggestion that they may not be as good as they think they are, ultimately makes them start trying to qualify themselves to you. Sort of as an attempt to prove you wrong. Use this to your advantage. 

Your seemingly unimpressed attitude will draw him in and this hot guy who had projected confidence would become putty in your hands. Works for me and I know it’ll work for you too.

Hey ladies, 

I’m going to start a series on ways to be aware and counteract some common tactics that redpillers use to try to manipulate women and share with you some of my experiences and basically things that I’ve tried and that have worked to either shame them for their behavior or ways that I’ve used their foolishness for my own benefit. 

I’m a huge advocate of women being aware of the existence of redpill subs. When a woman asks me for any kind of dating advice, I typically find a way to mention it, tell her about the tactics they commonly advocate and use to get women to sleep with them and to take advantage of women. For some, I show them redpill subs and links. Sometimes, they have a lightbulb alert where they recognize that some of the tactics have been used on them, some of the common RP phrases seem familiar, and they share how they were confused about their feelings and weren’t sure how to respond. 

Again, the advice given on this series is derived from a combination of experiences I’ve had dating some highly suspected RP men and just from the things that RP men on reddit and other forums list as their tactics. 

Let’s start with number 1:

**Negging**

“You look good in this light”
“You’re pretty for a black/Asian/Hispanic/(insertanyminorityhere) girl 
“You have nice hair...is it real?”
“You have pretty eyes, are they colored contacts”
“Your hair is stunning, but your roots are showing”
“You’re not my type but I can see why some other dudes would be into you”

Basically, a neg is a backhanded compliment, and the aim is to knock off your self confidence/esteem and make you feel less attractive or less valuable, so that you might possibly give him a chance. Men know that they’re low value, and so for a lot of them, trying to convince a woman that she is low value, is the only way she would consider having sex with them. Or sometimes it’s used as a way to get the girl to be the one to try and prove herself to him. 

The most important thing about negs is that you can recognize them. This is because I know that not every woman is witty enough to think of the best comeback on the spot. And so even though a comeback would be the best response, every neg might be slightly different and the context in which it’s said might be different.

We desire the same love and affection in which that the majority of us, who are genuinely good people, and make great partners, will try so dearly and go out of our way to provide to you.

When I first took a look at this subreddit, in honesty, I was genuinely disappointed. 

Many women preach about how they just want a good guy to love and comfort them, but don’t seem to realize that they would have this if more of you would give your attention to the men who aren’t always striving to try and look popular or cool or whatever. I think that this is largely the reason that many of you women whom I have seen posting on this subreddit seem to be exclaiming that you can’t find a single good man, or that we are all terrible but this is entirely untrue.

Do you really believe that you deserve to have a man in your life who provides these things that you all say you want in a man, like support, maturity, love, respect, compassion, the list goes on. Do you really believe that you deserve those things when you guys are on this subreddit talking to each other about how you don’t even give men chances, even if there are zero “red flags” about the men who are simply wanting to get to know YOU, not as an object or anything like I’ve seen some people describe that you believe men treat you as, but as a real person, who that man is attracted to, and wants to get to know?

Seriously, ladies. I saw some things that caught my eye in this subreddit, primarily the sexism.

I’ve noticed that many of you women on this subreddit, whether intentional or not, whether you can admit to it or not, are being extremely sexist. I say this because I saw several things right when first discovering this subreddit which caught my eye. For example, I saw a “Dating Strategy” that said “How to never, EVER pay for dinner” and you see, this really caught my eye, and really disappointed me, because that would mean that you women are preaching about gender equality, and most men support you entirely, but you guys still choose to make choices like that dating strategy which go completely against gender equality.

Hear me out on this, if men and women are completely equal, then what makes you think you should not ever even help out to pay the bill for dinner, just because that is supposed to be “Society’s norm”? 

I think that the best advice I could give you women, coming from a male, is that you need to show the respect, love, and passion towards the men you are attracted to just as much as the good men go out of their way to show to you. Also that, ladies in this subreddit whom have made posts about how you think all men are evil, or you cannot find any man who will simply show you the respect that you want, or “deserve” then you should try giving the men who genuinely just want to get to know you for you a chance, and also maybe check yourself, and think about your values and your possible subconscious, or unintended inequalities towards your male counterparts, and maybe try something different.


Now I am most definitely not saying that most females are sexist towards men, or don’t give them the respect in which that they themselves desire, but just that, for those of you who may think this way, even just a little bit, maybe try something new, shoot your shot, talk to the guys who are less of social-butterflies, I bet it can help you find what you’re looking for.



Thanks for reading, by the way.


Also, I only chose to make this post because I recently got into a relationship with the girl who I’ve been crushing on and wanting to talk to for months, and everything is going amazing. Why? It is because when I just poured my heart out to this girl, she gave me a chance, was honest about herself, and gave me her heart just the same, and that only happened because she was willing to give the guy who was more introverted, much less of a popular person, or social butterfly, a chance. 


Be safe, and please, once more, be open-minded and respectful towards us men. We might try to look tough or a certain way, but truthfully, almost all of us have just buried our emotions and are big softies desperate for a loving relationship with somebody who actually understands and cares about their feelings.",23683,"I’m not female, but this seems like a good subreddit for me to talk about this.

He got mad that I dare to tell him he's not supposed to watch this kind of stuff. He told me he has a shit filter and watching won't affect him and he can watch different points of view and pick what's his opinion. 
I asked when was the last time he watched something  with different point of view ( something saying that women are not evil)
But I knew the answer. 
My boyfriend is rather conservative, I often lecture him about things related to women and other races/genders. 
I said I can't be dating someone who agrees with this kind of opinion. He agreed and told me we should break up. (We've been dating for 2,5y and moved in together recently)

In terms of dating, not having a strong base/ friend group/home/family makes me live bait for predators (narcissist in particular).

It's a place where we can talk about dating strategies, support each other in our own dating journeys, and to have a sisterhood to lean on. For those who don't know what Discord is, it's currently the best chatting platform on the internet to connect with your friends. You can safely and easily download the app on your phone and/or laptop! **I highly recommend joining this community so you can have instant access to chatting with like-minded gals who can guide and inspire you. It's a moid-free space.** 

Here's the link: [https://discord.gg/awCFKgw](https://discord.gg/awCFKgw)

In order to get verified and let into this server, **firstly,** please answer the following questions and message them to me on Discord (not on Reddit). Be as detailed as you want.   

1. What's your age and location?   
2. What are your current goals with men and dating?    
3. What are you currently doing to improve yourself (or what you're planning to do)?    
4. What lessons on dating and men have you recently learned?    
5. What's your Reddit username?  

**Secondly**, you have two options to verify that you are indeed a woman. We do this to avoid moids in our server. 

**The first option:** Send a selfie of you holding up a paper that has your Discord username on it.     
**The second option:** Record yourself reading out loud the answers to the 5 questions above on vocaroo.com and then send the link to me. Note that [vocaroo.com](https://vocaroo.com) only allows recording on laptops and PCs, not on mobile.

Lie, say you're not a big drinker, say you're on antibiotics, say you have a hangover from lastnight, say your dad died from alcohol poisoning (ok maybe not the last one). 

If he springs it on you or something with 'I know this great bar!', say *'Oooh you know what I'm kinda hungry and I need to line my stomache first',I know this great place..'*.

They’ll misbehave and overstep their boundaries from time to time, but they can be trained. I have a few ideas of an appropriate punishment for a man if he is to disobey.

1. Squirt Bottle


Now this is a classic method to control an animal, and it unsurprisingly works on men too (since men are animals). Fill a squirt bottle with warm water, and anytime your man says something you don’t like, spray his face. For extra punishment, mix in some hot sauce in the spray can as well so that it burns when squirted on their eyes. Remember, if he fights back after being squirted, he committed assault, and you can get him thrown in jail for years. It’s a flawless strategy.


2. Threaten To Accuse Him Of Rape


Anytime your man says or does something you don’t like, scare him with accusations of rape. You have the power to get him thrown in jail for life, so why not use that power to your advantage. 

3. Whip Him


Now this strategy of punishment is more expensive, so I’d recommend forcing your man to pay for it. Get him to buy a whip, so that anytime he misbehaves, you can whip him. If he refuses, threaten false rape accusations on him. If he fights back, that’s assault. Truly a flawless way to punish a man. Make sure to whip the same spot if giving multiple lashes to leave a permanent scar to remind your man what happens if he disobeys.



Please give your own strategies to punish men in the comments, and like this post if it helped. If none of these work, you could always bite his dick while giving head which has worked for me before. Thank you for reading.",22618,How To Punish Your Man,0,1572213653.0,,,0

In the nearly two decades that this has been happening to me absolutely no one has ever allowed me to talk about it without getting angry or acting like I'm making it up.  As a result I have been entirely alone with this painful experience.  I almost started hanging out at RPW because I thought they were the only ones who would accept what I have to say, but I felt like I couldn't hack it with a lot of their practices.

It seems that I am attractive enough to use for sex, but too ugly to have a relationship with the men that I feel are on my level.

This brings up the question of whether I am wrong about my value and who is my equal match.  I'm genuinely not trying to punch above my weight, I truly want an equal.  But there aren't a lot of men who feel like they are on my level -- it's mostly boring, barely-employed, unattractive guys and maybe a few good-looking successful ones whom I almost never approach -- but when I find someone who I think is compatible with me he wants nothing to do with me.

So I must be wrong about myself, which considering that I am pursuing men will primarily mean that I am wrong about my appearance.  I've lived a very confusing life about where I stand in this regard.  The first experiences I had with men consisted of being used for sex and then having them make fun of my body/weight behind my back and refuse to acknowledge me when they saw me in person.  The confusing thing was that they would say both good and bad things about my appearance.  It was once reported to me by a guy that another guy had said about me ""she's hot"" and then in the same conversation made fun of me by placing his hands over his face and pushing on his cheeks to make them look fat, and then pantomiming giving a blow job.  (I wasn't even that fat I just wasn't stick thin like a lot of teenage girls.) 
 Anyone who hears me talk about this will say ""I'm so sorry that happened to you"" but I'm not sorry and I'm actually glad for it.  It's the only honesty I got in a situation that was clearly happening to me but no one would have admitted it if I had said something out loud, and if I had tried to discuss it with other people in my life I would have been treated like I was crazy and that it was my fault for being ""underconfident.""

This has happened to me in many different environments and in different cities.  A few years after the above incident, I moved to the city and thought I would finally have a normal pool of people in which to find my match.  I met a man on OkCupid (I was 21 and he was 30, if it matters) and he strung me along a lot and felt very manipulative even though I can't exactly name for you what he did wrong.  Anyway, there was one time, months later, when he came to the bar I was working at and I spoke to him for a few minutes even though we were not involved at that time.  A girl I worked with said to me, ""Is that your boyfriend?"" and I said no, and she said, ""Oh, because he looks like your boyfriend.""  How much above my own value could I be aiming if other people can see it too?  And yet, he didn't want me.

To be clear, I don't work at a bar now, and didn't work at one for very long, and even when I did I was also doing an unpaid internship.  I have a bachelor's degree and currently do office work (I don't want to give too many details here but I make more money than the majority of men I have managed to get dates with in the past couple of years).  I go to the gym 3-4 times per week and when I do I wear nicer, form-fitting workout clothes.  I'm currently 5'3"" 130 lbs.  A few years ago I was 118-120 lbs and I don't know that my experience was any better.  Maybe I have to be 110 lbs or less in order to be dateable?

I receive such confusing feedback.  Men my age think I'm too fat to date but I constantly receive comments from female coworkers about how skinny they think I am.  Even gay men tell me how cute they think I am and I even had one gay guy get absolutely furious that I did not want to hang out and ""be seen"" with him.  If I try to talk to anyone about this -- therapists, my mother, acquaintances, strangers on advice forums -- they act like I'm making it up, get angry, or cry like I hurt THEIR feelings about it.  That reaction weighs on me far more than one man's lack of interest.

I moved to a different city, which I am living in currently, and it's no different.  I don't like to do the pursuing for reasons that I know this forum understands, but in spite of that I recently have tried to softly initiate with a few men.  There was a man I introduced myself to about a year ago because we used to work at the same organization.  A month or two ago I was at a bar in my neighborhood and saw him working there.  Initially, he approached me by asking whether I worked at that organization and showing that he remembered me.  We talked about how his band was playing at that same bar the next day so I attended the show.  When I was walking in I walked by him and did not even see him there, but he greeted me, by name.  The next day I followed his bands Instagram and sent a quick message to say I liked the show.  He wrote back.  I then asked if he was going to another show the next day.  He said no.  I haven't heard from him again.

I know we could talk about whether I came on too strong.  But I also get criticism for not being open enough and for seeming like I don't want to talk to anyone.  My own father criticizes me for ""sitting there with a frown on [my] face"" and is convinced that the only reason I don't have a partner is because I have a bad attitude.  I made myself available to this guy, he knows where to contact me, and yet, he does not.  (I'm tired of the criticism of technology because it really could not be easier for him to contact me.  Do people really expect me to believe that it would be considered LESS demanding if he had to pick up the phone and make a call?  Texting is the least demanding thing.)

If he was interested, it wouldn't matter if I came on too strong or too weak or if I didn't do something perfectly.  When we want men to leave us alone, they won't even if we beg them!  If he didn't talk to me it's because he didn't want to, plain and simple.

The only approaches I ever get are from men who are wildly inappropriate for me.  Men who are 20 years older than me.  Men who are 10 years younger than me.  Men who can't dress themselves, who don't brush their teeth or wash their hands.  Men whom I have nothing in common with and erase everything I care about when they fill space by talking to me about nothing.  It makes me feel dirtied, like after all my hard work and depth and feeling I should give it up to any idiot that asks.  It feels polluting even when I'm not reproducing their genes.  If I also received a decent approach some of the time I might not feel that way but at this point I feel like a well-kept garbage receptacle.  Like if you raised and slaughtered an animal in order to eat it and instead of eating it you just gave it to the rodents.  This is what my family wishes for me, too.  Sometimes I think that this is what nature wishes for me, and why doesn't mother earth love me very much?  Because we are whole, just like nature, and they are not.  But here I am at the exact point of ""sex object,"" no more and no less either.

I usually don't do this, but I once swiped right on a man who was out of my league after seeing him on dating websites for like a year.  He asked me out, and on the date we talked all night.  After we finished our drinks I very well expected him to go right home and not be interested in meeting again.  But he asked me to continue on to a second bar.  He specifically said that he wanted to keep talking because he thought I was interesting.  That seems like a euphemism but he also chose to share with me that he liked my facial features and we had a conversation about how people have a facial ""type.""  After the date he told me that he was not interested in hanging out again.  Actually, there was a second guy after him who did the same thing, asking me to a second bar and not wanting to go out again.  Sure, maybe I end up doing something wrong at the second bar, but there have been plenty of people who bailed on me before they even got to the bar at all.  When I told my therapist about it she said ""maybe he just likes to go on dates with interesting women.""  Yeah right.  Why does she have to treat me like a fool?  The ""with you"" is silent and I can't have a productive conversation with someone who won't acknowledge that.

I see couples around and they ""look like a couple.""  And I think, where is my match?  And then I remember all the times in my life I have attempted to talk about this with people who were supposed to be on my side or who were supposed to be neutral, and they shut me down every time.  That's really the worst part.  Sometimes I just want to talk about my feelings, and sometimes I want to work through it and try to see if there are any solutions that I am missing.  But I am disallowed.  I'm not sure if that's because they know deep down that I am undesirable and don't want to admit it, or if they think I'm crazy, or what it is.  But it has been extremely isolating and fraught.  So, thank you for listening.",32179,My type is never interested in me,0,1572935276.0,,,1

So many of us have our shit together in this subreddit. I know when I was husband hunting I was in graduate school, absolutely killing it in my career, working out all the time, making loads of connections with friends, and doing pretty much what I damned well pleased.  My apartment was kept as an extension of me: always meticulously kept clean and I was always making something in it whether it be food or crafts or art. 

All of this moving and doing and creating, however, takes a ton of energy.  Dating coaches will sometimes call this energy “masculine” energy. This is what kicks in when you need to nail that job interview or you need to run five errands and pick up groceries. High value women are experts at wielding this kind of energy (it’s how you make $$)... but they also realize that this energy is not what lands you a high value man.  

When was the last time you just allowed yourself to receive a compliment or a gift?  Did you get pampered by a date lately?  Did you purchase a massage?  What about walking or hiking and just taking it all in? Travel somewhere alone just to enjoy?  Received a compliment and didn’t try to justify it?   This is what some dating coaches call “feminine energy.”  It doesn’t really have to do with traditional feminine behaviors at all: if refers to a more passive energy where you *receive* others’ “doing” or “masculine” energy. 

You can’t bulldoze your way into finding the perfect partner. Going out there and throwing everything you’ve got at a man will only attract the helpless ones who need mothers: you’re going to end up attracting a project. Projects are for work :)

Showing appreciation and joy when a man goes out of his way to care for you can be super powerful, and high value men are instinctively attracted to a woman who exudes confidence and can balance the “doing” with the “receiving”    

Letting go, giving up control and choosing not to push and move towards a specific outcome with a specific man will do wonders for your mental health, confidence, and you’ll exude that receptive energy that high value men desire. Just BE.  Finding solace and joy in the present, no matter what life throws at you, is an extremely attractive trait in a woman.",32157,Receiving Energy,0,1572926419.0,,,1

My friend told me she was impressed by her date because, “He didn’t play on his phone during the date,” and “paid attention” to her.

Um.

That is behavior that should be _expected_—a given, a no brainer! The fact that a man has basic manners and treats you like a human being should not impress you! You should automatically expect that out of him, and if he doesn’t extend basic decency and respect to you, you should get up and leave.

The next time you find yourself “impressed” by a man’s behavior, evaluate whether it was _actually_ impressive (i.e. he did something extremely chivalrous and is going above and beyond to court you) OR if it’s just that your expectations and standards are just extremely low.

Now, I understand. Many women’s expectations have been literally beaten into the ground by their past relationships, but honies, its time to raise the bar. The fact that homeboy, a fully grown adult male, can do his own laundry, should not have you swooning.

&amp;nbsp;

It took a few session because I wanted to afford my ex the benefit of the doubt and let the therapist get as much of both sides as possible and there was so much to uncover. I had him read through all the text messages and skype messages before giving my side of the story and then showing him the break up conversations and post break up behaviors.

&amp;nbsp;

I did this because I know that I am not perfect and I have my own issues and my ex tried quite hard to through it in my face that I was breaking up with him not because of anything he had done, but because I was cruel, unsympathetic, had a personality disorder, intimacy issues due to past trauma, etc. Some of the stuff he said I knew to be true, and some of it I simply feared to be true, but I felt that he was using these ""truths"" to make me question the reality that he was abusive.

&amp;nbsp;

But still the ""what if I was the abusive one"" thought kept coming back to me. So I saw the therapist with the plan to also see a therapist that didn't specialize in men's issues for balance, and it was the best thing I could have done for myself.  

&amp;nbsp;

He reassured me that the behavior was abusive and 100% not okay and then helped me to sift through the truths of what my ex said, as well as the truths I learned about myself on my own. He then helped me to realize how my ex identified my weaknesses (the truths) and used them to manipulate me and guilt me and question my own reality. The focus of my therapy now is dealing with those truths.


&amp;nbsp;

I really think that if you are actively dating and have bad experiences with men it would be so helpful to see a therapist to keep your own issues from messing with a good thing and, conversely, to keep your own issues from making you forget your worth and settle for a very bad thing.",32142,"I went to a ""men's issues"" therapist to get perspective on a relationship I had with a RP type.

So heads up if you are single and on your way to Hawaii or Cancun or whatever tropical resort surf town you can think of for vacation, but this is a quite specific Hawaii type situation.

I just got back from Lahui and I had heard of this type of thing but hadnt experienced it myself. This is common in Honolulu. Homeless ""surfer dude"" scrubs targeting single women staying at resorts. There is an entire sub-culture of these guys in Hawaii. They are homeless, live on the beach or wherever they can pitch a tent and cruise for single female tourists. He's usually a ""surf instructor"" offering surf lessons and trying to ""hook up"" and score a free place to stay for a week or two.

I was getting take out for lunch when a cute tan surfer type started chatting me up. He was charming and freindly, no red flags, just very chatty, so I engaged with him. His story was he worked at the surf shack beside the resort I was staying at. Could be true, probably was, but the rest of his story was a tad suspect. He stated that he lived in a beautiful big house overlooking the ocean that his parents had bought back in the day and had gifted to him and his brother so he was set for life and just enjoyed giving surf lessons and living the dream. Ok, cool, great life if you can get it. I didn't think much of it but then my spidey senses started tingling.

He quickly asked me if I was staying at the resort, if I had an ocean view room, if I hung out at the pool and just ""charged my food and drinks to my room"" (weird question), how expensive it was for the night, and how long I was staying etc. He gathered all this info pretty quickly and talked non stop while following me down the beach. He constantly talked about his laid back lifestyle and his big house while peppering me with questions. I couldnt get a take on what was bothering me about this guy, he was friendly enough, but then it dawned on me, the story I had heard about these homeless guys hooking up with tourists for a week or two and crashing with them in their hotel rooms. Sex and romance in exchange for a free stay in the resort, shes none the wiser, thinks shes having a fling with a sexy surfer dude but actually harbouring a homeless scrub. Usually he has some excuse regarding why you cant go to his place, he has roommates, its under renos, family in town, whatever, so you have to hang at the resort when u see each other. Next thing you know, hes moved in, with only his board shorts and flip flops.

I let this guy continue on with his spiel, he wanted to hang out with me, followed me around, was very ""helpful"" showing me the area, offered to take me to some secluded beach somewhere, etc etc. It started to become kind of obvious that this guy was a hustler. I couldn't politely shake him so I finally told him i had to go and made a random excuse. He asked if I would meet up w him later and I agreed just to get rid of him, but i had no intention of meeting up w him again and blew him off.

Beware ladies, there are more and more of these guys out there everyday. No big deal if you are down for some holiday fun with a homeless dude but if you think this is just an innocent fling, beware, he just might be hustling you for a bed and a hot shower.

Scrubs are plague in Hawaii. Homeless men are everywhere, especially Honolulu, most of them are are busted up old addicts but others may look young and sexy but they are grifters.

Logically I know I just need to let it go. And I’m somewhat embarrassed to admit to my relationship advice friend how I’m still hung up on how this guy hasn’t texted, so here I am.  

So last time this guy and I went on a date and I slept over, I told him, in the morning, I was moving out of town. I couldn’t bring myself to tell him it was happening very soon for some reason. Couple days later I told him I was very stressed the day before and the same day of the texts and wanted wine, which is what the edit out pictures are of. He went out with friends and I was doing my own thing too and I was fine with him doing his own thing until he was not responding to my texts in a timely matter, which he always does (plus at the end I was pretty intoxicated). We have been casually dating for 7 weeks now and I am seeing another person and I was suppose to be moving anyway (which long story I’m not).  

I probably just have a bruised ego from him not reaching out further because what does it matter to him now that I’m leaving and can’t give him anything (sex, attention) now. I knew I was getting too attached to him even though I know he is not someone I’d want to be in a relationship with. I think I was a bit irrational and I’d like it to have ended it better. Maybe I just miss the attention that he would shower on me. I know I am higher maintenance than he is use to.

Who the fuck decided men “need” to watch porn?  Who decided women should have to go Dutch otherwise we’re not “true feminists”? 

&amp;nbsp;

I’ll tell you the secret: A bunch of men pulled this shit completely out of their ass, stated it as fact, and acted entitled AF until they can bully enough women into agreeing to this nonsense. They present it as reasonable and logical and/or use fear and dread tactics all day. This is all men have, because most of them struggle to entice women on their own merits. MEN RELY ON FEAR TACTICS AND SLIGHT OF HAND TO FORCE WOMEN INTO COMPLIANCE. 

&amp;nbsp;

Men really have a lot of you trained to always think about what they think they’re “owed”. You’re scared to ask a man to pay for a date because then he feels like he’s “owed” sex. SO FUCKING WHAT?

&amp;nbsp;

YOU do NOT owe a man JACK SHIT!

&amp;nbsp;

Men think their entitled to sex after 3 dates but don’t think you’re entitled to a text back the next day, and definitely not a relationship. Why? They prioritize and legitimize their wants, desires, and needs above all else and do not give a single solitary shit about what women think they’re owed. 


&amp;nbsp;

Until you break out of seeing yourself through the male gaze and male wants and needs you will **NEVER** be happy. 
They continuously push the needle in their direction while women are still out here running in circles worried about “equality”. Please. 


&amp;nbsp;

So As long as men are creating bullshit expectations about what they’re “owed”, why not create your own?  

&amp;nbsp;

I think I’m owed $200 dinner dates and paid vacation weekends. Fuck it, I think I’m owed a giraffe. Pick what you want and *assume* you are entitled to that and STAY on your script!

I've seen quite a few women on this sub write in the commends that they don't want kids. I also don't want kids, ever.

Over the last year I've grown a lot and figured out a lot of mistakes I was making in relationships. I know that I don't need a relationship to be happy and can hold out for a person who meets my standards. But...

My decision not to be a mother makes having a true abundance mentality hard. A lot of guys who don't want kids are weird (not in an interesting way), often desperate, or not attractive. They just don't care about anything. The attractive ones are fuck boys and don't want kids OR a relationship.

The guys who are attractive and motivated and interested in relationships tend to want kids. I'm confused whether I should be looking for guys who don't want kids and pick the high-quality ones, or look for high-quality guys and pick the ones who don't want kids.

I also have no idea when I should bring up that I don't want kids, or how. Bringing it up right away smacks of desperation to me. Waiting too long to bring it up is a waste of time.

I think what I'm looking for is an approach that optimizes finding high-quality men and weeding out the ones who are waiting for me to get baby rabies, so I can have real options instead of crushing on one childfree guy every 4 years who happens to have a job. Also, in cultivating that queen mentality when I've made a decision that seriously limits my dating options.

Has anyone else dealt with this problem? What other pieces of advice do you have for someone in my position? Thanks.",32040,Female Dating Strategy for women who don't want kids,0,1572905719.0,,,1

This is an account of 4 year relationship between my friend and her neighbourhood boyfriend. 

They lived in the same building, same floor, got closer and that's how the relationship began. 

He has 3 brothers, no sister and his father is a cop. Not to mention his friends are of dubious morality. 

-He called her every 5 minutes!

-She went to other town for her studies so he traveled with her to drop her off and to take her back home. 

- **Obsessive and restrictive** She had to call him and tell whatever he wanted to know. Plus, she didn't have freedom to wear clothes of her liking. 

-We (me and my friend) went out to have some snacks and he freaking wanted her to make a video call in the middle of the crossroad! 

-Didn't trust her *at all*

I told her to break up with him but he was blackmailing her with pics of them. She hadn't told her parents about the relationship. 

**TRIGGER WARNING** Assault and violence

He hit her head on the door when she said NO for sex. 
He forced himself on her and damaged her down there, she was bleeding badly because he injured her with his nails. Yet she couldn't do anything because of his father's connections. 

Next, when she got a fiancé, he called him and told about their relationship and was asking her fiancé for money her spent on her during the courtship. 

Her family ultimately had to leave their house and flee because he was torturing her. 

Have a look at his friends/ connections as well ladies.

Women are so naturally empathetic and understanding, so we’ve been conditioned to look past or excuse away bad behaviors because we want to see the best in people, want to “save” men from themselves, and think that if we rescue him, he will love us. Nah, sis. Fucking stop that. 

**Here are the most common excuses I see and how to confront them:** 

**“He has trust issues because he’s been cheated on before!” or “He’s emotionally unavailable because he’s been hurt by his ex” -** Yeah, that’s rough. But honestly, who hasn’t? If he is using that as an excuse to put up walls or not commit to you, that’s not your problem. You didn’t cheat on him. If he’s not in a place to trust or work through these issues, wtf is he doing wasting your time? Why is he on OLD apps? He just wants his needs met without doing the work to address his trust issues and that’s not your problem. Plus trust issues can only be resolved from within. You’ll never “prove” yourself to someone who is determined not to trust. **If he can't trust, why is he wasting your time???**

**“But he has anxiety/depression/PTSD!” -** Yeahhhh but who doesn’t these days? Using mental health as an excuse in relationships means you’re **NOT READY FOR  RELATIONSHIPS. PERIOD**. If their social anxiety prevents them from being there for their partner or if their depression is keeping them from being a *good* partner, they need to **WORK ON THEIR MENTAL HEALTH**. Putting that on the person you’re dating, especially in new relationships, is toxic as fuck and should tell you that they will always put their mental health on you. When people mention in their OLD profile or within the first few days that they have unmanaged mental health, run the opposite direction. Listen, I have anxiety/depression/OCD/trauma, but I manage it through diet, medication, cognitive therapy, environmental management, and self-improvement. I do NOT make it my partner’s responsibility to manage my symptoms or make up for my lack of effort. Men are way way way more likely to do this than women, as men are taught to rely solely on their partner for their emotional needs instead of seeking out actual therapy, finding support among friends, or seeking medication. 

**“He had a difficult childhood! He was abused!” -** That wasn’t his fault, but healing is his responsibility. You are not his therapist, you are not his replacement mommy. You can’t undo his trauma, and if he’s using his childhood as an excuse to not do X or Y, he’s not ready for a relationship. Period.

**“He’s in a bad marriage, but he will leave her eventually” or “He’s in the middle of a divorce” -** Girl you’re stupid. Even if he is in the process of ending his marriage, why would you want to go all-in on someone who obviously has some shit to work through? Go find someone, you know, actually single. 

**“He’s between jobs/he keeps getting taken advantage of financially/he just needs money to get on his feet” -** UGH this one drives me crazy. As someone who has been financially taken advantage of by multiple men in the past, we always want to assume they’re working their hardest (like we are) and are just down on their luck. If he’s disclosing financial problems to you early in a relationship, that’s his homeostasis, girl. He is a permanent struggle, and will rely on you and take advantage of you as much as he can. No. Never, ever, ever loan or give money to a man, pay his bills, let him stay with you, etc. Fucking no.

**""If I just support him as he works on his career/gets through school, he will help me out later"" -** Nah, he will upgrade for a hotter, younger woman who isn't a doormat once he's successful. You should always be your #1 priority. 

**""He isn't texting me back/planning dates/making time for me because he's really busy right now"" -** Uhhh then why is he dating you? If his work is so busy that he doesn't have time to send you a text in the 24 hours we have in a day, why is he dating? Why are you entertaining this? Let him know to hit you up when he's ready for a relationship because that time is not now.

**""He yells/gets in my face/belittles me because that's how his mom/dad treated him"" -** Never, ever, ever, ever accept abuse. Ever. 

We women are completely responsible for our own mental health, and then take on the mental health of people who don't want to put in the work. This needs to stop. Yes you can grow together as people and as a couple, but that is not a replacement for his own self-improvement. And men who don't seek therapy or their own betterment will never do it for your relationship. If you won't change for yourself, you won't change for someone else.

Yes, he might love me now but what about a few months or years down the line, people change with the options they get, and who wants to settle for a man with no options? It would be a poor deal, and even in this circumstance he would eventually find a woman with low enough standards to fuck or exchange his partner with. So I am going to go for the best men possible and not settle because my faith will be the same just far worse when I make a poor choice. 

I still aim to marry and my loss of faith in the romantic utopia doesn't make me blind to the benefits of commitment and marriage or an advocate for open relationships.

Here's a copy of the post:

""

 **My (f30) husband (m34) is having an affair, and excuses it by saying “I would never fuck you the way I fuck her”.** 

&amp;#x200B;

 I’ve had suspicions about my husband’s fidelity but I always tried to tell myself I am being paranoid. But it was lingering in my mind for a while now. He will leave in the night or early morning, and if I ask where he is going he’ll tell me things like “mind your business” or “go back to sleep”. I didn’t want to be a jealous insecure woman and that’s what he made me felt like if I said anything.

But Thursday, his card statements came in the mail and I just decided to look. I thought what’s the harm in just seeing if there’s anything. But there were constant hotel charges, and even ones at a florist and jewelry store. I just didn’t want to lie to myself anymore and I really couldn’t, so I showed it to him when he came home from work. All I did was ask what it was and told him not to lie. He told me “I’ll tell you the truth if that’s what you want”. I nodded and he said he’s been seeing this woman for a little, he told me “it’s just sex, you know it’s different with you you’re my wife”. He told me he doesn’t love her, he only loves me. He said I am more beautiful. I asked him why he wants more than me and he told me “because I would never fuck you the way I fuck her”. I don’t really understand what he means but I am trying to imagine. I don’t know if it was meant to make me feel better, but I started to tear up. I just felt so defeated and all my energy was gone so I walked away from him. And I’ve been very distant since, I’ve been almost silent I’ve only said a few words.

He’s been trying to bribe me like I’m a child. Flowers and gifts. He’s already given me chocolate, wine, perfume, lotion, essential oils, and candles. just stupid things I like. And jewelry he gave me a very nice bracelet and a necklace I’ve been wanting for a while. It’s like it’s Valentine’s Day but we aren’t talking. He’s left them for me but I haven’t touched his gifts other than to see what it is, I don’t want them. He’s at least given me the space that I want, he doesn’t push me to speak to him and he’s not sleeping in our bedroom.

I feel sad but it’s a numb sadness. I am less emotional about it than I thought I would be. I feel more petty emotions than strong hurt or anger right now. What more could he want? I try to be perfect for him I don’t see where I’m lacking. What do his words mean? Is there any hope he’ll stop? I rely on financially, we have a son, and I still love him so it’s hard for me to imagine leaving. But should I? I just can’t think with any clarity on my own, my judgement is clouded. What do I need to do now?

Here's a copy of the post:

""

 **I'm \[34/m\] unhappy with my wife \[30/f\] who is lazy, fat and previously abusive. Since we got married I changed for the better and she changed for the worse. I want more kids but not with her.** 

 

My wife works 20 hours per week and spends about equal time playing video games. When we met and got married we were both playing video games in our spare time but that's not how I want to live anymore. Now I like to run, hike, camp, boat and go out. She recently had some health complications and is refusing to make changes to her diet/lifestyle to remedy this.

**Some background:**  
When we met four years ago I was running my own business and she was working full time later on we got married (have prenup) and my business took off around the time we had a kid. I worked my fucking ass off and eventually I sold it to another company and am able to live modestly for the rest of my life without working. I started playing a bunch of video games and my wife stopped working too to give birth. Postpartum hit and she went slightly bonkers, being verbally abusive to me, stopped doing all housework or looking for work, developed several online videogame friendships, and constantly asked for divorce. She complained about me being lazy (and to be fair I was being lazy but enjoying the life of early retirement) and she felt justified in her life style because I was doing the same thing. Except the difference is I worked my ass off to get here, where as she quit working to be there.

**Now:**  
I started another business, picked up a few new hobbies, lost a bunch of weight, and went back to school to finish my degree. She returned to work but only works 20 hours, still plays video games in her spare time and is doing the bare minimum of motherhood while our son goes to daycare. If she had her way he'd be in front of the TV while she played videogames but I had to fight to get her to not play videogames around him. She almost never reads to him and is content giving him the same sugary unhealthy diet she eats.

**Future:**  
I'm 34 and I want more kids but I sure as hell don't want more kids with her. I also am worried of her getting even more lazy as my business/income grows, or having some kind of claim to profits of this new business as I started it during the marriage so it doesn't fall under a prenup. I'm actually at a point right now where I can still find someone else willing to settle down and have more kids. In another five years the pool of eligible partners decreases and I begin to incur birth complication factors associated with old age. I love my son and my wife is nice to me (unlike before) but I don't feel comfortable fathering kids to a lazy woman.

**TL;DR:** Wife is fat, lazy and previously abusive. I'm now more attractive than when we met and I want to upgrade because her lifestyle isn't conducive to raising well adjusted kids.

 I am 20 and I only want beautiful partners by my side. I think i’ve always been that way but now idk i notice it more. Am i superficial?

I swear that i myself am a really good-hearted person, i am very empathetic &amp; all of that but it just seems that i care too much about physical appearance. It goes so deep that if i see a couple, where one of them is ugly and the other beautiful, i cringe and sometimes even talk about it for more than 10 minutes lol Is this ok or is my behavior not very normal?

He seemed charming and definitely interested enough. I don't ask his age, but assume we're in the same age range, he's professional, well dressed, decently groomed. All good. Agree to dinner date. Date is set then and there &amp; confirmed via text beforehand.

The actual date:

He keeps carrying on about how he might be older, but that he still acts like he's 25 . 

Why does he keep calling himself ""older""? Older than who and why does he want to be 25? 

I tell him he doesn't have to act 25. That I probably wouldn't date a 25 year old. I'm going to ask his age knowing he'll in turn ask mine and we can get that out of the way because he seems a little insecure and keeps speaking to me as though I'm his junior, but he interrupts.

**Him:** You really are beautiful. Goldie Hawn used to be beautiful. Have you seen her lately? 

**Me:** Thank you &amp; Goldie Hawn really is beautiful. She always seems so happy.

**Him:** No. Goldie Hawn WAS beautiful. Have you SEEN HER? Her daughter still looks ok but she'll turn out like that too.

**Me:** ? That's Kate Hudson, right? I don't know. I don't really know anything about them....have they been in the news or...?

**Him:** You should SEE her. You should google what she looked like when she was young. Then look at her now. She used to be so hot. It happens to all women. Give it time. You have some good years left but wait till you hit \_ \_ (age that I was 7 fucking years ago), you'll see. Can't wait to see Kate in a few years. It's showing already. (laughs) Just look at her mom! What does your mom look like now? 

My mom is dead &amp; WTF is even happening here? Is this a weak attempt at negging or is he legitimately pissed off at a random actress and her family for some reason?  Do I tell him that right now I'm 7 years beyond this ""wait till you hit..."" future date? Fuck it. This clearly isn't going anywhere so I just listen to him babble endlessly about Goldie Hawn and Kate Hudson as if they're both abusing him by aging. It becomes white noise as I finish dinner and enjoy the wine.

Waiting for taxi: I really want to tell him that I'm pretty sure we're roughly the same age so I'm not sure what all the hangups are about, but opt to instead go for a low key burn &amp; block because this entire date was so unpleasant .

Taxi arrives:

**Him:** We could grab another drink somewhere?

**Me** while dodging end of evening physical lean-in: I'm sorry, maybe it's *your generation*, but I feel like we're just not on the same page.

Closed the taxi door before he could rant about how I'll regret this when I reach the age I was 7 years ago. lol.

Also looked up Goldie Hawn and Kate when I got home. Goldie's a happy grandmother. Kate is an accomplished business woman with a happy family. What's this guy's major problem? lol. Leave Goldie and Kate alone! haha. 

So fucking bizarre.

**Lesson learned:**

I feel like I could have avoided this wasted time by not agreeing to dinner so quickly. I think that if we would have shared *at least* our ages beforehand, he would have likely cooled immediately, been far less charming in the initial meeting and saved me a few hours of discomfort.",31858,"My date: Goldie Hawn &amp; Kate Hudson are MONSTERS!

Here's a copy of the post:

""

 **How do I get over my ltr who I dumped** 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a long distance relationship with a girl in grad school for 1.5 years-ish. I really liked her but it was my first relationship and I made some mistakes by cheating on her twice. I learned from them and will never repeat them in a future relationship but the damage was done- we were fighting so much cause she didn't trust me. I broke up with her 2 months ago and regret it so much because I'm so lonely now man. The week days aren't terrible because I have work to occupy my mind, but the weekends are so hard because that was our time together. I ran back to her a week after dumping and she was so happy to hear from me but I still wasn't fully committed to her so she backed away. I just needed more space to realize how I felt. I then went into chase mode and sent her a few long texts since then and she was generally cold. She hasn't initiated contact once since we split I've always been the one who reached out. I don't blame her I mean I dumped her so I can't expect her to be the one pushing the reconciliation. But I'm just accepting now that it's over and it fucking sucks. I took her for granted for sure.

My friends are all my age (27) and most are wife-d up or not wanting to chase pussy with me or really do anything besides hang out with their girlfriends. So I don't really do too much now for social activities I just work all the fuckin time.

How does a girl go from being madly in love and so scared I would dump her to being able to move on in 2 months? I guess it doesn't matter but I'm curious. And how can I feel now like my world is crashing down on me when for 2 weeks after our split I was like 50/50 on whether it was good to even try and get back with her? Is it just the fact that we all want what we can't have?

I've been going to the gym religiously since we split. I'm making progress in there but honestly I've been motivated by the fact that I hope she sees the new me and takes me back. But I deleted her on all social media so she doesn't even have a way to see the progress I'm making. I banged a chick last weekend that was hotter than her but I didn't even get her number afterwards and generally it just made me feel worse

I know I have a horrible case of oneitis, but it's fuckin hard to get over this. I have these mood swings where I'll be fine/calm and be able to see the big picture, and then something will remind me of her and I'll crash down into a paralyzing depression and feel like I fucked up so bad by not sticking with someone who loved me so much. She wasn't perfect- she was kind of a slut before we started dating and her body was only decent but I'm no saint either.

Any tips are appreciated. I honestly just want her back so I can get my focus back on work and the thought of having to date again and get to know someone is scary to me. My honest feelings right now are that I need to have someone who I like that I'm fucking or I'm a low self esteem mess. I know I'm acting like a beta male pussy here but the feelings are real and powerful.

Since she seemingly has moved on from me so fast does that mean she wasn't as into me as I thought? Again I know it doesn't matter but I'm just curious. Her friends are def. telling her never to talk to me again too but man this shit blows. I really regret breaking up with her. I know I have to keep using this as fuel but sometimes its hard to just get through the day. Feeling shitty day in and day out is so exhausting and draining.

I know this is a vent post but can you guys please talk some sense into me

TL;DR

Dumped gf, regretted it and chased, she moved on and now I feel like the one who got dumped and it's destroyed my confidence

I’ve known him for 6 years and we were off and on this whole time but I have talked to him in a year and a half after he did something really shitty to me (not cheating, I am the only woman he was with in maybe 10-15 years). We were more than “on a break” and one night one of his oldest friends came onto me when I was really drunk. We went back to my place and he had the most aggressive sex with me any man has ever given me.  I had to go to a doctor because I was bleeding. The diagnosis was cervical tearing. I am not here to demonize men but I do want to bring awareness to women of their general nature. This was about 3 years ago and I’ve struggled so much with wanting to tell my ex about this and yet wanting to preserve their friendship. The friend told me my ex would lose his shit. Of course he would. I think I need to bury this. What would you do? For starters, my ex loves me as much as he is capable of loving anyone. I have had some of the best times of my life with him. 

Do I just let this sleeping dog lie? His “friend” in my mind has always been intensely jealous of my ex’s success and I felt like the sex was very much revenge/envy sex. This is also why I posted about how men betray each other as they go on how about how bad women are. I wish this had never happened but it really eats away at me and I wonder if I should just keep this a secret and let my ex think this guy is a true friend. I think by letting him know his friend is such a dog, I will lose him from my life forever, the reason that thought bothers me is that he’s been pretty fragile lately. He’s told me he feels like no one would miss him for weeks if he were to die alone in his home. He’s really a messed up guy but is one of the most fun, vibrant people I’ve ever met too. He hurt me so very badly with his actions but he seems to have hit a low point and learned some things and is talking to me again. I ignored him for a year but I started talking to him. 

He’s living with this POS and I’m so conflicted as to what to do. I also wanted to post this for other women to know that this is how some men operate - if they can fuck their friend’s women and get away with it they will. I wish to god I had never done this. A week later he tried it again and I was just so repulsed at the thought. No one has ever known I was physically damaged by him. I think he hates my ex in s way but he uses him. It’s just so awful. I should bury this I think? I don’t want to cause my ex pain, he is already in pain just b/c of how his life turned out, but I hate too that he’s been friends with a guy for most of his life who betrayed him this way.",18648,An ex is talking to me.

And let me tell you, if I had found this sub months ago I would have realized I was making every mistake in the book. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're both 21, he had just come out of a long-term relationship, so I understood his hesitation in not wanting to jump into another one. We're both finishing up college, so we're fairly busy people. The first time we met up was at his house for a hook-up, because I was feeling super horny. The sex was great, and he pushed to keep seeing me. We went on dates, hung out, had great sex, etc for about a month before summer break where I left the state for an internship. I realized that I was starting to catch feelings for this guy, but he was adamant on not being ready (and clearly not over his ex) so I swallowed my feelings and built a wall around them.

 I dated some people during the summer (not using female dating strategy), and so did he. I had a few average experiences, 2 terrible ones, and 1 great one. From the sounds of it, he had mostly bad experiences. We texted every day. He told me he missed me, that I was all he could think about, that he talked about me all the time, etc, etc. His friends teased him for talking about me, and he would often get jealous if I said I was going out with someone else. In retrospect, this is probably the time when I was inadvertently following a lot of the strategies laid out here: keeping my distance, keeping my options open, being emotionally unavailable. And it was working like a charm. He confessed that he had feelings for me too. 

I came back to college. We talked about our situation, he expressed that he still wasn't ready for a relationship. I said that was fine. But my schedule got incredibly packed and the thought of making time for other men when I barely had time for myself was anxiety-inducing, so I didn't bother redownloading any of my apps. We start acting more relationship-y: he picked me up from the airport, helps me move in, says ""I love you"" but only during sex, saying he feels like we're in an open relationship without the label...basically, a lot of shit that only a ""boyfriend"" would do. I start to think that maybe he feels more for me than he's letting on and that he's only forcing himself to date other people because that's what he thinks he's expected to do (he always told me sex with me was better, hanging out with me was better), so I let my guard down and pretty much go full girlfriend mode. I don't mind the thought of him sleeping with other people or going out on random dates because I know that I'm the option he prefers. 

This is where shit went sour. We had a conversation at one point where he expressed how much he missed his ex. The way he talked about her and what happened made me realize that he didn't feel what I thought he felt for me. I was completely shocked and heartbroken, like I'd been dunked in cold water. I told him I need some time to think and set up boundaries again. We have a few discussions and meet-ups over a 2-week period but barely saw each other. I decide I can keep seeing him, but I'll make an effort to see other people, and I ask that he stop treating me like his girlfriend when he doesn't see me that way. 

Things worked for a week, and then shit hit the fan again. I found out he was also dating another girl. Not just hooking up with or going on meaningless dates with, but actually dating. Like the way we were dating. This made me feel sick: to think that he was saying and doing the same things with her that he would do with me. The more I thought about it the less okay with it I was. I'm not okay with being treated like Option #2. I'm not okay with not being a priority in someone's life. 

I explained this to him in our 'break-up' chat and he was understanding. He was sad, but he said he understood, and he apologized for hurting me. He said he was reaching for threads to salvage 'us', but he couldn't think of anything that would truly solve the problem besides getting in a relationship, and he didn't want that. A part of me was/is upset that he didn't fight to keep me, that he didn't try to stop seeing the other girl, that he couldn't even consider a relationship. In a way, that helps give me more closure. If he didn't see it as worth his time to put other things on hold to have me, then I'm sure as hell going to stop putting things on hold to have him.

 I have a date tonight and I'm changing my whole strategy: let HIM pay for everything, WAIT to have sex, let HIM reach out first and ask for dates, and most importantly: STAY IN THE DATING POOL. 

I feel a little sad, because this person is a genuinely good guy (if a little immature) and a part of me believes that if we'd met at some other point in life things might have worked out differently. But it doesn't matter. If I run into him again years later and he proves that he's ready to treat me like I fucking deserve, then I'll reconsider.

I knew some of the components of this prior, but something snapped into focus for me. We were talking about how men seem to resent (even hate) strong women, as if it's an affront to them. They call us unfeminine or try to belittle us if we are strong and intelligent and capable. 

Here's the thing: men have extremely powerful but fragile egos. Their ego tells them they **deserve** the hot supermodel, but their ego is also extremely sensitive to criticism or challenge. So when men are confronted with whip smart, ambitious, career driven, well read women they think ""oh shit. I am lazy, I have no career ambition, I'm a mess and my finances are not in a good place"" so they resent that women because she's succeeding in ""masculine arenas"" where he is floundering. Her corporate job highlights his retail job. Her intelligence highlights his mental laziness. Her activities hobbies highlights his video game and porn addiction. And so on.

So he has three options: 

1. seek out a less quality partner who also doesn't have her shit together, 

2. belittle the strong woman so she seeks his approval, or 

3. become better himself. 

Option 3 is out because that requires effort and effort is hard. Option 2 is the easiest - destabilize her, keep her guessing about the status of the relationship, put her down for trying to make improvements in her life and get her to be complacent. We see this a lot, and FDS is all about not putting up with this fucking BULLSHIT anymore. Or there's Option 1 - date a lower quality partner.

We see a lot of incel or MGTOW guys do this -- seek out a woman who is a mess: financially, mentally, emotionally. She is not working on herself, she is in constant chaos and relies on other people. She's a user, she's irresponsible. She's the prime target for a man who has very little to offer, except maybe a little money or time. 

And that's why so many men complain that women take advantage of them. Because their sense of inadequacy and complacency drives them to women who don't have their lives together, they rescue her out of some White Knight ego-driven complex to save and be a Big Strong Man(TM), and then resent her for it. They grow bitter that they seek out women who don't challenge them, and are shocked when the woman cheats or uses him or does one of many irresponsible behaviors, even though he sought her out for those exact low-quality reasons.

It's unfair to say that all men are ""bad"", and it's equally ridiculous to say that there aren't women out there that take advantage and use men. There are. But in the same way that men seek out dysfunctional women to fuel their egos, we women settle for dysfunctional men because we've been socially conditioned to accept less than what we deserve and we've been taught that our strengths are unfeminine or need to be tempered to not alienate or emasculate weak men.

So what's the solution? Well a lot of men aren't stepping up to the plate to better themselves, but generations of women have positively reinforced this idea that inadequacy, abuse, mistreatment, negging -- all of these things are okay, and that has to stop. Maybe if we take stock of our weaknesses and become even stronger and more attractive, and we stop taking shit, men will slowly improve themselves. They'll go to therapy, they'll seek out higher education and become more empathetic and well-rounded people. Or, maybe not. But that doesn't mean we need to settle. I would rather be single forever with my beautiful, strong friends than be beholden to a man that drags me down and dims my light.

My aunt fell into this trap, proving that men did this back in the '70s, too.

Plus I'd just passed a couple hot guys and remembered this city is full to the brim with hot men, *hehehe.*

Anyway some nerd guy is sat next to me, and my spidey senses were tingling he was *going to try some shit*

He whips his head round and says enthusiastically 'Can I get your opinion on something as a female?'

I go 'sure', cos I'm bored af and got some time to kill waiting for my train. (SEE women aren't mean!!)

He asks me whether he thinks its weird that his friend met this girl from Texas, and has asked her to fly to London and move in with him after meeting her on holiday and speaking to her for via phone for 2months. (LMAO typical moid shit)

I'm like.... 'ummm , *wellllll*' thinking, is this guy for real or just making an excuse to talk lol but anyway I respected this moids creativity/balls, but he sure as hell ain't getting my number still. I continue, cos I can tell I'm going to find this dude amusing.

I go to him 'well I certainly wouldn't be packing up my stuff half way across the country for some guy, even if he was a millionaire, that's a big decision'.........

This guy is looking at me like I'm the most pessimistic person alive, and I'm thinking wow desperate guys are so naive. He says 'Why?? Do you think he's moving a bit too fast? He feels like the girl is saying she will do it but isn't really feeling it deep down' \*facepalm\* erm YEAH no wonder.

Anyway he compliments my loui  bag asking what I do, and I'm thinking mmhmm typical London shit (if they sniff money they suck up to you)

This is when it gets annoying, I now can't get rid of him (my own damn fault) he's chatting my ears off all the way to the station, mixed in with the odd sexual glance \*shiver\*. I have not flirted at all, but you know how it goes if you so much as reply to a male. I'm politely tryna switch off because I'm too tired for this &amp; thinking oh well I'll get rid of him at the station anyway. This dude is the same height as me at 5'2- not a chance a hell.

But it turns out this lil beta dude is balling, he runs his own property business in the Gherkin building in central, so I followed him on Insta, for potential further uses. But he was so gassed, if you saw his instagram, lmao he was definitely one of those overconfident moids (even if you're wealthy, 5'2 is a straight no for most women).

HOWEVER.....it turns out my train is DELAYED, and the dude is still lingering lmao, then he decides to go over to the piano at the station cos he wants me to film him playing happy birthday so he can send it to his brother *\*grrrroan\**

So in the MIDDLE OF A PACKED OUT TRAIN STATION all you can hear is *happy birthday to youuuu* playing on the piano and everybody's looking at him like what the fuck....and then a huge group of rowdy kids walk past joining in singing...and I'm stood there looking like Kim Kardashians mum *'you're doing great sweetie'* thinking ffs I'm too tired FOR THIS I was just tryna kill some time at the cafe I'm about to drop this phone and run.

Finally my train comes and I relaxxxxxxxx. Safe from the moids and fuckboys again.

But yeah that just goes to show guys, don't be *too* friendly to these beta males but if you are make sure you get their contact deets cos they might be useful. Also this behaviour is why guys like this stay losing.

I don't think this is the right approach or mindset for dealing with men, and intercourse should be delayed as long as possible, perhaps even until securing an engagement or longer. That might sound crazy to you now, but it won't when you finish reading this.

Before we get into the main topic, let's talk about modern male sexuality. Men are accustom to an overabundance of sexual stimulation (typically in the form of pornography) and more options for casual sex than ever before in human history. When you factor those in together with the nature of male orgasm, men tend toward expecting and desiring instant gratification. They want to do the bare minimum required to receive sexual gratification as soon as possible. This leaves women in the unfortunate position of being the gatekeepers of sexual activity in a relationship. Because men are sexual opportunists and will rarely turn down sex when offered, it's up to you to set the pace of sexual escalation and determine what happens. I'll get more into this later, but managing this position and using it to secure maximum benefits requires massive self-discipline--however, once you embrace the position and step into your power as gatekeeper, you probably won't want to go back to ""normal"" sexual courting ever again.

The Art of the Tease isn't just about gatekeeping, it's about prioritizing sensual and erotic pleasure over the purely sexual. Sensual pleasure is simply pleasure via your five senses: touch, scent, sight, taste, and touch. The erotic originates from your brain and pertains to your thoughts, your feelings, and your imagination. It's my belief that the brain is the most sexual organ in the human body! Most men are slaves to their hormonal impulses and their genitals when it comes to sex. You want that to shift to their brain and the totality of their body, rather than just what's dangling between their legs. 

A woman who has mastered the Art of the Tease knows how to create and leverage sexual tension so that even the most basic romantic and sexual interactions are imbued with intense pleasure, passion, excitement, and meaning.

So, how might a women accomplish that? Here are some basic principles, tips, and tricks. All of these interrelate with each other so so don't them as a straightforward list of steps; all of these need to be considered and developed to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Escalate physical, romantic, and sexual affection very slowly.
   * As slowly as possible. And take intercourse off the table for a very long time. Sexual tension can't develop if you're getting hot and heavy early on. If you want your first kiss to be electric, wait awhile. Tease and flirt with the possibility but pull away with a girlish laugh and a wicked smile at the last second. Get as close as possible to the line without crossing it until you've made him work for the privilege of kissing you. Men aren't used to being denied or managed in this way, and it will drive him crazy, because other girls give in to sex too early and too often. You want a man to anticipate a kiss or a touch, you want him to start fantasizing about you as soon as you leave. Keep the mystery alive!
* Filter ruthlessly
   * The truth is, not every guy is going to have the patience to be teased, even if it's fun. They're too pornsick, or they're massively selfish, or they're entitled jerks. If you try to tease a guy and he responds with anger, dump him immediately. If he crosses your boundaries, never see him again. Moreover, if he tries to pornographize any aspect of the relationship, stop everything you're doing and walk away. For example, if you're talking to each other in a sexy way, and he says something porny like ""You're my little slut, aren't you?"" you shut it down and leave him immediately. You physically and emotionally disengage at once and say, ""I'm no one's slut"", and ask him to leave (or you leave), then block him. Porn-influenced speech and behavior is a huge red flag. More on that later. But what's nice about this approach is that you have plenty of time to vet a guy and get the measure his character before involving yourself physically.
* Explore a wide range of pleasures together
   * Learn to give and receive pleasure that isn't explicitly sexual. What feels better than sex, or just as good as sex, or close to sex? Do those things together!
* You must be in control 100% of the time, and you have to be the first to end a kiss (or other things)
   * This can be very difficult, because if you're doing everything right and the man you're with is game, it's likely you'll be caught up in a whirlwind of feelings, too. If you give a man an inch, he'll take a mile. When you're making out with a guy and there's passion it's very hard to pull back and tell him you have to go, but the bottom line is, you want to leave a man always craving more. But you want a man to crave you, and letting things go on too long, or letting things happen too often, kills cravings. Always pull back, always make a lighthearted excuse about needing to stop, and always flash your prettiest, most charming smile. Regular meditation and mindfulness practice can go a long way to building self-discipline in general.
* Only engage in romantic and sexual behavior in person
   * In general, a relationship should be deepened in person, not through text, video, or phone calls, with the exception of general pre-screening correspondence before meeting in person for the first time. When it comes to sex and romance, NEVER flirt through texts, NEVER send nudes and videos or accept them from men, NEVER give men sexual material that they can use on their own time. They need to learn that relationships can only grown face-to-face, and that for anything romantic or sexual to happen, they need to spend time with you in person. Keep texts, calls, and other social media correspondence business-like, and use it exclusively for arranging dates.
* Keep it wholesome
   * With the prevalence of pornography use and participation in bdsm, even among women, this might be hard for some of you to wrap your minds around. Porn, bdsm, kinks, and fetishes are all indicators of what I call shame-based sexuality. I won't go into depth about that here (that's for an upcoming post), but you want to avoid shame-based sexuality and behavior, especially if it's being requested by a man. Men who get off to sexualized violence and/or humiliation, even if it's ""asked for"", are to be avoided at all costs. Why would you waste time with a man who can orgasm while hurting a woman? That's a sign of deep-seated misogyny.  Furthermore, men don't actually respect women who participate in shame-based sexual behaviors; they'll always be ""dirty"" in the eyes of men, and all men resent ""dirty"" women, even if these men engage in the exact same behaviors! So, keep it wholesome. So-called vanilla sex gets a bad rap these days but it can be thrilling, wonderful, and exciting.
* One step forward, two steps back
   * When you decide to escalate, never perform the same act the very next time you see them. Maybe pull back the reins and go back to just kissing. Make it clear you're the one in charge and that you call the shots. 
* Learn to say a million things with just one glance, or gesture, or smile, or sound
   * When you get really good at body language, you can heighten sexual tension with just one look. It's thrilling when you can drive a man wild with a gasp only he can hear. If you need to, start practicing in the mirror, and ask some close girlfriends to act as judges and coaches.
* Teach him that making YOU happy will end in good things for him... but only intermittently
   * Don't escalate sexual and romantic behavior ""just because"", wait until he does something particularly nice or generous for you. But don't reward him every time he's exceptionally generous. In psychology, it's been shown that giving intermittent rewards for a desired behavior yields better results than guaranteed rewards. 
* Start building a high-quality lingerie collection
   * Better yet, have *him* build your lingerie collection. Think of it as high-quality gift wrapping for a high-quality woman. When you're courting a man and choosing to take the relationship to the next level, wearing plain ore merely pretty underwear just isn't going to cut it. On your own time, wear whatever you want, but on dates, wear something luxurious.
* Make sure your pleasure comes first, and never fake an orgasm
   * Never give pleasure without first being pleasured. And be 100% truthful about your experience of pleasure; if he's not doing it for you, let him know. You're not here to coddle his ego. Since you've taken it slow, he'll be emotionally invested in you well before you've actually gotten to giving and receiving orgasms, so he'll genuinely want to please you. Be selfish and demand pleasure without reciprocating. For example, if you've gotten to the point where you're giving and receiving oral sex, let him bring you to orgasm and then say you have to leave. Flash a winning smile, give him a kiss on the cheek, and get dressed and out the door. Male orgasms are cheap, so never give him one without getting yours first, but feel free to take without giving.

When you get really good at this, experiencing the tension and build-up is much more fun than the actual sex acts. Most men never experience prolonged sexual tension and it drives them crazy (in a good way if they're decent men), and they'll be hounding you for a date. You want them to think about you constantly, to crave your presence, to wonder what might happen when you see each other next. All of this creates wonderful, dizzying passion. It also tends to engage men's feelings in a deeper way. To them, you become unique and wondrous, or as they say in The Rules, ""a creature unlike any other.""

I've done this with all of my exes and all of them speak glowingly of our time together, all of them consider me the one that got away, the love of their lives. A couple of their wives hate me with a passion, though I've never been inconsiderate or unkind to them. A lot of that feeling is due to maintaining sexual tension over the course of our relationship. It's so much fun. If you've been longing for a passionate relationship, this is a way to get it, assuming you find the right kind of man.",18009,The Art of the Tease: Mastering Sexual Tension,0,1572083695.0,,,0

We put up with abuse and mistreatment way, way longer than (most) men tend to, especially in the dating world. I think one of the reasons we run into this so often is that we treat men like women. We assume they have empathy, depth of feelings, compassion. We act as if we're communicating with another women, because that's the frame of reference we understand.

But here's the thing: most guys aren't deep, emotionally. They don't have compassion and empathy like we do, and they don't process emotions the same way we do. We engage with men long after we ""want"" to out of a sense of decency, forgetting that that same man would block us or report us on OLD apps if he thought we weren't attractive. 

I'm reminded of this constantly. I'm a relatively unattractive female (though, working on it!) who encouters a lot of with a lot of males in my professional field, and I will spend the entire day smiling, being kind and courteous, helping out and providing support to my coworkers when I can and... nothing. Few of them are courteous back, most ignore me or look away when I try and be polite. I brushed it off at first as ""that's how men communicate"" but after months and years of this trend, it starts to grate on my nerves and I realized: it's a good daily reminder that men are opportunists -- they act in ways that benefit them, and don't feel the need to extend even common courtesy to women they don't want to fuck. 

So ladies, when you see that you're accepting dates with men you're not intersted, entertaining conversations you don't enjoy, or finding yourself negged or manipulated and you're putting up with it out of some sense of politeness, STOP. Almost 0% of men would even respond much less feel obligated to be kind or treat you with any sort humanity if you didn't seek to benefit him in some way (sexually, financially, emotionally, socially). 

Be ruthless. Don't take shit. Don't apologize for your space or your boundaries or your standards. Be ruthless with your time and effort and resources. Find strong female friends to get your emotional needs met. Focus on your hobbies and your health and your legacy.

Also inb4 you pickme bitches say ""but my guy friends don't do that!"" and ""not all men!"" just remember Occam's Razor: The simplest explanation is often the correct one. Yes there are exceptions to the the rule, but operating as if the exception IS the rule is a really good way to keep getting hurt, wasting your time, and putting up with shit that men feel entitled to subject you to after years of existing in a society that allows, or even encourages, this behavior.",17828,Guys are callous opportunists and that requires us to be ruthless,0,1572074600.0,,,0

Met in a sports group, was always inviting me out every weekend and organising the dates, generally taking the lead and making sure I had a good time. He asked me out and I agreed because he seemed like a nice guy and I enjoyed his company. I wasn't that invested at this point. Timing-wise we had sex two weeks after we became exclusive. Red flag 1 - I told him I wanted to wait a bit because this was my first relationship and I hadn't slept with a man before. I nearly broke up with him because he was pushy, he begged me and said he understood. I rationalised it as miscommunication because we don't speak each other's first languages fluently. He asked again the second week. I said fuck it, this was probably the pace adult relationships moved at and I should just get it over and done with. It wasn't a bad experience, but with hindsight I would have preferred waiting. I was invested at this point. I went on holiday afterwards, came back, we had argument over communicating and he broke up with me saying he didn't see a future with me.

I was scrolling through insta yesterday because he still watches my stories and realised something again - all the western women he follows are either hikers or straight up soft core porn models. Whilst all the Japanese women he follows are his friends or just cute normal models. Dude was probably just looking for a cool foreign western woman to fuck and move on. Why he couldn't do that via tinder I have no idea.

I'm now at the 'I'm pissed' stage of being broken up with and I don't know how to get over him.  I've blocked him from all contact with me, but I don't want to stop going to our mutual sports group because I like playing and have friends there. I'm also pissed I didn't break up with him when I wanted to.

Since I was 19, I would meet men up to 45 yrs old. I would always have fun and interesting things to talk about, I enjoyed their praise for my accomplishments and it also filled the void I had growing up without a father. However, I realized they never fully let me in, except for 1 or 2 rare cases. If they had kids, they were never a huge part of the conversation, and I definitely met a lot who just liked the fact I was young and impressionable.

Well now I’m 24, and I’ve been giving guys my age a chance, and I gotta say I’m disappointed. They (general ofc) are just too caught up on their sexual needs, appearances, have a false sense of being hot shit, aren’t even that good in bed (lack of experience or appreciation for woman’s pleasure), and do not really know what they want or have their lives together. The last 2 points are present throughout all our lives, but they are closer to it when they are older and have lived life. 

Personally, I’ve been taking care of myself since I was 18, anything prestigious I’ve ever done or gotten was a result of hard work or luck. I’ve Gina through a lot of struggle in my short life and because of it I’m always a bit ahead of where people are at my age mentally. This isn’t always good, sometimes I wish I could just be more blissful and ignorant to things. My mom and I are immigrants and i had to learn everything about the world and connections and careers myself, so whenever I meet guys that have been hand held for most of their lives I cannot take them seriously. Or who just think getting me some drinks and showing me a good time is all all they need to do for me to sleep with them. If the sex was mind blowing then maybe as a FWB, but that is never really the case! Don’t get me wrong, I would love to meet a guy my age who was compatible with me, but I have yet to. My interests also align well to older men, the problem is I feel a gap between the men I’m into and younger guys. 

Like i’m in way too much of a different stage in my life to demand a man who has been established for 10+ years but will not feel fulfilled with a typical 25 year old in the states. So my question is, what can I do to start going for people in between? I don’t even know what they look like, I don’t think it’s exclusively about age but characteristics I am failing to look for or recognize. I struggle being attracted to the potential of someone, because I’ve seen it many times it doesn’t mean it will manifest. For ex, my brother, his wife saw potential, she was way overqualified than him in most ways, but after 8 years they opened a business together and are very successful. Like they say, men can be molded, and many times women are their source of inspiration, it’s not to be relied on but it’s overlooked. 

I ask because I met a really cool man this weekend, he’s an ER doctor and we have many things in common. However, several times he said things that he wouldn’t say to me where I 10 years older, and that reminded me of some of the older men I liked but couldn’t see me for more than my age. So what do I do? Do I keep going in dates with guys my age? For the older men, what red flags scream playboy or guys with a young girl fetish?

Men will usually conceal their misogyny in the beginning, but often you can pick up subtle ques in their bio's online to save you some time- these are personally some of my turn offs.

*'I want a down to earth girl'* 

Is it me or is this just redpill men's discreet way of saying they want a pick me who knows her place and acts 'humble' aka doesn't know her worth, and isn't expecting much from him? Basically these sort will expect an attractive girl to act like they don't know they're attractive. Its often code for him not wanting a 'high maintenance' chick, which in men's terms often means, a woman that has standards.

 [**SheRaSeven1**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7YmOvYuw0ubdPEvItrH3oQ) talks about this and how men will often say *'oh baby you don't need that makeup I like you natural etc'* as a way to mate gate women, aka they know if you make an effort with your appearance you will get men swarming over easy no problem &amp; they know they can't stop you from getting that attention when you walk out the door. I think there is a lot of truth to that! Think about it. I meet super stunning well groomed girls all the time, that don't use this to their advantage and feel down on themselves cos of the guy they're with. My advice to women, is *always act like you know it.* Higher value men love confident women, this inflates their esteem (ooo she chose me!!), instead of making them paranoid. Don't be afraid to glance over at a couple of guys looking at you on a date (men do it anyway). You want him to know *you're aware* of the attention in subtle ways, this will activate his 'manly' instincts to chase /protect &amp; make him aware of his competition. 

'*don't want any drama'* 

These type tend to have the 'goldigga fear' imo &amp; it gives me super red flags they've been cheated on, rocky divorce etc so they're going to be paranoid, or over emotional wimps with mommy issues. Could also mean they're a fuckboy and the type to tell you their ex was a 'psycho' on their 2nd date. I'll pass

*'not here for netflix and chill!'*

Yeah, course mate, isn't everybody. Be very wary of these men claiming they're only after something serious in their bio's- this is exactly what women want to hear and so will probably increase his matches by default (he could easily state his intentions in a convo). Does not mean he means it however.

The things I look out for in men's bio's is something original that shows they've thought on their feet to get a girl talking, and I look out for pics of them travelling/in the outdoors doing manly shit. I stay well away from posey men and look for men in suits. No OTT 'cutesy' pics with their pets etc as I can tell they'll be a simp, and I swipe right on any guy that has pics with girls well out of his league as if he's trying to imply this is his 'standard' lmaoo.

Like many users have said before, letting a man know your high n-count will only end badly for you. No matter how good, trustworthy and genuine you think he is. he will view you negatively. Period. The end. 

The thing is, men’s egos aren’t only attached to their own sexuality but they’re also latched to the sexuality of the woman he’s romantically/sexually involved with. To tell a man you’re had many partners in the past damages his ego. 

THIS IS MY RULE: IF YOU’RE TOO EMBARRASSED TO TELL THE INFORMATION TO YOUR PARENTS, DO NOT TELL IT TO YOUR MAN. 

Would you openly tell your mom or dad that you’ve fucked 25 men and 20 of those men meant absolutely nothing to you? No? Great. Don’t tell your man. 

There is also a 95% chance he runs and tells his friends what you told him to get their input. Then his friends tell their friends. Then you’re know as the slut. That’s how these rumors start. 

You can feel connected with your man without  telling him everything. Don’t be an open book. just show him enough chapters so he’s satisfied.",17565,The Truth About Relationships and Honesty,0,1572062645.0,,,0

We have a lot in common, he is genuinely kind and honest and we want the same things in the future, we click very well and I feel this can turn into something real. 

**The problem -**

During the first three months I asked him out 4 times and he canceled every time. However, with **legit reasons**. Then I asked him out again at the end of September and he answered roughly with *''It's not the right time, sorry if I'm unclear''*. I said *''I am interested in you so you will have to text me when you want to meet up, but I will not wait for you''*. We haven't had any contact for about three weeks but he has written one day each week that he thinks of me, miss talking to me and likes my insta photos etc… 

Now in October, he says he wants to start talking again. I've started dating others (though only first dates, so far). And he got a little bit offended. I then told him *''I have started dating others. I told you that I will not wait for you and you said you understood it, how do you want it? You don't want to meet me but you also don't want me to meet anyone else? You have to make up your mind.’’* He replied that he wants to meet me, **but** he still hasn't set a day or time. **What should I do?**

If it had happened with another guy, I would have blocked him immediately, but something about this guy feels right. He doesn't give me any red flags except the meeting part. **How do I get him to ask me out?**

Feel free to ask if you need more information. English isn't my first language.

&amp;nbsp;

A repeated question we get on this sub is how long to wait to have sex with a new guy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Our general rule of thumb is 1) after he has made a commitment if you are interested in a relationship or 2) after he has demonstrated value and investment to you for FWBs. 

&amp;nbsp;

The general idea is to validate that a man is respectful of your time, body, and energy, is honest and of good character, and is willing to compensate you for the additional risk you take on as a woman by providing you with extra value - [more on that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d22vzv/given_that_the_risks_of_sex_are_way_higher_and/)

&amp;nbsp;

Here’s My personal Quick &amp; Dirty Rules at the moment:

&amp;nbsp;

Sex should take place 

&amp;nbsp;

1. After he’s agreed to an STD test ( you’re a HVW, who honors her sexual health)

2. After you’ve had a bit of phone sex to outline the rules of the game and of pleasing you. Don’t just let it happen because this is one of those things that can go very badly if you don’t set certain boundaries upfront. Furthermore - if he tried to cross them later you know what kind of a-hole you’re dealing with. 

3. After he’s made an obvious attempt to impress you.  Attempts to impress you could be he takes you somewhere you’ve always wanted to go, pays for an expensive date, etc. It should be an investment slightly larger than just dinner and a movie. Scale it to what you guess is his overall salary. Unfortunately with men - before sex is your time of greatest leverage so if you don’t set the standard now, you won’t be able to raise it later - so milk it for all it’s worth.

4. After you’ve said “no” to something and he’s graciously accepted it. It is very important to gauge his reaction To you setting limits - because if he is a boundary pushing asshole it could end up in your rape or sexual assault. It also weeds out RedPill assholes who try and bully women or fake “alphas”.

&amp;nbsp;

**Optional - but something I’m gonna do:**

&amp;nbsp;

5. Push *his* sexual boundaries a little by telling him you just want oral sex. He’s got to show he’s invested in pleasing you before you are willing to please him, and demonstrate he has sexual self control. 

&amp;nbsp;

But we both really did love each other and so I figured why not try to make it work.

However, he went off to college and broke up with me. We’ve both said we still have feelings for each other but a relationship wouldn’t be a good idea, but stuff has still been very messy. He’s out living college life but telling me about and we both are reacting very badly to it all (for example, he told me about how he had drunkenly lost his virginity, to which I said it made me feel better I had waited until I met someone who valued it the way had, and he started crying because he had wanted it to be with me and regretted it). He’s open about still having feelings for me, but is also “trying to move on” and seeing other people.

Anyways, he’s back in town for the weekend, so we decided to meet up irl to talk. We both said we still loved each other but a relationship isn’t a good idea, and then hooked up.

I know a part of it is that I need to be patient, but I’ve been single for a while and I’m afraid that “waiting for the right guy” is going to turn into waiting forever. Should I keep going on with Tinder or turn my attention to other things?",35161,Tired of Tinder,0,,,,1

In light of my own responses to this, I've realized that its very likely I will end up alone. Personally the answer is maybe 5% of people my age I am attracted to, and maybe 1% or less that would make suitable partners. Its very likely that the same &lt;1% I am interested in are the same high value men other women are also chasing, and the statistics just suggest that the probability of finding a long term partner that I will be happy with is very low. I am still trying to come to terms with this, and I am curious about what other women here think about this. 

The whole concept of this sub is new to me, but is something I have come to feel, learn, and experience first hand. I am also learning so much reading through posts here, but I think this is one point we should consider in building a complete dating strategy picture.  The fact is we will not all find suitable partners, it just doesn't work statistically. The obvious solution is for men to simply be more attractive. Or maybe just more ambitious and less immature? Stop rewarding slobs for their slobbery. The idea that women should lower their collective standards is absurd. The number of single mothers, abused partners, and girlfriends supporting their layabout partners is proof enough. 

The problem is this still leaves many women like myself with very little probability of finding the lifelong partnership with a competent, interesting, caring man.",35157,What percentage of men would you estimate you are attracted to? What percentage do you think make suitable partners?,0,,,,1

So give him yours. If things end for any reason, at the very least he wont have information about you that can be used against you, or just the sheer satisfaction of knowing your business. 

1. Keep your texts clean

That means text about surface level topics, but keep the deeper level conversations on the phone or in a disappearing voice text.  The reason for this is so that he cannot go back into the thread and piece things together. Also: NEVER TEXT HIM YOUR SCHEDULE. You never want him to get an idea of your routine because that says alot about you and he can use this later to piece things together OR he can use it to double book you with other women. 

2. Count his blinks. 
Sounds really stupid but psychologically people become more attached to people via eye contact, and when he's closer to you he will reveal more as he is comfortable. 


3. Learn to mirror questions back to him. 
When he asks you a personal question you need to quickly give him a vague answer, and throw it back to him expecting a clear answer. 

4. Ask alot of questions. A lot. 
Be careful of questions that are really creepy like what is his exact birth time ( if you know you know ) 
But you need to get to know him in ways he probably doesnt even know himself. This also makes him feel wanted because you are interested. There is a finesse in this approach though. Its not an interview or interrogation its like play therapy for kids you are doing something fun with him, a topic of his interest presents itself, and you are simply asking small questions and steering it back to him. 

5. Keep him out of your place until youre sure he's serious about you. The reason for this is you dont want him getting comfortable with you and your place is your oasis. Once he is at your place he has they key to pandoras box whether you have his keys or not. 

6. If he has books at his house, secretly take a picture of his bookshelf. These are the things hes interested in, these are the things he is trying to become. You need to know who youre dealing with. Wealthy families wont even allow you to date someone without a thorough background check, and athletes/ celebrities wont even give a girl a chance unless shes on the good girl list. 

7. Find his hot topics
Everyone has this one interest where you bring it up and they start telling you everything they know about it. The more they love something the more they will talk and reveal other things in the process. 

Example: I love the US version of ""The Office"" 
Him: My favorite episode is the fire drill .....
That reminds me of the fire we had in my neighborhood etc etc etc. 

8. Never criticize him. 
This is from Dale Carnegies "" How to win friends and influence people"" the goal is to keep him interested and feel comfortable with you. What you do next is up to you, but you will win way more flies with honey than vinegar. The less he feels judged the more he will reveal. The more he reveals, the more power you have over him. 

9. Choose more interactive dates. The more activity youre doing together presents more opportunities to explore different topics. You will be revealing things about yourself in this scenario, so learn to keep things fun, light and vague. 

10. Physical touch is your friend. 90% of what we say is nonverbal, so if you truly dont want to answer a question or go down a rabbit hole that leads to information you dont want to get into you can simply touch his arm and smile. This politely tells him ""no I'm not ready to talk about that"" but also ""yes I do like you"" 

11. Remember that you do not have to lie, ever. You are simply choosing to reveal less. You can honestly speak on things about yourself, just a more shallow amount of information. With this you need to know how to speak alot about benign topics. This could come off as vapid but its actually highly intelligent. The more you speak without revealing yourself entirely, the more he will open up and you can use this information yo decide whether or not he is worth your time.",35154,How to get to know him intensely without revealing much about yourself,0,,,,1

I have a small vibrator (half of the size of a pen) that I use every so often. It’s nice and it gets the job done. However, my ex did NOT like the idea of me having one. When I challenged his reasoning behind it he said, “Well, it makes me feel bad. Having sex with me should be enough for you. Why do you need that?” 

After having explained to him that I can’t get off from penetration alone, he got offended and pretended to play the victim by saying, “So you’re saying I’m not good enough?!”
No amount of education could get through to him. He assumed I stopped using it because I never mentioned it again after that, but I used it every chance I could get. lol

The kicker is that he was *always* pressuring me into doing anal and other depraved kinky shit that I never felt truly comfortable doing, yet it was a huge problem that in my alone time I masturbated with a small toy.

He ended up cheating on me with my best friend while I was working overtime for a month.

Were your parents emotionally immature? Are you? Is your potential or current partner immature?

I skipped to halfway to ""what it's like being with an emotionally immature person"", because it's more useful to identify one today and get rid of them, or manage them if you can't cut them out of your life. For example, Mother-in-Law. These descriptions are seen over and over on /JustNoMIL

Personally, the hugest sign of an EI person is.. the conversation is just weird. I think I'm having a back and forth, they think they're having (and winning) an argument. *All the time*.

* Communication is difficult or impossible – they aren't interested in listening, comprehending or reciprocating. Their goal isn't understanding.

* They provoke anger – pretty much just by existing, being so annoying and needy. (called ""Bitch Eating Crackers"" on JNM. They need attention and all eyes on them for every mundane thing, or feel the right to intrude and grab your attention whenever they feel like it).

* They communicate by emotional contagion – they fuss when they're distressed and expect everyone else to make them feel better. (Rocking the boat)

* They don't do emotional work – being unwilling to take responsibility, they just shrug and say “that's how they are”.

* They're hard to give to – they create a malignant guessing game that keeps everyone uneasy. “If you loved me you'd read my mind”.

* They resist repairing relationships – EI people expect to be taken off the hook immediately. If you don't forgive them and “put the past behind us”, you're to blame. They don't understand that rebuilding trust takes time and that they need to apologize and recognize the harm they have caused.

* They demand mirroring – EI people expect others to act the way they want them to, their fragile self-esteem depends on it. They have a fantasy that a child (or partner) will make them feel good about themselves.

* Their self-esteem rides on your compliance, approval, acceptance and success – they respond to complaints about their behaviour (or you asserting your boundaries) with extreme statements like “I must be the worst xyz ever!” in order to shut down communication. They don't want to hear it or think that they might be bad. They want you to back down and reassure them that they aren't the worst Mother/boyfriend ever.

* They see roles as sacred – as a parent/spouse they feel entitled to respect and obedience, and being exempt from respecting boundaries or being considerate. They stop by unannounced and rearrange your furniture because “family” or “I'm your mother”. They use the same concept to coerce – threatening to reject you or getting family members to gang up on you.

* They seek enmeshment, not intimacy. They may play favourites towards the one who is the best clone of themselves, ignoring any bad behaviour and gushing over the good. They might pick up strays to enmesh with.

* They have an inconsistent sense of time – once they are emotionally aroused, it feels like an eternal now. They can't self-reflect to use their past mistakes for growth, and they can't anticipate the future. They'll do whatever it takes to make the uncomfortable emotions of now stop.

During our date, my BF left to be on the phone with someone for **30+ minutes**. When he came back, I jokingly asked him whether he was fired and inquired about who called. He stated that it was a fellow female brazilian jiu jitsu practitioner, whom he had sparred with the previous day. Apparently she didn't take the sparring session too well and needed to talk to him about it. I practice muay thai (a combat sport as well) and we spar with men all the time. We **do not** call our sparring partners demanding explanations for their rough tussling - our trainers (we call them Kru's) tell us to suck it up - women need the conditioning as much as men. 

I left the date early under the pretense that I was tired. I offered to pay for our meal and he declined, so I ordered an Uber and he demanded to go with me. Throughout the entire ride, he wanted to know why I was REALLY cutting the evening short. I told him that I needed space and he kept on probing the issue. He then wanted to know how long it took my last BF to piss me off this much (6 months btw), which IDK why he even asked me that. He kept on texting me asking me why I was mad but I haven't replied (I turned off my phone). I asked him to please give me space to cool off (but didn't mention why). My questions to you girls is:

* Am I being an a-hole? or was that completely rude of him?
* Is he an insecure male now? He was confident before, but after I got my boob job (on Halloween) he began asking me whether I would leave him.
* Is it wrong that I re=downloaded my dating apps (Hinge, Tinder, Okcupid, etc.)?

*It should be noted* that he has a ton of tagged pics with him and his jiu jitsu girl friends on Facebook. Maybe it's just me, but it's striking me as a low-value male trap to make it seem like he has a higher sense of worth.

Since I would be appreciative of those qualities coming from a man, I figured that he would be appreciative of them from ME, and reciprocate.


But men don't have the same mindset that women do, where we think ""good men are a scarce, rare commodity so I need to hold onto this one"". I made the mistake of projecting that onto them. Men don't think that a woman who emotionally supports him, lifts him up, and puts him first is a rare commodity. Those are just things that they feel entitled to from ANY woman. They figure since you did all of it, the next woman will too. Putting him first doesn't make him think you're high value, it makes him think you're low value.

I tried deleting and making new accounts but they always found me.

I used to think that I have to settle for men who are less than 6 feet, even though I looove tall men.

Well, I don’t have to. I’m attractive enough to have access to a pool of bachelors who have all three. I don’t have to settle for a man I’m not genuinely attracted to, just because he’s a good guy. I don’t have to give him a chance, just because he treats me well. Why? Because I can have a man who I’m genuinely physically attracted to and who treats me well. 

Ugly men aren’t the only ones capable of being kind to a woman. Hot guys are just as capable of being a high value man in terms of how they treat you. I’m so tired of seeing women settling for below average guys because society makes them think that that’s the best that they can get. No, it’s only society’s way of making sure that even below average men get women, to avoid them from causing chaos in society as in the case of incels. 

For the men asking, what do I have to offer? That’s the thing... you assume that the women here don’t have value by default because you can’t see what we’re like. A lot of us aren’t being unreasonable at all for having these standards.

We've all seen it. The guy who has his bank stub in his OLD profile, who promises shopping sprees and hotels as dates, who says he's looking for a ""sugar baby"". Ladies, these are not quality men. First of all, they think you're stupid and shallow. And if they're offering you, a stranger, money, they're doing this to other women. 

We at FDS want High Quality men, and creeps flashing stacks in their PFPs or basically asking to pay for sex are not High Quality.

Socialite: ""My goodness, Mr. Churchill... Well, I suppose... we would have to discuss terms, of course... ""

Churchill: ""Would you sleep with me for five pounds?""

Socialite: ""Mr. Churchill, what kind of woman do you think I am?!"" 

Churchill: ""Madam, we've already established that. Now we are haggling about the price.

Your happiness should come from yourself, not by what you believe someone could give you in the future. Hope and partnership should not be your standards to finding happiness. 

It is detrimental to you if you carry on a relationship you foresee not working out. If one person remotely sees incompatibility, it is doomed from there to not work. 

Being honest sucks especially if you’re a “yes” person (like I was). But you’re an independent woman. You can feel empathy/sympathy for the person you broke up with, but don’t feel guilt. Everyone goes through sadness so you know that they’ll overcome it just like you did. If they don’t, you do not need to take responsibility for their future actions. You effectively vocalized a mature, responsible decision for your well-being. 

Set boundaries and be blunt. I’m not saying you have to be hostile, but just honestly tell them it won’t work out. The ball is in their court and you are absolved from their future actions. If they decide to talk up a storm about how you’re this terrible person or keep contacting you, remember that’s not your fault. They just suck at taking rejection. They are ignorant that life isn’t always sunshine and rainbows. 

It may hurt a moment that you made that decision, but very soon you will find solace, I assure you. Just remember that you are the bearer of your own, personalized happiness.

Being selective is critical to your wellbeing. 

Do not accept sub par behaviour in the beginning of your courtship. Every time you rationalise away a red flag or poor behaviour you are creating a deficit to your mental health. You are devaluing yourself. The mental gymnastics you are required to employ if a man is behaving badly will only torment you when things eventually disintegrate. 

Secondly, your body. If he has no respect for your body or boundaries DITCH HIM. The purpose of selecting a mate is to 

a) secure a committed partner b) ( potentially) find a suitor to reproduce with. 

If he is not respecting your body or your boundaries - do not entertain a moment of this! If you eventually become pregnant with his child  - you will be in a very vulnerable position. Mentally, financially and physically. You will be at your weakest and if he no respect for you in the ""honeymoon phase"" of a relationship, he will certainly not offer you respect of courtesies when you are in physical discomfort and pain. 

A good test is always - ""Are this man's genes worthy of reproducing with mine? Will my offspring have a strong chance of survival with a man that shows me zero respect? Is this man WORTH being pregnant for? Does he have the resources to provide my genetic material with the best opportunities life has to offer'?

Never surrender your boundaries. Remember - you are offering them something deeply sacred - the opportunity for their genetic material to continue in society. Vet them with deep caution. A man with good character is crucial to your well being and mental and physical health. The wrong choice can lead you into a life of despair.",33882,Ladies - remember what is at stake - your mind and your body.,0,,,,1

&amp;nbsp;

**1. He describes his “type” as being innocent, petite, big eyed, and/or pale**. Along with this, he finds tattoos and piercings a turnoff and wants a woman that wears very little make up. He might recommend that you wear less. He also might like it was girls wear dresses or have a “cutesy” / “girly” style / look innocent. This one is easy because you can straight up inquire about what his ‘type’ is or if he finds x, y, &amp; z attractive.

&amp;nbsp;

**2. He uses words such as vile, disgusting, gross, contaminated  etc for things that are not physically so**. By this, I mean he uses this kind of vocabulary to describe situations in which there is nothing “gross” present (smells, tastes, physics sensations). It’s a kind of moral disgust. This is a little more subtle, but if you’re having good/long conversations it should come up. It just has to be more on your radar.

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Similarly, he might also be more sensitive to “germs” and “contamination”**. This doesn’t necessarily mean they are OCD in keeping their house clean, but they don’t like to get their hands dirty. They are beyond repulsed by the topic of menstruation. They might be obsessed with keeping things pure. He will also be more into virgins and might inquire about how many men you’ve been with.

&amp;nbsp;

**4. You have to learn his take on age gap relationships**. This might be a lot more difficult to determine,  but a good start is, how much older than you is he? If around 5 years, you could ask something like “so am I the youngest girl you’ve dated?”. You can also tell a story about an age gap relationship or something (if you can find a way to make it relevant) and see how he responds to it. If he is quick to express his revulsion to them, that’s a good sign. If you are still unclear of his exact opinion because he stayed mostly silent, there is a good possibility that he is not morally opposed to them. 


&amp;nbsp;

**5. He is very concerned with status and material things**. This is not always an indicator, and may not always be obvious if he can actually afford nice material things. If he doesn’t have an abundance of status indicators (cars, watches, etc) you should determine whether or not he is embarrassed by his lack of, because this means he is still very status oriented (just fails at building his).  Among men, young, beautiful women has become a sign of status. So if he is concerned with where he falls on the hierarchy he may be much more likely to lust after younger women ESPECIALLY if he doesn’t already have the other status indicators because he feels the young woman will elevate and validate him as a man much more quickly.

The problem is I am scared to get into that situation. I have had sex with upwards of 30 guys and there were only 2 or 3 of them who made no attempts to coerce me. All the others were really awful, and tried to pressure, coerce, guilt trip, and in limited cases physically force me into doing things I hated. The idea of getting into another situation like that where I may find myself confronted by someone who is trying to override my boundaries and coerce me, while I am in a situation that's difficult to instantaneously exit (if anything you have to put your shoes on and find the door) fills me with lots of anxiety. I just don't want to have to deal with a situation like that. I was also sexually abused as a child and being touched in certain ways fills me with sheer RAGE and it's hard to restrain myself from an instinctive, reflexive reaction of violence. It's grueling to try to explain that and then face someone's attempt to argue or convince me ""you'll like it when I do it,"" ""just try it,"" etc. Yes I can get dressed and leave but the idea of even being in that situation at all is exhausting to think about.

I'm going to give some background about where I am coming from I was raised in a very strict first generation immigrant African family so dating in high school was not really an option at all if I wanted a peaceful life so I just threw myself into school , writing , reading , creativity , volunteering , fashion , and I also discovered that I wanted to go to law school and started working towards that goal. So I graduated at 17 a kiss less virgin with virtually no real dating or relationship experience to speak of and looking back I kind of embraced it and was happy to have been able to graduate and accomplish a lot of things during my high school career. However after high school I obviously went to college and delved head first into dating and of course that meant that my first kiss was out of the way quick at 18 still a virgin though. I was raised with a great father who taught me and my sisters to have high standards and too see ourselves as the prize at all times. I’m thankful for him and how he brought us up and how he treated my mom with a lot of love and respect throughout their marriage.This followed me as I started dating as I did not tolerate any mess and have no reservations about blocking any guy that tried to mistreat me. However in the midst of me exploring dating and having mostly good experiences with a few bad I got very involved in my college campus , started traveling extensively , chasing my goals , and expanding creatively so boys and men were not really a priority. However during my second semester my family experienced a family death and a very traumatic experience so I decided to still go to school and move back home to support and help out. I decide to completely not date at all during that semester as I knew that I needed to give myself space to heal emotionally. I also had a fast track journey on truly asserting my self worth , self love , and self respect from the inside out by analyzing all aspects of my upbringing and life and deciding to improve. ( I’ve been on the path from like 14 but recently I made a lot of strides). Fast forward to the present I haven’t been on a date since January (which was a hilarious disaster btw) and I have recently had to assert my self worth by blocking men who were not respecting my time. This was after a string of men pursuing me and making plans , dates , and hangouts and simply not following through. While I definitely cut contact it still kind of hurt you know because im kinda tired of being alone.I have kept my standards high and other than one or two mistakes here and there of like texting first I just feel very drained and I can’t shake the feeling that something is wrong with me. I have deleted all my dating apps this weekend after some deep thinking and I just feel a little drained and lost by it all. I have reconciled that Although I want a relationship I would rather remain single forever than settle for a toxic messed up relationship just to assuage loneliness.I can’t shake the feeling subconsciously that something has to be wrong with me in the fact that I’m 19 and never have been in a relationship and that my time is ticking away. A lot of older people in my life keep telling me that finding a life partner in college is almost imperative as afterwords the chances dip and are low.(my parents met in college so this also plays into this) I’m about to go into the second semester of my sophomore year and the possibilities are very iffy at best. I’m also reconciling with the fact that I want to be a lawyer and writer as well as have a family and how I can have both dreams without compromising my hearts desires. It feels like everyone else is having a much better experience and I just feel alone. What advice would you give to me as I am feeling a bit lost with having to reconcile all of this. Should I change my mindset and make adjustments? How should I proceed when it comes to dating , relationships , sex , and love going forward? Is it normal to feel kind of lost  and a little bit disillusioned? Also is my experience out of the ordinary?",33673,"Just found this sub during a time where I am learning about myself , relationships , and dating.

Recently ran into the same issue with two different men.  We live in a city with public transportation, but nowhere near as elaborate as NYC. I have a luxury brand SUV that I’ve had for several years, I own it and it’s completely paid off. I have a parking spot in my high rise that I bought as an investment bc I knew it would be worth more than double it’s value by the time I sell my condo.  I work hard and feel that I deserve to  have a vehicle that’s nice and safe but also has some style because why the fuck not? Plus I’m total euro trash so of course I’m going to get a European make/model. I just like nice cars, sue me! 

Anyway, twice now I’ve met men who are otherwise successful, handsome, and have minimal baggage but then they drop the bomb on me. They don’t own a car. One of them even had their license expired (bonus: he’s terrified of flying so wtf do you never leave your neighborhood?). 

This doesn’t bother me so much from a materialistic standpoint but from a logistical one. 

Hey can you pick me up from the airport or after a procedure where I can’t drive myself home? Nope. Guess I’ll have to take a $50 Uber or ask a friend. 

Your place or mine? Well I guess I’ll drive over so you don’t have to trek here in the cold/rain/snow. Or worse- guess I’ll just come pick you up!

Let’s do a Costco? Oh I guess I have to drive. 

Let’s go to an event in the burbs (where a lot of our friends are moving as they have children and throw parties)... oh I guess I’ll be driving. 

Hey can you drop something off that I forgot - it’s an emergency? Oh yeah I guess you can’t. 

Sounds like a really boring and impractical life. 

Instantly I see myself being the fucking chauffeur in the relationship which is a very masculine role that I dislike. Sometimes I want to be picked up and whisked away on a nice date or getaway somewhere or a concert without having to deal with driving logistics. Sometimes I just want to be picked up by my man and have the security of not having to worry about transportation or dealing with parking. Sometimes I want to get wine drunk and be driven home! 

Sure, they think maybe not having a car in the city is more economical? It is for some but we are grown adults. I’d love to see how much money they blow on Ubers every month, too. That shit gets expensive. 

I just can’t see myself with a man that’s not mobile. Even and especially if it’s a casual relationship (which I prefer). I feel the burden would fall on me, or worse, they start expecting to borrow and use my car (this happened with one guy I dated when I was much younger and stupider) which is a big no from me dawg. Most people drive and park like shit. 

Side note: men who are poor drivers are a MAJOR turn off. 

Also, if a guy had a car but it’s a total clunker, I feel like it’s also a letdown. I don’t think it’s wrong to seek someone who can match your lifestyle. Plus, with unreliable crappy or falling-apart cars, I don’t feel safe and once again I feel like we’d start preferring and using *my car* more frequently. 

This has become an issue for me as bougie (and turbo euro) men who show off their flashy cars and go to douchey clubs annoy me but hipster/crunchy “cool” urban dudes that are hot are really starting to fall into this “minimalist lifestyle” thing as a scapegoat for not having to be a reliable and functional adult imo. 

Do I sound like an elitist asshole snob? It’s seriously a deal breaker for me.

But he really wasn't because he brought it up more times later, even though he had said he's okay with it. I don't remember exactly how and why, but after a few weeks of feeling really stressed about it, I decided to do it. I am not sure how much was him ""dread-gaming"" me or me dread-gaming myself to be honest. I had grown up quite defenseless to anybody who'd insist on a request and who said that everybody else does it. I gave myself PTSD from my people pleasing (and from being exposed to people who took advantage of it) and I'm still trying to recover. I thought maybe you ladies can help me.

The act itself wasn't a big deal I suppose but it still wasn't something that felt like an authentic expression of my sexuality, but after doing it (late unfortunately!) then it hit me, what FDS ladies have been repeating lately: He is not doing anything he isn't comfortable with, why should I? I told him I'm not going to do it again, to which he replied, 'don't worry, I'm going to make it chew gum first'. And he also pointed out to me, while we were watching a movie where a guy was doing it to another guy, that 'I should take notes'. To this day, watching oral sex references come up in movies can ruin my mood. Long story short, he broke up with me and didn't give me the chance to have sex on my terms again.    


After that, I perhaps naively posted on yahoo answers looking for some sympathy and for how to deal with the feeling of having been coerced, being complicit in the coercion etc. That was one of the answers I got:

I’ve been dating someone for a year now (both in college for masters/mid 20s). In the beginning I did really well but I’ll admit in the last few months I’ve slipped and let my boyfriend “get away with” a lot more. For example, I do way more chores than him and praise him when he does, like, 60% of the work I’ve been doing regularly. Or I just let it slide a couple times when he postponed or cancels non-concrete plans with me for the boiz. I could give a thousand other examples but from the posts I’ve read here I’m sure you guys know what I’m getting at.


I’ll admit I’m just not happy with the pushover bitch I’m starting to become. He’s even started initiating sex way less than he used to and I know things slow down over time but I’m getting increasingly worried it’s because I’ve lost sight of myself and my dignity has drained a bit.


One thing I’m working on is seeing him WAY less. We used to see each other 6 or even 7 (I know) days a week and I’m trying to cut it down to a maximum of 4. 


I want to know FDS: is it possible to bring a relationship back once you’ve let things slip a little? If so, what else can I/should I work on? I’m currently studying, working part time, meet with friends for lunches and such pretty regularly, work out 2-3 times a week.

Men do this not because they want to empathize with you, but because it's entertaining for them to hear stories about how you were sexually harassed, almost raped, emotionally abused in a relationship, etc. Men like this are highly likely to be predatory and abusive. A great way for them to find fresh meat is by asking these seemingly innocuous questions.

That, and they also use your stories as an ego boost for themselves. They think ""Oh I must be amazing, if she went out with him, if she dated him, if she married him"".

I have just realised something (that maybe most of you already know but cut me some slack please, I levelled up recently): STATISTICAL DATA IN REGARDS TO CALLING/TEXTING!

Ok, so maybe math is boring but I started counting the amount of times that a guy texts me first vs. when I text first. You start to see a pattern.

General info: met this guy at a club and he lives in a different city. I wasn’t too bothered with him because I’m focusing on myself, following a bad break-up. He is very charismatic, lovely to talk to , tall and very good looking and a year younger than me. I am around a 6/7 out of 10 and past me would’ve had a fucking field day and became a pick-me if a guy like this was interested in me. Present me has shit to do.

I almost texted a guy, I’m quite into, first (seems to be an HVM but too early to tell) but I decided to look through our convo to look at the dates and I see this:

FIRST DAY: He texts me first 
- a day later again 
- 3 week break (i say nothing) 
- texts me first again 
- texts me first again 
- next day I send a meme 
- texts me first again 
- texts me first again 
- texts me first again 
- I text him first 
- calls me 
- texts me first again 
- I text first this time 
- texts me first again 
- I initiate again
- texts me first again
- TODAY.

So these are different days entries. I can see a pattern forming where he doesn’t feel the need to initiate conversation because he knows I WILL DO THAT. Thus, chasing after him instead of him chasing me.

I know most of you will bounce on the 3 week break but I kinda needed that too as I had to get my shit together. Not being smothered then is actually a plus as I hate being pestered. I also had a break from social media then.

Moral of this story is: I ain’t initiating shit and if I “lose” him then good riddance babe. But most importantly: LOOK AT THE DATA ON HAND! If I didn’t I would have ended in an awkward position.",35484,How to be chased but also keep a balance so you don’t seem uninterested?,0,,,,1

At the time, I was working at a restaurant, and at the end of the night, around 2 AM I was getting in my car to finally leave.

Where I worked was on a strip of clubs and bars where a lot of college age students would go out and get drunk, very typical. I was already in my car literally about to drive off, when one kid about 22 years old, tried getting into my car claiming that I must be his Uber driver. I thought he was joking, so I laughed at him and said no, it’s not me and kindly shooed him off. 

Instead of just leaving me alone, him and like two of his buddies and his supposed girlfriend all start crowding my car and getting in. He was telling them “come on guys” and they were  already very drunk at that point. They all had their hands on my car started literally stepping inside and it was to the point where I had to pretty much lash out and like scream at them to get the fuck out of my car.

His girlfriend in the back is  looking at me, smirking with her hand on my car door handle. this was a few years ago so I’m happy to say that I haven’t had a chance to act like that in a while but I really was about to hurt that girl. 

These three beta males start screaming at me and completely berating me for kicking them out of my vehicle with the one instigator male taking away his girlfriend because she knew she was going to get punched in the face. A couple of male staff workers from my job had to come out and that’s when these betas decided to calm down.

To be honest with you, I was LIVID. The fact that people, especially these weak, little “men”, tried to get into my property, put their hands on my property and completely disrespect me. I absolutely let them have it. Now, it was at the point where I am about to drive off because they were put in their place. 

Before I leave one of them shouts out and talks about how to even say how cute I am and that he actually wants to take me out.  I called him a beta again, he said he was an alpha.  I finally drove the fuck away but not before he shouted again at me “ I’LL FUCK YOU IN YOUR SLEEP”

So, that’s my little story I wanted to share, I am quite excited to gain insight from other women who know that they’re Queenss. Hopefully, I can only enhance my own queendom by posting and reading.

Also, I wanted to add that I think the girl in my story’s behavior was equally appalling. she was in a position to help things out and become a peacemaker and she just aided these weak men  in terrorizing a random chick. they weren’t smirking for long, though!",35484,My encounter: Men treating you horribly only to ask you for sex...,0,,,,1

I see a lot of queens struggling to hold off on having sex within the first month of meeting a guy they like. I get it.

But I think we need to change the narrative of: “Wait to have sex because he’ll respect you more.” While that is a common *effect* of holding out for sex, it should not be the end all be all reason. 

Reasons to wait for sex:

1. Establish what will  be necessary in a successful LTR: Emotional intimacy. You BOTH need a chance to get to know each other first. Without the hormones and the orgasms and the pornified view you gave him when you were sucking him off two hours after your first date. Are you excited to see him because he made you laugh until your sides hurt? Cause you can’t wait to talk about your favorite obscure show together? Or just cause you’re grateful he paid for your drink and didn’t ghost you after plowing you in is basement? Give each other time to actually get to know each other besides the sexual. Sexual intimacy often gets confused for emotional intimacy when sex is introduced too fast, especially for women. 
2. Rediscover the art of prolonged seduction. Does anyone remember those titillating times in high school when you finally got the chance to hangout with your crush and after weeks of talking and crushing and day dreaming about this moment, you had your first kiss? Remember the electricity that coursed through your veins and the excitement in his eyes? Remember when making out on the couch was the most erotic thing in the world? A time when a kiss meant something? Now we are expected to shove a dick in our mouths loooooooong before a man would even consider holding our hands in public. First and second base are severely underrated and have lost their charm. Which is a crime imo. This leads me to my next point...
3. Train him to turn you on without using his dick. Now I’m no fool. I’m not expecting or even suggesting you should be a nun until you have sex. In fact quite the opposite. If he can’t make you cum (or at least try) he is a selfish lover. Hoping into bed with a man without weeks or months of perfecting foreplay is a recipe for an unfulfilling love life. With that said, remember to sloooooow down. Your body is a temple. Each spot should be reserved and highly guarded until you deem a man worthy to worship. One part at a time. Go back to high school mode and just keep it simple. Build that sexual tension for as long as possible. It’ll be worth it. 

In sum, waiting for sex provides relational clarity, emotional and sexual intimacy, and promotes a more vivacious and fulfilling sex life when the time comes. 

While it is true that men respect and chase women who don’t give up sex on a platter, waiting is so much more than a 1+1=2 manipulation game. Waiting benefits you on multiple levels when you meet the right person. It forces you both to practice self control and self discipline. Nothing valuable in life comes easy. For men or women. 

I see it like going to the gym and eating well. Don’t do it for attention. Do it because it’s great for your health and body. The attention will come. But it’s a by-product of doing the right thing for YOU. 

Ever notice how when you start doing queen shit for YOU, the perfect, men, jobs, opportunities, etc. start gravitating towards you at shocking rates? This is no different. 

Don’t withhold sex trying to “convince” a man you’re wholesome. Do it for all the reasons I listed above. 

Anyone have anything to add to the list? Does this resonate? I’d love to hear your thoughts!

Edit: Just wanted to add that I’ve been dating my high value man for 3 years. I made him wait and he took it like a man. He’s the man of my dreams and it was SO beyond worth the few months of self discipline.",35482,PSA: Why waiting to have Sex should have nothing to do with manipulating a man,0,,,,1

If so, then let’s use it as a reminder for those currently dating.

 As women we must keep our body like a temple. That means, not letting in stupid men that would otherwise be a waste of our precious time and energy.  

I also know that when women are young we have very high sexual needs and sometimes the hormones cloud our judgements causing costly mistakes that could be avoided.  

One trick I have found to combat this is to masturbate before a big date.  When you satiate yourself sexually, you won’t need to find the satisfaction outside of yourself, so you can be a completely clear-headed, cool woman for your meet up. 

Finding a way to satisfy yourself and enjoying it will help you make less mistakes overall in dealing with men. It also helps with the whole waiting 2-3 months thing. If you can wait a bit to jump his bones, he will love you all the more for it.  Men like waiting way more than they are willing to admit, so it’s a good technique to keep you chill when you are hanging out with that guy you have major fire with.  In the end it will be so much better. 

So this has been my trick for a while now and it’s really helped with meeting back up with exs, with dates, and with guys that I needed some serious clarity because my hormones were saying sex and my brain was saying NOOOOO. It will also allow you to keep your dignity and save your prize for the one who truly deserves it instead of the ones your hormones were screaming for at that moment. 

Hope this helps.",35482,How to Avoid a Costly Mistake,0,,,,1

# SF Bay Area - how bad is it?

📷 [Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)

I am (m40) initiating a divorce. Will move out soon, will fight to get as much custody over my 2 kids as possible.

I  heard horror stories that SF bay is really bad for dating. My dream  would be to meet someone with similar background/values to retire  together in 15-20 years. I am under an impression that all the women who  are left here are married as it is hard to survive here as a non-techie  single person.

My cosmetic  details: Eastern European, 5’11’, slightly overweight (I workout a lot,  muscular). Probably 7-8 out of 10, balding 😀

I’m  a techie, well-off, though I will be paying huge child and spousal  support (expect to be left with an equivalent of $300k income). Income  will increase in 5 and 11 years as my kids turn 18.

What are the chances to meet someone here?

I’ve seen some questions on here recently about how to apply the FDS philosophy while in a long-term committed relationship. Along this thread, wanted to ask you all a question for some outside perspective.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. He is a wonderful man and incredibly supportive of me in every way. From the beginning he has prioritized me, respected me, and treated me with the utmost care. However, there are some things I am unsure about. Recently we’ve been talking about buying a house and getting married. Because of his current income level he’s enlisting the support of his family to help us buy a property. They all have said they don’t want me to contribute to a down payment, but rather just help with mortgage payments after it’s purchased. They would be assigning both our names to the title. If it weren’t for his family we wouldn’t be able to afford a place. 

In general I should add that they help him out a lot financially in general. I work full time in tech, he’s an artist. Whenever we do things he doesn’t ask me or expect me to pay, but most of the money he spends on us comes from them. Do I have my head up my ass about this? Should I expect that he should be doing this without the help of his family? Ladies help me out here.",35463,Another long term relationship FDS crossover question,0,,,,1

The worst are the men who coach women because they basically are giving advice on how to date them and their Nice Guy ™️ bros. Popular women coaches are no better and are often handmaidens for the patriarchy. 

Coaching is big business and most coaches make unsubstantiated claims of success and post “testimonials” and minimize negatives. Here’s the thing: they do untold harm and destruction BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO “MAN BASH” or say anything even slightly negative about common bad male behavior in dating and relationships. Most mainstream coaches have strict rules for their “tribes” and don’t allow any talk about bad dating experiences because “positive vibes only” and not all men.

On a personal level this pisses me off because not only did their advice not work when I used it - it exposed me to more bad shit. I am not a victim of anything but my own stupidity and willingness to believe in so-called experts. And because I have critical thinking skills I was able to move on with lessons learned. But why should dating advice and coaches be unaccountable for their shit results from their terrible advice? 

Coaches know how bad men behave and justify the value of their advice over the safety and welfare of women. Their business model is to ignore male depravity and blame their client or say shit like: dating is hard, it only takes one, it’s a numbers game.

I found an article that aligns nicely with the FDS creed and wanted to share it with you. I hope it gives you inspiration to be your best self, leave a crappy relationship, pick yourself up when you're feeling down or help for whatever situation you find yourself in. 



https://kitschmix.com/signs-woman-youre-dating-major-game/




**1. Confidence.**


Self-confidence is one of the strongest pieces of the puzzle, and a confident woman is more likely to come out of a relationship unscathed. This is because she already knows who she is by herself, and she knows that she brings her happiness to the relationship – the relationship doesn’t bring happiness to her.



**2. Self-esteem.**


There are definitely some points of overlap between confidence and self-esteem, but there are a few differences, too. Someone can be confident and not have much self-esteem – they know what they have to offer, but they don’t know what they deserve. The woman with a solid self-esteem knows that no relationship is worth letting go of her own wants and needs, and she won’t put up with someone who doesn’t treat her as good as she’d treat herself.



**3. Allure.**


She doesn’t do the chasing – she’s the one being caught, but only because she let you catch her. She’ll mirror your effort, but not add anything extra to it. After all, why should she have to prove that you should want her? She doesn’t need this relationship – but she’s open to the idea of letting it happen.



**4. Time management.**


She’s not going to be the one to make the dates, but she’ll accept them when you ask – unless she’s got something else going on. She’s not going to make a new relationship her priority when she has other stuff going on. She puts herself first, and if you fit into the picture, you’ve got a spot – but she’s not going to carve one out just for you.



**5. Mystery.**


The woman with game isn’t going to let you know everything about herself. She probably even keeps things secret from herself, just so she knows she won’t let it all out. She’s got walls galore, and she’s not going to take them down for just anyone – you’re going to have to prove you deserve it first.



**6. Emotional unavailability – sort of.**


You’re not going to know exactly how she feels about you – which is very deliberate on her part. She’ll answer you honestly if you ask, but you’ve got to be brave enough to actually ask her. If you don’t ask, she’s not going to offer it up. That would be vulnerable, and she’s not about to let herself be vulnerable.



**7. Kindness.**


Just because she has game doesn’t mean she’s rude. In fact, she’ll be nice to just about everyone. She’s not using you or making you feel underappreciated – she genuinely wants to see you happy, too. But she’s not going to let you think you have any control over her happiness – because you don’t.



**8. Unintentional sexiness.**


She doesn’t have to try to be sexy – she just is. She knows it, but she doesn’t force it. Her confidence and self-esteem means that she’ll look just as sexy in a baggy sweatshirt and a messy bun as she does in 6-inch heels, or just as good in basketball shorts and a white tee as she does in a suit. It doesn’t matter what she looks like – she feels sexy, so she is sexy.



**9. Boundaries.**


The woman with game has pretty sturdy boundaries protecting her heart, and she’s not going to break them down just because you ask her to. These boundaries are built from learning how the game is played – and she will use them to her advantage whenever possible. She knows how to say no, and she understands when someone else says no. It doesn’t take away her power to let you win – because she knows she’s letting you win.



**10. Mad ghosting abilities.**


If you stop talking to her, that’s the end of that – she won’t beg you to come back into her life if you don’t want to be there. She won’t waste her time on someone who won’t put forth the effort. If you break up with her, you’ll never get that “I miss you” text. She won’t try to win you back. Closure is implied with her. That doesn’t mean she won’t be upset about it – but she will make damn sure you never see her in a position of vulnerability again, trust!",35466,Signs A Woman Has Major Game,0,,,,1

&amp;#x200B;

I'm using a throwaway account, but I've been following this sub for over a month now and its really opened my eyes. I implemented some of your strategies and found a really great guy who treats me like a queen. We've been seeing each other for over 3 weeks, haven't had sex yet, and he has made it clear he would like me to be his girlfriend when I'm ready (I told him I would like to wait for at least a month to make sure we're the right fit before going into a relationship. Just want to get to know him more). Great, right? So I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

He cooks me dinner, he wants to see me multiple times a week, everything cool until last week. I slept over at his house, but we didn't have sex. At some point in the night, we got talking about each other's types. He stated he usually goes for girls with my color and length in hair, but that I'm ""the first curvy girl he's ever been with."" Now, I know my body shape and I'm proud of it. I have a flat stomach, wide hips, and large breasts and bottom. Its very womanly, but I'm happy with it. In no way would I ever classify myself as fat, and I don't intend on going back to feeling shit about my body like I did growing up. However, he proceeded to show me pictures of his ex partners and they were all stick thin. Good for them, everyone is beautiful in their own way. I have never been able to have a body like that, even with an eating disorder. It's just not how I am made, and thankfully I've grown to accept and love myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

But something felt off. Why would he tell me this? I've wracked my brain trying to figure it all out and the conclusions never come up good. It felt like he was saying ""oh, you're the fattest girl I've been with"" or ""oh, I've never been with a girl bigger than these, you should feel lucky."" Its just put me off him at some degree. On top of all of this, while we were making out, he wiped his dick out and it was the smallest penis I've ever seen. Imagine if I just said ""oh, you're the first tiny dick I've ever been with."" I wouldn't, because I know that would crush his self confidence. 

&amp;#x200B;

Listen, I'm seriously doubting this is going to go any further because of the penis issue alone (good, penetrative sex is something I need in a relationship because its what my body enjoys, not just foreplay), but I really felt like there was potential emotionally with this guy. He made me feel beautiful and wanted until he didn't. Is his comment something worth throwing it away about? Would you guys take it as I would, or am I seeing it completely different than how it was meant? I just don't see the point in him saying that to me, especially the fact that he isn't some dude with washboard abs. He's average and we even each other out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Idk, just looking for some general thoughts and advice from you guys. I really value your opinions because you guys always tell it how it is. I've asked my friends and they said that he shouldn't have said that, but I feel like I need to hear your opinions before officially ending it (or not).

I have been on very few magical first dates where a guy has truly moved me. I have gone on a lot of average dates where I didn't care whether the guys followed up or not. However, when they do, I feel like I have to convince myself to like them. It's not that they're bad guys...it's that I don't particularly care for them. I feel like rather be at home alone, hanging out with my dog or doing yoga, rather than going on a date...even if that means getting out.

I think that if a guy doesn't truly move me on the first date, I'll never feel sparks. I don't know if time and getting to know someone can eventually establish that connection. I recently ended a relationship with a great guy. Every time we hung out, I would internally count down the minutes until I could go home. I figured that if I felt this way, I shouldn't force it.

I’m such a fool. I agreed to meet and yeah as expected he hasn’t changed at all. Just same fuckery. Tried to hold my hands and kiss me. Yikes. I didn’t let him do it.

But after this I felt really terrible and started blaming myself... why did I even bother to meet him and all that? Yeah he was cute and I fell for it again. Ha.

I stumbled upon FDS a while ago and I was amazed at how it fit into my mentality. There’s no “before FDS/after FDS” for me (as some people comment), I feel like I’ve always had this mentality. 

A few years ago I met a guy. He took me on lavish dates, got me whatever I wanted, was there for me, and we didn’t have sex for months. I held out. We ended up having a relationship for around 1.5 years. It was perfect - we constantly travelled, he took me to the spa, nice dates constantly at the time when our friends who had been dating the same time as us were barely going out, he got me jewelry, clothes, paid for my manicure/pedicure, sent money to my parents to help them out etc. I felt like he genuinely cared for me. He was wealthy but not too wealthy - I feel like I should add this in to say that he wasn’t spending pocket change on me. 

However he turned out to be a liar and a cheater. He was the worst gaslighter I’ve ever met. I was absolutely broken after him, and I feel like all the trips and dinners made me stay longer than I should have because I was blinded by the fun times and the money. Combine that with his lying and his fake “im here for you” acts, and that’s how I stayed in this relationship longer than I should have. I was in my early 20s where most guys could take girls out for dinner, but just not every week, so this guy seemed like a true HVM. 

After him I’ve had a few nice dates but I wasn’t looking for anything serious. Now, however, I think I’m ready for a relationship, but I’m scared to get with the same type of guy. How does holding out sex for three months make him show his true colours? It took my ex almost two years to show his colours and I don’t want to waste another two years of my life. 

Any tips, ladies? I’m almost finding myself repulsed by HVM because it seemed like my ex was one and I don’t want to waste time &amp; get hurt again. Thank you.",36629,"I was part of FDS before I even knew it, dated a HVM (or so I thought), but he turned out to be trash",0,,,,1

I get some variation of these question on OLD somewhat frequently. I'm wondering what your opinions are regarding the meaning or motivations behind these questions. They ask almost as soon as the conversation starts. The question rubs me the wrong way and I never answer and sometimes unmatch.

My initial impression is that they are gauging how easy it would be to meet up or I imagine, how convenient for them it would be to have a FWB situation (my profile gives no indication I am interested in a FWB situation).

Are these guys trying to make conversation or is there a sinister intention there that I'm picking up on? Is this a common experience for others on OLD?",36617,"Why Do Men Ask ""Where are you?"" On Online Dating",0,,,,1

So I have this classmate at my Uni, he started texting me a lot/ sending memes/ inviting me to “study sessions” alone with him/ over complementing etc etc and gets pouty if I do group hangouts and leave him out of it. All sounds really cute but he’s in my eyes not exactly asked me for a date. I think he has some potential but have been reducing time we spend together cause every after we spend a lot of time together he acts weird and “pulls back” , and I don’t chase so ofc I won’t initiate contact during his pull back time. 

Fast forward to last Friday, we went out with a large group. He got super wasted and made out with this girl I know, no one saw it and they both told everyone nothing happened the next day . But this girl needed advice on him so she came to me and told me the whole thing , so now I know it happened. Me and her aren’t friends but She doesn’t have a lot of friends and I helped her twice when she needed help, so I guess she kind of thinks I’m reliable. 

Now I’m wondering if I should just ignore him from now on? We have class together once a week and sit next to each other/ next to the same “group”. Do I just switch seats? And also ignore his messages? He messaged today but I’m not at all in the mood to talk to someone/ invest time In someone who sends such mixed signals.

I write this because I used to be where Kehlani is. 

I used to sit in my bedroom the morning after I'd cried myself to sleep, questioning my relationship and self-worth, wondering how much of what I experienced was what I deserved: the gift-less holidays, the forgotten birthdays, the continual cheating, the continual disrespect and low-effort that was shown toward me, that I accepted without question. 

But--! But--! But--! I cried to all my friends, You don't understand. He's misunderstood. He just needs to be shown true love. Actual love. I can show him that. 

Yet deep down, I was ashamed. I still wish I could take back all the trauma our relationship gave me, that I'm still unpacking. I stayed by his side, loyal and doting and hurting. I stayed, with the utmost patience and understanding for a person whose character I not only concocted but idealized. No matter how much me loving him hurt me, I stayed. 

And now I'm older, and I'm telling any Queen here who reads this that, you deserve roses. 

You deserve a healthy, functional, safe and loving relationship when the time comes for you to be in one. One where you don't wake up with tear marks from the night before and are spared and shielded from as much pain as possible, because your partner truly cares about you.

Love, true love, is reciprocal. Always. There is no question of ever begging to be loved or shown affection, or of playing a martyr all for the sake of it. 

That's not love.

On first dates I prefer lowkey casual environments so it was fine. 

I’ve always struggled with self esteem issues so on dates I used to try to figure out what type of girl the man would want and just fake my personality to get him to like. 

But since I’ve found out about this sub I’ve been working to take better care of myself and boost my confidence. So on this date I was able to relax and just be myself. I wasn’t worried about whether or not this guy would like me I just wanted to enjoy my wings. 

I kept reminding myself that I’m the prize and that this guy is the one that’s trying to impress me. 

I just let the conversation flow naturally and when there were drops in conversation I would leave it up to him to think of something else to talk about. He paid the bill and then we went back to my place to watch a movie. He picked up a pack of whiteclaws on the way back and we drank a couple of those while watching serial killer documentaries. 

We found out we had a lot of similar interests and cuddled for a while. He didn’t try to initiate sex he just let me chill. When he left I kissed him and it was a good kiss. I’m proud of myself for not sleeping with him right away.

He told me to let him know when I wanted to hang out again. Then he went home and I smoked a joint by myself and fell asleep feeling content. 

This morning he sent me a good morning text and I haven’t gotten one of those in a long time. 

I’m attracted to this guy but I’m not attached at all so if it doesn’t work out it’s fine I’ll easily be able to let it go. I do plan on seeing him again but Im still going to go on dates with other men   Right now I’m not even looking for a relationship  as I still have a year and a half left of college and I need to focus as much energy as I can into my career. 

The only thing I’m looking for from men right now is someone that respects me, I get along with, and can be a reliable source of dick as I can’t put in enough effort to maintain a relationship right now.

I went out for coffee last night with this guy I met on Tinder and had been talking to for about a week. We hit it off. I thought it might be fun to take him home on the first date. I’m an adult and I wanted sex and here it was. Sex was great, very attentive lover, nothing weird. Lots of cuddles and talking. He kissed me goodbye before he left and said “Please try to sneak out and see me. I don’t think I can go 9 days without seeing you.” (My parents arrive from out of state in a few hours)

I was completely floored when 20 minutes after he left, I received a video with his voice saying how I had a great time, sex was great, you’re a smart amazing girl, but there was no spark, I’m looking for the love of my life, I won’t be sending anymore messages. Along with a text that said “I’m sorry, I wish you all the best”

I think I would have been ok if this was an agreed upon one night stand, but this guy was laying it on thick. I don’t want a lecture. I know I was an idiot. I won’t ever do this again.

I’d like to fuck his life up a little bit though. He blocked me on Instagram prior to sending his message. Like that will stop me. He manages the social media for a large car dealership and is in their commercials and also is in sales. I have a video of his voice of him being an absolute douche. 

I’m so angry. I will sleep on this. But I’m wondering what your thoughts are about posting this video under a burner account and tagging him. Will I get into legal trouble? I want him to think twice about doing this to another girl, although I doubt he will.

No. Maybe, it’s because you have this irrational thought they he may turn out to be something, with all these things and more in the future. Because the present is irrelevant when it comes to the future. 

The only thing he is is what he is showing you currently. Tally those up and if they’re not more than you can count, throw him out. Don’t wait till later. Till you’re more invested.

So i was curious, what was the worst date you've ever been on before you found out about FDS and what was the worst date you've ever been on after FDS? All kind of dates included, not just dinner dates.

For me, i haven't been on bad dates after FDS (I started lurking about a month ago or so), i went on a couple of dates with a guy (his only major flaw is that he wasn't tall, below average height) which went good but i just couldn't get myself to be attracted to him and felt like i'm settling for less looks wise, at first it felt like if i would get to know him a little more i'll get attracted to him but it wasn't it. And i don't even look for ""sparks"" on dates, just good mutual connection and similar opinions. I was honest to him about it and he was very upset and tried to convince me to give it a chance but i feel like it would be a waste of time, mine and his. 

Before FDS, i feel like i had so many bad dates (not even neutral or okay ones) because of the same reasons, getting taken to dinner, they share their misogynistic opinions/talk about sex a lot/racism, i ask to change the subject as it makes me uncomfortable, going dutch when the check comes (not my thing, i never took out my wallet and pretended to want to pay for myself so he can say ""nah it's on me"", i thought it was obvious that it should be on him) so that was already a big turn off and then the guy proceeds to try and convince me to come to his place for drinks/movie, i always refused so the dates never got to second dates, i never actually texted them afterwards, mostly just blocked if it was a terrible date or just send a text saying i didn't feel we're on the same page, then block. Mostly they took me to shady places, they all said they're going to take me out to eat and that we'll meet at X place and walk to the restaurant but it didn't happen and i was too shy to ask about it so they didn't bother taking me out to eat, it's cheaper to get to know me while sitting on a bench in the park. Never again. It was weird because i made it crystal clear that i am only looking for a relationship and not hookups/exploring/fwb. 

Worst date 1: when one guy who asked me out admitted he took me to that low quality restaurant which was in his city and expected me to come to him because he wanted to eat those poorly made noodles and he didn't want to go alone since his friends were all busy so he invited me, i did go and the date went badly, kept bashing me for my political opinions and i already realized there won't be a second date and planned to leave and he didn't respect my physical boundaries and kept trying to kiss me when i said no plenty of times. When the bill came he said ""honestly i never pay because i feel like its ridiculous to pay for a stranger"" well, no wonder why during the date he told me how he asked out more than 20 women, 9 agreed to go on a date and there was never a second date, if you'll think of these women as strangers they'll stay strangers.

Worst date 2: when i went on a date with an older guy and he was very disrespectful, said he'll take me out on a dinner date but we stayed at the meetup place because he was too 'tired', was on his phone the whole date texting other girls and said it's normal because he has ADHD, started asking what Instagram filters to use for the photo he wants to upload, his friend called him on the phone and he talked to him for 30min in front of me and then said ""Yeah i'm with my friend here"" he didn't even introduce me as his date, he wore pajamas and flipflops and i kept asking if he wants to go to a restaurant because it's freezing cold outside, the date ended when his friends texted him about meeting up rn and it felt like he just had a free hour or two and didn't want to be alone so he spent it with me, i was hoping he would at least apologize or find an excuse or ask me if i got home safely. He didn't. I stupidly texted him after 3 days of no contact (big mistake) asking if we can catch up and have a second try, he asked if it can be at his place and i said no i want it to be at a proper place and he agreed. We didn't text for a week afterwards, i didn't want to seem needy and he straight up didn't care enough to text, the night before the date we planned i texted asking if its still relevant. He left me on read, i double texted the next morning and he left me on read again, he texted me 40min before the date (I already made plans with a friend by then and was already out) saying ""I'm with friends"", no apology, not saying he'll make it up for me, no lame excuse, he just straight up didn't care enough. I didn't respond to the message, i used to be one of those long paragraphs girls who would try to explain you where you're wrong but i thought to myself ""why? he's not going to read it anyway. he doesn't care."" and i blocked him, ever since i stopped sending long paragraphs and i adopted the mirror behavior, how you treat me is how you'll get treated, no more no less.",36490,"Ladies, what's the worst date you've ever been on before FDS and after FDS?",0,,,,1

These days, going out for drinks is usually the go-to first dates for millennial women who enjoy social drinking. It’s a low pressure way of getting to know someone and you can relax at the same time with your glass of Riesling. If you don’t like him, you can easily make an excuse and leave after your first drink. This was my main reason for having done a lot of drink dates throughout my dating life. That and the fact that I was afraid that if we do a dinner date, he might ask me to split the check. At least with drinks, if he wanted to split the check, it won’t be as expensive. 

My outlook has changed since then. 

**Be girlfriend material. Make it expensive to take you out to filter out low effort men.** 

Accepting drink dates will not yield you men who are looking for relationships and it will place you in the category of a “fun girl” instead of a girlfriend/wife. If you’ve met a man socially and he asked you out on a date, requiring that he take you out to dinner will call for more financial investment on his part, which is one of the ways you can tell if a man is serious about you. Plenty of men offer drink dates because it’s a low financial investment on his part and it allows him to see as many women as possible. A man who only wants to do drink dates after you’ve stated that you only do dinner dates is a red flag and I would personally pass on that man. Remember that a lot of men do drink dates because they know that alcohol smoothes the way for sexual encounters. 

What if you meet someone on a dating app? Now, should you still expect a dinner date from someone you’ve never met before? My answer is still yes. Online dating is notorious for attracting men who are only looking for something casual, so it’s even more imperative to only do dinner dates if they want to take *you* out in order to filter out low effort men. Before embarking on a date, do a pre-date phone call first to test for conversational compatibility and to make your expectations clear beforehand. (I’ll write a post on this soon.) 

**You need a sound mind to filter men.**

Don’t drink during the first few dates with a man. Why? This will allow you to have a sound mind when it comes to filtering a man — does he pass your standards, does he have dealbreakers, does he seem like a good person? You need to be able to judge a man’s character with an alert mind. Being under the influence of alcohol makes you focus more on the “fun parts” of the date like how attractive he is and how much you like kissing him, instead of analyzing if he’s the right fit for you and if he’s boyfriend material. Abstaining from alcohol also helps you determine quickly if you two have real chemistry. Alcohol will make you think that you have more chemistry than what you actually have. Plus, why would you want to go out with a man who’s only fun when the two of you are drinking? Many women don’t successfully enter relationships because they date the wrong men, and this is because they’re under the influence of alcohol during the early stages of dating. 

**So what should you do instead?**

For first dates, I recommend dinner dates. You can do one in 90 minutes to an hour to see if you'd like to see him again. Do a pre-date phone call beforehand to see if you're on the right page, to communicate your expectations, and to make sure it's worth it to get all dressed up for him.",10879,Drink Dates: Don’t Do Them if You’re Looking for a Relationship,0,1569956954.0,,,0

These past few weeks have been a little weird romantically. I broke up with my boyfriend and it opened it the flood gate from orbiters and new proposals. One in partially is a college aged guy, to put in perspective, I’m 17. We only talked casually about basic things until he learned I was single again.

I think he thought he was being smooth or sexy, or maybe he thought he was “taking charge” but he started demanding things out of me. If I didn’t text him or snapchat him he’d make passive aggressive “jokes” and eventually he’d just start demanding that I snapchat him. Of course I didn’t listen to this stuff and snap-chatted him on my own time, because I do enjoy his conversational skills. He began asking me about my sexual history and making inferences from my post history on reddit. He made this grand proposal that when I turn 18 he’d ‘bless my life’ by ‘allowing me to have sex with him’. When I told him it was an absolute no in every way, and that my sexuality doesn’t even work like that, he completely glossed over it and began sending me a barrage of pictures and said “next time you get horny, think of me”. I made it very clear that I HAD to laugh.

I didn’t talk to him for three days after that. Than one night he reappeared with usual “snap me rn” (which I always ignore) and when I read it and didn’t respond, he called me through snapchat’s call feature. I could tell he was trying to put on a sexy, just woke up voice. It sounded like a needed a glass of water. He started going on about how I should talk to him instead and he can show me some fun and at this point almost every girl on earth knows what this means, regardless as to if they’ve talked to any boys at all. I responded by asking him if he knew who Chris Hansen was and quickly screenshotted and circled the wiki article that stated that Chris Hansen does work on catching predators, and I told him that if he doesn’t stop you’ll end up taking a seat with him. He got pissed, hung up and started texting me saying how I was acting like a teenager and how I was rude for saying it. Sir, I’m acting like a teenager because I LITERALLY am a teenager. The next day I told him that I wasn’t a fan of our convo and even though i’m young the mind games he attempts to play on me are gross and made for babies. I promptly blocked him.

The second guy has been a heavy orbiter ever since he confessed his crush on me, though I will admit he has very high SMV but RMV is on the oppositeness of the spectrum. Constantly comments heart eyes on my posts on instagram and anything I put on instagram. I don’t let it get to my head, he’s not the kind of guy I want a relationship with. Whenever we do hold conversation, he instantly steers it to how he wishes I would “give him a chance” and that i’m stupid for not wanting to try it all within the same breath with a sing songy voice and cutesy pout. Anyways, I posted kind of a psa about not being on your phone at all while driving. He slid up and made a joke, relating it to mario kart. Of course, after I told him it was funny he started complaining again that I should say yes to his date instead of posting random stuff on snapchat.

I told him clearly that I posted that because that night a woman that was in her phone almost t-boned me, causing me to swerve and almost roll the car over. I got out safely and unharmed but it shook me up so badly he left me crying. Apparently this was funny to him.

***Men speak what they want into existence - no matter what they have in life!***

&amp;nbsp;

Men survive on their ability to lie and obfuscate. And Lie they do. OMG the lies they tell.

&amp;nbsp;

Then they find some woman they can scare, intimidate, and bully into accepting it. The more desperate they are, the more intense the lie and intimidation.

&amp;nbsp;

That’s it. That’s the game. Lie like Pinocchio until someone believes in you.

&amp;nbsp;

It’s not magic. It’s not superior cunning. It’s sheer stubbornness, self importance, narcissism, stupidity, and physical intimidation. ***All men have in life is the Audacity.***

&amp;nbsp;

It doesn’t matter if any of the shit he says is true or not or even if he really believes it - they just have to get a woman -or a few - to believe in their bullshit to make it real.

&amp;nbsp;

And when or if it doesn’t work? They cut and run to find another target or they pick a hill to die on.

&amp;nbsp;

***Their entire self identity is crafted from nothing but belief in their own desire and sense of will.***

&amp;nbsp;

This is why repeated failure makes men homicidal and/or suicidal

&amp;nbsp;. 

This is why that crazy guy on the street cursed you out when you turned him down for a date.

&amp;nbsp;

This is why that guy you thought you were vibing with suddenly disappeared.

&amp;nbsp;

This is why your ex is on Instagram pretending he’s pulling women left and right when he’s really at the club begging girls for pictures.

&amp;nbsp;

You threatened their already fragile self identity in some fundamental way.

&amp;nbsp;

***When your identity is based on nothing, it feels like you’re constantly being threatened.***

&amp;nbsp;

Why do they do this? They’re males, sis. This is what males are at their core, and this is what they do.

&amp;nbsp;

They Beat their chests and act like they’re something they’re not and bigger than they actually are. Just look at our primate cousins for proof:

https://youtu.be/yHzugoaktbk

They ought to call this “Males Capping in The Wild.”

&amp;nbsp;

Men are expert manifesters in this respect.

&amp;nbsp;

They’ll talk all about how they only date 10s all day while going home each night to sit in their basement eating Cheetos.

&amp;nbsp;

Then they eventually stumble upon a woman with weak enough self identity to believe it. He convinces her how lucky she is that he’s considering dating her, since he only dates 10s usually (*wink*wink), knowing damn well he hasn’t seen a single woman naked in years.

&amp;nbsp;

A woman who does not have a narrative for her life mapped out will be easily disrupted by the plethora of males with a more vivid narrative than hers, who are more practiced at maintaining it in varying situations.

&amp;nbsp;

This is what people mean when they say you need to work on yourself or “you teach people how to treat you”

&amp;nbsp;

A woman with strong boundaries has created a narrative for her own life so vivid and secure that it is impenetrable to bullshit. She may not know if what he’s claiming is true or not, all she knows is he does not fit her vision for her life, and that is enough. She won’t manifest his lie into reality.

&amp;nbsp;

***You’re the one who gets to choose to make him real or not. You can leave Pinocchio as a puppet or turn him into a real boy.***

Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.” I wish that you all can take these words with you and relinquish your anger, set yourself free from the burden of hatred.

Always, always (always, always, always) require your partner to wear a condom. No questions. No condom? No sex.

Guess what! Your hookup/dating partner/random dude at the bar is gonna *fucking hate that*! And that's not your problem! Only one or two guys I've ever hooked up with didn't whine, bitch, or try and get me to *not* expect that they use a condom. Women are [biologically way more susceptible to STDs](https://www.fhi360.org/sites/default/files/webpages/Modules/STD/s1pg22.htm). Any guy that pressures you is not going to be a good father, or sit at the abortion clinic with you if something goes wrong. Even if you really like this guy, just think about the guys you've \*really liked\* in the past who turned out to be shady or shitty. I'm not saying assume the worst of every guy, but I'm definitely saying be realistic about how a good portion of men operate. They'll say they got tested and are clean (even if they haven't). They'll say they never have unprotected sex with random people (except ***you*** for some reason?!). Don't buy it.

I made a handy guide for how to handle the inevitable excuses and guilt trips you will go through:

* **If he says, ""it reduces sensitivity, it doesn't feel as good!""** You say, *""Not my fucking problem"".* 
* **If he says, ""I can't stay hard with a condom.""** You say, *""Not my fucking problem.""*
* **If he says, ""I didn't bring/don't have any condoms.""** You say, *""Guess this isn't happening, buddy.""*
* **If he says, ""I just got tested/I'm clean/don't worry.""** You say, *""Congrats! Get a condom anyway.""*

Never, ever, ever put yourself at risk for some guy's bad lay. This is coming from a former weak ass bitch who would let herself get talked into having sex without condoms because I wanted him to *feel good* or *like me* because I didn't like or respect myself enough to say ""fuck off"" to any guy that would put me at risk for his own temporary pleasure.

In my experience, there is no discernible different between sex with and without a condom for women (other than having to listen to men complain about it) and men know that, so they try to guilt and shame and cajole us to avoid using condoms. But no. We need to stand firm and protect ourselves. I've seen too many women catch STDs or deal with unplanned pregnancies because the guy stealthed them, complained about condoms, or otherwise just didn't take precautions. 

Always remember: every guy is 20 swipes away from being replaced. You do not need to ever put yourself at risk, and you are worth vastly more than that.",9148,PSA: Condoms. Always.,0,1569762290.0,,,0

recently I’ve found that I can’t even share things with some of them because i get comments like “you’re salty”.  All I shared was a screenshot of a text with a dude that went MIA for a week and popped up again. 
I don’t grasp what was salty about me taking an hour to reply (i was dozing in and out of sleep) and my response was brief (2-3 words) and I cut the conversation. — so maybe me bringing it up to the friend sounds salty because she thinks i shouldn’t talk to the guy but that’s just BS to me. i didn’t bitch the guy out or say “how come you haven’t texted me in days?!” or even come off argumentative. 

(Sorry to ramble on but my friends and I can discuss anything, it’s just that our dating lives are very different so they claim they would do this or that but they’re not in my shoes and they don’t have any idea of this sub. )

anyway my point is i’d rather come here and seek your input on something. 

this guy and i had been taking since last month. 4 dates and sleepover. he seemingly wanted something physical and I was into it. I waited til the 4th time because I felt like it. his text initiating dropped and i mentioned how he didn’t text me back and he jokingly called it nagging.  so i pulled back and left him alone. 

we didn’t talk again and it’s been a week. last night he texts me saying “Hi don’t forget about me” and I could’ve been bitchy and replied with a “salty comment” like “why shouldn’t I, seems you’re forgot about me” or other dumb shit that I would never say, even if it crossed my mind. Anyway I didn’t reply for an hour (i was in and out of sleep) and he texted again. I simply said “Hi 👋🏻” ...he replies “wake up” (trying to be playful as we were before) and I said “eh, i’m sick). this morning he’s asking what’s wrong. I replied with 5 words max and he told me to feel better. I thanked him and that’s it. 

would you call this. dead situation? because it seems to me like it is, judging by a whole week of no texts and me finding this sub.  
i’m not gonna ask questions or bring anything up to a manboy who is clearly insecure and just seeking attention because I stopped looking for his.  i’m tired of his bullshit behavior. I’m also tired of opinions of my own friends who don’t know what dating is actually like nowadays.

Um excuse me? You want beautiful women Mr Man. Have men ever done a trip to the beauty store and calculated how much those products cost? And they run out too. At least every 6 months. 



I’ve spent a year out of work. I invested in shares in order to live off them for a year while I studied music as a passion year. My course is over, it was amazing, and I finished off my fantastic year by travelling to Europe for a month. 


I know how to look after myself financially. 


I don’t need a man for money. 



I’ve never had a man pay for my dinners.  


I’ve also never had a man treat me right. 



Perhaps my independence was too much for them, or perhaps I kept dating fixer uppers. Whatever the case, I’ve spent all my money and am going back to work. And I’ve run out of some of my makeup and it’s frustrating the hell out of me that even my super duper minimalist makeup routine is prohibitively expensive right now while I await my first pay check in a year. 



Why is this cost invisible to men? For the lurkers who want to rage on our ‘gold digging’ whilst simultaneously justifying your own desire for beauty. Realise this. It costs money to wear even the light ‘no makeup makeup’



I don’t want men’s money. I wish I had known though, that men put their money where their mouth is. And going Dutch means he doesn’t value a woman. 


I also highly recommend women take their financial matters into their own hands. Read books. Seek advice. And always keep a seperate account. For safety reasons. 


If you do decide to become a mother. During your time off work - your husband should be covering your usual retirement deposits. 



Say for example you take a year off and usually would have $6000 invested into your retirement account. That is now his cost. Women retire with half the balance of men not only due to lower paying jobs but because of the timing of the time out of work. Taking a year off with 30 years of compounding interest to go is what results in our major wealth disparity.",36760,Money money money,0,,,,1

30% of women experience pain during sex .. wow

https://theweek.com/articles/749978/female-price-male-pleasure

&gt; That matters, because nowhere is our lack of practice at thinking about non-male biological realities more evident than when we talk about ""bad sex."" For all the calls for nuance in this discussion of what does and doesn't constitute harassment or assault, I've been dumbstruck by the flattening work of that phrase — specifically, the assumption that ""bad sex"" means the same thing to men who have sex with women as it does to women who have sex with men.

&gt; The studies on this are few. A casual survey of forums where people discuss ""bad sex"" suggests that men tend to use the term to describe a passive partner or a boring experience. (Here's a very unscientific Twitter poll I did that found just that.) But when most women talk about ""bad sex,"" they tend to mean coercion, or emotional discomfort or, even more commonly, physical pain. Debby Herbenick, a professor at the Indiana University School of Public Health, and one of the forces behind the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, confirmed this. ""When it comes to 'good sex,'"" she told me, ""women often mean without pain, men often mean they had orgasms.""

&gt; ""men and women imagined a very different low end of the sexual satisfaction scale.""

&gt; While women imagined the low end to include the potential for extremely negative feelings and the potential for pain, men imagined the low end to represent the potential for less satisfying sexual outcomes, but they never imagined harmful or damaging outcomes for themselves. 

&gt; An 8 on a man's Bad Sex scale is like a 1 on a woman's.

&gt; Because we live in a culture that sees female pain as normal and male pleasure as a right.",36748,"Stats on painful sex, and what people consider ""bad sex""",0,,,,1

It is not enough to just set them, you need apply them. 

Your boundaries may be different from the next woman’s boundaries. That’s okay. If you personally have zero tolerance for a lying man —whether it’s a white lie or he’s lying about his age—cut him off the first time. When you pick up on red flags earlier in a relationship it is easier to move on. 

During the first few months of dating people are on their best behavior. If he’s lying in the first few months how do you expect him to act in 2, 4, 6 years. 

Your boundaries are your friend. They help weed out the men who want sex or a relationship for the minimum effort. Bare minimum boyfriends turn into apathetic and passive husbands which created resentful wives. 

Boyfriends who are  wishy-washy when it comes to showing you their affection and how much they love you aren’t all of a sudden going to become attentive adoring husbands. 

Your boundaries and standards do not make you a bitch. For instance, there is nothing wrong with a college educated woman with a high paying career wanting a college educated man with a high paying career and refusing to settle for less. There is nothing wrong with an ambitious woman wanting an equally ambitious man and won’t settle for manchildern or lazy bums. If you do half the house work and expect your boyfriend to do half the house work too it doesn’t make you a nagger.

I’m not a model but I have never had problems with guys. I’m pretty confident. But he’s so shy that whenever he needs to talk to me completely avoids eye contact, which he doesn’t with other women. 
His friends tease him when I’m around, make jokes and have made quite a few comments to me about him being interested. Some in a tactful and respectful way, others not so much. Not that it bothers me because it’s always been in a playful context and not to offend. 
Today, I made clear to one of his friends I’m interested in the shy guy. Let’s see what happens.

2. What's wrong with splitting the bill? I \*completely\* understand the ""putting women first"" thing, but if both parties pay for their OWN food and the woman isn't paying for the man's food, how is that favoring the man?

We had similar goals in life and we became exclusive for few months until he just dropped the ""I fell out of love with you"" bomb despite him being head over heels for me few months ago!! We had plans of getting married already (which is by the way my whole goal. I wanted to find a man who will marry me). 

I saw the posts here and realized my biggest mistake: I was too available for him. 

I fell in love and gave him everything I have now he's done with me because being available and giving 100% of me made me look so easy for him.

I mourned and now I'm done. Seeing the posts here made me realize some stuff and my actual worth.

Before we became exclusive I dated men with high value and they chased after me. Spent a lot of money for me. Gave me everything I hint that I want. Some of them even flew to my country just to date me only for me to say no but it never stopped them. 

During my mourning process I had this shitty thought that I'll never find a man like him and BOY I was so wrong. I'm not unlovable. I'm worth it. I'm a queen and I had men chase after me. Men in high positions, men who can pay for my vacations, men who can just drop so much money just to buy me shit I think of. I realized why they were so head over heels for me. I didn't give them a single fuck. I was so unavailable to them because I was too focused on dating this guy who, now, just broke my heart into millions of pieces.  I have so many options and I should never make myself too available for someone. 

Women, thank you for making me realize all of this. You guys just made my whole healing process faster and soon I'll be ready to doll up and meet new people. I know my *worth* and I'm gonna act like it.

Well... it turns out that's an easy way to get yourself to 25 without ever having sex! 

Because most guys, especially young ones (20s), behave in a manner which I don't respect and therefore, I cannot psychologically allow myself to be intimate with them.

Hey I just wanted to get some advice and feedback on this situation. So about 1 month ago I met this amazing guy on a dating app (36M), and I thought I was living in a dream. I’m a 26 year old woman btw. So I'm somewhat picky, but he pretty much checks almost every box of what I want in a person. Also when we met I felt an instant, almost karmic soul connection. I have never been comfortable with someone as quickly as 1 date. It felt like we had known each other for years. He said he felt the same way. Our first date was actually so amazing that he extended it longer, and the next day asked to see me (so our second date was literally the day after our first date).

So I'm going to try to make this brief and sum up the most important parts, but I need to give you some background so you understand. Since even before our first date, he was not big into texting (I'm not either), and he has mentioned that he is horrible at texting. Also he owns his own company, is a workaholic, and is extremely successful (multimillionaire status). I feel like these factors contribute to my confusion about our communication. We recently had our fifth date together. We slept together on the third date (not sure if that matters), and had an amazing sexual connection. Here is where my confusion is, and what my question is about...between dates, we have barely texted. So I'm very confused on how he feels. I've known him a little over a month, so we have went on about 1 date a week. I am someone who almost never initiates communication with a guy, but with him I have found myself initiating communication quite frequently...or else I feel like our connection will fade. For example, a lot of times on our dates, aside from texting right after to let him know I got home, that was it...for about 3-4 days there would be silence unless I reached out. Once I reach out he responds rather quickly, and after I reach out he has usually initiated hanging out again.

So obviously he is into me if he keeps asking me on dates and spending time with me. Also he is extremely sexually attracted to me, and makes that really clear. It's just, if he is barely initiating communication with me between dates what am I supposed to think? It's really confusing. We've been on 5 dates and I want to continue seeing him, but I don't know what to think when I don't hear from him for days and then I have to reach out. I am not into small talk or texting a lot either, I'm not very needy, but it's nice to check it once every day or every other day especially in the beginning stages of dating so I know he's still into it. So my question basically is, what do you think about his communication? If he has been consistently inviting me on dates and acting into me, why would he be putting so little effort in communication? Should I even keep initiating communication or let him reach out? I really don't love doing it, but I'm so serious about this guy. He checks every box and I can really sense a future with him, so I want this to work out. I have no interest in pursuing anyone else. If we have a sixth date (I am confident we will), should I mention the lack of texting and say I don't know how he feels? I'm not sure how to say how I feel without coming across the wrong way (desperate, insecure). I'm really not into games at all and just want to be honest. Also, any overall feedback/advice is totally appreciated on this entire situation, I love hearing thoughts/feedback from outside sources.

Secondly, it gives you the opportunity to test their sexual self control. If you have to ask a man more than once to leave then you know he’s going to be a pushy boundary disrespecting asshole. You have to start to get him Trained up the first time.

**A bit about me:** I wasn't born good looking or with good social skills. I dedicated around 3 years of my life to approaching thousands of women and going through a painstaking process of improving fashion, fitness, vibe, conversational skills, and everything else to become good enough to pull women home every time I go out.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/cz5ny6/my\_insane\_3\_year\_pickup\_journey\_from\_hardcase/](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/cz5ny6/my_insane_3_year_pickup_journey_from_hardcase/) 

I'd say that this whole process was a lot harder than I expected and I had to really hone in on all of the fine details from facial micro-expressions to body language to even getting elevator shoes to actually see real results. I'd say that the dating world was incredibly harsh for me so I learned to become a ruthless and manipulative person in order to get results. I honestly think that based on my experiences, the average woman is significantly smarter than the average guy as they are able to sense even the slightest fuck-ups or inconsistencies in my facial expressions and tell that I'm up to no good and I really had to practice thousands of times to actually get it right. I'm not kidding when I say I've had an easier time selling software to multi-million dollar companies than picking up women. Women are smart and have great natural instincts and social awareness. It got to the point where I seriously started to wonder why the elite power holders and decision makers in society are mostly men and not women. Then, I had my first few relationships and figured it out: Women go from smart to retard levels the moment they fall in love with a guy.

**Here are some of the biggest mistakes I see women making:**

1. **They become completely different people after having good sex with a guy.** There's so many instances where I'll be chasing a girl and she's genuinely smart and socially savvy, but as soon as we fuck, they start to chase me and I'm in complete control of the relationship. Oftentimes, I'm not even intentionally trying to form trauma bonds or get into abusive relationships. The women just become so retarded and attached after sex. They'll start cooking and doing favors and I'm just like, ""what the fuck?"" and exploit the fuck out of them with no repercussions.
2. **They suck at power games after a relationship is formed** \- This is something that puzzled me because like I said, I really do believe the average woman is many times smarter than the average guy but for some reason, whenever I get into a relationship whether it's fuck buddies or a Long term girlfriend, they completely lose all sense of self respect and let me walk all over them. I don't even use sophisticated tactics. All I do is occasionally threaten to leave whenever they do something I don't like. That's it. I threaten to leave, then walk out the door and every single time, the girl will call me and beg for me to come back after a few days. It's pathetic, honestly. I never viewed them in a different more loving light after they beg me to come back. I just think to myself what a pity it is that these otherwise strong, capable, professional women can't even stand up for themselves. I would never be able to make a guy cook, clean, and do laundry for me. Never in a million years unless I paid him. Yet with women, it's simply a matter of threatening to leave over and over again until they start doing everything I ask. I think girls need to learn to be stronger and actually start dating other men and calling bluffs.
3. **They focus on looks and sex after a relationship is formed** \- I don't think I've ever wanted to get married with a girl just because she's really good at sex, yet I see all the time, girls try to have a lot of sex over and over again with guys they really like to try to lock them down. It does not work. I've never felt any emotional connections just from pure sex and looks. What women should do instead of find some way to help a guy on his personal mission in life. Most guys women are attracted to have strong personal presence and charisma which comes as a result of following their personal mission in life, whatever it may be. If women could just find some way to fit into that personal mission, then the guy would be happy to propose marriage or any other thing without any begging. Find some way to help out in the personal mission without giving away all the power and form a relationship based on mutual respect.

That's my thoughts. If only women could learn to separate their emotions from their decision making and learn to play more tactically and strategically post sex, I really think they would hold most of the power positions in society because they have naturally better social skills than men. People say women aren't as mentally tough as men but that's mostly bullshit as well. The highest level ultra-marathoners are women. Just stop letting emotions get in the way of sound logical decision making in relationships after sex, it's that simple.",21852,My observations on female dating strategy as a Guy who approached thousands of women,0,1572201329.0,,,0

He’s an extremely nice and genuine person (as in he’s not doing it for show. I even DMed a girl from his Instagram profile who he was friends with in Highschool and she said he’s one of the nicest people ever). He’s about 5’9, so not super tall, but he has a very cute face and smiles a lot. I’m 18 and a freshman, and he’s 20 and I believe is a junior. Anyways, we’re both college students, at universities about 2 hours apart.

So we’ve been snapchatting back and forth and occasionally texting as well, just getting to know one another and stuff. Sometimes I leave his snapchats on read just to see how he reacts and he usually double snaps me, so it gives me the vibe that he cares. 

So now the main topic. He said he really wants to see me, and wants to get to know me better, so I told him to come over here. So he drives to my university, we meet in person. He’s just like he was online, very nice very friendly, we go out to eat and he pays, the whole 9 yards. So we get back to my dorm and end up doing it. And this is where I can’t get past mentally.

The sex was awful. I’m not gonna lie, his dick was slightly below average (like MAYBE 5 inches) and I couldn’t really feel anything to be honest. I could tell he was really trying to pleasure me, but physically it was just not possible whatsoever.

When he left he seemed kind of embarrassed, and now he’s been talking to me less this week. This whole thing happened over the weekend. My problem is that I really do like him, I just need to be sexually pleasured and he’s not doing it for me. At the same time I’d feel kind of guilty breaking it off with someone who is basically ideal, doesn’t act like a typical mood, and actually cares about me, just because of sex.",21682,Should I break it off with him?,0,1572198614.0,,,0

So nice to have found this thread.

So the other day I was watching a documentary on Alec Missnik, or whatever his name is, and I kind of fell down the rabbit hole of incels and I was deeply disturbed. If you don’t know what they are, please, go look them up.  They would have remained in meme obscurity had this Alec guy not tried to mow over 17 people with a truck, killing 10 of them. Killed them! For literally just being women. 

I have never hated a man and trust me I have reasons from here until next year for hating them.  Despite having been raped, cheated on, stolen from, had a gun pointed at me, a knife in my face, screamed at, shamed for no reason, and been lied to—the way these men hate women is way more than I have ever hated them. 

And I thought, wow what gall these motherfuckers have.  They sit there in their underwear—probably—masturbating to some lame ass porn in mommy’s basement (the grand cliche) and wishing women would give you the time of day for just existing! They are entitled twits.

Yet at the same time they scorn us for being intelligent, they scorn us for trying to have a decent wage, a normal semblance of life without having to be gawked at, or worse, touched by some creep, all because we don’t want to FUCK them? Are they even serious? Apparently they are. 

We can’t even talk about video games, or do things like fix computers because men think they have the goddamn copyrights to it.  They think they own the copyright to the whole damn world. Including apparently, our goddamn vaginas. 

Ok this is more of a rant than a discussion but go with me here...I promise I have a point. 

So yeah. These male echo chambers are really something else. Meanwhile I’m over here upset because I had to resign from a job I love because I can’t take my child to work and I have no one to watch her on the 200000000 teacher work days that public school decides to force on me.  Her father happily moved to Oregon and sends me child support to save face and pretend he is a good dad. Whatever.
My female boss (who brings her way smaller grandchildren) said no.  So 8 years probably down the drain unless the other campus hires me.  This is the shit we have to deal with and they swear they have it sooooo bad. I don’t say this for anyone to feel sorry for me. I decided to make a child so I know these are those sacrifices a mother makes. I take full responsibility for all my actions.  I’m just saying it to prove that men live a much cushier existence.

I just graduated with a bachelors because I was a single mom. I’m over here making sure my child is fed, clothed, does her homework, gets good grades, plus work, plus manage the rental house my father left me, after he passed, feed the cat, make sure he is also healthy, manage the pool, manage my house, drive over 60 miles back and forth from work to my kid’s school, do laundry, do school projects, write papers, write books, all the while these imbeciles are calling women like me and my mother (who busted her ass all her life to raise two kids on her own because my dad wasn’t there) they dare call us stupid? 

We create life.  We can manage multiple situations at once, multiple people, we make things thrive and grow and they dare say they are better than women because they have some sausage full of meat and a sack with little slimy balls in them? Please, these boys, need to sit down and shut up.  

First of all incels are crybaby wimps. Just the fact they are begging for sex is pathetic. Women do not beg for sex, it’s beneath us. 

Even men laugh at them, because most men know that’s definitely not the way to go about women, but let’s be honest,  it applies also to life.  No one should be that pathetic. It’s unnecessary.  

I guess what I am trying to say is that I was insulted. I was insulted because I have played my whole life by men’s rules and at 43,  and they dare say we don’t play by their rules? Seriously? What the utter fuck?

I have decided I just don’t care to impress men any further.  Just to spite them, I am becoming a VOLCEL. That’s right. I’m literally not having sex voluntarily.  Not because I cannot, because surely I can, but because there are so many men who don’t deserve the woman I have become and will be.

 I would rather my vagina shrivel up and house a merry band of spiders than give it to any idiot any longer. And to men, I say  to you, it’s not a threat, it’s a promise. I will be a goddamn voluntary celibate.  I can do it too.  I got tons of toys. 

Until such a time when men learn to be a little nicer and smile just a little more (baby cakes), I’m mthrfking done.  

Because you know what? Men need us a lot more than we need them, especially at my age.  I want a man that understands the rules of life.  And if they want to sit there and cry in their beers about how terrible women are despite probably being leeches to their mothers, they can go and have that sausage party all on their own without me or hopefully without any of you. 

Until then the fabulous magical pixie land I own between my legs is closed until further notice. So I guess join me, or not. Do whatever you please, but  this has been brewing for a few days and I thought it may be something that would appeal to ladies such as yourselves. We seem to share common ideals and thoughts. Although, I could be wrong.  

Anyways, I’m open to discussion from my kinfolk.

We are long distance which is difficult but we usually make it work. I am in college while he took a gap year and takes a night class 2 days a week. 

I have depression, anxiety, PTSD (rape), and chronic pain. I deal with them well usually, I was in therapy for years, I do much better now. DB (damn boyfriend) has anxiety as well, last year he really struggled with it, it was difficult for me to stay with him through that time. Although we were long distance he was very needy, he had a lot of anxiety attacks and I pulled away, but ultimately any time he needed me I was there, I even would drive 4 hours one way to see him to make sure he was okay on weekends when I could. He is doing much better now, this was a year ago and we worked through it. 

Que Rant: DB needs to be there for me, and not just when it works for him. We will be texting in the middle of a conversation and he says hes tired and wants to sleep, which is normally fine. It bothers me we never get to finish the conversation though, it is never brought back up unless I bring it up and I feel like I shouldn't always have to. He's the one that ends it it would be nice if he would think enough to continue it later. 

Well last night I was having anxiety, DB knows it's depressing me I'm planning my own birthday, (I threw him a surprise party with all of this friends from 4 hours away, organized all of the food, booked his favorite location (a hobby I do not enjoy) and got everything ready, I then had to drive 4 hours one way for the party.) I love birthdays I love planning them but what depresses me is the fact I go out of my way for others and I still have to plan my own. I am also hitting an age I never thought I'd live to when I was younger, this birthday is freaking me out, which DB is well aware of. I know I am young (ab to turn 20) but I lost so much of my childhood it saddens me I'm ab to be an adult. 

SO while I was expressing my anxiety over my birthday I didn't get far before DB says he's tired and might fall asleep. I say I need him and he says that he'll stay up, not even 2 minutes later he's asleep and I am panicking alone. It made me feel sad he didn't stay up, and more sad when he never brought it back up today.

That brings us to a few minutes ago, we were in the middle of a conversation when he says he wants to sleep, fine but I bring up the fact he always does this, and then the conversation is never continued and last night I could've used him. He says he's sorry but keeps insisting he wants to sleep as I am trying to express why I am upset, which pisses me off more he's doing exactly what I am saying is upsetting me as I'm saying it! He could've said ""okay I'll stay up because it is clear you're upset, I'll do better I'm sorry, something. While he did say he's sorry it was also always followed by he wants to sleep because he has work tomorrow. Well buddy **I** too have to wake up for my class at 10 (same time his work starts), then do work for my next class, go to my second class (both classes 1.5 hours straight, to then go to work, followed by a lecture. **I** too need sleep, but I am so upset for the second night in a row I cannot sleep and it pisses me off he is sleeping soundly not caring how I feel. 

I told him how whenever he needs me I will stay up, not complain, and help him. DB said I can sleep and he doesn't care if I go to sleep when hes struggling. Sure he says that now but next time he calls me crying I am sure he won't feel the same way. I told him I am not capable of just letting him be upset, I cannot just leave him alone, that I care enough I won't sleep to help him.  He just said he needs sleep and we'll talk about this tomorrow and that was that. 

Even when I was visiting him, when he wanted to sleep that was all that mattered, it didn't matter if I wanted to talk, hang out, or anything, when he wanted to sleep that was that. He made no effort to do anything else. I do not see his family much and my last night at home I was talking to his family and he just took his dog, went upstairs, and laid there for 30 minutes when I was with his family. He didn't tell me he was going to bed and it surprised me when I finally went looking for him and he was laying there on his phone all of the lights off. 

It is getting to the point I need to be selfish and say I do not care if he wants to sleep because I need him, but he doesn't even put in the effort to stay awake, he claims he does but he lays there, eyes closed, lights off, between texts, not trying in the slightest. 

Well now I am so pissed off I can't sleep and God I wish him a very restless night. 

I'd love advice, tell me I am totally in the right to be pissed off, tell me if I am just a total bitch, but please do not suggest we just break up. Just help please!",20954,Sleep isn’t always the most important thing,0,1572186264.0,,,0

He says he's sorry but keeps insisting he wants to sleep as I am trying to express why I am upset, which pisses me off more he's doing exactly what I am saying is upsetting me as I'm saying it! He could've said ""okay I'll stay up because it is clear you're upset, I'll do better I'm sorry, something. While he did say he's sorry it was also always followed by he wants to sleep because he has work tomorrow. Well buddy **I** too have to wake up for my class at 10 (same time his work starts), then do work for my next class, go to my second class (both classes 1.5 hours straight, to then go to work, followed by a lecture. **I** too need sleep, but I am so upset for the second night in a row I cannot sleep and it pisses me off he is sleeping soundly not caring how I feel. 

I told him how whenever he needs me I will stay up, not complain, and help him. DB said I can sleep and he doesn't care if I go to sleep when hes struggling. Sure he says that now but next time he calls me crying I am sure he won't feel the same way. I told him I am not capable of just letting him be upset, I cannot just leave him alone, that I care enough I won't sleep to help him.  He just said he needs sleep and we'll talk about this tomorrow and that was that. 

Even when I was visiting him, when he wanted to sleep that was all that mattered, it didn't matter if I wanted to talk, hang out, or anything, when he wanted to sleep that was that. He made no effort to do anything else. I do not see his family much and my last night at home I was talking to his family and he just took his dog, went upstairs, and laid there for 30 minutes when I was with his family. He didn't tell me he was going to bed and it surprised me when I finally went looking for him and he was laying there on his phone all of the lights off. 

It is getting to the point I need to be selfish and say I do not care if he wants to sleep because I need him, but he doesn't even put in the effort to stay awake, he claims he does but he lays there, eyes closed, lights off, between texts, not trying in the slightest. 

Well now I am so pissed off I can't sleep and God I wish him a very restless night. 

I'd love advice, tell me I am totally in the right to be pissed off, tell me if I am just a total bitch, but please do not suggest we just break up. Just help please!",20951,SLEEP ISN'T ALWAYS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING,0,1572186187.0,,,0

Absent favorable qualities to a mate, the male will gleefully rape and kill his way to one. This is true in just about every species of creature on the planet, especially mammals such as ourselves, and especially on the local-level — which is why violence is highest between people who are close to each other relationship-wise. As humans, we funneled the male murder drive — as is evident in crime statistics by gender —primarily into War, where incels that couldn’t compete for female attention would go to violently take it by force from those weaker than him. 

&amp;nbsp;

For a brief period of time the bloodlust of incels could be sated and there would be eras of peace and prosperity among civilizations if enough incels were killed off in the previous wars to mitigate their violent impositions. Victorious incels then became the new Chads and established doctrines that enforced civic contracts between citizens ensuring that incels would be provided mates in return for them not going full retard and killing and threatening everyone around them if they provided tax money and weaponized their violence for the state, which had so generously litigated the landscape of inter-personal relations in such a way as to force women to be dependent upon men as a class. This was most easily done by stripping them of their rights to vote and work, similar to the slaves kept by the pre-eminent violent male class at the time.

&amp;nbsp;

Essentially, pretty much all of human history has been a cycle of males killing and raping everyone because they can’t get laid. It’s therefore no surprise that they’ve evolved to be ruthless unfeeling monsters, those who didn’t were either killed or enslaved by those who did. Historically, as societies liberalized and men could no longer leverage the violence of the state to render women dependent on them, they took up arms and went to war. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you want it put in a politically correct way: monogamous pair bonding makes men less violent.
Here are some examples of the well-developed body of basic evolutionary-biological/psychological/anthropological evidence (and theory) supporting that claim.
The Competition–Violence Hypothesis: Sex, Marriage, and Male Aggression https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2016.1216153
“...men who transition to a monogamous, or less competitive, mode of sexual behavior (fewer partners since last wave), reduce their risk for violence. The same results were not replicated for females. Further, results were not accounted for by marital status or other more readily accepted explanations of violence. Findings suggest that competition for sex be further examined as a potential cause of male violence.”
Here’s another paper, with a long list of relevant references:
Why Men Commit Crimes (and why they Desist) http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0735-2751.00110
Luckily (?) though every hundred years or so one of the males comes up with a good idea that makes society a little better for everyone before they, males, rage quit and destroy everything. This accumulation of significant human knowledge constitutes the basis we use to dictate the rules we enforce upon people via the pre-eminent patriarchy that’s monopolized violence at that point in time, hopefully and eventually.

&amp;nbsp;

To kind of give you an idea of how much of a crapshoot this process is:
Anatomically modern human beings are about 200,000 years old. We’ve only made slavery illegal about 100 years ago. Spousal rape was legal 50 years ago. Women went to college at the same rate as men 25 years ago. And this is true almost exclusively in liberalized western civilizations, because we have monopolized violence, which as I mentioned earlier means we get to set the rules based on the aggregate human knowledge we’ve collected.

&amp;nbsp;

**Fortunately however, the comforts of modern society afforded by the aggregation of human knowledge I discussed earlier has rendered the incel weak and docile.** He is able to diverge his violent bloodlust into things like pornography, r/MGTOW, and r/The_Donald. We culturally condemn toxic masculinity at least in public. Violent males are put into cages before they go full inceltard. Etcetera. **Most importantly however, the wage gap affords men the ability to financially enslave the various debt-ridden dependent debutantes of their dreams.**
Amidst the begruntled moans of being stripped of raping and pillaging and enslaving and the other various past-times of patriarchical society I’ve referenced, there is a hesistant nod of aggrement among the gentlemen of our civilized society to not kill everyone as long as they’re in a better financial position as a class than women (and slaves of course) on average.

&amp;nbsp;

after WWII we got so fed up with the impotent wanton violence and capriciousness of them that we instituted gigantic social reforms that gave women independence from having to depend on them to survive and raise children, hence the ensuing exodus of engagement and the devastating deluge of divorce. 

***Mother Nature is now correcting for this error by washing the 80%+ of obsolete male chromosomes from the gene pool.***

***Men simply don’t know how to compete for female affection and attention in a world where women no longer literally starve without depending on them for jobs and schools they were literally barred from and are showing their true colors in an age where you can no longer legally rape your spouse and treat her as a slave.
Male culture never developed the traits women actually find attractive because society has enforced a patriarchy through violence by the male-controlled state, and so once that patriarchy is dismantled their true ability to court female relationships is shown in its pitiable true form.***

&amp;nbsp;

They’re already being naturally weeded out of the gene pool as women gain agency through the legal protections and economic opportunities afforded them by our liberalizing society. Incel movements are an emergent edifice of this metamorphosis of modern politics and economics, but their violent outlashes are frankly nothing new.

hat’s why I’m personally very mindful of the rise of violence and fascism from the conservative alt-right clowns gunning down people around the world.

Anything a person chases in life runs away.**

**2. The women who have the men climbing the walls for them aren’t always exceptional. Often, they are the ones who don’t appear to care too much.**

**3. A woman is perceived as offering a mental challenge to the degree that a man doesn’t feel he has a 100 percent hold on her.**

**4. Sometimes a man deliberately won’t call, just to see how you’ll respond.**

**5. If you start out dependent, it turns him off. But if it is something he can’t have, it becomes more of a challenge for him to get it.**

**6. It is your attitude about yourself that a man will adopt.**

**7. Act like a prize and you’ll turn him into a believer.**

**8. The biggest variable between a \*\*\*\*\* and a woman who is too nice is fear. The \*\*\*\*\* shows that she’s not afraid to be without him.**

**13. Whether you have terms and conditions indicates whether you have options. Almost immediately, you present yourself as a doormat or a dreamgirl.**

**14. If you smother him, he’ll go into defense mode and look for an escape route to protect his freedom.**

**15. Whenever a woman requires too many things from a man, he’ll resent it. Let him give what he wants to give freely; then observe who he is.**

**16. A \*\*\*\*\* gives a man plenty of space so he doesn’t fear being trapped in a cage. Then..he sets out to trap her in his.**

**17. If you tell him you are not interested in jumping into a relationship with both feet, he will set out to try to change your mind.**

**18. Always give the appearance that he has plenty of space. It gets him to drop his guard.**

**19. More than anything else, he watches to see if you’ll be too emotionally dependent on him.**

**20. He must feel that you choose to be with him, not that you need to be with him. Only then will he perceive you as an equal partner.**

**21. If a man has to wait before he sleeps with a woman, he’ll not only perceive her as more beautiful, he’ll also take him time to appreciate who she is.**

**22. Sex and the “spark” are not one and the same.**

**23. Before sex, a man isn’t thinking clearly and a woman is thinking clearly. After sex, it reverses. The man is thinking clearly and the woman isn’t.**

**24. Every man wants to have sex first; whether he wants a girlfriend is something he thinks about later. By not giving him what he wants up front, you become his girlfriend without him realizing it.**

**25. A man intuitively senses whether sexuality comes from a place of security or from a place of neediness. He knows when a woman is having sex to appease him.**

**26. Bad habits are easier to form than good ones, because good habits require conscious effort. Waiting encourages this effort.**

**27. If you pull the sexual plug at the last minute, he’ll label you a tease.**

**37. If you give him a feeling of power, he’ll want to protect you and he’ll want to give you the world.**

**38. When a woman acts as though she’s capable of everything, she gets stuck doing everything.**

**39. Men don’t respond to words. They respond to no contact.**

**40. Talking about the “relationship” too much takes away the element of the “unknown” and thus the mystery.**

**41. Men respect women who communicate in a succinct way, because it’s the language men use to talk to one another.**

**42. When you are always HAPPY; And he is always free to GO; he feels LUCKY.**

**43. If you allow your rhythm to be interrupted, you’ll create a void. Then, to replace what you give up, you’ll start to expect and need more from your partner.**

**44. Most women are starving to receive something from a man that they need to give to themselves.**

**45. A woman looks more secure in a man’s eyes when he can’t pull her away from her life, because she is content with her life.**

**46. The second a woman works overtime to make herself fit his criteria, she has lowered the standard of that relationship.**

**47. You jump through hoops any time you repeatedly make it very obvious you’re giving your “all.”**

**48. You have to keep from being sucked down into quicksand. Unless you maintain control over yourself, the relationship is doomed.**

**49. Jumping through hoops often has a negative outcome: He sees it as an opportunity to have his cake and eat it, too. But when you stay just outside his reach, he’ll stay on his best behavior.**

**50. The nice girl gives away too much of herself when pleasing him regularly becomes more important than pleasing herself.**",20833,100 Attraction Principles from “Why Men Love Bitches” (#1-50),0,1572183115.0,,,0

I have to, because 90% of the time, if I don’t take initiative, it becomes an endless thread of messaging, until someone reduces it to one word answers and the other loses interest as a consequence. Anyway. 

I extract some info from their profile, and come up with something interesting for us to do. They’re always game. Helps that I’m paying. It works out well in that at the very least, I get a makeout session, if not more. Ladies, I’m not even masculine. It’s just 1) I’m not one to want to wait around for things to happen 2) It’s not like I’m going to have to worry about setting a precedent since it’s unlikely it will last and turn romantic anyway and 3) I don’t attract women who are leaders, I attract women that are even more femme and submissive than me (which I didn’t know was possible) 4) I don’t spin a ton of plates...I go out with very few women, so I can afford this. 

My point is, when I come to think about what it takes to plan a date...it’s not rocket science. And yet, it seems with men, it’s like it’s some sort of baffling mathematical equation. I have to be explicitly clear, like they’re children, and I don’t understand it. I’m the leader in literally every other aspect of my life, and all I want is someone who can manage to set a day, time and place convenient for me to get to that’s kind of interesting. In this city, that is ridiculously easy. There’s so much to do. But it’s like they’re at a loss and can’t figure out how Yelp and Google work. 

I can’t figure if they’re just juggling too many chicks (not my problem!) and can’t afford to take them all out, or if this simple, simple task is too much for their brains. Or, I just don’t inspire them enough (I’m always working on maxxing), because like I said, I’m hardly masculine, and yet, when I want something, I make the effort....I can’t imagine having like 100 times the testosterone and still waffling, and asking the woman to help me plan a date, because I “can’t figure out what to do”, if I really wanted to see her. Or maybe they want the lowest effort option, and there are either a ton of women willing to do the work for them, or they’d rather just be sexless for life than have to work for it (which totally goes against what I understand about testosterone and motivation but whatever).

I don’t know the reason. But what I do know? I *do* put in effort for my dates with men...I take an hour to get ready, I don’t wear the most comfortable clothes, and it takes every ounce of my willpower to not take the reins from them. Because if I do, I’ll never be able to gauge his level of *romantic* interest.  So it’s on *him*, showing up in his t-shirt and jeans after 5 minutes of getting ready time, being the gatekeeper to relationships, to plan and pay for the dates. Period. Do not settle for less. It’s hard, because most guys just don’t try for me. But I won’t settle for someone refusing to put in this basic amount of effort....because if I can manage to do it on the other side of dating, so can they.

If you missed part one you can find it here

https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dw4yor/book_report_how_to_win_friends_and_influence

This post has 17 bullet points so buckle up please!

1. ""Begin in a friendly way"" first impressions set the tone for the entire relationship. In retail they say in order to undo one bad customer interaction there needs to be approximately 12 fantastic ones.

2. ""Start them saying yes, yes"" just like a salesman gets you hooked by asking yes questions. Do you want to live forever? Do you want worldly riches? When a person says no there is a physical withdrawl. She who treads softly goes far.

3. ""Let them do much of the talking""  this gives you a chance to absorb their perspective and look for areas that need to be addressed.
 
4. ""Let them feel it's their idea"" nobody likes to feel they are being sold something or told what to do. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts. They then come back to us with a sense of majesty.

5. ""Be sympathetic to their point of view"" success in dealing with others depends on a sympathetic grasp of what they are saying. When we are interested in the cause, we're less likely to dislike the effect. MOST of the people you meet in life deep down crave sympathy on some level. Give it to them and they will love you for it.

6. ""Appeal to their nobler motives"" everybody has exactly 2 reasons for doing anything. One that sounds good out loud. And another that is their real motivation. If you want to win someone to your point of view appeal to that idealist in them. 

7. ""Dramatize and use showmanship"" a  little showmanship for dramatic effect will get someone's attention and once your have their attention they are more likely to take in what you're telling them.

8. ""Throw down a challenge"" deep down everybody has a desire to excel and a desire to be important. That's why people often get SO competitive. Use it to your advantage.

9. ""Begin with praise"" a piece of honest praise will soften up the tone of a conversation. I know i am much more likely to respond to praise then criticism.

10. ""Call attention to behavior indirectly"" never use the word 'but' when trying to correct a person, use 'and' statements. Instead of saying you're great 'but' you smell bad. Say you're so great AND this sexy cologne will take you to the next level.

11. ""Talk about your own mistakes before criticising others"" nobody is born with perfect judgment it comes only from experience. Sharing these things will help a person to feel improvement is possible for themselves.

12. ""Ask questions instead of giving orders"" asking a question not only makes an order more palatable but will often inspire creativity in that person. 

13. ""Let the other person save face"" even if we are right and they are utterly wrong.... We only destroy a person's ego by causing them to lose face. That will not make any progress towards meeting our own goals.

14. ""Praise the slightest improvement"" quote from the book: 'praise is like sunlight to the human spirit, we cannot flower and grow without it'. When you reinforce the good things people do the less good things will waste away from lack of attention. I would add the caveat that being in a healthy relationship is prerequisite because praise won't stop abuse obviously.

15. ""Give them a good reputation to live up to"" if you want to improve a person in some respect act as if that trait were already one if their outstanding characteristics. They will then make the effort rather then see you disappointed.

16. ""Make the problem seem easy to correct"" a little bit of encouragement goes a long way with people. 

17. ""Make them happy to do as you suggest"" forget about the benefits to you. Focus on the benefit to them. Find out what they really want and match it up with the benefits of what you're suggesting. Be empathetic in this process and keep your own focus on your goals.

I hope this information brings you closer to any relationship goals you may have. They work great in all arenas of life however so practice them often enough and it will become second nature. If you've not read this book already i encourage you to do so. It's a timeless and inspiring look into what makes people tick.",34698,Part two: how to win people to your way of thinking,0,,,,1

She is very good at performing the ""White Swan"" role of a pure, innocent, hardworking, loyal good girl AKA the obvious form of PickMe. The director says he will only cast her if she can also play the role of the spontaneous, wild, powerful, and sexually teasing ""Black Swan.""

How is the High Value Woman different from some kind of male-gaze-y dominatrix fantasy? 

When it comes to dating, I want to be picked by someone who I would also pick, but I don't want to be so desperately to be picked I sacrifice my standards and wellbeing. How do I untangle this, so that being High Value isn't just another way of trying to ultimately cater to him? How do I know if I'm truly Not PickMe for the right reasons or just playing Not PickMe because I want to be picked really badly?

I see it often. Women dating a man’s potential, instead of dating who he is as a person. I hear, “He said he was going to get X done by X time and he didn’t follow through. I believed in him and he let me down.” Or some variation of that. 

The truth is there’s nothing wrong with dating a broke man. BUT, there is something wrong with dating a lazy, passive broke man. If the man you are dating happens to be broke you need to assess his level of ambition. Here are the traits of an ambitious man:

-He is always trying to better himself. You will almost never see this man waste idle time. He’s always asking himself, “So, what’s next?”

-he is curious and eager to learn. Whether he wants to be a farmer, trash collector, engineer or president of the US, this man will go out of his way to make sure he’ll be the best damn trash collector in the city. 

-he has set clear goals for himself (preferably at least 5 years down the line). This man has set goals for himself and a time table to achieve them and he has missed a deadline yet. This man is the epitome of self-discipline! 

-he is engaged in hobbies. He’s a jack of all trades. He not only has hobbies because they’re fun and make you a better well-rounded person, he has them because they’re great ways to network with like-minded people who could help him get where he wants to go. 

-if he faces failure he isn’t discouraged. When I faced failure, my parents used to say, “You can feel sorry for yourself today but tomorrow you’re going to do something about it.”  He can throw a pity party for himself for a minute but he’s right back on his horse soon after. 

Love is not enough to sustain a relationship. You may love a bum but think, in 10 years, when he’s done nothing with his life are you still going to love him? Will you be resentful because he refuses to grow as a person?

To value ourselves first we must:

1. Abandon the idea of the patriarchy thinking that's so deep within the latino community, that is how they control us. 
2. Abandon the view that the communication medium has of us latinas. We should not accept to be objectified by being called feisty, exotic or as extremely sexual beings with no will control.
3. Abandon the view that latinas are mostly dark haired, pretty pale and curvaceous vixens. If you are an Afro-Latina own it, if you are Indian-Latina show it, if you are a mixed latina be proud of your roots and who you are. Love yourself above all else and your unique culture behind it.

For the dating scene don't allow men to sexualize your personality, your roots or your identity. You are more than a body. After dating left and right outside of my culture I learned how to some men I was just a fetish. It was disgusting and I vowed to never let a man treat me like that ever again. So now the moment a man finds to only be interested in the sexual side of me I level up, even if they are fuck boy material. I will always value myself more so I decided to do the following:

1. **Never accept approaches from a man that finds you feisty because you said no to something.** Are they even listening to what you just said? My character and my words is not something to sexualize, you either respect me or get out the door. I never joke when I say I don't like something. 
2. **Don't let the men treat you like an object because they find you exotic.** It is degrading and objectifying to be someone's fetish because of your natural personality, looks or origin in life. This is fetish type behavior and you are worth more than that, a high value man will never act or behave this way. 
3. **Do not talk to a man in Spanish** ***if*** **he is getting a sexual kick out of it.** This should be basic. If he doesn't speak Spanish and is not interested in learning don't speak it to him so he can get a kick out it. This is again another fetishistic behavior, you should be more than his kink.
4. **If he want you to call him papi... kick him out.** I am not calling a man I'm sleeping with my father, that position is taken and he is a great father. The men you go out with probably already know what it means, they just get a kick out of it.
5. **Kick out the man that's only interested because of your ""curvaceous latina body"".** We come in all shapes and sizes and this a really low quality behavior from any type of men. Sure it feels nice to have a man lust after you but that's all they'll ever give you if you let them.
6. **And finally, never allow a man to put you down based on you place of origin.** It doesn't matter if you immigrated or were born in the same place as him, or if you are a few generations in. If it is part of your identity, your culture and your family interactions you should always feel respected.

Last dude I dated dared to constantly call me feisty because I spoke my opinion. He ""without knowing"" put me down because of my place of origin, treating my as a second class citizen. Don't be like me and play along to their desires and speak to them in Spanish because it turns them on. No, they need to earn it. And because of that I made this my new mood in life.

We’d broken up before but he always found ways to reach out again. This time he won’t be able and neither will I.

Text copied from NYT:

*Because marriage is an ever-evolving experience, we constantly shift, change and, in some cases, start over. In It’s No Secret, couples share thoughts about commitment and tell us what they have learned along the way, revealing their secret to making it work. (Answers are edited for context and space.)*

**Who** Vicky Tsai, 41, and Eric Bevan, 42.

**Occupations** They are the founders of Tatcha, a skin-care company. They remain with the company after recently [selling it to Unilever](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-10/unilever-buys-tatcha-to-grab-growth-from-algae-based-skin-care).

**Their Marriage** 15 years, 5 months and counting.

Through the Years

The couple married before 94 guests on May 29, 2004, in the Gamble Mansion, a small brownstone event space in Boston. “Three friends played the guitar and sang “Fools Rush In” as we walked down the aisle,” said Ms. Tsai. “The tailor botched my wedding dress so I wore a sample from a random designer, which was cut too low. I was fine about getting married but really nervous about showing too much skin.”

In 1998, Vicky Tsai, then 20, met Eric Bevan, then 21, at a college dance. She was a junior at Wellesley; he was a senior at M.I.T. She wanted everything to do with him; he wanted nothing to do with her. Six months of determination from Ms. Tsai made that change. “I kept asking him out, he’d turn me down. I tried talking to him; he acted disinterested. I thought he was cute. I’m not used to taking no for an answer. I think I wore him down,” said Ms. Tsai, now 41.

Their first date lasted several hours. Others followed. “Two months in I turned to him and said, ‘I think we’re going to get married one day,’” she said. Five years later they did.

In between, there was a joint move to New York, jobs on Wall Street, 9/11, and Mr. Bevan developed an autoimmune disease, rendering him in the hospital every weekend on heavy medications. For the next three years, Ms. Tsai took care of him. In late February 2003, Ms. Tsai proposed.

“I hated seeing him in bed lacking his natural sparkle. I thought, ‘how do I make him feel better today? How do I make him happy and laugh again?’” she said. “I woke him up and told him we should get engaged today. He said, ‘O.K., but I don’t have enough money to buy a ring.’”

They got dressed, took the subway to Tiffany’s, where Ms. Tsai purchased a simple band with diamonds. They got married a year later.

What They’ve Learned

**Ms. Tsai** I’m serious, always planning and thinking. He’s Zen, lighthearted and happy. I’m passionate; he’s calm. I dream; he executes. I’m creative; he’s mathematical.

He has the wonder of an 8-year-old. I didn’t know how to have fun until I met him. He’s my rock and never questions my dreams. He keeps me grounded and makes things real.

He’s my better half, but also a better human being. I have to be intentional to be one. I have meditation guides and journals, I work at it; for him, it’s effortless.

I’m super annoying to be married to; he’s a saint. I create a lot of work for him. Some days I wake up and I can’t believe he’s still there. He makes me feel unconditionally supported and safe enough be my full, crazy self, which he loves and encourages.

I’ve made his life exciting. He’s quiet, but has an adventurous heart. He’s let me pull that out of him. Without our marriage, he wouldn’t have found himself in Cambodia or Africa twice a year. I throw chaos into his life and keep him on his toes, but secretly he loves that. I do, too.

I’ve learned humility. That I’m nothing without him. And to appreciate how much he brings to the equation. I’ve learned we show our love for each other differently, and that’s O.K. He does it through doing and actions; I do it through words.

**Mr. Bevan** I’m introverted, quiet and guarded with my feelings. I can be blissfully unaware. I wouldn’t have taken the initiative to ask her out so I’m grateful she was persistent. We started out with new love, chemistry and good banter. We weren’t attached to anything but each other. She made me emotionally vulnerable. I opened up with Vicky. And she did with me. We became enamored with each other’s values and personality. That strong connection hasn’t changed.

We are complete opposites. That makes life interesting and stretches us. She’s the visionary; I’m the muscle. That lets her thrive and take care of what she needs to, and I take care of her. I live in the present, without a clue as to what’s coming next. Vicky is in the forward, brilliantly planning both personally and professionally. She challenges me and helps me reach higher potential.

When she smiles she lights up a room. She’s fearless, driven and dynamic. She’s my energy. She’s the person I want to come home to and create an adventure with. The qualities she has makes me want to be a better person — empathetic, fearless, grateful, compassionate. She makes it O.K. to be out of my comfort zone. We’re both predicable in each other’s eyes, but that makes me feel understood, loved and connected.

Marriage taught me to trust who you are, and who you’re with. That you have to rely on and trust each other’s intentions, and enjoy how different our personalities are. I’ve learned individual goals become shared goals. And when the right person steers the ship, you’re steered correctly.

I’d be lost and broken without her.

**The smartest thing I did was let her steer the ship. I was seeking a nontraditional life, with Vicky I have that.**",34641,"Discuss the Tatcha power couple love story: the woman committed all the sins in the FDS bible - initiated, chased, proposed and even bought the ring.

-Men can’t help themselves once they are sexually excited, so if you still say ‘no’ they have the right to pout and whine like they’re being wrongfully imprisoned 

-Fucking random strangers is fun and empowering for you

-If there is a sex act you don’t like or you’re just not in the mood for sex in general, you need to get over it and be more “game” 

-If you try your hardest to be kind, generous, open-minded, and physically in shape, you will be treated well through the magic of karma 

-Women are the high maintenance gender 

-Compliments from a man on your looks is the ultimate validation

-Gender equality is about believing that male and female sexuality is basically the same AKA straight male sexuality 

-You should always give him a chaaaance, even if you’re not physically attracted at all and/or his personality turns you off and scares you 

-The gateway to reciprocal emotional connection is him unloading his anger and pain on you and you nursing him back to calm and happiness 

-If you are worthy, a man will naturally want to take care of you and protect you 

-Male selfishness is harmless and female self-protection is demonic

This is my first time reading this subreddit, and I’m seeing a lot of negative comments about men who date significantly younger women.

My ex boyfriend was only four years older, and we had a healthy, fulfilling relationship that ended last year because ultimately we were not compatible. A little while after our breakup, I made a Tinder and set my age range to 29-40. I am 21 going on 22 in a few months. 

It’s been.... really great. I haven’t been on a single bad date. Sure, I haven’t settled down with one person because I haven’t been seeking a serious, long-term partner, but I would still call it a success.

The dates are fun, the conversations are interesting, and the sexy times are mind blowing. I’ve learned and experienced a ton of stuff  I wouldn’t have if I stuck to dating guys my age. Overall it’s been really rewarding and FUN.

I did meet one guy who tried to use his wealth, experience, and “wisdom” to manipulate me, but I recognized and ended that quickly. While I understand this is why age gap relationships are often frowned upon,  the others I’ve dated have been nothing but kind, respectful, and communicative “high value” men. 

When I started swiping on people my parents’ age, I told myself I was only looking for casual relationships, but now I could see myself getting serious with a silver fox. I’m always honest about what I’m seeking from the very beginning, but these flings keep ending with the guy admitting he really likes me and wants something more. 

Am I naive to think these men aren’t actually so bad? And maybe I can have a wholesome, well balanced relationship with an old dude? Besides the manipulative weirdo I mentioned earlier, these are not men who exclusively date younger women. 

Am I just being a silly kid?? What are your thoughts on age gap relationships? Can they work, or is any 38-year-old dating a 21-year-old automatically an immature creep?

# It's not you, women just don't like to be approached in public

📷

Hi! So, this may get downvoted but I feel like a lot of people here really need to hear this:

**Getting approached in public by a stranger is just not a good situation to meet someone in.**

I am a girl and I guess I'm a bit above-average looking, so I get hit on in public pretty regularly. Not once, no matter how good-looking or smooth-talking the guy was, did I ever feel comfortable. Nor did I ever even considered giving the guy any contact information.

There are two reasons for this:

1. There are so many gorgeous girls around and I know I'm not prettier than all of them. So, when a guy approaches me, I don't feel special or pretty. I just feel like he probably has a lot of free time and even if I did give him any contact info, he would approach ten more girls on his way home. Girls want to feel special.
2. Girls don't actually just wanna feel pretty. Girls wanna feel smart, loveable, kind etc. Knowing that a guy is into you based solely on your looks is a huge turn-off.

I talked about this with many of my girl friends and they all feel the same as I do. It's not about your technique, your looks or anything like that. It's just a shitty situation. I know this has been said times and times again but really, do join a club, start doing a sport. Get to know the girl at least a little bit, before you ask her out or start flirting. Compliment her personality, not just her looks. Make her feel like she's special to you.

The rules are obviously a bit different in a bar or something. But when it comes to the street or a mall or whatever, most of the things I read here are not a good way to meet anyone. And I kid you not, freaking Chris Hemsworth could approach me in public with a pick-up line and I would turn him down. Most girls would.

It gets to 12.35 and he still hasn't come home, I call and he says he is leaving in 5 minutes.

It's then gets to 1pm and still no sign of him..
Call him again, he says leaving in 5 minutes..

He gets home at 1.15pm One hour after the agreed time.

So I waited a hour for him. 

I have lost count of the number of times he has done this, the worst was 3 hours.

I (26F) was platonic friends with a fuckboy (27M) for sometime before he started flirting and asking for more. He said he wanted a Long term relationship and I agreed, on the condition that we were exclusive. It goes well for 2 months, in which he flirts and takes effort in building the relationship. 

Out of the blue, he went into depression and said his feelings are not growing and rejects sex (partly because I think he felt bad he couldn’t make me cum all the time, though I’ve explained the problem is with me since I can’t even cum all the time when masturbating).

We go back to being friends but he sometimes acts like a Boyfriend. Within a month of this we have since went out twice, he continues to  tease me frequently and pays for all our meals, pokes my sides/sat on me to tickle me, and held my hand and put his arm around me (and gently stroked my arm) when he noticed I was cold. He also brazenly told me he was looking at my boobs.

Less than a week from holding my hand, he now tells me he is going back on tinder to continue sleeping around. He said he told me because I don’t approve of this side of him and might disappear from his life; unlike other girls who he has slept with and cut contact from, he wants me around. By his own admission, I am the only Friend here that he is texting regularly (rest of friends are back in hometown) and the other girls he slept with all don’t keep in contact.

 I’ve been dating others because I don’t bother waiting for him. Should I cut him off entirely? Out of the people I’ve dated, and whom I’m friends with, this selfish ex is arguably the person with the most common interests with me, and I’d hate to lose him. But I can’t explain what is going on between us when asked by this guy who might be interested in me.  

My question is: if we remained friends, would this turn other potential suitors off? 

TLDR: fuckboy pursues me claiming he wants a LTR. Fuckboy resumes to fuckboy ways but acts like my Boyfriend. Does this damage my dates?

Mine was short-lived, intense, and it taught me these things:

1. **Don’t talk about sex a lot even though he's your boyfriend.** Maintain its mystery. Talk about your fantasies every now and then, but don't do it often. It should be a treat for him. 
2. **Lie about your romantic and sexual past.** It's none of his business. If he asks, you've had less than 5 exes. They all treated you great. Don't tell him you've been cheated on before. Make him think you're too good for that. Trust me: there's no need to feel guilty about embellishing the truth. If you want maximum success, just do it. The people who get what they want in life aren't afraid to get their hands a little dirty. 
3. **Don’t appear too crazy in bed.** Keep those naughty fantasies to yourself. 
4. **Slow it the fuck down.** Meet twice a week max if he's your boyfriend and once a week if he still hasn't made it official. You need to protect your heart. Don't agree to exclusivity before 3 months has passed. You're doing this to protect your heart. 
5. **If you've had emotional struggles before, don't reveal it too early.** Reveal it after 6 months or later on. Your confidence should be earned. 
6. **Don’t talk about your past men.** Keep it super vague. He doesn't need to know. 
7. **Reserve the naughty acts till after 6 months or a year.** If you want him to love you and treat you well, be content with passionate vanilla sex. 
8. **Even when you’re in a relationship, still maintain your distance.** Make sure you go to social events at least 3x a week where you meet new people and see your friends. Spend the majority of your time working on your career, gaining new valuable skills, working out, reading, and socializing. Live a full life. If you're in the same social circle as him, limit seeing him there. You meeting there doesn't count as a date. 
9. **Don’t give too much of yourself too soon.** Make them earn every fucking thing. Slow it down.
10. K**eep your heart on lock.**  He might treat you a queen and appears to love you so much but remember: AMALT (All Men Are Like That). He is still a man and he's not exempt from the principles we talk about here, no matter how amazing he seems. Be cautious. Keep your heart on lock. Always be ready to walk away. If you feel like you're getting too close to him to the point where it will hurt if you walk away, put some distance between the two of you so you can regain your sanity and you can return to the point of being able to walk away at any point.",16870,Newly Single: The Lessons I Learned with Mr. Blue,0,1572036676.0,,,0

Then he told me he didn't love me anymore in july.

Now he came back, saying he did a full switch of his personality, that he wanted to destroy everything good before and became a manipulative jerk at some point in his life because of certain people betraying them. And he was afraid of commitment, of seeing that we were going to have a future together. He has mentioned he tried doing stuff with other two girls but it never went all the way because he couldn't keep it up with them for some reason.

That he suffered the whole time we were apart. But he was not messaging me?, he was treating me like a coworker(yes we work together so we saw each other daily after the breakup) and sort of like a friend. But he has realized he doesn't want me to be his, he wants me to be with him. That he doesn't care if I am less motivated or I get at my worst or best, he has decided he wants to embark on this life journey with him, even mentioned marriage and kids. That he is sure he loves me and is proud of it. And he has repeatedly told me he loves me. These past few days he has treated me like I always wanted him to treat me, with intimacy, soft touches, little lovely things and actions. has bought be 61 roses for the 61 days we've been apart. he even cried and he never cries. 

He said he has changed completely from being destructive and all that bad stuff to this, to simply being his purest self who loves me, that he now think differently overall and will be kinder to his parents and so on. That he has decided I am the one he wants to spend his life with, and knows he fucked up and lost my trust and hurt me a lot, and will work hard to regain some part of it. That he feels small in front of him. The one who used to treat me like shit, ignore me and my messages, not show me any romance, not being nice to me in a physical way even, now is.

Problem is I am scared of this now. i have suffered a lot, this was my first relationship. Going back to dating guys, it has been scary. I am a bit infatuated with another guy as well. This ex was my first love, and seems to love me now, but I don't know if I will ever care about him like my old naive self did. It was a toxic relationship and here he is now promising it will not be anymore.. he does seems changed and I am thinking of giving him the chance to at least date, I can't just jump back to being with him. I am guarded with guys. This sub has helped me as well.

Short story:

I knew HandsomeThug since I was in. middle school, he lived around. the corner from me. We knew each other in passing, but I always thought he was attractive. Years later I move back to my hometown and we exchange numbers. He seems really interested in taking me out, and I oblige. We go out, it was fun. I love bombed him on the first date and made him feel really special, not because I was trying to manipulate him, but I was so aloof at the time I thought I really liked him based on his appearance alone. Anyway we end up at a nightclub one night, I see a few celebrities there, and one of them was tugging my arm overtime I passed him but I would ignore it for my date. I was a local celebrity at the time, simply because of the people I knew and places I would go, and seeing them on a regular basis so it never fazed me. This made act more interested in me, but I didn't really think much of it. We get to my house after the club, and I was so horny I fucked him on the second date. My bedroom was a MESSSSS I was embarrassed that he saw my place in that state. Prior to this we ate and watched a movie and after making out I told him I had one rule: If we have sex stay the night with me (because I needed to cuddle) this asshole fucking starts getting dressed to leave directly after he loads the condom!!!!!!!!! He made this speech about how his class was at 10am and it was already really late and he would return. I told him that's not acceptable and if he leaves make sure to delete my number too. I didn't give any fucks about anything  in that moment besides the contract he agreed to. Anyway I blocked and deleted him after that, felt used and dirty for giving him sex. He pops up EIGHT YEARS LATER and finds my facebook with a message to please call him because he needs to speak to me. Naturally I do because I'm interested in what he has to say. so we spoke and he said  Sorry blah blah blah can he see me again. I said I'm not interested but thanks for the apology. I hang up and this sorry pos sends me a dick pic. I have never been so livid in my entire life. I think I actually became violent. So this goes on for about 3 months he is making new facebook pages contacting me daily, full stalker mode. I block every page and every new number he texts me from. I can't change my number because: fuck that. Anyway he wore my defenses with his persistence and he got me on the phone again, but this time I lead him to a textnow number I got from an app to create the illusion that I got a new number.  I answer and say what's up? Completely ignoring all the bullshit this one fuck cost me. We chat as if we're long time friends and he actually sincerely asks me on a date this time. I agree to the date, with my defenses up. We plan for next Friday, and I tell him to meet me two states (and $30 in tolls) away from our hometown at a bar in the downtown area. He agrees and I actually continue texting him throughout the week, as if nothing ever happened. I speak to him the day of the date and he asks me if Im still going. I said yes Im getting my nails done. So %pm rolls around, the time that I'm supposed to meet him, and he calls to ask where I am. I told him that I was headed there but there was major traffic and I would likely be late. He says that's fine he'll have a drink while he waits. I said ok, then in 30 minutes he calls again to see where I am. I tell him I had car trouble I'm still on the way. He tells me fine he's having another drink. In 20 min he calls me again to say where are you and I said to come outside I'm walking up to the bar now. He goes outside, and says where are you? I tell him I'm right here, he goes where I don't see you, I said

No matter how low down on the market, these men still feel entitled to a mate way above them, because being born as a man, in a patriarchal society, puts them in a place of privilege- whether they are consciously aware of it or NOT. The patriarchy has paved this for them over a very very long time, it becomes embedded in their psyche, identity and collective values which they cling onto tight. They can feel the tip of a wave coming for them...*.and they do not like it.* Why would over entitled low value men want to be kicked off their thrown &amp; be stripped of their benefits? *This* is why they call feminists hysterical and say the 'patriarchy' is a lie, its a classic manipulation tactic to make us seem unstable and unbelievable. Its gaslighting, because they know the dire state women find themselves in, and they know it is wrong they lie to these women, and use and abuse them. Feminists have rattled the cage they kept and continue to keep us in... which is why they're despised by most men who benefit from this.

**They know deep down women have the power in this sphere and always have, we select the genes, THEY aren't entitled to a high value female mate in the wild**, so they established a hierarchy that puts men at the top at a better advantage, particularly for incompetent unattractive men that would otherwise struggle to attract a good mate. They established this by chaining women to domesticity and childrearing way long after they needed to for survival purposes *(obv at some point it did make sense for women to stay at home &amp; attend to their children, whilst the man did heavy labour shit &amp; protected them- this would keep the woman and the child (most important) safe from harm, disease &amp; predators)*. However  at some point...they realised they could *extend this* to maximise their own benefit.

 Once survival was less of an issue *(humans had moved to the top of the chain &amp; the threats to us were less significant)*, men decided that they quite liked having these women docile and stuck in the home because it meant they could get ahead. They saw a window of opportunity, if you will- they saw an opportunity to give incompetent men power and assert that over high value women, they otherwise would have no access to. They were giving the puny, incompetent men a leg up the mating hierarchy. They actively excluded us from spheres of power; economics, law, politics, sciences etc...and instead we learnt how to focus on cooking for our man, looking pretty, repairing clothes etc *(this is genuinely the type o shit my grandma got taught in the 50s)* and how to be a good wife. We learnt some similar things to men, but not all and this was deliberately so. This meant that society was mostly built by men and history reflected this account, all the historians, inventors, scientists, lawyers, politicians, philosophers etc were mostly male.

 It is not that we were naturally inferior, we were shamed and silenced if we wished to contribute to society outside of the home, we were laughed at, threatened and degraded for having desires, dreams, aside from having children and making meals for men. Only men were allowed to be true individuals with fulfilling lives, whilst women picked up for them. Men were the gatekeepers, and they were on average physically stronger, they were essentially *abusing* the main advantage they'd evolved to have in order to PROTECT women/themselves/offspring to guarantee survival. Male aggression was not intended to harm and abuse women, because *CLEARLY* women are essential to their survival, their higher levels of T and subsequent aggression is to FEND OFF PREDATORS and protect their offspring, NOT to cause wars and slaughter women, which THREATENS SURVIVAL. Think about it, it makes NO sense these men defend mindless aggression that isn't to protect themselves *(and is why we put people in prison for it unless its out of genuine defence)*. We were scared of them, physically *(which is natural WHO DOESN'T want to survive)*, but we were ***never*** mentally inferior to them which is why more women are killing it at college now than men.

We were discouraged from sex outside of marriage, and babies out of wedlock *(my great nana told me some women were put in mental homes for doing this).* Because of this, many women like my grandma ended up not very smart (understatement but sad), and stuck dealing with a violent husband because divorce was frowned upon &amp; she had children. Here we have a classic example of this power dynamic skewed to favour undesirable men: a violent man, that got a nice submissive wife (my gran was pretty hot in her days aswell), who outside of patriarchy, would of left him high &amp; dry. Humans are unique in that they have more consciousness than most animals, thus their threshold for qualities in mates is higher, as we live much longer and are far more aware of whats going on, plus we have much more complex emotions. *His physical genes being strong alone* is not good enough, he needs to prove himself to be component enough to protect/provide for the child *over a long human life span*, and have personality traits that would be beneficial to the womans/child's health and safety. She will also want chemistry etc for her to spend such a long time with him, this obv does differ person to person, for all kinds of reasons. Clearly this man *fell short*, because he was a threat to her wellbeing and safety- *still the patriarchy granted him his nice submissive wife.* She still has a scar on her ankle from when he smashed a glass on her foot. 

Now when you consider the full impact of this on a global scale..............you can truly grasp how we got here, and why women are facing so many of the issues they do today still. Men have purposely objectified us to keep us docile 'AM I SEXY ENOUGH?' , they hold us to ridiculous beauty standards to keep us inferior and scrambling over them, as well as putting a dint in our finances, that were often controlled by the head of the house, the man. This also made us hypervigiliant, self conscious and needing validation from them, and worked *to the benefit of men.* Men were allowed to look like their natural selves but for women this was not enough, women had to perform femininity by shaving and wearing makeup &amp; keeping slim even if the man was gross. Sex was a given and men could rape their wives as the contract of marriage saw her as his property- **only in 1991 was the marital rape exemption challenged by UK law (just 30 years ago)**..sex without consent in marriage was not seen as rape before then (thats how consent came about)...and so this gave nasty men, or those incompetent in the bedroom or lacking in size a huge example as well. Men raping us is another dirty tactic, wanting to force pregnancy on us, or force their penis for sexual gratification alone, when it is the WOMAN who chooses the mate (female animals in the wild DO NOT enjoy being raped either and will kick them off). 

They did not have to be nice to have sex or work at pleasing the woman because women were reliant on them for a roof over their head (and childrens) as well as money/validation/safety and to be seen as socially acceptable ......*now do you see where these entitled attitudes come from?* They were entitled to sex no matter if they were shit or if she wanted it- this is clearly not how it works in the natural world, because PATRIARCHY is not natural- its a hierarchy of power designed to *oppress women for the benefit of men.* Feminism as an act of resistance against these chains, and has only taken impact in SOME areas of the world, often concentrated in wealthier countries, but not all. There are still many places where this the norm or worse, still many places where women have no access to education or are married off at 16 to men twice their age. And even in the areas we have penetrated, there is still a lot of work to do, because all these changes are mostly recent in terms of world history. The patriarchy had been established as the norm for a very long time, mostly by religious indoctrination, but not since the dawn of time *(important to note, it is* ***NOT*** *the natural order of things).* Religious indoctrination has been successful in establishing patriarchy, because it is tied up in the spiritual, the essence of life, death and family values. To challenge this, you are seen as attacking the 'essence' of life, peoples deeply held beliefs they often comfort themselves with in times of distress and so you are seen as committing a sin, so it is effective in shaming people. **But the patriarchy is NOT natural, men are clearly** ***abusing*** **their strength (designed to protect women) to ABUSE them through domestic violence, threats and rape and MEN are not** ***LISTENING*** **to us on this or attempting to CHANGE.** They can't use the 'survival' caveman bullshit excuse, because their behaviours are going directly against the survival OF WOMEN by doing this.

The thing is, it IS time women woke up, played this dirty game dirtier *(all the smart ones do)*, and got a global mating strategy of their own. ESPECIALLY high value women who are educated, smart, attractive, strong matured, loyal and caring *)* \- these women have put in the WORK to be an attractive competent mate and need to STOP allowing themselves be undervalued because they can be getting so much better. On a global scale, *we will never* raise the minimum threshold of competence for men if HIGH VALUE WOMEN keep settling for LOW TIER trashy men that cheat on them. We will never do it, **we are only as strong as the WEAKEST LINKS.** And right now, there's still a lot of them *(the handmaiden pick me's who are always anti feminist and seem to lie about orgasms more).*........SISTERS??? WHY do you think we are finding it so hard out of here? Why do you think that average looking man feels comfortable to talk you like a piece of shit on his foot? Why do you think so many men with sweet f all to over are so entitled? Why do you think so many highly attractive women with depth, humour, nice dress sense, hygiene, interests, and a good education keep getting PLAYED out and LIED to by shitty lower tier men?? Why do you think women keep going back to violent and abusive men who don't love them? It's not a coincidence, this shit happens all over the global, on a daily basis and for the average high value woman it will *happen again and again grinding her esteem down* until she WAKES UP and starts to play dirty *(aka fair &amp; meet men at THEIR level)* because this game is skewed against her. Is it because they were born a man, and its naturally like this or because of the patriarchy they are born into? 

Beta males, moids and fuckboys still get the better mates because handmaidens cave and settle, THEY DO NOT DEMAND MORE OR BELIEVE THEY CAN GET WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM, because they keep women insecure, jealous, yearning, overworked, traumatised, scared, fearful of 'the wall'. There is NO reason for them to step up with this privilege in place and so they keep breeding and leaving and abusing and using these women. WHY DO YOU THINK THERE ARE SO MANY LIKE THIS? They would of been struck out in the wild.

These men gaslight us on everything from cheating to rape to domestic violence to sex trafficking to transgender nonsense to how they use us for emotional labour to running off from fatherhood. They tell us what we WANT to hear, but don't actually respect us most times, see our humanity or care about our opinions and feelings. If they did, the patriarchy would have been abolished and women *(the most important sex in terms of welfare due to us being the ones that have babies, the future)* would be no longer suffering these issues or nagging men to listen to our suffering. Most do not believe we are equal, even the ones who say they are, they are in a position that is too tasty and beneficial to them..........just like the ugly moid who is too comfy with his handmaiden to even bother treating her with respect. **WHILST WOMEN SUFFER, EVERYONE SUFFERS, BECAUSE THEY ARE ONES RAISING THESE CHILDREN AND FUTURE ADULTS. WHEN THEIR LIVES IMPROVE, SO DOES EVERYONE ELSES, INCLUDING MEN.**

And why would they? The dynamic benefits them...you have attractive smart women with their own apartments, scrambling over some average or below dim bozo with no manners. If he plays her off, then he get more and more scrambling after him. He gets to weaken her self perception and limit her actual scope of her options because of this. Then he can sit back , relax and decide which ones he wants to pick off, and better yet the WOMAN will do most the work looking after his offspring.

We know when women settle and overlook thing this *does not guarantee* he will treat her better. But it *does* guarantee the man has the upper hand

We raise women to HIGH standards, so men receive the MAXIMUM benefit with LITTLE to offer. These men would be chucked out the gene pool in previous times, they would not be competent enough, but women of today are still happy chasing these men as if they are the prize.

&amp;#x200B;

This is why I refuse to settle- time to put men back in the WILD, in their natural HABITAT, where only competent mates attract a COMPETENT female mate\*\*. If we have to go most our lives without men, SO BE IT. If we have to access sperm banks SO BE it.

I know a few of you have played the puzzle 2048 and it can be tricky but its super doable. I like to shuffle very quickly and sometimes I make a horrible move and every move I make after that is super critical, as it could end the game. One time I got 2048 between two 64s and I needed to pair the 64s to get to the next level but it was extremely difficult, as I had little wiggle room. My strategy for the game is to line the numbers up 2, 4, 8, 16 perfectly so that every time I make a new list on top of it the numbers meet and I continue going higher exponentially. The problem is when you get a number like 2 next to a 256 you have to be very careful to turn that two into another 256 to continue. So my movements are binary. i simply only move down and right to line them up. When I have made a bad move I use this (until you HAVE to go up because its the only possible move) until I have buried the number I was trying to get rid of and the numbers are aligned again. 



I know that was a whole bunch of blabber for non gamers but think of that as a metaphor for relationships.

How do you even conceive about being high value when you're a covered in red flags? Here's the details:

I'm early 40's, never married, only LTR was less than three years to an agoraphobic x-rockstar, currently graduate school (borrowing $$$$$$ for it), very little money, ill-fitting clothes (very tall weird body shape), and to boot a highly stigmatized STD (genital herpes.) I know I'm a project. I'm trying to change careers and get in a better position, but I have a big hill to climb. Due to severe family trauma mostly due to shitty men I kept men away. I'm 100% working on myself. I'm in therapy, going to graduate school, can't do anything about the herpes except pray for acceptance. I do know I'm smart and I'm funny.  But, I'm also in LA, where image is everything. So, am I deceiving myself in thinking I can be high value, when nothing about me is (or at least compensate)? 

Please don't tell me to go to the herpes site.  It's a joke. Due to lack of standardized testing (STD panels don't usually test for herpes) a lot of people don't know they have it (1 out of 6 people have it, but 80% don't know they do).",16480,How to be a high value woman when on paper you're a total project (low value)?,0,1570912116.0,,,0

Here's why. You need to see first hand the type of tactics they pull so that you can be fully armored when you meet a man that you would consider marrying. You need to be very experienced in red flags, spin strategies, all of the sick shit men do to get us in bed. You are not there to do anything but take him as a case study. The douceyer the better. Literally take notes on his actions every step of the way, try to have a good time and leave. Drink dates are perfect because it would cost you no more than 40 min of your time at the very least. Long term dating douches is a really good way of learning, ESPECIALLY sociopaths. Dating a sociopath was literally the best/ worst thing that ever happened to me.

I told the current guy what was going on and he lost his shit and said he had no words and was going to bed. This morning I texted him to let him know I had no feelings for anyone but him and that I’m just an open book and that’s why I shared what was going on with him. Well he wrote back later and said dating me is out now but that he makes a “great friend”. He also said that he could not and did not want to reply to the stuff going on in my life (very little really, he’s being super insecure) and therefore he’s done with me. 

I replied that I was hurt by being rejected for things in my life beyond my control and that I didn’t need more friends and wished him well. I told him I was deleting his contact info and to please not contact me. I’ll be fine and keep writing (I’m working on a book and poetry and he asked me to keep going with that). I then went and deleted his contact info, the convo we’ve had for almost two months and all the videos he sent me - it’s all gone.
I told him I would not bother him with my baggage anymore (all it was was that ex texting me because I’m the only person he could ever open up to), and I said I would not validate his sister’s claim that “all women are crazy” but that I will say that some men are far too insecure to form bonds with women. Truthfully wished him the best and wrote that guy write off.

I want to talk to you. I want to tell you some things I never had the backbone to tell you before, and should have. You deserve to know, and your future victims deserve for you to have heard it.

You sensed my weakness when we first met. I was eager to please and easily charmed. I had little experience with men and the experiences that I had were all very bad. I was exactly your type. You charmed me, and listened, and got me to open up to you in ways that I had never opened up to anyone, I shared parts of my life and my story that had never been told. You took my desire to feel seen and loved and to feel beautiful, and you promised me that you loved me. You started to build a future with me that I had never seen for myself, we talked of the children we would have and the life we would build together. 

If I had been wiser or more calloused, I would have seen the signs. I would have seen how quickly you confessed your love, how easily you ingratiated yourself into my life. How readily you let me serve you and cook for you and clean for you. How you were okay with letting me pay your bills and take on your problems. How you laughed at my weight loss and said it would be a game for you to make me gain it all back. Real men don’t do that, but I had so little experience with real men.

You took a fragile girl made of glass, and you shattered her. When I found out that you cheated, one of the girl you cheated with and I became friends, and my heart ached for her. You promised her a beautiful future, you talked about the children you would have with her and the life you would build together. She even looked like me, because your victims are easy to spot: we’re all desperate to be loved and seen. My heart hurt for her in a way yours never will. She deserved better, every woman deserves better than you. After I found out you cheated, I tried to understand why? What was wrong with me? What did I do, or what didn’t I do enough of? 

When I think of people who do bad things, I try to understand why. Who hurt them that caused them to hurt others? But that’s the thing: nobody hurt you. You had an easy childhood, which transitioned to an easy adulthood. You had every opportunity to develop a strong character. You had resources and support and love. You had both of your parents, you had stability and safety. And you took all of those beautiful things, and made an ugly life out of them. 

You sought me out not because I was weak, but because you are weak. You will never find a strong woman on the merit of your character, because you have none. You are the perpetual abuser, someone whose life will in service to hurt and pain. I hope you grow old and women grow strong and see you for what you are. I desperately hope for strength for the women you encounter, because you are nothing without your manipulation.

People say that adversity makes us strong, but you didn’t make me shit. I made me strong. Every day I healed, and I learned, and I became better. I sat on the floor and glued together the fractured pieces of my heart, because I am the only one who can take care of me. You took my love and my effort and my money, but I’ve made them all back and then some. When I’m pursuing my dreams and making my goals a reality, you will keep spinning your wheels and abusing people because you are not just bad, you are evil. You don’t have a redeeming character arc, you are not the hero in anybody’s story. 

""Bitterness is drinking poison and expecting it to kill the other person."" I’m not angry with you anymore, and I don’t pity you. I grieve for your victims, and will spend my life making other women strong to protect them from people like you.

P.S. you still owe me $800.

For some BG info: 

I've always been overweight (20-40 lbs) despite exercising. I was normal weight 2x, through anorexia by age 11 and through obsessive exercise and CICO at age 16. my metabolism was probably wrecked by those events and why I was never able to lose weight that way again. I also have PCOS and insulin resistance, which I just found out about 1 year ago (23yrs old) and that finally gave me a concrete reason as to why I needed to cut out carbs and sugar in order to function like a ""normal"" woman. Well, 1 year ago I started to lose my hair, they found a benign tumor in my pituitary gland that messes with hormones, so that likely had to do with it. I lost about 50% of my hair, and I got a hair piece, then a wig, and I shaved it all off 3 months ago when I started my first out-of-college job. I look in the mirror and I don't feel like me. If I'm honest, while my confidence in myself and my abilities have grown so much, I feel like ""me"" until I look in the mirror. I already went through the depression and am still working on acceptance. It doesn't consume me like it did before, but it has completely stagnated my dating life. I am able to do what I do and take care to better myself because of hopes for the future. 

But sometimes those hopes are not enough to make me happy, or to replace a person. I am in NYC and I have yet to make many friends. I often am alone and I don't mind as I always find new things to learn, it's just not how I want my life to keep being. I mean this in terms of friends and men. I get so much more attention when I wear my wig, but tbh it;s not that comfortable. My hair seems to be doing better, so I'm hoping to grow it out and get a hairpiece again as that was the most comfortable. I know guys prefer my wig hair, and it sort of makes me feel like an impostor when I wear my wig, even though I didnt chose to lose my hair...I just don't look as good with my short hair. Some edgy hipster dudes who are not my type say it's cool, but it's not elegant, I'm not into looking edgy. Also, I don't make a lot of money so I really have to budget for months if I want to get a new wig or something hair related. Sometimes, I just break down and will stay inside and watch netflix and eat ice cream or something. 

We all have phases that are hard, I know that one day I will be at a better weight, have a new wig or hair piece, and hopefully some friends, but until then all I want to do is rest and focus on me. This tends to isolate me though, any advice? I feel like I'm wasting the potential of this city.",16016,How to stay focused to better yourself when you don't look the way want/feel?,0,1570810075.0,,,0

Often women tend to feel they are not 'good enough' when a man starts acting trash or disrespecting them/showing less interest. They start thinking they need to lower their standards or this man doesn't see any value in them at all. You start to think you will never find a good guy that sees value in loyalty....

HONEY, HERE'S THE REAL TEA- THIS IS *RARELY* TRUE FOR A HIGH VALUE WOMAN!

The fact is women are far more likely to settle than men are, and this has been backed up by studies and divorce rates (women are more likely to initiate divorce). We are far more likely to date down in looks /education and overlook red flags / undesirable traits than they are...*'well I'll give him a chance, he could be a good guy or going through stuff'.* And men are certainly less likely to settle when it comes to attraction, even if they are below average looks wise themselves.

You can be attractive, smart, well dressed, healthy, well read, interesting, well travelled, caring, kind, funny, honest and trash men will STILL treat you like gum on their shoe or just a piece of meat. These men you settle for will STILL lie to you and think they're the shit.

This can be because of several reasons besides you: THEY are insecure and don't feel like they have enough to stop you from straying (they can tell you have enough options &amp; are goin further in life than them), THEY are immature and have not spiritually developed yet (girls are for fucking, nothing more), THEY are running away from personal issues by fucking several women to boost their esteem (*I'm the man! Sob, why I can't I earn more!),* THEY haven't got their shit together and feel its not a good time to get into a relationship (mental health issues/financial instability), THEY don't think they're good enough (cheated on/not ready to trust yet) or THEY have not worked on their resilience/communication/self work and struggle to open up emotionally (which is essential to a mature longterm relationship.

More women settle than men (this is changing slowly), and its in men's interests to knock your esteem down, so they feel comfortable. So you don't feel like a threat, so they don't have to address the parts of themselves they feel anxious about, so they can keep you from moving on and discovering your equal.

They have a variety of ways they do this:  going hot/cold deliberately in order to make you yearn them, hiding themselves, lying about where they live/career, putting you down, testing your patience to see if you'll get emotional and validate them (they're insecure), acting with an overflated ego, trying to control you, putting you off travelling, belittling/rolling their eyes at you knowing more than them, making you paranoid they receive more interest than they do (men are ALWAYS receiving less interest unless they're top tier) etc

SO ALL I'LL SAY IS

If you're dating a dude that only has one in demand factor such as he is attractive....but he's bummy, not smart, not particularly interesting but you kinda maybe think he's a nice person cos he's cute sometimes but then he went cold and is getting disrespectfil

DON'T INTERNALISE their projections! And DON'T SETTLE. Know what you have to offer, and stop letting low market men think you are not good enough! There is a guy out there waiting to find someone like you, or is on his way to becoming the high value man you will find in a year or 5 from now!

This is the fuckboys no1 trick.....and it has fooled so many women I've seen who are high value and have settled in 2 or 3 departments only to be treated like shit and staying for the children.

You cant go around giving your goods to any man that asks or is there. Youre killing the pussy stock market. If the supply is high the demand goes down. Its simple economics. 

Remember, if your goal is a long term relationship you need to keep your mileage low anyway. Plus the men that are looking for a spin will be gone by the 3rd date anyway. 

You are also going to have to pay for the 5th or 6th date. He needs to see effort on your part as well. Dont be a user, you will inly create more MGOTW fucktards, and they are asexual so the human race will die off eventually 😂 

But in all seriousness if you look at Arab countries where the women are women are completely covered, the men are HORNY AF. That means they are willing to do anything to get a woman, including court a woman properly (wow, who wouldve thought 🤔)

Lastly, you need to match the fantasy that he already made up in his mind when he met you. So if you give him all of you too early he will ghost because he thinks youre easy. (For his purposes, you are)

Exception to the rule: If you have an exceptionally more glamorous lifestyle than him (live in a mansion, have a few luxury cars, own a yacht, etc.) and you have sex with him ONCE then disappear and return he will be so disoriented that  his interest will have peaked over (unless your vagina is loose, do kegels)

5. He's a gentleman. Will open doors, hold elevator doors, and does those little ""chivalry"" gestures for me.

I’ve been reading these methods, and, while I follow them, what I’m successfully doing is filtering out clowns. So I’m not getting used anymore, so that’s good. I was single for 2.5 years before I started this stuff and, 6 months after that, still in the same boat, except the time wasted is spread out between more men, because I cut them loose faster. 

But what’s not happening- that I keep hearing about in success stories here- is these guys that *are* stepping up, as a result of these methods. Treating some of you like queens, really making an effort! I’m not sure if I’ve ever experienced such things. I see myself just stuck on a hamster wheel of filtering out what has got to be a good 20 guys in the past 6 months, and never getting done with it. Out of them, maybe two seemed like they were super into me, but there were problems with those guys (unemployment, soon-to-be long distance, really bad kissing, etc.). The consistent failure in this blur of men has been kind of damaging. No sex in nearly half a year now because I stopped with hookups, which is all that’s been available. My profiles look pretty good, but I don’t get the “tons of messages” I hear other women here are getting. Your ability to level up to these guys that actually try almost seems too good to be true.

So for those of you who are not only filtering out duds, but actually *also* getting guys pursuing you (who I’m assuming you’re attracted to), are you all 8’s or 9’s? Are you all in your 20s? Are these guys you date significantly older and worried they’re running out of time? It just all seems so foreign to me, the part of this strategy that leads to being coveted. Tell me about you?

As for me, I’m early 40s, attractive, decent job, work out regularly, dress well (can’t do super high heels tho, have a permanent injury), and I’m a good conversationalist.",15780,The results FDSists get,0,1570759800.0,,,0

I was chubby and not great looking and that made me an easy target at my first high school. Boys 3-4 years older than me used to verbally abuse me, throw things at me, beat me, and once they even smashed a bottle over my head. I went to my guidance head and she attempted to track some of these boys down and nothing was done about it other than they were given warnings because it was my word against theirs, I’m sure she even said “boys will be boys” at one point. She even went as far as to blame me because i kept on going where they were (the school had all mobile phone service blocked and the back playground was the only place you could get a signal and I had really bad anxiety and I needed to call my family every break and lunch). After that my family soon pulled me out of that school and I was moved to an even worse one.

The next school was in a really bad area and I was assaulted almost every day by boys in the years above me. But it was different this time because they weren’t just insulting my appearance, they were making loads of sexual comments to me, but at the same time I knew it was sarcasm? They used to trip me up, punch me in the face, pin me up against walls all the time whilst saying that I was sexy and they wanted to fuck me. I eventually stood up for myself and when I felt someone trying to trip me up I grabbed him and punched him square in the jaw, also the whole time I was at this school I was 12. When one boy started saying things about my 12 year old ass I told him he needed a slap in his stupid spotty face, he then called me fat and the usual crap. This was also around the time of the “damn Danial” and “what are those” memes, and since Adidas superstars weren’t my shoe of choice that gave them even more ammunition to trip me up, I eventually started hitting back harder and eventually I was basically thrown out to the point my guidance head said “I wouldn’t bother coming back if I were you”. By some miracle I then earned a scholarship to a private school.

The private school was different because it was all mind games. The boys didn’t do that much to me physically at this school but they were always making passive aggressive comments and making fun of my weight. The uniforms weren’t flattering. They always asked about my sexuality and I told them I was asexual (this still stands to this day but at the time I was a prepubescent 13 year old), all the stuff that had happened previously caught up with me and I went in to a deep depression, the comments from the boys (and girls) at this school added fuel to my depression fire. A year and a half later I was medicated and was getting better but the boys were still making nasty comments and treating me like shit. At the end of the year one of the private school boys decided he was going to hit me because I said his friend was being rude to me, so I left a year early and went to college. 

At college now boys treat me like dirt and think just because I’m fat I’m insecure and desperate. I’m fighting off unwanted advances constantly and I’m shocked about the massive change in boys behaviour. Once they find out I’m not interested in them they ignore me and are nasty as fuck.

 **Ex Fiance left after 8 yrs** 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, I am new to this so I am not sure where to start but here goes..... I had been with my ex for 8 years, engaged for 3 and he was the love of my life, my soul mate, my best friend. We did all sorts of things together and spent 6 years remodeling our dream home. All of our money was wrapped up in it and I felt him pulling away slowly. We had some fights about money (who doesn't?) but he couldn't seem to let it go. I tried everything to give him pep talks, send good energy and reassurance. Then he started drinking more, and had been messaging girls from his work that he said were just friends. I know sometimes they are just friends but I felt it was something else. I confronted him and he denied anything was happening. I got random text messages from I'm assuming another co worker telling me they were hanging out. I was still blinded by love. In July he just up and says he needs a break. Then a few weeks later he wants to see what else is out there. Meanwhile, I'm dealing with a broken heart, and taking care of my sick momma. A few weeks ago I left for vacation and he had been spending time with me again, talking more, and we slept together. I came home to find out he was non stop texting this girl and hung out with her while I was gone... after saying he missed me, loved me and etc. This time I read everything and confronted him. He broke it off with me completely and had changed in like 4 days. He gave me the I'm just gonna be single line 2 days before our Anniversary. On his birthday the girl that was just his friend told him happy birthday as boldly as possible and he said thanks babe. Not even 2 weeks after 8 years and he was calling her babe when he spent 8 years calling me baby. It was a slap in the face, and my heart completely broke. I can't get the image of them out of my head and it keeps hurting and I can't make myself understand why this happened, let alone get over it. How did I invest so much of myself into him? Now I have realized that I can't orgasm either when I never had trouble before. I barely eat, sleep or function and I guess I'm asking for any advice to help, or any one that has had this happen.

Contrary to what incels and redpillers believe, material generosity is just one small part of what makes a HVM; there are plenty of financially well-off, if not wealthy, men, but many of them aren't interested in treating a romantic interest like a Queen, or even like a real, live, breathing human being. It's a sad state of affairs when there are so few men who have the emotional intelligence, integrity, and character to love another person wholeheartedly, with dignity. Our society does not teach men to view women this way, so for a man to develop these characteristics, he must do so alone, going against strong social programming. Frankly, the vast majority of men will never even bother to try. Technology will further reinforce social programming that makes it difficult for women and men to continue to have healthy relationships with each other, and I believe this will have huge ramifications for society in the near to intermediate future. 

For example, look at porn production and consumption. Prior to VHS tapes and players in the 80s, porn consumption was limited to theatres and magazines. ""Respectable"" men rarely visited porn theatres because it was a communal experience; you ran the risk of running into someone you knew. Magazines like Playboy were popular, but the content was often softcore; hardcore mags were pretty taboo. A man's (or boy's) contact with pornography was likely limited. When home viewing via tapes and DVDs became available to the public, the porn industry exploded. Filming and distributing content was cheap, and a whole new generation of men suddenly had easy access to hardcore pornography. Of course, this only intensified with the advent of the internet. My point is, with the last 30-40 years, the widespread availability of pornography (especially hardcore porn that features sexualized violence) has changed sexuality in fundamental and likely irreversible ways. If your first exposure to sexuality is through pornography (as is often the case with millenials and gen Yers), and you've gorged yourself on porn before you've ever had any kind of sexual contact with another person, it will have huge ramifications on your sex life. There's plenty of research out there about how porn consumption messes with your brain chemistry and interferes with healthy sexual relationships, so I encourage everyone here to read into it if you haven't already. Objectification of women and sexualized violence is at the heart of pornography, so if a man (or a woman for that matter) ""learns"" about sexuality through porn, they are being taught to objectify women and to associate sexual pleasure with sexual violence. It doesn't help that liberal feminism has taught an entire generation of women that so long as sexual pleasure is involved, anything goes. When kink and BDSM have gone mainstream, it is a symptom of a widespread societal problem that says sexualized violence against women is acceptable and desirable. This should scare everyone, but it doesn't.

I believe that advancing technology will only further widen the gulf between men and women, to the point where relationships between the two will break down completely on a societal level. For example, if we assume that technology it's possible to create an AI sexbot that passes for a human woman, then men WILL create one eventually. It's a matter of when, not if. If such technology becomes available to the masses, why would men and women bother with each other at all? Can you imagine it? A man can go to an AI brothel and have sex with a sexbot that is anatomically ""perfect"", never ages, can't say no or talk back (unless programmed to, of course), never carries diseases, can never get pregnant, and must cater to a man's every sexual need and desire. Or a man can buy a robot for his own... and hey! maybe they can be programmed to clean, too. Why would men bother with women at all, then? They wouldn't. Not even those that would be inclined to become a HVM.

The gulf is widening already... among first world countries, birth rates are plummeting. Women are marrying men later in life and forgoing motherhood more often. Many women aren't marrying at all. Governments aren't able to provide women with convincing incentives to keep procreating. The birth rate will continue to dwindle.

I don't see anything changing for the  better. The world is full of fuckboys and too few men of quality--certainly not enough to go around for all the HVW out there. Thinking longterm... what does this mean for women? I feel that the future is pretty bleak, and that there's not much we can do about it.",31793,"High Value Men are an endangered species, soon to be extinct",0,1572812518.0,,,1

I don't agree with that definition but that is what the moids have in mind when they spew that.

This is such a knee-jerk response from men when confronted with women who don't care about being married or otherwise saddled with a male half. 

The stats speak for themselves. Best case scenario, the woman will outlive the man in a long term marriage...and she will be his caregiver until he is dead. 

Or worse, the wife gets sick and to the SHOCK OF NOBODY, the couple will divorce because men fucking suck. So she ends up alone...after dealing with the illness and the selfish POS husband.

I turned 40 this year, I don't' feel like I hit a wall - rather I hit my tailwind.  I just don't give a fuck anymore what men (and even my husband) find attractive or necessary for a woman to do.  

I stopped shaving my legs, not out of anger but just because I find it tiresome.  And frankly, it feels really nice to feel the wind in my leg hair.   On Monday, they are going to take my IUD out and I'm not replacing it with anything.  Fuck it, I've been on birth control since I was 18.  I'm going to love my body as a perfect vessel to get me through this life.  My feet are large (size 10), they are perfectly proportionate for my height.  My belly is soft and warm, my thighs are strong, my face has smile wrinkles.  These are signs of a life well-lived, not something to be hidden, injected, or surgically removed.   Finally, I'm not going to hide my cleavage for the sake of false modesty.  For too long, I have been sexualized for my genetics, either by men leering or by fellow women judging.  These are my breasts.  I like them.  They are passed to me by my mother and grandmother just as much as my other hereditary traits.  

If I can communicate anything to the younger generation of amazing women coming up, it would be this.  Don't wait until you're 40.  Be exactly who you are right now and screw anyone who wants to put you in a box.  You are not a prize to be won and kept dusty in a showroom.  Walk away from anyone who puts demands on your body, your time, your intuition.  Keep your standards high.

FWIW, I did have this conversation with my husband when he asked why I stopped shaving.  We had a drawn-out discussion about my reasoning and while he said he doesn't find it attractive, he acknowledged that it was his social conditioning and said he doesn't find it unattractive either.  I pointed out that I make no demands on his body or shaving rituals, and this small act has major reverberations in the way I view my place in the world - on my terms.",31740,I'm learning how to hold myself outside of the male gaze,0,1572791464.0,,,1

He is my best friend in the entire word, he’s for me like a family and as much important as family. But our telenovela goes already for more than one year. I’ve been through a lot of shit.. depression, anxiety etc. He patiently bare with me trough that time but of course it comes back from time to time.
Mostly I’m depressed because I’ve never had a boyfriend and I feel very lonely and anxious about my body. 
Of course I wish we weren’t just friends but I’m afraid to say anything because him to be my friend and in my life is the most important thing.  Sometimes I think that he wants that too, but then he does something that makes me think complete opposite - like asking me about girls from work (we work in the same place) or asking me to stalk them if they have a bf, telling me about his dates etc. But yet he couldn’t find any girlfriend, he just had relation that were down only to sex.
We don’t see each other very often because of work schedule (so it can be 3 times a month or even once in 3 months). Recently every time we saw each other and watched Netflix he starts to cuddle to me. Lay on my lap, ask me to touch his hair, hold my hand when I lay it on his chest etc. 
Then we had a serious talk about sex - about our history and experiences. And he asked if I want to have sex with him (this is very important thing to him as he said that he cannot get feeling to a girl without having sex with her first). Firstly I didn’t agree but then I decided to try, mostly because I wanted to be close to him.
He was very sweet and turned out that I got my period on that day but he still wanted to give me pleasure specially that it would take my period cramps away. So we stick to petting only. 
And few days ago we saw each other and even if I had to go to work in the morning he asked if I wanted to stay the night (but saying that we don’t have to have sex if I don’t want to, just go to sleep). I stayed and I agree for sex but I also was very honest that I’m afraid and not that confident (because it felt for me like it was first time - hadn’t have sex in a looooong time). He said that it’s ok and start to touch me. It didn’t last very long because we really had to go to sleep and at the moment it felt good but after..

I felt so lonely... because it was just sex for pleasure and I felt I’m missing all this amazing thing when it’s about connection and love. We didn’t kiss during sex and it wasn’t super romantic. Later we didn’t cuddle, I was just laying on the other side of the bed. I don’t know if he was afraid to do it or he wanted me to cuddle to him or he just didn’t care about it at all.
And on one hand I want to be close to him and it feels to me like the only way to get to him but on the other I’m afraid I will feel like this every single time and my depression will come back.

These are the arguments for not paying on a first date:

- no exclusivity

- women may see multiple people at the same time

- equal rights means equal responsibility 

Now, let’s unpack a bit:

1) equality between the sexes extends to the legal, judicial, economic aspects BUT it does not extend to the social aspect. 

Dating and relationships are not human rights. Furthermore, the first 3 aspects are generally (and intended to purposefully) be as objective as possible, whilst the social factor is incredibly subjective. Therefore, it is of incredible stupidity to treat a subjective aspect of your life through an objective perspective. 

The art of courtship was designed so women (or their families) could pick the best suitor. This meant that the man would often have to flex all of his qualities, be them monetary or otherwise.

2) If exclusivity is not in the table on the first date and you believe that she may be seeing other people as well, why would a man disadvantage himself by not paying for a first date? He is essentially doing less than others.

This is like a fast-track for a woman to lose interest.

I know this is probably out of topic, but I wanted to tell you all how this community helped me!

 Long story short, I'm only 23 and I'm not really into having sex without being comfortable and at the very least exclusive. I only had sex with one person (my long term bf at the time) about 3 years ago. Since then, guys have asked me out and flirted with me. I even dated a couple, but, as most guys my age, they always expected sex asap, so I always ended it.

 The thing is, I started to get lonely, so I talked to some friends for advice and they all told me I was insane for not dating casually first, have sex and then see if that leads to something, that I should lower my standars and see guys personalities and that I really should download tinder (fyi in my country its used 98% for just sex).
 This threw me off a little bit, so I searched for answers from male subs ( I know, huge mistake) and they all said the same my friends did, ""if we don't have sex after the 3rd to 5th date, its over"" and ""yes, I love when girls ask me out"". So, being the idiot I am, I decided to give it a try.
 I liked a guy (average, but ""good personality"") and I asked him out, texted him, made plans, etc. Not only did he suddenly started to act like he was the price and I should do everything in my power to gain his approval (when before that he always texted first, approached me, complimented me and generally pinning after me ), but I have never in my life felt so ugly and insecure. Thankfully, that went nowhere, but all my friends insisted I should at least try to have casual sex to see if I liked it. This really isn't in my nature, but really, I felt like this was the only way to have a relationship and it apparently worked for everyone I know and trust.  

 So, I was really starting to consider it and ever trying to hype myself to do it thinking ""its the normal thing to do, not just being used. If not now, when?"". But while lurking r/vindicta to better myself, I stumbled upon this place.

Why is it 'goldigging' when an attractive young woman who is educated /has her own money wants a competent man that can financially provide? Internalised misogyny perhaps?

Do these people claiming we are evil 'goldiggers' know that financial issues is the NO1 REASON for divorce in the US?

So if you're with someone that has lax/immature attitudes to spending/is a low earner with no (evident) plans to ease the burden off you as a hardworking breadwinner mother....don't you think that might cause some heated arguments between you both? Wouldn't that cause friction that could possibly erupt into a broken home? Get real here people. Love doesn't pay for your children's daycare fees does it? Verbal flattery from your husband won't pay for your kids college tuition, it won't pay for your health bills if you get sick. It takes a lot of money to raise kids &amp; you are going to feel overwhelmed settling for a broke man as a working mother.

If I'm going to take a pay hit to a lucrative career whilst having children, then I'm going to need a reasonable unselfish man who has me covered so everything is smooth sailing...particularly if we want multiple kids, with multiple mouths to feed. I don't want to be working 50 hrs a week in a high stress job whilst cooking , cleaning, doing the laundry, running after the kids etc whilst the man comes in and slumps his ass on the couch from his low paid job, leaving it all to me. Most low earning men I see, with breadwinner female partners, have ZERO desire to advance their pay/careers through education or qualifications....they are perfectly complacent &amp; comfortable with the set up because old girl is doing *everything for him*. Old girl is shouldering MOST of the weight, and she thought it was fine to enter a relationship this on matter, she thought she could 'do it all' herself.  I don't believe this is fair or balanced...I don't believe that is what true  'equality' looks like....it looks like a man slacking off, taking the piss and using his wife as a donkey.

Why does an educated woman with money have to settle for nit picking broke men, since we all know broke nit picking selfish men are rather partial to emotionally manipulating women so they can financially leech off their hardwork and reap the benefits of dumping domestic duties on their wifes saddled back? Those pay half men are some of the most awful I've come across, they *still* feel entitled to sex after the first date.

**He is hoping you bring your sexuality into the relationship while he provides nothing to the table. You are NOT his sex puppet. Don't be ashamed to bring it up and see how he reacts.

I understand it might be hot to imagine a woman you like making out with another woman if your head is in porno land, but trust me, a lot of women aren't getting lady boners over their boyfriends making out with another hot man or would want that to happen.

Another red flag is if men don't see you kissing, developing feelings or having sex with another woman as cheating. That means he isn't looking at you both as individuals, rather, he is placing you as an object. Try kissing or having sex with another man, let's see how hot he gets thinking of you going down a hot guys dick. Yeah, not so happy now right?

Sometimes you're actually friends and hang out outside the bedroom, but often y'all just go to Bone Town and that's the extent of the situation. In this guide I'm going to break down the dos, don'ts, and how to get maximum female benefit from your FWB. 

**Why would an FDS woman want or benefit from this?**
The short answer is, not all women will. Some women only enjoy sex with intimacy, connection and monogamy. But on the flip side, there are those of us ladies who find they think more clearly and logically in actual dating scenarios when their physical needs are getting met on the reg, so they’re more able to recognize red flags on actual dates because they’re not dickmatized. If you’re the latter, keep reading! If FWBs or casual sex isn't your thing, you do you boo. 

**What constitutes a “good” FWB?**
Let’s be honest, most men are horrible in bed. Sex is rushed and over when they are done, regardless of your enjoyment. 

A good FWB will: 
*Communicate, listen, and value your needs
* Share your kinks
* Respect your physical boundaries
* Be clean and use condoms without bitching about it
* Understand the physical nature of your relationship and not get too attached

A good FWB will NOT:
* Pressure you, neg you or manipulate you 
* Be passive aggressive or make you feel guilty for seeing other people; slut shame you
* Discuss your situation with others without your consent. I had a FWB in my friend group once and we were always incredibly discreet. It's not anyone's business. 
* Push you for an actual relationship if you've made your boundaries clear 
* Put all the responsibility on you (hosting, contraceptives). His dick, he buys the condoms. 
* Be married. If he doesn't respect his wife, he doesn't care about women and will be bad in bed. Just don't do it. 

**How do you find a good, quality FWB?**
I’ll be honest, I have a hard time maintaining a FWB with a guy that I could see dating long term. I prefer guys who meet the above requirements but with whom I’m not compatible emotionally or else I’ll catch feelings. For example, the best FWB I’ve had was a guy I briefly dated in my friend group. He was clean, good at communicating, fun to goof around and laugh with buuuut he wanted to become a professional Twitch streamer, we had nothing in common, and still lived with his parents. Obviously not long term material. But he made an excellent fuck buddy. 

So where can you find this guy or girl? OLD is always an option. Like the guy above, if he isn’t up to speed with me professionally, emotionally or intellectually but I find him attractive, I’ll have the conversation that I’m willing to be casual but that’s it. Some guys will be hurt but some will be on board. 

Another way is, an actual friend. This is always a little bit more weird, at least for me, because it’s an odd transition but I’ve known of it happening.  If you’re a little kinkier, fetlife or kink communities are an BUT I have also found that fetlife in particular can be a breeding ground for toxic male behavior. They think they can get away with absurdly assumptive or degrading behavior because of the sexual nature of the community. Take extreme caution when using something like that. I’ve had mixed experiences and while I don’t think it’s inherently bad, I think you have to keep your guard up and carefully vet people. Overall I would say OLD is the best way to go.

**How you you start a FWB situation?** 
Like I said above, having that clear conversation from the start will be key.  Discuss needs limits, schedules, and preferences. Tell him to get tested routinely and that condoms will never be optional. You can discuss frequency or leave it open ended. Sometimes you'll hang out before and sometimes not. Depends on your actual emotional connection. 

The funny thing about people who calls us ""femcels"" is the this doesn't exist. Any woman at any time can have a FWB, no matter who she is or what she looks like. There are a thousand dudes on tinder or whatever app you're using that will be down to clown at any time, your job is finding a good guy who will provide you with a fun time while you're both independently looking for your LTR. 

**How do you end a FWB? What if it's not working out?** 
Most of my casual sexual relationships have ended because I became monogamous with someone else. I saw the FWB until me and the man I was dating DTR (defined the relationship) and then I broke it off with the FWB. The conversation usually went like this: 

Liz: Hey dude, so I'm in a relationship now so I won't be able to hang out anymore 
FWB: Congrats! Thanks for letting me know!

And that's it. Easy peasy. Usually we stay friends on Facebook or snapchat and see each other around but there are no hurt feelings. Now if you're not in a new relationship and aren't feeling it anymore, just say something to the extent of ""hey, I'm too busy right now, I'll let you know if anything changes"" or ""I'm going to have to stop seeing you for a bit, but I'll let you know if I can meet up again in the future"". You don't owe him an explanation and we all know if you sexually reject a man, he's going to try and burn down your house, so I prefer the indirect approach and they'll usually get the hint without their fragile egos being damaged. You can definitely be honest but I've never found it was worth it to me. 

**A few final notes:**
* Always meet first and never let him think that you'll have sex with him without doing your research. If he wants to enter your body and expose you to a whole host of potentially life-long consequences (STDs, pregnancy) the absolute LEAST he can do is give you his full name so you can do your research. No joke, one time I was talking to this guy and he was cute and funny but when I looked him up, he had FOUR DV CHARGES, several restraining orders, and drug related charges. FUCK THAT. Court records in the US are open for public review online. If he thinks that you seeing his ID or checking his court records is too much, bye. The risk isn't worth it and he's got shit to hide. 
* NEVER SEND NUDES. It introduces a power dynamic that can turn toxic extremely quickly. I had an ex threaten to send my pictures to my friends and family because I broke up with him. Never ever ever do this. 
* Never invite someone you don't know to your house.
* Trust your intuition. Female intuition is an incredibly powerful thing. If something feels wrong, get out of there. Block him, end it. You don't owe him shit. Our intuition is finely tuned to recognize and alert us to danger before we even see it consciously.
* Your safety and enjoyment comes first, always. If you aren't feeling it, end it. Before, after and during. You're in control. 
* Have fun! If you're not having fun, what's the point?

I've often felt some resentment towards the men I experienced in real life.

&amp;nbsp;

I had this idea that men, as a whole, had so many insights and were capable conjuring up amazing creations and concepts, but my experience of men had been so much less impressive. The greatest people in history, had all been men. Fictional or not, *they* were the ones that found all of the knowledge that we have today... so why are the men I interact with on a day to day basis keeping all of this greatness from me? Why don't they ever give me a glimpse of this wisdom and intelligence they have within?

&amp;nbsp;

Well... I realize something lately. I'm sure we are all aware of the generalizations. Men and women have the same average IQs, but the maximums and minimums are less extreme for women and more extreme for men. This means that the smartest person in any of your classes is probably a male, but so is the dumbest person.

&amp;nbsp;

So don't let a lack of female presence in the history of knowledge discourage you or buy into the false premise that men are smart/better than women.
Never mind the fact that women didn't even have the privilege to explore the sciences and philosophies that men did, the vast majority of technological advancements and profound philosophical concepts were by these rare, extremely intelligent (and privileged) men. Not by your average male. 

&amp;nbsp;

Other, greater men made great discoveries, and the rest of men are just riding the coattails. The modern man, especially, likes to look to these great minds and use them as evidence for their superiority. Of course, they forget that the smallest minds in history were also men. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are a ton of factors as to why there is less of a female presence among the great minds of history. The obvious ones being that we had lesser rights and less bodily/reproductive autonomy. Why did it end up that women were placed below men in society? Because as a species, we are religious thinkers. Not scientific ones. 

&amp;nbsp;

What do I mean by that? Women *are* physically weaker. We *are* more hormonal. We are more risk adverse. We are less competitive. We bleed 3 months out of the year, and (until recently) when we have sex we are highly subject to the vulnerabilities pregnancy and child-rearing. Men on the other had *are* stronger. They *are* highly sex driven. They are more aggressive, competitive, and therefore hierarchical / status focused. Before the concept of evolution came into play, we didn't have another explanation for the differences in male &amp; female behavior so we assumed it was because one sex was inferior to the other, most obviously due to our physical differences. 

&amp;nbsp;

In simpler words, religious thinking is what led to men to believe God made man in his image. Scientific thinking is what brings forth the reality that *man* made God in *their* image.


&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR** Don't ever buy into male superiority. Those that push the idea of male superiority are indulging in religious thinking, rather than practicing scientific thinkings.",31554,Men on the pedestal; are men smarter than women?,0,1572706552.0,,,1

 **Men are completely bullshit about how often they get laid** 

 

I just posted this as a comment in another thread but figured it deserved it's own post.

Men are incredibly bullshit about how often they get laid. The fact is that it's extremely hard to get laid. Let's look at it mathematically. Lets say the average girl sleeps with 20 guys in her lifetime, which is probably pushing it because a lot of girls barely sleep with anyone (religious girls, girls who get married young). And let's say that the average girl is also sexually available (has reached maturity and is single or poly) for 10 years of her life(also pushing it). So that means that there are 3,650 days in which this woman is going to sleep with 20 men.

If you figure the odds without any variables added in, then you have a 20 in 3,650, or 1 in 182.5 (close to .5%), chance of getting a random girl to fuck you on any given day (if you're not already fucking). So lets say that you work out, learn game, dress nice and all that shit. And that you also pick your women and go for promiscuous girls (a girl with 100 lifetime partners would be 1 in 36.5, or around 3%, without accounting for variables). I'm going to be extremely generous and say that all these things can bring your odds of getting in any one girls pants to 1 in 15. Now let's say it takes on average 6 hour of work to get a girl to fuck you (probably generous although sometimes that number is a lot lower too). So, under optimum conditions, you would have to put in an average of 90 hours of work for every girl you sleep with. Or two weeks, plus some over time, of a full time job. That's also without factoring in the amount of time that working out, shopping for clothes, doing your hair and all that other stuff takes up (probably at least 10 hours a week). Factor in that there's also women that have partners who will waste your time and let you hit on them and the amount of time for each girl you sleep with is probably closer to 110-120 hours. If you do out those numbers based on the average girl (20 lifetime partners), then that's 550-600 fucking hours per girl.

Even if you give yourself a 1 in 5 chance of sleeping with any girl, which is fucking ridiculous unless you look like ryan gosling, then you would have to put in 30 hours of work for every girl you sleep with. Even if you severely dump your standards and go for girls you're way hotter than, those girls are still not going to want to add another dude to their tally unless they just can't resist. I would say that would bring your odds to 1 in 3 at best, and that's if you're like a 9 that starts going for 4's and 5's. So still 18 hours per girl. Of course, this math is all very shaky but you get the point.

The fact is that dudes, including me, are bullshit (although I've gotten better at not doing it). We really can't help but inflate our number even when we try not to. We're so insanely insecure and sensitive about our masculinity that we need to lie in order to prevent ourselves from feeling worthless and inferior to other men. I really think it's a toxic thing to do though because it creates unrealistic standards for everyone and leads to a lot of unnecessary insecurity and jealousy and whatnot. I think the fact that just having other people think we've fucked girls that we haven't even fucked makes us feel better also goes to show how superficial our motivations for wanting to fuck a bunch of girls are. It really is such a stupid, empty pursuit when you think about it.

In the post I commented this on, the op said he thought 20% of men could get laid at will, which I think is ridiculous. I would say it's closer to .1% if not worse. ANd that .1% is made up of celebrities and extremely genetically gifted people who are also in extremely advantageous situations (Frats, rave scene, schools star athlete). And the latter of those two types of guys is going to have a lot more trouble getting laid once they leave that advantageous situation. I would say that 1% probably can get laid pretty easily. Like I said, 1 in every 5 or so tries. Which means that the other 99% of men are bullshit.

I think my current relationship is best I've ever had mainly because we're best friends. I think it's very eqaul and we're both on the same page with so many things.

I know there's a big thing about making the man pay for everything on this sub. But the way bills work in our relationship is an income-based ratio, so if I make half as much as him I pay for half as much in expenses.

I know it would benefit me more financially to make him pay for everything, and I know that he would. But since he's genuinely my best friend I can't bring my self to make him, I never let my girlfriends pay for me so why would I let him?

I do pick up most of the housework since I only work part-time but we often do big chores together.

And from an emotional and sexual point of view, he takes care of me very well.

I guess the main question that I've been thinking to my self is whether or not I should make him pay for more stuff?

Precisely the kind of loser that you do not want, because he will probably be lazy and stingy in every other aspect of your relationship. 

Ladies, ever notice how there isn’t a similar shaming language for men that only seek to have sex with women or use them for sex? Because things are only “bad or morally wrong” when it’s a woman doing it. The only word that comes close is “player”, which in itself has undertones of praise and a lot of people don’t use it as shaming language. In fact, sometimes it’s said as a term of praise and admiration. Only women are shamed for wanting to use men, just like it’s mostly only this sub that’s being brigaded with incel, cucks and other low value men losing their mind about the fact that it exists, while they haven’t brigaded the many other subs that seek to use women. 

There’s so much attempt to restrict and police women’s actions, it’s incredible. No safe spaces for women to literarily just be, without men trying to forcefully inject themselves and their worthless opinions into the things we say to ourselves. And this is also notable in many other societal social issues that affect women, with mostly men trying to be the one to make decisions about what women should be doing with their bodies, their lives. They’re so terrified and insecure about the inherent value and power of women, they seek to oppress and shut it down every time a woman realizes it. 

Be a “gold digger” if you want to, love. The threshold to shame women is so low, and so society (esp men and pickmes) will literarily shame you for anything. If you live your life based on what they’ll think of you, you’ll never be happy. There are lots of men that don’t mind, in fact LOVE paying on dates. They love spoiling their woman and they take pride in being able to pay for most (not necessarily all) things. That you actively seek and prefer such men is to your benefit and a blessing. 

The shamers will cry and wail, tear their hair out in frustration and screech their shaming language at you at the top of their lungs, while you’re chilling and enjoying being spoiled. When they’re tired and realize no one is listening, they’ll wipe their tears, stomp the last tantrum stomp and then go and sit down.

Sure, we think about it subconsciously, but when’s the last time you stopped what you’re doing and actively made a mental note of this? I believe that this question is so important, and the lack on inquiry about it, is one of the major causes of unnecessary stress and disappointment with regards to our relationships with men. 

At every step of your relationship or marriage, this is a question that you need to be asking yourself. In fact, this question should ideally begin before the relationship even starts. And it’s why I’m a huge advocate for women dating multiple men at the same time. It can be stressful and exhausting, but at the end of the day, it is the only thing that brings on the rewards that you as a woman have been seeking. 

You need to evaluate every guy that you’re dating on these very important qualities: 

- Attractiveness and fitness
- Confidence and ambition
- Sacrifice and generosity
- Goal orientation 
- Kindness and responsibility 

I believe that these 5 things are the ideal traits that every woman should look for in a partner. And men that fall too far off each requirement should be cut off without sex or effort reciprocation. 

A man that does not pay for at least the first few dates and insists you go Dutch, is likely poor quality that does not value you or think its worth it to try and impress you. A man that does not take care of his general appearance and the importance of him being attractive to you, does not care about your preferences. The one that always seems to be in between jobs and talks like he’s still hoping to jump start a rap career at 30, does not have discernible goals and is not someone you should associate with. 

And if he’s a total dick to you, then you need to dig deep into your inner bitch and ruthlessly cut him out of your life. Or worse, if he’s nice to you, but a dick to the waitress/plumber/delivery guy/(insert any service job here), then he’s likely the manipulative, 2-faced kind that will eventually cause you stress down the line. 

Do not let any guy or anyone shame you for dating multiple men at once. Tbh, chances are that so is he and he is likely being hypocritical with regards to judging you for doing precisely what he’s doing. It’s neither his or anyone’s business who and who you’re dating. A lady does not kiss and tell. Tell him that it’s none of his business and that it would benefit you and his’s relationship with each other if he focused solely on the relationship that you two are building together. If he bristles or outs up too much resistance or insecurity about it, communicate good riddance and leave him on read. 

As a woman that knows what value you bring, you need to ensure that the man that is joining you along the ride is on par with you and can keep up. If he’s slacking, he either needs to shape up or fall off.",19753,What value does he bring to the relationship?,0,1572144075.0,,,0

I'm in my mid-20s, and was listening to my boyfriend's younger cousin talk about her brother and his girlfriend. These are young kids (everyone is under 20) so hearing about their dating lives are interesting. She (let's call her Anne) was saying her brother's girlfriend (Bianca) was too high maintenance because she was expensive to take out, and her brother had to spend lots of money ubering to see her since he didn’t have a car, etc.

To me, I always hear it as “too high maintenance FOR HIM”. Know your worth, and find someone who can act accordingly.

If I dated my boyfriend at Bianca's age, we wouldn’t have the problem of him saying he spends too much money on uber because he had a car to drive since he was 17. He grew up driving Mercedes's because of his family background, which is the type of person who will be able to afford you.

As an only child, I've grown up high maintenance. My parents lavished their time and attention on me, and even though I wasn't given every single thing I wanted, I grew up wealthy so there was never anything I couldn't get - it was just things my parents didn't want to give me because it would spoil me.

As an adult, it's only natural I want this type of lifestyle to continue.

It's not enough to date some random old guy who's made his own money in whatever industry he's been in for the past 30 years. Being high maintenance allows you to find a guy who's still young enough, but with everything an older guy has earned for himself, and more because of his family background. I don't want someone who has spent his life making millions - I want someone who grew up in it, because these people have a very different outlook in life.

I do pity Bianca, because even though her bf and mine are cousins, their family backgrounds are pretty far apart and she's not gonna be driven in a Mercedes by her bf until his parents win the lottery or he earns all that money himself. I was online dating and actively looked for someone like my bf, because I wanted someone who grew up wealthy just like me and could treat me the way I was used to. I lucked out with him, because he grew up even wealthier than me.

I demand degustation dinner dates for my birthday. I want to be driven home after every date - in his parents' Mercedes, not my bf's clunky old Land Rover that's a hobby car. I demand his time and attention on the weekends. I want his best in my life. Don't dumb yourself down to being any guy's Cool Girl when that has zero interest in your own wellbeing.

First of all, worries about pregnancy and STD. Although I ALWAYS keep the rule that “no condom, no sex”, but I was the one who get worried if period comes late or just generally concern about the aftermath. Of course, guys cum and go (not pun intended 😏); do they even care?

On top of that, I tend to be emotionally attached  a bit after sex which I tried my best not for it to happen. It sucks. There were just so many pump &amp; dump situation happened. Ha.

In addition, mediocre dick and mediocre sex. Smh.

Now I’m so done with this hookups as I’m tired of having sex with random dude and realised I just need something steady. So, Instead, I got myself a vibrator and have fun with it lol. I’d be lying if I said that I don’t miss intimacy but... oh well.

He was super cute and loving, and really good looking, but something just seemed off in a strange, can't quite put my finger on it way. 

There was a whole lot of red flags with this guy. I'll just state some of them.

1) He asked my why I broke up with my boyfriend and I said that it happened due to some core differences. He wouldn't let go and insisted on knowing what differences exactly, which I obviously didn't tell him since it's none of his business. Then, without me even asking, he proceeded to tell me how he broke up with his ex because she always complained about them having too little sex. He told me how sex is not everything and how he loves to just chill, watch movies, cuddle, yadda yadda.

Idk if he is actually a caveman still thinking that women don't enjoy sex or what, but I knew that he was full of shit. Obviously not all women enjoy sex to the same extent, but I am definitely more on the ""I could do this until I faint"" side, so it really didn't work with me at all.

&amp;#x200B;

2) I mentioned that I was stressed and studying, and he said ""I'll come and cuddle you"". I do love cuddling, however, I never showed any signs of being interested cuddling *him.* I took it as a joke and said ""whatever lmaooo"", to which he sends me a picture of him sitting in his care with the caption ""I just need your address"". Idk why this creeped me out so much but I stopped responding to his messages completely.

He texted me three times after that, apologizing if he said anything wrong and asking me to simply respond, which I, being a nice fucking person, do. We start talking again and after two weeks of not showing any red flags, we agree to a date. He would pick me up from uni, take me to a nice restaurant, all that stuff, and it did resonate with my standards and expectations atm, so I was like why not. 

And now my favorite one, red flag number 3.

The evening before we were supposed to meet up it started raining heavily. On my way home from uni he texts me someting in the terms of ""perfect weather for cuddling"", and I respond with ""yeah, if you're cozy at home and not freezing outside"". He hits me with the ""you should've called me, I would've picked you up, blah blah"", piss off honestly, if you wanted to pick me up you would've texted me before I was almost home. Not to mention the fact that I am not giving my address to a random guy from tinder. About an hour later I'm at home studying and he texts me ""man, now I gotta drive to (name of the area I live in). So I'm like ""really? why?"" and he deadass says ""coming to your place"". I take it as a joke cause he cannot be that fucking weird, to which he sends me his location with the question ""Come on, am I nearby?"". 

Ghosted him immediately after that.

Fast forward to yesterday, turns out my sisters boyfriend acutally works with him. His name is first of all not Kara. The whole not having sex story was more made up then the posts on r/AITA, since he is the biggest fuckboy, a new chick every two days - type of guy. And now my favorite part, the mentioned ex girlfriend, whom he broke up with because she complained about not having enough sex, is not an ex at all. She is his current girlfriend who is absolutely clueless about everything, since she has been in a hospital for weeks now after suffering a terrible car crash. 

I genuinely cannot wrap my head around someone being this much of a complete piece of shit. Still, so often happens with men, disappointed, but not surprised.",19459,Tinder moid lied about every single aspect of his identity. Trust your intuition ladies!!,0,1572133842.0,,,0

So last night, I was looking for a movie to watch to help me get over my ex (it's now been a week since it happened, so I'm getting there...) and I watched this movie called, ""Ready to Mingle"" on Netflix! All throughout the movie I was thinking, this is totally like FDS, but IRL. I think you ladies will love it. ;) 

Here's the plot:

&gt;After the man she thought she'd marry breaks up with her, Ana joins a class for single women who are in search of a husband.

Here are some golden nuggets from the movie:

So all of you are on a journey to find a man. And what have you done to find him? 

**Student:** Well, I downloaded Tinder and other apps, but no one takes you seriously.   
**Instructor:** Maybe you're the ones who don't take yourselves seriously. How many failed dates have you been on? How many times have you waited for that phone call that never came? We live in hard times. Technology allows us to find a partner with one simply click. And with another, we can get rid of them. Men have more options to choose from nowadays. But so do we. 

Wear solid colors, not prints. Remember that less is more. Memorize this: men only notice looks. They can’t help it. It’s in their DNA. So if you want their attention, you must improve your looks. 

**Student:** Shouldn’t we be with someone who sees beyond appearances?  
**Instructor:** I don’t know. You tell me. How many men have been interested in your big heart? Like it or not, girls, these are the rules of the game. Use them and you’ll be living it up for the rest of your life. 

You must look feminine at all times. Unless you’re not looking for a man, of course.

Men don’t want a wife who looks like a stripper. They want a wife so they can think about a stripper. They’re men. Don’t try to understand their logic. 

You can be whoever you want. 

**Instructor:** Your future husband is out there, and it’s up to you to find him.   
**Student:** There’s nothing for me out there.   
**Instructor:** Maybe you were too busy stalking your ex to find the time to go out.   
**Student:** I’m not stalking him. He blocked me ages ago.

**Instructor:** If you really want to meet someone, you have to leave your comfort zone. Change your routine. No more chaperoned dinners, Netflix nights, or cyber sex. Stop going to Pilates and find a class with more men. Join a gym. Go out! There’s a whole world of possibilities out there.   
**Student:** Isn’t that why we have the internet? So we don’t have to go out.    
**Instructor:** And look how far it got you. I’m not telling you to give up social media. Instead, use every possible resource to maximize your opportunities. 

So basically, what I've learned from the movie is: 

* Do less online dating. Focus on meeting men IRL. My theory lately is that high quality men won't be on dating sites. My type of man is busy working and doesn't want to hook up with women, so odds are, he won't be on dating sites. I have a post coming up on how to flirt with guys IRL + a personal challenge for you ladies to do, so look out for it!
* Stop wearing prints and do wear more solid colors. Always look feminine at all times! 
* I need to get a makeover. This includes getting my hair done (I need to redo my balayage, it has been a while), working out more, and revamping my wardrobe (new clothes, new life!).",19459,"An FDS-Approved Movie on Netflix: ""Ready to Mingle"" (Tips Included!)",0,1572133503.0,,,0

Smh.    

Recently, things between me and my best friend had taken a turn for the romantic. He initiated it and I went with it quite encouragingly, because he really would be perfect for me imo. However, right in the initial stages, he broke down and said that he realized how much damage he’s carrying from his previous (oh god, disastrous, disastrous!) relationship. He was quite upset and we talked things through, and he apologized profusely. But the sexual tension was already in place, and a few days later, we devolved from a maybe relationship to a sexting situation.     

Now, I take full responsibility for participating equally. Mostly because I’m attracted to him and I do have feelings for him. But from his part, there’s been sexy times and furious backpedaling. And I cannot but help feel as though I’m becoming a sex buddy on call. And, what’s equally painful, I miss my best friend.      

So. This is the soup that I’ve gotten myself into. What would be the best way to maneuver out of this situation? Is communication missing here? Or is he now being a ‘man’, instead of being a person, like he used to be?    
  
And, full confession, I still would like to pursue a relationship with him. Is there any rational way for me to actually get this to healthily happen?",19453,"Ladies, I need some clarity again.",0,1572133348.0,,,0

Alright let’s get down to it. This sub has grown exponentially in the past few weeks/months and we are so happy that you all joined and we welcome your input/strategy advice, as long as it coincides with the general goal of the sub. 

We’re doing so well, the sub has been picked by multiple RP, MGTOW and incel groups [like here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/dhpr50/femaledatingstrategy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). Apart from the usual weak cope stemming from their bitterness and anger that they use to deceive themselves that our strategies won’t work, one of the things mentioned is that only unattractive women need dating advice and strategies. Let’s take a step back and think about this for a second. Think about your own dating experience. Whether you’re an attractive or an unattractive woman, old or young, experienced or not, what have you noticed about the kind of men you end up having to date when you don’t require much value from the men that come your way? 

Many men will certainly throw themselves at you, but what quality are these men? What efforts do they bring and what value do they offer? What ways can you make sure you get the most and the maximum use of the men that come your way and ensure that you’re always one step ahead with minimal negative effects or damage to you, your physical, mental and emotional health? 

Answers to these questions is what we and this sub offers you. You yourselves know that so many men have such little value and until you project yourself as someone requiring him to have value before you agree to be with him, you’ll always end up with the shorter end of the stick. 

These RP, MGTOW and incel men will and continue to cry hot tears because they know that when women come together and realize their value and have ways to negate men’s manipulative tactics, they stand no chance. The inherent value you have as a female places you at a higher position, but imagine what you can become and what you can get when you’re actually aware of their tactics and you’re armed with strategies to counter them and get the most for yourself? ☺️

Men know this and they’re scared. Appropriately so. Let’s keep it that way. 

Again, y’all are doing awesome. I’m so proud and so grateful to the mods that have been propagating the integrity of this sub and keeping the information relevant and keep us growing everyday. Keep slaying 💯",19401,Do women really need dating strategy advice? 🤔,0,1572130818.0,,,0

I’m a junior in high school, 17, and I recently met this amazing guy. He’s tall, cute, fit, etc.Over the last month, we’ve really gotten to know each other and he’s like the only friend I’ve met in such a long time. I feel like my life changed after meeting him. I was a loner and had really low confidence when I first met him and now I’m doing much better. I’ve gotten to be friends with some his friends. My life is just much better with him.He’s always there for me and I think he really cares about me. However, I haven’t really gotten him to commit to being in an exclusive relationship. He’s a just go with the flow type of guy and tells me not to worry when I ask him this. He tells me he’s with me literally at the moment and to not think of these things. But it’s literally impossible.

He has so many pretty female friends that he talks to on a constant basis. He could be getting intimate with them and I would have no idea. He’s just a sweet lovable guy. I’m crazy about him. He gives off player vibes honestly but he tells me that he’s not that type of guy. He could be with tons of other girls and I wouldn’t know. It drives me kinda crazy. He tells me he really enjoys our relationship but doesn’t want to be official bf/gf since he’s a senior this year and probably moving out to to college next year. Meanwhile, I’ll still be doing my last year of high school. We’ve gotten really intimate together lately. In the beginning I was trying to hold off since we weren’t official but I just couldn’t help myself. I’ve stayed over at his place overnight and I met his mom. She’s really nice and fucking gorgeous, I have no idea why he’s with me if he can date a girl that’s actually physically attractive.I really just have no idea what to do. He treats me like a friend in front of his friends. No hand holding, hugging, cuddling nada. His friends just think I’m an ugly girl he’s platonic friends with when we’re not.When we’re alone he turns on a switch and is super intimate. He tells me how gorgeous I am and I literally melt. No one has ever shown me that they cared like this guy does

What should I do guys? He’s like my best friend now and I don’t want to lose him. However, I feel like when he goes off to college we’re done and he’ll go off happily to a large school and be with tons of pretty girls. I’m just really confused with our relationship and just want to have commitment at least. He tells me he doesn’t like being intimate in public which might be why we don’t look like a couple to his friends. To his mom, he also introduced me to her as his friend. So I just don’t know if he’s embarrassed of the possibility of us being a couple and just wants to be good fwb. I don’t want to be the girl he’s using for intimacy. I want to be the girl he’s proud of to show off to others and things like that. Help me guys please. I’m just scared of losing him. I’ve opened up to him so much about myself and he accepts me which is something no one has ever done before. Any advice?",19392,Am I getting played?,0,1572129831.0,,,0

dont ever degrade yourself to make a man happy. have high standards, show a little disgust in reaction to his cum. they owe us alot for tolerating their disgusting bodily functions, show no remorse in doing so because they will do the same about periods. we as women have been brainwashed to fetishize male cum because we wanted to make them happy, we wanted to comfort and reduce their hatred toward the dirtiness of their cums, but they took it as a way to degrade and demean us more and use it against ourselves.(men used to complain about women jumping to wash their genitals after sex which made men insecure and feeling dirty, which is very illogical because if women dont wash afterwards they will end up with urinary tract infection and pain, but men being the man child they are; didnt have womens best interest at mind, now porn has normalized swallowing, deepthroats and bjs as part of normal expected routine , something that they couldnt even dream about in those days)

reminds me that anything we do as women with good heart intentions, men will turn against us.

dont ever degrade yourself to make a man happy. have high standards, show a little disgust in reaction to his cum. they owe us alot for tolerating their disgusting bodily functions, show no remorse in doing so because they will do the same about periods. we as women were brainwashed to fetishize male cum because we wanted to make them happy, we wanted to comfort and reduce their hatred toward the dirtiness of their cums, but they took it as a way to degrade and demean us more and use it against ourselves.

We eventually hung out once and just kissed and did some pretty tame petting. He said he was emotionally unavailable. I told him that I was a virgin, but I just wanted experience because I couldn't do a relationship rn (true, because of busy schedule).

He asked me to let him know if I wanted to hang out again. I was unsure of things (especially since he calls himself non-monogamous and broke things off with his long distance ex-gf because she wanted to move to be closer to him wtf), but I was feeling horny one night and texted him to hang out - which was a month after our first hang out. 

He said ""sure, I'll get back to you in a min!"" and then... no response for 2 WEEKS. 

He texts me last Friday and I told him I was sick. He was like ""oh damn"" and then asked if I wanted to learn how to give a blow job. To be fair, I did say I wanted to try oral stuff, but I was taken aback by the question. 

What's horrible is that even though I felt uncomfortable, I played around a bit with him over text and basically said I would do that. 

Now it's been a week and HELL NO I am not giving this guy a blow job. like what was I thinking... He's not reliable and he made my volunteering position hell over the summer. 

So how do I get out of this situation without looking like a loser or somebody who just toyed with him? 

a) ghost him (we kinda still see each other around, so it would be weird)
b) tell him I'm going through a stressful time and just need to focus on school
c) tell him I'm not ready to try any sexual things because my mind is not in the right place

I'm a 23-yo woman, and generally considered quite attractive. (I sometimes model.) Moving to a new city and breaking up with my boyfriend has led me to dating apps — Tinder and Bumble mostly. I've found, as I'm sure many of you have, that on these apps I will ""match"" with virtually any man I swipe-right on. At first I was very selective about by my matches, because I didn't want to waste anyone's time, or lead anyone on. But over the past few months I've found it far more fulfilling to do the following:

\- Purchase the upgrades on Tinder or Bumble for the extra functionality (unlimited swipes, matches don't vanish. etc.) They're well worth the cost.

\- Swipe ANY MAN who I find even slightly attractive.

\- Once we've matched, let him fight for my attention with all of the others. (In the case of Tinder, he texts first. In the case of Bumble, he gets a free ""Hey"" and that's it.)

The downside is I have dozens (or some days literally hundreds) of texts of sift through. But I've gotten very good at eliminating men quickly (Too lazy to punctuate? Fuck off. No clear body pics? Sorry, Charlie. Bragging about your dick without asking? Pass. Etc.) and the result has been a very good pool of available men both for dating and simply hooking up with. And additionally, their awareness that they do NOT have my full attention make them put several times the effort (financially AND sexually) into the dates I do agree to go on.

I'm kind of bored of being single, I rarely meet a guy i'm physically attracted to let alone on a mental level/have stuff in common with...and quite frankly I'm missing regular sex with some1 I have a connection with. *THAT* part. The last 3 years I've said to myself i'm not getting in a relationship for the sake of it (last 1 was intense), but none I've chatted to have tempted me beyond a few months...eventually I see too many turn offs/fuckboy red flags and block them. I'm sure you get the frustration of this false start cycle.

However...

An ex of mine has been dipping his toes in with me for a while now, every few months he tries to spark convo somehow, complimenting a pic/story...and then a few months ago we got talking and he starts sending me old pics of us at uni, which sparked so many memories lol (we'd both just moved south to the capital city so we kinda experienced it together both coming from the north). We've never been on bad vibes really, I actually have quite a bit of respect for him which is pretty rare for me and ex's, he's a very chilled out black guy, he looks like he would crush you but is actually a friendly giant &amp; we have the EXACT same taste in music. I really feel this one is still not over me lmfao cos he STILL has this ancient pic of me in a bath robe, that should not be still in his possession otherwise. That shit is OLD son!!!

There was never any hatred between us, I think we just met at a bad /immature time. We both met in our first year of uni (NOT a good idea) when I was tryna get over this asshole back home I was still in contact with ( I was SOOO upset over that one for MONTHS it ruined my first semester). I guess I was wanting the attention to just get over my asshole ex, but we were quite cute together. I remember one time he got a taxi 3hrs away just to visit me at home.

I think the reason I dumped him was because  there was this pretty dancer chick, that he was flirting with just b4 me (I think he had trouble choosing at first, bc he was till fresh to uni &amp; exploring his options), and some pick me trifling \*\*\*\* said she saw him sat on him in the library....so I naturally went mad and dumped him. I also remember at the time, he was a little immature, and his b.o was bad in the summer cos of him being in the gym 24/7. Basically I wasn't enthralled enough to take the risk.

But in retrospect, knowing what I know about the *pick me* girl now, I don't believe it because this girl was mad jealous of me and ending up spiting me in an unrelated incident (long story but she got in my face on a night out and was meddling with another close female friendship of mine). Obv I didn't believe his denial at the time bc you know how men are...but in retrospect now, he might of been telling the truth... because I remember the pick me saying ' I MIGHT of seen him, come to think of it'...after it all blew up. She backpeddled once I went crazy &amp; dumped him... so that's the only reason I questioned her intentions about it.

I think it only bothered me, cos this dancer girl had her eyes on him when I did but he ended up rocking with me. I remember when he first fully clocked me, I was on the underground and he was glancing at me, when he got off he went to his friends 'that girl is FIRE' &amp; he was like a typical giddy ass teenage boy lol. Anyway he tried getting me back at this boat party and I was having none of it. I was such a nonchalant bitch, I deliberately wore the tightest dress in my wardrobe and made sure everyone noticed lmaooo

HOWEVER...he has now glowed up like FUCK. He's always been mad tall and athletic (he gyms a lot&amp; is quite bulky), but now hes in suits, working some high paid finance job, has a nice car and has bought 2 properties hes renovating (he's had the updates on his insta story). Basically, he's become a man, and he has a lot going for him, pretty much the full package goin on. When I speak to him now he always says hes snowed under at work. So a lot has changed in those years. I think he had a pretty mixed chick on the go a while back but they broke up.

The only issue is his dick is massive. Its like 8/9inch...and at the time, I don't think he knew how to work with it to not hurt me, he was always paranoid. It was actually a bit problematic logistically.. but theres worse problems lmao

But yeah, basically, he keeps sniffing around me...and Its tempting, bc I've never really hated him, I just think we met at the wrong time, with me getting over an ex and him being immature in his first year of uni. But yeah I'm getting tempted cos we do have really good chemistry.

I've been a lurker of this sub for a while now and I've been reading the posts here almost every night.

I would just like to rant for a little bit if that's okay. 

I work in the hospitality industry as a receptionist. I like my job and my job duties but lately, I'm getting tired dealing with male customers. 

I will just list down a few things that happened to me recently;

A middle aged South Asian man befriended me and then proceeded to ask me personal questions about religion. (He's a Christian minister) I tried to dodge his questions and then he asked me out for dinner one night, in which I rejected. Things became really awkward after that. He tried to talk me but I will give him short answers and will only answer questions in relation to my job. 

I started wearing sleeveless tops to my workplace recently because I started to feel confident about my body. Cleaner No. 1 who rarely talks to me, started talking to me and calls me, ""Sexy girl"" and asks me questions like, ""Why do you dress so sexy?"".

Cleaner No. 2 was fine at first but now he has begun to flirt with me and he kept asking me questions again and again until I lose my calm, I don't know if he genuinely doesn't know his own job or if he's just trying to get a reaction out of me because he thinks it's funny.

Befriended an Irish man who was in his fifties and even introduced him to my friends because he's friendly and seemed like a wise man. Around two weeks later, he messaged me out of the blue saying that he's horny and he's thinking of having sex with me. Proceeded to send me a picture of his penis. And that was the last time that I talked to him. 

There were also some guys who hit on me and naive me will think that they genuinely like me for me, only to find out that they just want a quick fuck before they leave the country. I got myself burnt several times because of this. I honestly don't think that I'm giving off the signals that I'm the casual kind of girl. 

I love my job and meeting people from all over the world but I'm sick and tired of dealing with men and their toxic behaviours in general. The hardest thing is that if I wasn't working, I could be like Fuck Off to these men but these men are smart and know that I couldn't do that. So I continuously have to deal with them (and not just deal, be friendly with them too) for as long as I see them at work. 

I'm supposed to work three days these week but I already cancelled my shift tomorrow. And thank you for reading my post! I just wanted to share my experience dealing with male customers on here.",19083,I work in customer service and I'm tired from dealing with men.,0,1572116046.0,,,0

“Dear Abby,

I don’t understand why I am still single.   I am a fun, cute girl who is always up for a good time.   I don’t need to be taken on fancy dates, I am fine just chilling with a guy at his place, I am totally sexually fun and open, I don’t have any desperate need for babies and I am not in a hurry to get to the altar.   I don’t make a lot of demands on men, I am totally low maintenance and I don’t get possessive.   I have a cool city fun job and I do yoga, I am totally modern, cool, chill and don’t ask much, so why am I still single?  Why can’t I get a man to commit? 

Sincerely,

Confused Cool Girl.”

Whenever I have seen such a letter, I want to grab this woman and say:  This.  You just listed the reasons.  That’s it that’s the explanation.

Everything you said is why you are single.


Confused Cool Girl is probably not aware she is cool girling or trying hard.   She probably genuinely thinks she’s super chill and not in a rush to get to the altar, but if that were true she wouldn’t be sad about not getting commitment.

Here’s a tip:  if you are acting like you’re in no rush for your needs to be met, why would a man rush them for you?

The most important takeaway from this post is that **men *say* they want a woman who appeals to their male imperative, but they do not *respect* a women who does that at the expense of her own needs; they marry women who are not afraid to honor their own imperative**

I am not saying a woman who genuinely feels all those things and isn’t sure she wants marriage won’t be respected.   But in spite of what men say over and over, if you genuinely want marriage with a quality man,  playing it down to seem cool and because low value men have screeched about how marriage is something to run away from is just shooting yourself in the foot.

Some men do want a woman who appeals fully to his desire to get laid and stay single, and you can do that too, if you want to be a plate.

If you want marriage and family, or even if your goal is just a FWB where you get treated like a queen, **he should know this by the first date or at most after say, three meetings.**

No you shouldn’t make it personal early on like you must marry him specifically, but he should know it is your goal.

The high value men who choose marriage respect that you respect yourself, they will not if you pretend.   No matter how often men say they love a passive 100% submissive docile obedient maid and sex doll who does not need commitment.   That is not who they marry.

Insist upon your standards immediately.   If this drives a man away, congratulations, you just saved yourself months or even years of your valuable time.",19073,"If you want commitment, marriage, children, to be taken out, treated like you’re special, then you must insist upon it, and make it clear right away.

I've read enough posts from women on those subreddits to think that some men are NEVER monogamous with you. They're being monogamous because they can't find women to cheat with. It takes them months / years to find someone so they'll have a GF or wife while they secretly browse and look for other women.

Of course, my advice is to leave immediately, but sometimes I feel like that's what women should be doing.

This is going to be long but this is about:

My parents divourced when I was 9. My mother, due to depression, was abusive and brutally kicked me and my siblings (6,5,3) out of our home. We wound out with my father. By then I'd been conditioned by my mother to cook, clean and take care of the kids so as not to get hit or upset my mother. I did the same with my father, who worked late nights. I did it also because I was afraid he would abandon me and my siblings again. So I was left to take care of the kids for YEARS from morning (getting them ready for kinder/school), to putting them to bed, and then spending the night cleaning until late.

This with time was encouraged by my father, and then my siblings who became entitled to my subservity. I developed a co-dependacy mindset, depression, cutting...

However, I want to reinforce that I am strong despite this; I am smart, resourceful, opinionated, and was forced to grow up quickly.

My Dad’s first girlfriend I rejected (when I was 10) and he dumped. I hated that she tried to be like a ""mother"". The second girlfriend, he kept “secret” for AGES pretending she was a family-friend but I was not stupid. I disliked her but was forced to get along with her kids, and take her in. This made me a ""black sheep"" for a long time, and hurt me further. I still maintained a divide between her and my siblings. For some reason, I automatically reject women who approach my siblings and I through my father--probably because of my mother, and my established responsibility to take care of my siblings.

During this with his second girlfriend, he’d spend loads of time either at work or at her place, placing me in a parental role at home. I'd proven by then, that I was capable of managing a household--but at what cost, he'll never know until 9 years later. However, they broke up 2 years ago (when I was 16) on my term. She had insulted my siblings and I. I don't tolerate this. Especially when she was repeatedly toxic, and brought the worst out of my father. I didn't care if my dad would be angry at it--she will never go near my siblings. if my dad pursed a relationship with her, fine, but that will be all.

Since, she has bullied me, but a comment of hers has resonate with me: That I am ""the queen of the house"".

Now at 18, my childhood has caught up with me. I've been crying, cutting, depressed as I reject my co-depdency habits and how they have been re-inforced by my father, and siblings (who've grown used to it, and have been emotionally abusive about it). In rejecting it, I have been very open about my struggle over the years, and yes, very accusing and very blunt (eg. ""I raised them...I did this...I did that..."").

In response, it has often angered my dad who has openly stated that ""I think I'm better than everyone, that I'm always in charge"" for stating opinions, advising him/siblings ect. I've realised I've emasculated him. He has shown sympathy though when I finally showed my cutting scars, and in response he's put pressure for my brothers (M16, M15) to ""step up""-which I saw as ""fair"" at first-I'll get back to it.

My dad has also showed signs of threatening to kick me out, and making me uncomfortable to live at home now that I'm an ""adult"". To the point of my offering to pay rent/or for food because I feel awful living here ""for free"".

I've also realised that I've often forced myself to be quite and ""small"" about thinks I KNOW I'm right about, so as not to over-step him--but COME ON, I'm basically been made a parent now, just without the benefit of the ""title""/and biology. Now, I am extremely respectful to my father, more so than my siblings (remember--emotionally abusive, because unlike me they've been raised to be entitled, and selfish, and ""take, take, take"" because I was always the child that had to be ""perfect"", responsible, ect.)

Now, he’s has another girlfriend with at least 6 kids. At first I was happy for him, but now I’m scared of repeating the past. I don't want to be around her or ""play happy family"". My siblings think the same thing: Happy for him but don't want to be forced into anything. My father, over the past 3ish months has basically moved in with her, coming home to either change his clothes for work, or sleep a little before work--he has even been late with bills, because I think he provides her with money.

And on top of that he has been hostile like always. I thought my stepping down to ""heal"", will allow my siblings to step up to be more responsible--because, you know, older siblings learn the ""important"" skills most of the time. But now I think it's bullshit, the way I see my Dad berating my brother for stupid things like he used to when I was younger. I've realised, it's not my siblings who need to ""step up"" but my DAD. All the time he spends ""dating"" shows he has time to ""parent"".

I must admit too that my dad is good with children. I think he always preferred and loved us better when we were kids. He treats my ""half-siblings"" from his second girlfriend better--but, you know, kids are cute and need to be loved differently than teenagers ect. So I don't hold that against him.

What I do hold against him, is how I've allowed myself to be ""small"" despite, apparently, being a ""Queen"". I still need time to heal and establish food boundaries, and focus on exams for the next month--but I've realised I need to step up again.

You can't teach a dog new tricks, you know. And I want my Dad to be happy. I just don't plan on making him happy by being small anymore. I have always been strong for picking myself up and others on my own-and I am realising this because I've always thought I'm weak, especially this year with all the tears I've shed from having my childhood catch up on me, and realising all the time I've lost being an adult/a parent.

Not only that, because I've been on ""break"" and my Dad is dating, and my brother is fucking young! nobody is raising my siblings well. Their potentials is being wasted away.

They are not as ambitious as I am. I'm a youth leader in my community, I volunteer, had clubs and awards to my name, and have had two jobs thus far. I've noted that my siblings only take on these credentials if I'm pushing it (eg. they are volunteering now because I said so).

I need to raise them again, but this time on my own terms: no feeling guilty, no pleasing my father, but rising them well and still focusing on my dreams/goals.

It's just, I don't want this ""role"" to break me like It has in the past. I don't want my siblings to ""break"" me either with their entitlement and how I just 'give, give, give"" and neglect myself. Last year, I failed getting my grades I want (but still did well) because I was nursing my father back to good health (the break up, our grandmother passing away, and a ""betrayal""), and managing my siblings, a job and then school, and then my mental health which when to abolsute shit--it was...really, really bad, panic attacks and everything.

I just want to do this right, so I need your advise: How can I still continue to balance levelling up/and being a Queen focused her goals while raising my siblings, job ect. I guess it would be easier, to ask this as ""what advise would you give a single mother"" because my dad has chosen his priories (and he thinks making money, putting us through school is all he can and should do).

Thank you to all who read this far, I really just had to get it off my chest! And I am so ready to be ruthless (I'm done with my dad, honestly), and have a strong ""game plan""!

I also know, other subs will tell me to call CPS or ""get out, don't bother"" but I can handle this (especially because my siblings are older now), and because (this may sound bad) but I priories my education and goals above EVERYTHING. Plus, I know this sub will encourage me to take back my power, to get my shit together and upgrade, and that's the advise I want. 

tl;dr: I was grew up raising my siblings like a parent. My father's dating habits further enforced this; this made me very co-dependent, and my attempts to ""heal"" has revealed my habit of being ""small"" to make my father happy is wrong and toxic.

This is going to be long but this is about:

My parents divourced when I was 9. My mother, due to depression, was abusive and brutally kicked me and my siblings (M6, M5, F3) out of our home. We wound out with my father. By then I'd been conditioned by my mother to cook, clean and take care of the kids so as not to get hit or upset my mother. I did the same with my father, who worked late nights. I did it also because I was afraid he would abandon me and my siblings again. So I was left to take care of the kids for YEARS from morning (getting them ready for kinder/school), to putting them to bed, and then spending the night cleaning until late. 

This with time was encouraged by my father, and then my siblings who became entitled to my subservity. I developed a co-dependacy mindset, depression, cutting...

However, I want to reinforce that I am strong despite this; I am smart, resourceful, opinionated, and was forced to grow up quickly.

My Dad’s first girlfriend I rejected (when I was 10) and he dumped. I hated that she tried to be like a ""mother"". The second girlfriend, he kept “secret” for AGES pretending she was a family-friend but I was not stupid. I disliked her but was forced to get along with her kids, and take her in. This made me a ""black sheep"" for a long time, and hurt me further. I still maintained a divide between her and my siblings. For some reason, I automatically reject women who approach my siblings and I through my father--probably because of my mother, and my established responsibility to take care of my siblings.  

During this with his second girlfriend, he’d spend loads of time either at work or at her place, placing me in a parental role at home. I'd proven by then, that I was capable of managing a household--but at what cost, he'll never know until 9 years later. However, they broke up 2 years ago (when I was 16) on my term. She had insulted my siblings and I. I don't tolerate this. Especially when she was repeatedly toxic, and brought the worst out of my father. I didn't care if my dad would be angry at it--she will never go near my siblings. if my dad pursed a relationship with her, fine, but that will be all. 

Since, she has bullied me, but a comment of hers has resonate with me: That I am ""the queen of the house"". 

Now at 18, my childhood has caught up with me. I've been crying, cutting, depressed as I reject my co-depdency habits and how they have been re-inforced by my father, and siblings (who've grown used to it, and have been emotionally abusive about it). In rejecting it, I have been very open about my struggle over the years, and yes, very accusing and very blunt (eg. ""I raised them...I did this...I did that...""). 

In response, it has often angered my dad who has openly stated that ""I think I'm better than everyone, that I'm always in charge"" for stating opinions, advising him/siblings ect. I've realised I've emasculated him. He has shown sympathy though when I finally showed my cutting scars, and in response he's put pressure for my brothers (M16, M15) to ""step up""-which I saw as ""fair"" at first-I'll get back to it.

My dad has also showed signs of threatening to kick me out, and making me uncomfortable to live at home now that I'm an ""adult"". To the point of my offering to pay rent/or for food because I feel awful living here ""for free"".

I've also realised that I've often forced myself to be quite and ""small"" about thinks I KNOW I'm right about, so as not to over-step him--but COME ON, I'm basically been made a parent now, just without the benefit of the ""title""/and biology. Now, I am extremely respectful to my father, more so than my siblings (remember--emotionally abusive, because unlike me they've been raised to be entitled, and selfish, and ""take, take, take"" because I was always the child that had to be ""perfect"", responsible, ect.)

Now, he’s has another girlfriend with at least 6 kids. At first I was happy for him, but now I’m scared of repeating the past. I don't want to be around her or ""play happy family"". My siblings  think the same thing: Happy for him but don't want to be forced into anything. My father, over the past 3ish months has basically moved in with her, coming home to either change his clothes for work, or sleep a little before work--he has even been late with bills, because I think he provides her with money. 

And on top of that he has been hostile like always. I thought my stepping down to ""heal"", will allow my siblings to step up to be more responsible--because, you know, older siblings learn the ""important"" skills most of the time. But now I think it's bullshit, the way I see my Dad berating my brother for stupid things like he used to when I was younger. I've realised, it's not my siblings who need to ""step up"" but my DAD.  All the time he spends ""dating"" shows he has time to ""parent"".

I must admit too that my dad is good with children. I think he always preferred and loved us better when we were kids. He treats my ""half-siblings"" from his second girlfriend better--but, you know, kids are cute and need to be loved differently than teenagers ect. So I don't hold that against him.

Starting talking to a guy, mid 30s, happy, friendly, attentive (by text), very keen to meet up - or at least keen until it comes to making actual plans and sticking to them. 

We finally had a first date this Monday just gone, he picked me up, paid for lunch, we walked around a park for a while and then he dropped me home, expressed he had a great time and would love to see me again. But getting to that point was so hard! 

It was theee weeks of ‘maybe the weekend, maybe Monday night’, ‘maybe dinner, maybe breakfast’, two late cancellations on the day of a date, trying to get me to come over his house last minute (no) or late at night for a drink (no). 

He wanted to catch up Saturday, then swap to Sunday, then too tired for Sunday... patience waning so I let him sort it out. 

Even when we finally nailed the day (Monday), he couldn’t figure out what time or what do to, up to the point I’m in his car and he’s trying to work out where to go for lunch. 

The date itself was lovely, absolutely gentleman and so easy to talk to and get along with - I had an awesome time - but afterwards the flaky and low effort behaviour has continued unfortunately. 

Trying to get me to see him before he goes to work yesterday, to come down the coast one night where he’s staying for work next week but without saying what night or more information (also definitely a booty call scenario the way he worded it).

I’ve already reinforced several times that if he wants to see me I would really like to set plans in advance - I’m busy with work and general life and this would make me able to set my schedule easily. 

In response he’s now told me he won’t make plans in advance as he ‘needs his freedom’. I need my time valued enough to have plans set up ahead of time as I can’t drop everything - and more importantly I *like* to have things to look ahead to. I’ve expressed this firmly but pleasantly and gotten back a response of ‘ok’. And now I move on!",18852,He won’t set and stick to a plan!,0,1572107422.0,,,0

First, I'm certain that a solid 90% of all women are perfect relationship material, while very few men reach up to the same level.

That means that right out of the gate we outnumber high value men by a huge margin.

Replication is them celebrating the debauchery of humankind while creativity is trying to get closer to God (creating imaginative things.) Any contact with female is the road to babies guys. Even the cutesy way Peter MJ dalliance is portrayed. I cant provide all the know-how on the matter, what I can state here that someone else hasn't figured throughout the thousands of yrs of human knowledge.

Take my advice under consideration. Here is my life progression. Please forgive me for the rant.

I was the female equvilant of a purple piller. Thinking that life would reward being kind and being empathetic to others experiences, especially my choosen dude would pay off.

I counseled a friend away from MGTOW and redpilling after his divorce, but I'll participate here.

I am 29. I have had corporate careers. I have moved far from home, for work, to earn a good salary. I graduated with an engineering degree from a top ten engineering school. I started on a master's degree in electrical engineering at yet another high end school, which got fucked by my ex.

So real meat. My issues first, because I have no problems being transparent. Honesty is strength.

Background: My father was a physician in a small town. So we were upper middle class to wealthy for the area. My mom, who I could write a novel about, gave up on life, got fat as fuck, and gave up her career prospects to raise his three kids after intense in vitro. She was the primary parent. He cheated on her relentlessly their entire marriage, including taking his mistress on trips when he couldn't come to our events as children such as soccer games or band concerts, and when finally she confronted him about his affair and we, those she raised or actually supported her, told her get a lawyer and leave. She tried. She hired a private investigator to track the major affair, and my dad stole her files from the investigator and the lawyer. After he threatend to kill her, she used me as an excuse to stay with him and now, she won't leave. Traditional roles, traditional values, which is really financial dependency. She was ""stealing what he earned."" Despite her stepping in to manage his failures of investments for years and trying to basically be a handy man to keep his shitty ""empire"" afloat.

Seeing that dynamic: I have never wanted to be financially dependent on a dude or a bad partner. Both of which were things she did. Realistically, both of my parents failed. Also, I heard all my life how I should be stronger than basic people, from my dad, my mom, and others. So guess my self esteem was too high... I have been fairly tough, engineering school, lower salaries than dudes at my same level, doing my own activities, until fuck boy.

Communication breakdown was a problem in their marriage, but when my dad was out partying in Vegas on ""business trips,"" for years, I think my mom deserves a degree of happiness after dealing with kids for 20+ years. She won't ever cheat. He still has a girlfriend and tells me often how much he dislikes my mom, but won't divorce her. (Half is he'd have to pay, half is both of their ""well we both had broken homes"") So MGTOW, Redpill. Vote me down. Wanna hear about how many alcholics tried to kill my grandma? I made a choice to not compromise my values, for a long time, here is what happened when I did.

My end: I went into dating, cautiously, due to context above, and open mindedly, because every girl believes in some aspect of love. I wanted a partner. I worked on myself. I was biking and running constantly. I have a 401k. A good job -- then and now. An HSA. Paid off my loans. An established friend basis which I built since I left home. I didn't date seriously until I was established financially and emotionally. I solo hike and camp alone in national parks. I had (yup, gone because of him) a job in an F500. 

A cute guy who was seemingly stable and together messaged me, in all the trash of OLD.

Smart. Good job. Cool projects. Similar interests. Similar background. Grad school instuctor, at my grad school (fuck). Getting a clearance. VP dad at my former company (fuck).

Here is what my ex actually was. 

Sign up for red flags to ignore. 

At 29, he was dating a 16 year old who was hanging around. After 5 years of dating, she grew up and left him for his friend. I heard all about it. Why? Because instead of going to therapy, my ex uses women to deal with his emotions. Also, he has never taken a processing period to reflect on a relationship. Also only a 16 year old or my retarded ass, would put up with this shit. That's okay. Learn from my mistakes.

There has been more than one after me. Run away from this behavior. If they can't be alone, fuck them. Gave him the benefit of the doubt, after all, men in engineering are awkward. (LOL)

His house was a chronic disaster despite being in his 30s. Literally had no kitchen. Fine. I thought he didnt want kids and would be a good partner -- for sex and travel. He broke up with me saying that he wanted to ""work on his house"" and because ""he wanted kids."" Okay. Call me when your kid dies in your construction zone. It's been two years. Ladies, guess the state of that house. I had no dog in the fight. I wasn't about to sign-up to me mean mommy. Also, a 30 year old should be able to figure out that he needs to change his sheets weekly.

When he gave me an STD, I should have walked. But my friend said, ""at least he told you."" No, he should have managed his sexual health, like I do as an adult.

Shit got real when I asked to meet his friends, after six months of dating, when he had met most of my social crew, ""you have too many expectations.""

Come to find, he was banging married women on his lunch break while dating me. But its okay, ""he just doesn't like talking on the phone."" He had secret accounts for this.

I prioritized him. I put him first thinking that maybe listening and loving was what he needed. He certainly fucked me like he needed me initially, then once his needs were met, he was back to staring at my roomates and never texting me. Critisizing me for not orgasming relentlessly. ""I can't date someone who doesn't cum every time."" No amount of reassurances, fixed this ego problem, yet he couldn't have sex without his shirt on due to body confidence issues. Grow up. Late 20s/30s sex isn't always glamorous.

During the six months we were dating, I underwent a job change. I took on two high level grad school classes, and I continued to live with 3 roommates in a house undergoing renovations. Far from home, far from friends, far from any ""given"" support structure.  Yet he had friends and family, in this state that he was from, that he saw weekly. I never had a study space, despite him owning his own house -- libraries, conference rooms, etc. Everything he offered was out of reluclance and not love, but I always put him first. 

When his cat died, or he wanted to go on a date or he needed to get over his ex, where was I? Yup, offering love, time, understanding and affection. Classical female traits. Undervalued. At the expense of myself.

I drove down to see him constantly. He learned he didn't have to work for my attention. Fuck that.

Asking to meet his friends was apparently too much. Despite the stability and love I offerred, in my realm of instability, it was too much apparently.

Prioritizing him cost me: my grad school, my job, my fitness, my sanity and my car at the end of the day.  So guess what he lost, and guess how fast he had another chick in bed.

Two years of personal progression, out of years of depression in my 20s, were destroyed by someone who sent messages like ""wow it's really healthy that you don't text me all the time."" I was busy and wanted someone activity driven and happy on dates. 

Because his ex was ""too clingy."" Yeah, she was 16. Never, be the cool chick, because he was using me 100% of the time. And his ex was ""crazy."" How fun it was to watch him literally run away from me when I told him I knew he was banging a married girl.

When I stood up against him and told his ex to get STD tested, I was the bad guy, for telling her and damaging his manipulative factor. (He was seeing her behind my back after a certain point too). Honesty ruins fuck boys. Talking to her (because he deliberatively hid me from his social circle) was hilarious to watch. Apparently, I shouldn't tell another girl, hey our mutal ex gave me Chlamydia, and you should get tested. I'm stalking him for having independent conversations. When he couldn't control what I did, he followed me around our grad school to intimate me. Enjoy your ethics compliant. (Though I still haven't been comfortable going back).

Learn from my mistakes. 1.5 years later I am still recovering from a fuck boy who looked good on paper and started out sweet. He did the occasional present. He gave alright head. He earned equal money. This is the bare minimum that a 30 something fuck boy learns. 

But he fucked my life in ways that will take years to recover. Think that when he couldnt send a basic text to tell me his weekend plans with his friends, would he chill with his progeny.

Don't ignore flags. Don't forget your worth. Put yourself and your finances first. I fucked up when I went back and didn't stick out leaving like I should have when I realized it wasn't mutual. 6 months with an asshole ruined my life for years. Dick is abundant. Get your paper and personal development first.

Writing from my recovery zone. In my own rental. In a new awesome job. In a good city sadly not 15 states away.

Then i met this guy through a dating app. He talked a bit too much about himself is what I firstly noticed, then how he was quick to rush the intimacy and us kissing and doing all these gestures when we first met and talked a bit. He did say before meeting that he is not looking for anything serious in the new few years and I went with it thinking if it's meant to be it will be.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been going crazy over him for months. Gave him space, tried not to message him too much, he was always busy etc. Would take hours to respond to a message, then it got to days. He would usually message me cute good night messages or good morning ones, wishing me a good day and so on. Would occasionally call me like once a week while he was doing grocery shopping. I would call him to my place once every two weeks because he was the type to treat 'the people he sees' as he was 'their boyfriend' and I quickly got addicted to the feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

I would go through phases of tried not to care. Then when I finally felt free I would see a message or he would call me, like he could sense when I stopped thinking about him. Then I would go back to crushing on him and feeling so let down when he would take long to respond. He would be even less active on the days after we've seen each other.

Our meetings involved passionate stuff, also all of the things a couple would do, hand holding, kissing for a long time, spending the night, breakfast together, hand holding while walking outside.

I finally confessed after two months, he said he doesn't believe in relationships and I should not wait for him, and that he likes me and really cares about me. But I can see from everything he does that he doesn't care enough, not like me. I can see it in the way he looks at me, not lovingly, neutral. Or just the way he doesn't laugh sometimes when I joke. How he never said he misses me, or never called me on a date. I asked him once if he wanted to go take a walk and he said he was busy. I sent him two risky messages in the past two weeks and each time he hurried to see each other and talk about the issue.

The one time we went on a 'date' was to discuss my risky message that was mentioning how I want this vague thing to end..

I told him  my ex came back and regrets leaving me, and that I will give him a chance. But the one I want is him.

He has told me He think we have high compatibility for something more in a future, but he thinks he can still find someone better for him, so he still wants to date. Confirmed he is seeing other people.

It hurts I have to accept he doesn't really care because he never asks me about my day (only on rare occasions), or about myself, never calls just to say hi, likes talking about himself.

Now, I don't want to block him. I want to stay friends at least, because I felt like we had a connection and would be ok as friends once my infatuation fades out. But I will never be able to get over this if I don't stop seeing him (I don't want it to stop..) I know I am being foolish and he probably doesn't care. I haven't been that focused on my life recently because of constantly being sad, I feel it got toxic for me. I know I was stupid, still am, but I fell in love and I am patient and it backfired, now I just want to stop feeling like this for him so I can get on with my own life.

You should look at these men with scepticism. Sure, sometimes they might be telling the truth, but more often this isn't the case.

Genuine men won't attempt to hide their opinions. Honestly, it should be a massive red flag if a potential partner has never disagreed with you on anything political. It's normal for people, even of similar opinions, to disagree sometimes. Dating isn't an exception. I think men will automatically hide their opinions because they want to present themselves as perfect. Their opinions are the easiest thing to hide.

Sure, if their opinions include shit like ""women belong in the kitchen"", or anything else that would obviously make them incompatible, then you should stay the fuck away. But if you disagree on trans issues or something, for example, and you aren't getting in fights about it, then you know he's not scared to reveal details about himself that you might not like.

Take my one friend T., for example. She's amazing. She's been with this guy for two years, and he has never, not for one fucking day, taken her or their relationship seriously. She's early 30's, he's mid 40's. He has an extremely demanding career that takes him out of the country, but when he IS in town he's putting his family, his sports, his hobbies, literally ANYTHING ahead of her.

She is wasting her pretty years on someone who will never care, and she refuses to hear it. 

Ladies, STOP MAKING FUCKING EXCUSES FOR THESE MEN! Fucking LISTEN:

* It doesn't MATTER if he's been ""hurt before"", HE needs to take responsibility for his hurts and traumas, just like we do. WE don't go around blaming every man for our hurts/rapes/abuses/generational abuse. If he's not going to improve for himself, he won't do it for you. DON'T MAKE EXCUSES FOR HIS TRAUMAS. 
* If he's not putting your relationship as a priority, he doesn't want to be with you. Period. Full stop. Men work for what they don't want to lose, and if you make yourself incredibly available, he won't give a fuck how you feel because he knows he can breadcrumb you and keep you on the line. DON'T MAKE EXCUSES FOR HIS LACK OF EFFORT.
* If he cannot seem to get his shit together, he's lazy or stupid or both. I don't give a fuck what you think his potential is, or how great he could be if he applied himself. Potential without action is fucking nothing. If he wastes his money on video games and weed, lives with his parents, or does hood rat shit with his friends instead of securing a good future for himself, FUCKING DROP HIM. HE IS NOT AN ADULT WORTH PURSUING.
* If he doesn't maintain regular communication with you, fucking drop him. Don't wait around for him to be communicative because if he liked you, he wouldn't be able to get enough of you. Don't try and convince him to be more attentive, don't tell him you ""need more"". He knows, he just doesn't fucking care. 
* Stop condescending these fucking hoe men and acting as if they just need a little of your TLC to become better. No, they need to work harder. They need to stop being fucking babies and take responsibility for their lives. You are not his mommy, you are not his therapist. Don't take on his emotional labor just because you think he's a poor widdle ickle sweetie boy. Fucking drop him. Find a man who is working on himself.

continuation from this post

i decided that when he did one more weird and uncomfortable thing i was dropping him and your comments on this post helped me so much.

he walked me home from work last night and he wanted to go to a certain fast food chain with two golden arches and i said nah i just want to head home bc i have work tomorrow. he ditched me at the tram stop at 10pm to go to maccas then came back sulking five minutes later when i didn’t follow him immediately. i asked him what was wrong and he completely ignored me. he then proceeded to take me home- by walking about three metres behind me at all times and not talking to him.

i got off the tram and told him to just go home bc what kind of grown ass man acts like that. my four year old brother does that. not a 21 year old.

he followed me home and tried to make me listen . he said he was ‘just thinking’ and HE wasn’t upset at me. yeah alright good, you don’t get to be upset at me for not going with you to get food at 10pm?

i went home, dropped his phone charger on the porch and told him to leave me alone. he didn’t leave so my housemate told him he had to go.

cried a bit, had a bath, cuddled my housemate’s dog and my parrot then played some video games. i’m feeling so much better today and like i’m free.

i’m done with his weird ass crap and acting like a therapist for his issues that i told him to seek counselling for and i’m excited to focus on the things i enjoy and training my new parrot. 

thank you to this sub for helping me realise he was crazy and i don’t need this kind of thing. my close friends and my mother kind of suggested going back but i know they didn’t see what i saw of his crap and i’m just going to scroll through these top posts whenever i think about going back.

My first job was working at a fitness chain. The regional manager would come to our location on a semi-regular basis to check in on things and making sure we were meeting franchise standards and all that. 

We were cordial at work but not close. He would always smile at me and chat a little when he came in. We weren’t allowed food or drinks outside the break room but sometimes he’d sneak me candy during my shift. I was far too young for him at the time but always had the biggest crush. 

He had been dating the same girl since junior year of college and the way he spoke of her always made my heart melt. He seemed stupidly in love with her and was so excited when they got engaged. 

Eventually, I moved away for college. They got married and moved to another country. The crush faded and I moved on but I still thought of him from time to time. 

Once I graduated, I moved across the country and started my career. Fast forward another few years, one of my girlfriends from back home recently came to visit me and loved the area so much she decided to apply for some jobs. She was really bummed out about not getting a position at this particular company. I pulled up the company website and who would happen to be a department VP? The freaking (former) regional manager. Their office is about 45 minutes from where I live now. 

Naturally, I get curious and look him up for the first time in years. He and his wife got divorced recently (no idea on the specifics.) 

He’s not on OLD, unfortunately. Or if he is, I’m outside his age/distance range. 

I obviously can’t just add him on FB/Insta or something now because ew. I’m honestly not sure he’d even remember me.

I just want to write a trick that several men use, obviously I fell for it, because I generally trust others. 
 
the trick is this: tell a story that makes you look like a nice person.
 for example, he told me that he helped a friend to overcome a difficult moment, or that he had taught her kick boxing. 
a
Another time he told me that he had gone miles on miles to go and take a male friend friend with the car broken down.

 I obviously thought: what a good boy !! a heart of gold. then I discovered that they were all bullshit, this guy was the most selfish person of planet earth.

I then discovered by reading TRP that the technique has a name that is ""Dimostrate high value, protector of love ones"".
Basically tell a story in which you are generous and good to your friends or family or people in general (or tell a story in which yoo look brave, or rich or adventourus ecc)
And
I think it's a really smart tactic and that most women are naive enough to fall for it.
And
I also think we should make a list of all the tactics used by abusive men or pua and how to defend from it (exactly like TRP have in their sidebar!!! )

to defend oneself from this tactic it is enough to remember that words or promises do not count for anything and a man must prove what he says with facts and sometimes even the facts lie, one can also pretend a gesture of generosity or kindness, so a single gesture means nothing , but many small repeated gestures every day are significant.",32619,Tricks That Men Use to Seduce,0,1573135418.0,,,1

• he borrowed his friends car to drive to my city (he lives about 40 mins away)

The actual issue: it’s guy hawks days and people are setting off fireworks still. He decided to set some off in the parking of our residential homr lot. The thing is I HAD A FEELING! I didn’t want to do that. I refused. He begged so much for this sentimental grand gesture that I gave in and said I’ll sit there. He puts the little rocket firework in the ground.

My spidey sense amplified as he fixed it in. I COULD FEEL EVERYTHING IM ME SCREAM TO GET AWAY. I was about 2 metres away so I shuffled back more. He lights it.

You know what happened? The rocked firework started SPINNING in the ground, took off STRAIN TO MY FACE. I ducked (terrified) at lightning speed and just as the firework went over me, it exploded. I was petrified.

We ""fell in love"" (never trust a man that says he loves you in the first 3 months) and he moved up to live near me, leaving his job, his dog with his ex, his apartment, and almost all of his stuff to live with a friend. Of course that living situation didn't work out so he ended up living with me within a month. 

I worked 50+ hours a week, he worked on part-time trucking contracts. I cooked breakfast, lunch and dinner even though he stayed home for 2-3 weeks on his ""off time"" playing video games and watching TV. I would come home and clean up after him, doing all of the laundry, cleaning, maintenance. I paid all the bills and he used my car. We had sex 2+ times a day and I enthusiastically supported his disgusting and degrading fetishes. When he was on his trucking contracts, I would get his hotel information and send him pizzas, little Amazon packages to cheer him up, supported him emotionally, sexually, physically, and financially. I had never been ""in love"" before and I was determined to do anything to keep it. I didn't want kids but I was willing to have them for him.

Aaaand I found out he was on Tinder when he was trucking, fucking 20 and 21 year olds. He also had a bunch of excuses to go back to his home state (sick grandpa, sick mom) at which point I found out he was maintaining his relationship with his high school sweetheart, who he is still with to this day. So basically he was cheating **with** me, he was cheating **on** me, he was in ""long term relationships"" with multiple women because he, and I can say this earnestly, has no soul and no concept of how his actions affect anyone else.

One day I was cooking in the kitchen. We had the exact same iPhone with the exact same case (guess who paid for both!) that were charging on the counter (which was unusual because he was extremely secretive about his phone) and I went to check a recipe and I accidentally highlighted his screen instead. Jessica. Jessica. Jessica. Jessica. Jessica. Text after text after text from the same woman. 

I confronted him, he said it was a coworker. I said ""show me the texts"" and he said no. I said ""show me the texts or we're done"" and he said no. I found her on facebook (his facebook was always extremely limited -- another ongoing issue we always had) and asked her why she was texting my boyfriend. She said she was texting ***her*** boyfriend, and that he was away on work. They had met a few months previously, and he had been lying to her about building a future, that he was away on work and visiting his sick grandfather and his sick mother, but that he was living with her in Minneapolis. 

The heartbreaking part was that he was never actually going back. He was using her for money, emotional support, sexual gratification, sick mind games -- he was just using this poor girl. He preyed on weak, amenable, young girls who wanted to be loved so bad they would overlook his many (many, many) flaws. Like the quote says, ""when you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags"". I made hundreds of excuses for him because I wanted to believe that I was worthy of love, and so did she (Jessica and I actually became friends after and she's doing really well now). 

After I kicked him out the day I found out about Jessica, I started to arm myself: with therapy, supportive friends, resources, knowledge. He, of course, wanted to work through it. He would go to therapy. He would go to couple's counseling. He would prove himself. He would change, and be better, and do better. I told him he had to figure out *why* he cheated. I had never been cheated on before then, and literally didn't understand the headspace of someone that would cheat. Why even be in a relationship? And in my mind, more importantly, **what did I do wrong?** How was I not good enough? I paid for everything, had sex with him constantly, made him my #1 priority in everything. **What could I have done better?**

I started reading countless books on infidelity, watched every YouTube video I could get my hands on, devoured podcasts and articles about the topic. What makes people cheat? The most conclusive answer I came up with is that infidelity is **never** the fault of the victim. You couldn't have been hotter, more accommodating, more pliable. Some people just hate themselves and that manifests is seeking constant approval, or they don't care about how their actions affect anyone else out of a deep rooted sense of entitlement. He never regretted his actions, he regretted his consequences.

The whole situation really damaged me in a lot of ways, but the person that I became (through my own strength, my resilience and my supportive friends) was stronger, more aware, more weary but also more trusting of my intuition. It made me realize that men don't care what you do for them. RPW think they can be the perfect housewife and they'll be rewarded the perfect man, but men don't value things they don't earn. If you're doing everything for him, cooking for him from jump, sexually available and accommodating too fast, he will not appreciate you or value you. In his mind, he **deserves** you to take care of him, because you don't value yourself and he doesn't value you either.

If I had taken my relationship with him slower, actually trusted my intuition, seen the red flags for what they were, and more importantly, **prioritized myself**, I never would have been so damaged. Honestly it probably would not have gone as far as it had because I would not have been an easy target for a manipulative liar. 

I beg the women of FDS, RPW, and women in general: **ALWAYS PUT YOURSELF FIRST.** You are the only person you will always have to rely on. If you are putting anyone (except your kids) ahead of yourself, you're investing in a future you can't control. You are worth being your #1 priority. See the red flags for what they are; don't be charmed by a man who promises the world without backing it up with actions. Protect yourself emotionally, physically, mentally. 

**A few random things I learned from this toxic relationship:**

* Don't trust someone who is extremely protective of their phone. I'm not saying you should go through it, but if he angles the screen away from you, always takes it with him (even to the bathroom), or won't even let you watch a video or something with him on his phone, he's hiding something.
* Same with social media. If he's extremely low key about his social media presence, never acknowledges your relationship, denies tags of you two together -- red fucking flag.
* If he lets you pay for his share of bills and expenses, he doesn't care if you respect him more than he values you monetarily. 
* Never, ever, ever send nudes. I've said this a hundred times in the sub but after I ended things, he (not subtly) threatened to send my many nudes that I had sent him to my friends and family as penance for my actions. 
* NEVER EVER EVER loan someone money. Don't pay emergency bills, don't even pay for things that are seemingly ""for your relationship"" (plane tickets, etc). You will NEVER see that money because a man who is such a bum to let you pay will never have the money to settle his debts.
* Teasing and joking in relationships is fine, but watch for the fine line between teasing and negging. If he pokes at your weaknesses and knows that it hurts you but does it anyway, he's manipulating you and keeping you emotionally off-balance. 
* Lastly, keep your head on a swivel. Be ruthless about identifying and addressing red flags early on. Trust your intuition, have supportive friends to act as sounding boards, and never just ""hope for the best"" when it comes to dealbreakers. All of my friends warned me about him, and in hindsight I thought they didn't understand, but looking back I realize now that they loved me more than he ever did.

I’ve been living with my boyfriend for almost two years now. Until I lived with him, he brushed his teeth 6-8 times monthly and applied deodorant once a week. He showers daily and it has been rare that that I’ve smelled anything bad, even prior to living with him. But because I do the laundry, I have noticed that almost all of his shirts smell of sweat, and I cannot get the smell out. I like to buy him clothes and it bothers me that the armpits of a brand new shirt smell awful after a few wears. My mother was anal about dental hygiene so I kind of grew up the same way, and when I do smell bad breath it also bothers me a lot - maybe more than it should.

I have expressed that personal hygiene is very important to me and that these behaviors bother me. It has gotten a lot better, and he generally brushes his teeth at least once daily now. He refuses to put on deodorant daily because “it irritates his skin if he wears it every day.” However, he never gets a rash or any visible irritation/redness. He claims his skin just hurts. He has tried several deodorants (Old Spice, Tom’s, Mitchum, mineral salt) and the only one he will wear daily is the mineral salt, but it doesn’t prevent the problem. He sweats through it. He has also started to get upset when I ask him if he has brushed his teeth or put on deodorant, saying that I’m nagging him.

Any guys with the same invisible “skin problem” and any good deodorant suggestions?

How can I better express the importance of hygiene, or how can I better accept that he isn’t going to do these things?

Is this normal for guys?

TLDR: boyfriend says wearing deodorant daily irritates his skin although he has no visible rash or redness. He brushes his teeth more often now that I live with him but has started saying that I’m nagging him too much. I’ve tried to express that hygiene is very important to me, how can I do this in a better way, or how can I better accept that he just isn’t going to? Is this normal for guys? Also, deodorant suggestions would be great.

But what about when you can just see it? Or sense it?

The eyes give it away. I don't know about you all, but I can always see it in their goddamn eyes. 

I look in his eyes and I can nearly smell how foul he is inside. 

But he didn't say anything rude, he wasn't overtly mean. So, we're shallow if we judge based on what we see. If we are repelled, we're the badguy. We're supposed to be cheery, chatty, friendly, open minded, always smiling (I'm reminded of this one by men all the time).

Time and time again I have fallen into abusive relationships; friendly and romantic. My gut screams to me that they are bad news, but the voice society has reinforced into my brain says ""Aw, give the guy a chance. You don't even know him yet! He's a great guy deep down, but you gals won't even give him the time of day! Just be nice! Just chat with him! What's the harm in that? You just don't understand him.""

But these men use their words as a mask. Once he gets your attention, he'll try to cover what you could already see to begin with. He'll say anything to get what he wants--until his mask finally fades.

He's sweet, he's caring, and he's kind--until he's suddenly not. He loves you, he misses you, he just wants the best for you--until suddenly he doesn't. 

And then he hurts you. He hurts you with every weapon he's got. He lashes you with his hateful words. He stuns you with gaslighting. He screams the profanities you hate the most, he calls you a liar. He shatters your favorite coffee mug on the floor, he punches a hole in the wall just inches from your head. He grabs your wrists, pushes you down, and leaves you bruised and crying. He hurts you any way he can. All the while, he is the victim, of course. And he'll make sure you know that. 

How dare you guilt him with those tears? That's manipulative, you know. Those bruises are not his fault, you women are just too delicate! Calling you a b*tch? Well, you just simply deserved it. 

So, ladies, if I've learned anything in my adult life it is this. Listen to your gut. Judge that book by its cover. Judge it in any way you see fit. If you sense something is amiss, it might just be.

I wanted to outline a case study of my 6 month relationship with a millionaire, and how I screwed it up by being too much of a pickme. This ended up with me getting plated and my feelings and pride hurt. This was way before I ever found FDS, of course.

How things began:

I met Subject B on an online dating site (not an app) and did a few things right in the beginning. I wasn't terribly quick to respond, and I apparently came across as mysterious and aloof to him. Later, he admitted that he was intrigued by me and actually felt intimidated by my ""glamorous lifestyle"" (his words). I didn't know he was rich until our third date when he picked me up in a Porsche. I actually thought he was sorta nerdy and weird, which is why I was so aloof and distant in the beginning--and guess what? It drove him WILD.  He went far out of his way to impress me. By date three he was trying to get me to come over and cook me dinner--and I agreed. He clearly thought sex was going to happen, but I made out with him for a bit, then told him I needed to get home. The real reason I was being so weird? I was convinced he was going to be a terrible lay, so I delayed sex for two months. During these two months, he bought me gifts, took me to expensive restaurants, and lavished me with attention. I didn't seem bowled over or impressed by these overtures, which I think also made him go crazy. 

Where things went awry:

After I slept with him, I found out something I didn't expect--the dude was insanely good in the sack. And, I'll admit, he brought out a little bit of a sex kitten in me. I wanted to see him more. I started to ask *HIM* to get together before he asked me. I wanted to make sure I had him as often as I could. Then, I did something even dumber--we were having dinner, and he informed me that he'd disabled his dating profile. And I stupidly did the same thing without a commitment. I naively *assumed* that meant he was serious about me!! He even said he wanted to join me on my trip to Italy that I had planned in a few months!

I now think it was just a cheap manipulation to get me off the dating site, too. 

**Mistake #1** \- Got too sexual

**Mistake #2** \- Started asking him on dates

**Mistake #3** \- Disabled my dating profile and took myself off the market without an actual commitment

Things continued to devolve...

For the next few months, I continued to be the one proactively setting up dates with him. This was partly because of the sex, and also partly because at this juncture my anxiety had mounted. If I made plans with him, I didn't have to hand-wring about his interest, or so I thought. Surely, if he was accepting plans, that meant he was into me. Now, I realize that my anxiety was because I had put all my eggs in one basket without a commitment. Even worse, I started to nag him on whether he'd decided to join me in Italy.  He now was evading answering me or cagey about committing to it. 

**Mistake #4 -** Started nagging/seeming needy

The guy never came to Italy with me, obviously. You can sense where this is going. Things ferried along for a few more months, but then when I came back from Italy, I had a little bit of an emotional meltdown and warily asked him where it was going, expecting the worst.

His answer, ""*I just want to see where this goes...*""

You all can know where it goes. It continued to devolve until we just saw each other a few times a month. At the end, I realized....

Notice how moids hate promiscuous women and want a woman who had a low number of partners or never had one at all? These women are the most picky and ""hypergamous"". They WANT this type of woman, they are only pissed off that they can’t attract one and so they lash out and claim that this behavior is unfair.

The reason why degenerate and unattractive males have subs like mgtow is because they secretly hope that women see their comments and change (LMAO). You see these pests spread their virus on every youtube video targeted towards women. If you are going your own way and are sooo happy then why do you invade female spaces? I thought you wanted nothing to do with women anymore? It’s not our fault if you’re of low value and lazy. These pests just want easy and free sex from women who are way more attractive than them.

They don’t like their fellow moids neither. Notice how they have a chad/virgin or alpha/beta ranking and group women together? It’s because men actually don’t get along and have to fight over status. The same thing can be observed in the animal kingdom. If a beta woke up as an alpha tomorrow he wouldn’t give a fuck about the betas anymore and their suffering. He‘ll probably enjoy it.

Or a woman will advise other women to focus on their education and career and you'll get at least one (often a man!) using the ""money can't buy you happiness"" argument and ""you'll regret this when you're old and alone.""

Generally the dilemma first occurs when a woman is 20 and tells herself ""I can't accept \[insert fantastic opportunity here\] because I'll never find another pefect boyfriend like the one I have now!"" Note: if he's that perfect he'll have no problem waiting for you to complete whatever you need to do to increase your earning potential but deep down you already know he isn't and he won't. 

Another typical situation: you meet someone who lives in a different town or a different country than yours which offers almost no decent occupational opportunities for you. But you move for him anyway and a year later you post on Reddit that you're now stuck and wanna die.

This is a scarcity mentality that mainly prays on the young. Your mother wasn't joking when she said that ""men are like busses, one every minute."" If there was only one person for us, none of us would ever remarry or even be able to fall in love with different people. 

When you limit your earning capacity for a man that might feel good at first but I can practically guarantee you'll have to pay all that ""feel good"" back eventually...with dividends. Having to ask a man for money gets old really, really fast, because even generous men can develop a tendency to question, comment and controll your every expense, especially after you've had children. Financial differences is [the biggest divorce reason](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/money-marriage-end-divorce-day-relationships-personal-finances-slater-gordon-a8147921.html) worldwide. So while money doesn't necessarily equal happiness, not having money will definitely make you unhappy eventually. 

Don't listen to the disney minded. They often don't have money either and are just trying to feel better about that. Focus on solidifying your earning abilities before you get serious about someone. It doesn't matter if you have a trade or a degree, as long as they are useful. I know skillfull hairdressers who live like queens and women with useless college degrees that live in moldy appartments. Men are socialized to know this from day number one, that's why you'll almost never see one of them ask if they should limit their earning options for love.",33451,"Analyzing the ""money can't buy you happiness"" trope",0,,,,1

We have called eachother soulmates and normally our relationship is pretty great. I have had trust issues in the past. 1 reason is because my ex was a literal pathological liar and chronic cheater. I had no idea until about 1 .5 years into the relationship. Another reason is because my partner has said in the past he might be  poly minded. I brought up the original conversation. After many lengthy discussions he has said he does not want to be poly with me and he is happy being monogamous with me. But he does have an intetest in reading about it and he might want to be poly if i wanted to be. I tryst hik but this makes me nervous.

He has a much higher sex drive then me. He would want sex once or twice a day where i am happy with twice a week. I know he watches porn and he has talked to me about how he uses it. I have been ok with him using porn to fill in the gaps because he does not look  at cam girls andseems to have good boundaries with right and wrong. However, i have found out he has looked at porn when i was in the same room as him and even when we had sex 3 times in one day. He said sex makes him feel more horny so that is why he looked. This makes me sad that he feels the need to do this so i know it has effected my ability to be intimate with him. 

Anyways, we were watching a show about japanese culture and there was a beaitiful japanese girl on the show. He said he would love to go to Japan. I insecurily thought to myself he probably wants to go there to see all the pretty girls...then i told myself i was paranoid and obviously didnt say anything. Later that night he went to bed early for work and i wanted to find something on his phone. We have free rain over eachothers phones and he has no problem with me looking. Anyways i find that on reddit he has looked up all these naked Asian/Japanes real girls and porn. I was shocked he would specifically look up a different race then me to jerk off to. He said porn was impersonal to him but i felt like that is making it personal. Do i have to worry about him sexualizing everything? It made me feel like shit and i got super depressed. When i tried to talk to him about it the next day i was very upset and he could care less. He said he didn't even like what he saw and it was just on a list of Japanese things on reddit. He said he didnt think he did anything wrong so he didnt care i was upset. When i was crying he told me ""enjoy your melt down"". When i told him i couldnt eat that day because i was so upset he said ""well u cant eat after your mom says hi to you so i dont care"" this is completely untrue. He was just basically throwing in my face a huge issue i have been having with my mom (that he has been having too). I was more upset that he treated me so shit and that is where i am now. I need advice and i didnt want to post anywhere else because i knew guys would blame me for being uncomfortable with porn at all.

I also want to add that I have MS. It has been hard on both of us but he  has been nothing but supportive about it. He us normally a great guy so i just feel lost on this issue.",33441,"Fiance said, ""enjoy your meltdown"" while I was crying",0,,,,1

In every patriarchal culture, men are taught to see women as objects. When a man considers a relationship with a women, he asks himself, ""What can she do for me? What roles do I need her to fulfill?"" What combination of the mother, maid, wh*re, therapist, etc., are they looking for? With a lot of men, especially young men, they're looking for sex... they want a reliable source of sex on demand but most don't have the money to pay prostituted women for it. Why would they bother paying a few hundred dollars for an hour when they can go on Tindr and trawl for coffee or car dates where the woman pays for her share (and maybe even his!) and he might get a one night stand out of it, or even better, a low self esteem woman who puts up with his bullshit while having regular sex with him. Maximum return for minimum effort is the typical man's modus operandi, remember that. They are not interested in egalitarian relationships; they want to find women who will be satisfied with crumbs while they feast on everything a woman has to offer. 

Women, on the other hand, are encouraged not only love men, but believe their love will be a transformative force in the man they love. A love so powerful it will motivate men to become their best selves. I believe this is deeply tied to the nature of child-rearing, wherein you expend 18+ years trying to develop a child's potential with the hope that they will become successful, well-adjusted, fully functioning adults. But men are already adults, and women are so focused on the perceived potential of men that they ignore the reality in front of them. When confronted with the lack of their man's progress or growth (or commitment or care or whatever), they internalize that as a personal failure. They think ""Surely, if I love and care for him more, it will change everything"". And women break themselves for the sake of their men doing this.

When you pair a man who objectifies, who desires maximum reward with minimal effort, with a woman who feels it is her duty to nurture and love to help others fulfill their potential, you create a dynamic that where the woman burns herself out for a man who is more than happy to receive the benefits of her labor without returning it. He doesn't care what it costs her, he only cares about what the bottom line is: how little can he provide before she leaves him, or how much effort is he willing to tolerate giving before he grows tired of it and leaves? 

This dynamic is why it's so important for women to take men at face value and realize that your love cannot make someone into a better person. You are not responsible for making a man into his best self. If men were interested in becoming their best selves they'd be doing that work long before they meet you, and your love would have nothing to do with it",33436,Men are taught to use women; women are taught to love and care for men,0,,,,1

We went through community college together, pushing one another towards our goals and eventually transferring to the same college where we dated for another year before breaking up at 23.

It’s been three years since we broke up, we’re 26 now. He’s dated, but hasn’t had anyone that he would call a “girlfriend” since our time together. I’ve had two significant boyfriends over the past three years. We’ve both since graduated, moved home and I’m single again after two years. We never fully lost contact, but he’s been pursuing me for months since and has made it clear he wants to be my boyfriend again. We’ve been going on dates here and there, he’s my go-to plus-one for couples events. He always picks me up when we go anywhere, pays most of the time (is in fact worried about being a leech on me), listens to me when I need to vent, we text everyday, my mom loves him. We kiss when we see one another, but nothing more. I haven’t pushed the commitment “talk” because quite frankly, I’m still a bit hesitant.

30 yr old Female and he’s a 32 yr old male. We been hanging out for 4 months. Went on 3 dates and since then every time he picks me up he takes me straight to his house without asking me if I would like to do anything else . At this point he just assumes we going to his place . I am annoyed ! I am on the verge of exploding . We watch tv every weekend for about an hour then we lay down and u know what’s next. He gets easily offended so I’m trynna find a good way to tell him that I’m tired of couch dates every weeknd . One day I snooped and saw movie tickets that he went to the movies with someone ! I was allowing couch dates because I thought maybe financially he wasn’t in a good place but he’s taking other females on dates is beyond disrespectful. I can’t bring this up because he’ll know I was searching through his stuff . We are not exclusive yet but at the same time I should be worth dates esp if he’s spending money on other females . Why not me ? Also he’s always saying he wants to take it to the next step with me . And in my brain I’m like huh ?? I like him but this worries me . Any ideas will be appreciated at this point .

# My (23M) roommate crush (21F) betrayed me

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short I developed a crush on my roommate and I thought she felt the same given our very apparent chemistry, but when I confessed my feelings to her she rejected me and when I asked why she said:

* ""She was surprised""
* ""She acknowledged the chemistry we have""
* ""She thought of dating me for 2 weeks since we moved in, but apparently she logically did not want to date a roommate""
* ""She said she is going through stuff at the moment which would not make her a good companion""
* ""She asked how much space I need""

This happened on Wednesday, and fast forward to Friday I could hear her inviting some other guy in to her room and sleeping with him. I feel she betrayed me because she lied to me about not being in good position for a relationship and then jumping on a guy just 2 days later.

I am mentally broken and hearing them made me cry for the first time in 10 years, I didn't sleep tonight at all, just looking at her makes me vomit, I feel worthless.

What do I do? My current plan is to move out and forget she existed.

PS: I know she doesn't owe me anything and neither do I, but I feel living with her would put me in an emotional prison of self loathing, constantly thinking what I did wrong and what I could do to fix it.

# Not sure what to do

&amp;#x200B;

My ex fiance (28f) and I (28m) have a child together We broke up about 4 months ago (my choice), kept trying to turn it around for another 2 months (continuous failures on my part) and are now in limbo. At the 2 month mark she decided she needed space, I was fighting with her alot and we put about 60 miles between us when I left. Shes told me she still wants to make this work but has essentially cut me out of her life at the same time saying she needs time and space. We still communicate for our son and if I ask about us she will usually give me one word answers, granted they are positive. Sometimes the response takes about 8 hours or is one word and not very convincing .I asked her out for dinner recently after we hung out to take our son trick or treating and she agreed but then wanted to push it back a week or two because it was too soon which was fine. We had a face to face recently and I asked her if she wanted me to wait for her and she said yes, later i thought about it and texted her asking if this was a mutual thing and she said yes... am I just being insecure? Shes a very extremely loyal girlfriend but shes not my girlfriend anymore either... should I trust the process here? I know I have anxiety issues. Part of me thinks this is a test of my commitment because I've had issues with telling her I wanted to leave when things were uncomfortable in the past. Weve been on and off for about 14 years.

I just need some advice on what to do

I am no longer willing to protect the reputation of someone who doesn't deserve it. I should have left a year ago when he flung a box of mac and cheese at the wall a foot away from my head hard enough to make it explode dried noodles everywhere. It was the first time I was scared by him. Instead of protecting myself and leaving, I apologized for ""making"" him do it. I looked past all the times he called me stupid and punched walls and flung things during his tantrums. When I was scared I'd put my head down and apologize never once raising my voice back. One night he drunkenly screamed at me for doing dishes wrong, broke a glass, and continued screaming at me until I cried. Then while staring me in the eyes took out his penis and pissed all over the half clean dishes in the sink. The sink I used on a regular basis. That we made our food in. I was horrified. Disgusted. Terrified. I should have left. Instead I kept my mouth shut about this bizarre dog-like intimidation tactic because he was ""sorry"". Another day a girl kissed his face in front of me and it offended me. He ditched me at the bar and got about a block away, leaving me alone, in a bad neighborhood, in the middle of the night. When I caught up he screamed at me in the street. Called me a ""stupid untrusting bitch"" for thinking this girl was anything but ""just a friend"" to him. BUT made sure that I should be ashamed for embarrassing him in front of her. They're dating now. But that didn't stop him from screaming at me about exactly this again and again and getting me to apologize about 10 more times for ""misinterpreting"" the situation.I kept his name calling and screaming fits at me a secret to protect him. I'd call myself stupid, but he's done that enough for both of us :) . I was naive. He is nearly a decade older than me and he took advantage of my trusting and forgiving nature only to abuse and destroy those gifts. I'm not stupid and I'm not sorry.


Honestly on cloud 9. I thought he won everything and took my dignity with him. Made the post above public. Old girlfriend who I lost contact with from my old/his current job contacted me to meet and talk after posting. She says everyone believes me from the job and is on my side and that he's been having issues melting down and being horrible to female hosts and other servers at their work.

Turns out the new girl is 23 and a severe alchoholic, just like me 3 years ago! We started dating when I was 22 and he was 31 and we both had a nasty drinking problem. Guess at 26 I'm simply too old and decrepit and sober for him so he needed a new model.  Scared for her... but  eh. I won.

So this isn't really a dating question but I'm not sure where else to ask this. I am a single, straight 23 y/o female. I have a straight male friend, let's called him A, who I met when I was dating someone else. We became good friends over the course of my relationship and remained friends even after I broke up with my boyfriend.  A has mentioned a few times that he finds me attractive, even back when I was dating my ex. After my breakup, A and I tried casually dating but it didn't really work. He got way too intense about us, when we had both agreed beforehand to keep it casual with no strings attached. I cut off contact with him for a few months but we eventually reestablished our friendship. A told me that he was still attracted to me. I made it clear that I wasn't interested in dating him. He said that he understood but still wanted to remain friend because he values our friendship. 

So fast forward a couple of months, A and I are still friends. I've mentioned casually dating guys, having crushes, getting phone numbers nothing serious. He told me he's legitimately happy for me and that I've mostly been placed in the friendzone. I told him about a recent date I'd been on where we had sex because I wanted A's opinion on some signals I was getting from the guy. Apparently that crossed a line; A said that he felt used and didn't appreciate that I was asking for advice while sleeping with a guy. He said he needed space and I apologized and told him I'd give just that.

So, I understand that I was very insensitive in this situation, I shouldn't have mentioned that I was getting serious with a guy considering my past history with A. It was naive of me to not realize that would hurt him. I value A's friendship a lot, he's probably one of my best friends. This is the 3rd time we've had to cease contact because of something that's happened between us. I'm starting to think that's it's not possible for the two of us to remain just friends. 

Does anyone have any similar experiences? Is it even possible for us to remain friends like this? I don't know if I should try to repair the friendship or if I should just cut A off to save us both from hurting each other anymore. Any advice would be appreciated!",33355,Is it possible to maintain a friendship with a man who's stated that he's attracted to you?,0,,,,1

Now as FDS women, we can watch dozens of love advice videos daily, but I find that if I don't actually write them down and review them every once in a while as a reminder, I gradually forget the important lessons being taught and I have to start over from scratch. So, I've decided that I'm going to take on the moniker of* ***FDS\_Transcriber*** *and share with you the notes that I've made along the way.*

**1. You are in your masculine energy.**

It’s the leading, organizing, and planning energy that you use to get ahead in your life. It’s a great energy to have because it empowers you and lets you get shit done, but it’s not your best friend when it comes to your love life. If you want to attract a masculine man who brings you flowers, sends you texts, adores you and treats you like a queen, then you have to create that feminine energy where you lean back in your relationship with him.

Romance and love is all about the polarity of energies (masculine + masculine won’t work), which means that if you want this masculine man to step up for you, you have to lean back and be in your feminine. Stop being the woman in the driver’s seat, asking, “When are we meeting? When is the next time I’m seeing you? When are you calling next? How come you haven’t called? What’s your #? How can I reach out to you?” They might seem harmless to you because you’re used to getting things done really fast, but in matters of the heart, patience really helps — leaning back in your feminine energy and allowing the man to step up and be the man in the relationship, the leader, planner, and be the one who’s moving things forward with you. Letting him be this way allows him to connect much more deeply with you than if you are in your masculine energy. You have to really check out if you’re in your masculine energy with this man by accident or mistake, and you really want to start embodying feminine energy practices in your relationship with him.

**2. You are disconnected from your own heart, so you’re not able to connect with him as deeply.**

It’s something that stems from your childhood where you didn’t make much of your emotions back then. You’re always told as a child, “Get on with your feelings. Stop feeling so much. Emotional displays are for the weak and you should get your act together and move on.” These beliefs certainly made you a tough cookie and you can get things done, but they prevent you from being vulnerable, from feeling your feelings and from expressing them in front of a man. They also prevent you from letting a man see our imperfections, weaknesses (just another facet of who we are). But in this tough cookie culture that we women have to grow up in, we’re so ashamed of our feelings, a lot of us are constantly in this masculine space of trying to put the best image forward, to be the perfect girl, to always be put together, to never share your feelings — these are things we learn from our childhood. Maybe when you didn’t like something as a child, your mother asked you to be polite, or if you didn’t like being around someone and your parents told you that you have to be nice. Even though you didn’t feel good about it, you still did it. You suppress your emotions and disconnect with your feelings and therefore you’re not able to connect with the man you want to inspire more to connect with you.

So the only way to connect more with this man is to go deeper in your heart. If you’re at dinner and you don’t like the food, it’s okay to say that the food doesn’t taste that great. It doesn’t mean that you’re complaining or high maintenance. It simply means you’re honest and authentic. Of course, this means allowing yourself to express positive emotions as well. But what we’re talking about here is getting rid of the mask (where everything is perfect and great, I’m always together 100%), this is what disconnects a man. It doesn’t bring him closer. See if you’re not connecting with your feelings to figure out if it’s what’s not facilitating your connection with him.

**3. He is emotionally not available for the commitment you desire.**

If you’re ready for the full commitment, it’s possible that the man you’re seeing right now and can sense your desire for it, and he simply is not at that point in his life. He wants freedom, to explore his options, to have his fun. Basically, he’s not ready to give you the close, connected, frequent contact, frequent dates that you desire and deserve. This is bad news because when a man is emotionally unavailable, it’s best to not go further with this man because he’s just not in that space to give you what you desire.

**Conclusion:**

The good news is that the first two things, you can work on! You can work on increasing your feminine energy which is one of the most classic powerful ways you can pull in a man by creating that polarity and sexual polarity of energy, where if you lean back, he will step up and move forward the relationship if he’s the right man for you. And the second one is having a deeper connection with your own vulnerability and your imperfections, and being comfortable expressing that in the presence of the man. It’s understanding that it’s actually your vulnerability and imperfections foster connection vs pushing him away, which is the belief that most of us has.",33348,3 Reasons Why A Man Isn’t Stepping Up To Claim Your Heart,0,,,,1

I feel like this is the adult version of ""boys will be boys"" and I can't fucking stand it.

When people say ""men are visual creatures!"" it seems to take away their responsibility *as functioning people* and justify whatever depraved shit they do because their biologically uncontrollable lust-filled DNA. Additionally it places the responsibility back on women to make up for (or encourage) their pRiMaL nEeDs. It's just one of the myriad ways men have justified doing whatever the fuck they want and we just have to deal with it based on some pseudo-evolutionary bullshit. 

**Based on this, women and girls**

- can't dress provocatively (i.e. in shorts or tank tops) because men can't control their lust

- MUST dress provocatively to find or keep a man 

- have to be/stay attractive to keep their men, if they wander it's your fault because of visual creature reasons 

- need to understand that men have urges 

- are responsible for how violently/sexually/dangerously men act 

- are made to completely cover ourselves in large parts of the world because it's easier to COMPLETELY shield a woman from society than it is for a man to look away from a sexy sexy ankle 

- are held to different biological standards because we don't shoot up schools or murder exes, so we as the moderate gender have to do what we can to ebb the impulsivity of men around us 

- do not enjoy sex as much as men on average but if we express this we are frigid bitches and ""aren't any fun""

- have to be independent, interesting, smart, a good housewife, responsible, funny (but not too much). JK SHE JUST NEEDS TO BE HOT LOL MEN ARE SIMPLE CREATURES 


**Based on this, men**

- get to act out their depravity 

- rarely take ownership for their shallow one-dimensionality

- can use a lack of sexual interest to justify cheating on their wives and abandoning their children and nobody is allowed to call them on it because ""men are visual!!!!111""

Oh and fuck a woman if she's visual, right? Men have very little asked of them besides ""don't stink, keep your beard and weight under control and wear something halfway decent"" and most of them fuck that up but we still spend huge swaths of our life trying to appeal to their DISCERNING GAZE. 

When we hear this phrase you know what we should do? Laugh at them. Say ""yes, you're so right, all women were born without eyes"" or ""maybe we should keep them in cages if they're TOO WILD to operate in society?"" Laugh at them. Laugh at their tiny penises that determine too much of how modern society operates. Just laugh.

# Child support/custody mess

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in Colorado.

I'll try to keep this as easy to follow as possible.

Got with girl when she was 7 months pregnant with (obviously) not my child. Was my first relationship/girlfriend/whatever so I stupidly signed the birth certificate. We talked with the bio dad and asked him if its cool that we did this first because he claimed he did not want a kid and her being pregnant was a mistake. This was all very stupid on my part for obvious reasons but this isn't about me and my mistakes but more about what the right thing to do is...

Things didn't work out with us and we break up. I'm immediately responsible for child support. Not fighting that at all... I made my bed and all that. She moves a state away to get back together with the biological dad. I'm still paying child support through all this.... Little perturbed but not much i can do. They break up and she's with some other person now still in another state. Bio dad is now wanting to be in the kids life. I don't blame him.

Fast forward to now. Bio dad and my ex are in a custody battle. I've been contacted by both of them independently. Each wants my help in a different way. Here is what they both want:

Ex: Wants me to be a witness (I guess?) to the fact that we sat down and talked with the bio dad before I signed the birth certificate about what everything meant and that I would be legally his father. This is true.

Bio dad: Wants me to go to the court where I was ordered to pay support from and sign an affidavit explaining that I know I am not the bio dad. Which is also true

Now, I know the right thing to do is to do what I can to make sure this kid can have a father. I am no longer in his life (he was 2 when we broke up and they moved a state away) but is that even something that can be done? My ex says that biodad is trying to get 100% custody claiming she's an unfit mother. She said she needs me in court to help prove that he didn't want anything to do with the kid when she was pregnant. She said if I help her she is going to get all the support waived and that biodad would be named the father for support purposes?

I'm highly confused as to what to do because they both have lawyers and I have none. I feel at a disadvantage. My ex is afraid that if i sign my rights away (if thats even a thing) it could affect her ongoing custody case with biodad. Im just so utterly lost and cannot afford a lawyer.

I guess what I'm confused about is:

If I'm legally the kids father but I never see him and the bio dad is wanting to be in the kids life.... shouldn't the courts let that happen without me having to choose a side? I have a biochild with my ex who i am currently paying support for and I have no problem doing so but she said she doesn't need the support anymore and said she would drop all child support if I help her. (helping her is not lying mind you... helping her is telling the truth in court)

\*\*edit\*\*The original support order / parental rights hearing was in Kansas. She moved to Missouri and that is where the custody case is now being held. They have also moved the support order to Missouri too if that makes any difference. I'm not in the childs life at all since she got back together with the kids bio dad almost 4 years ago so I have no problem giving up my parental rights if I even can.

I’ve been lurking through this subreddit lately so I think this is the best place to write this.  This might be long. 

I’ve been going through an emotional stress lately due to my (now ex) bf breaking up with me more than a month ago. I’m absolutely devastated by this due to the fact that I thought this man was of high value to me by these following reasons:

1. He would always drive 8 hours + 4 hours plane ride just to see me for one day (and will repeat the process to go home and work). He did this once a month, this was the best he could do because before we used to live in different countries and his job doesn’t allow him to really take long leaves. 

2. My birthday present from him was an all expense paid trip to an island in an amazing private resort. He’s not rich so he shelled out all his savings for this.

3. He dated and pursued me with the purpose of marrying me.  During our first month together, he invited my mother to a dinner. 

Last September, he got an internship here for 6 months but due to stress he got more distant until it lead him to telling me that he feels like he loves me less now but assured me i’m not at fault. During this time he also told me he can’t lose me in his life as he still deeply “cares” for me. So we kept in contact. 

Now the shit part is that he still treats me like his gf. He takes me out on dates and is still..very affectionate physically (random cuddles, kisses on the forehead, kisses on the cheek). I know I’m at fault for still keeping in contact and it just made my moving on process a LOT HARDER. It confused me so much. Last week I asked him if he wants to get back together with me and he literally cannot answer me.

I’m so confused with my current situation and what to do at this point. Any advice, comments, suggestions are greatly appreciated. Please slap my face with the harsh truth too because I’m having the “love is blind” moment here. Thank you so much.",36670,Need someone to slap my face with the harsh reality of my current situation.,0,,,,1

1. saying it's okay to break up with someone over sexual compatibility
2. it's fine if sex is important to a person in a relationship

Or generally things of that nature. Any advice on those two subs involving sex will say one or two of those things. Specifically, I saw a post of a man saying if he weren't having consistent sex with his wife like they used to, he would've never felt strongly about her and it made me so sad that our society has conditioned people to think sex ought to dictate romantic relationships in a way it's more important than their character. I'm curious about a radfem's perspective on this topic as I'm not sure if sexual compatibility in a relationship is ever discussed (from as far as I've been digging). 

My viewpoint is that sex is probably the last thing on my radar in determining a partner as it's more about the person they are than their ability to have sex. Like, I have sex frequently, but if I could never have sex again with my partner I wouldn't say that's a dealbreaker for me because I like them as a person, not simply for sexual purposes. I definitely couldn't date anyone who didn't think like this too. Also, sorry if I picked the wrong flair!",35411,What are your thoughts on sexual compatibility?,0,,,,1

He didn’t know her last name, but took the information he can on his receipt. My group of friends are all trying to protect her. 

Two of us have been subjected to r*pe culture. I being one of them. As you know, I’m open about finding self love and being vocal and assertive with men. 

Now, we are all trying to help my friend. She is scared as she TOLD US! Her sister is a lesbian. No biggie, right? Well, she pretty much said that this dude who randomly found her wasn’t creepy. She kept victim shaming HER OWN SISTER because apparently being nice as a SERVER means you want to shag a customer. Even a lesbian is subjected to “pick me” culture. 

She boasted about how some old, rando on Instagram decided to message her to send her money. Of course, your well-being and caution is completely dismissed when you can get fifteen dollars from a faceless, Instagram profile. She’s nineteen, but she is unfazed that her sister who is a minor is living in the same town as a dude that can’t differentiate service from flirtation. 

Of course, my sister and I defended this young girl. My sister has been in the throes of patriarchy, herself. We were honestly flabbergasted that our “friend” wouldn’t even stick up for her little sister. We warned her about our struggles and of course, “friend” says, “you wouldn’t be creeped out if a woman did that!” I don’t know about that one, Ms. Pick Me. I’m sorry that women have more respect and awareness for boundaries. I have yet to feel harassed by a woman. 

So, Pick Me is thinks it’s okay for a man to waste his time searching for a minor since she never texted him. Pick Me says that all men are good and rarely want to immediately have sex with a girl. I had to recount my experience with sexual assault as well as relay having to that I had to reject a guy LAST WEEK as he kept pressuring me to get drunk with him at his hotel. This was just to prove a point, which really just slammed into a brick wall. 

I don’t think all men are inherently bad, but that doesn’t mean toxic masculinity and the patriarchy hasn’t affected their choices. And this culture is still thriving. Brushing it under the rug that there are men conditioned to expect sex from women or to feel allowed to manipulate women won’t make it go away. 

I feel invalidated. After being r*ped, I learned the people that deny your struggles or make you out to be a bad person was harder to cope from than the actual experience. It made me live years doubting myself. And Pick Me culture glamorizes that. Pick Me tells a girl that we as might as well give men what they want. We must do everything we can to seek validation. We are not victims or fighters of the patriarchy. It disgusts me more when women are under this impression- I’m just use to it by men. 

If you are not willing to defend a fellow female that is in the binds of harassment- If you are undermining how uncomfortable she feels, you are a Pick Me. Pick Mes have no self awareness. It was clear as day that the younger sister was uncomfortable. SHE SAID IT! But big sister continued to victim blame. She said that her sister asked for it. She said that the man was not creepy. 

As of now, I am cutting Ms. Pick Me out of my life. She has been a nuisance and danger (other stories) to my sister and me, but this experience goes too far. I absolutely do NOT want to be around a woman convinced that this is how the world needs to work. She is nothing but negative, misogynistic energy. I’ll do what her big sister is suppose to do and protect my friend if it means she can be safe.",35409,A pick me experience,0,,,,1

 I'm talking about men who straight up dislike most types of vegetables/fruits or a large amount of foods from different food groups are a very big turn off for me. It's even a bigger turn off for me when they dislike something they never even tried (sushi for example, or avocado).

I am a pansexual woman. I am very open about my orientation as I have this idea that people might as well screw off if they don’t like it. Sometimes, I rather deal with homophobe than a man that sexualizes my admiration for women. I have had women ask me rational questions as to why I am pansexual. They never cross boundaries. 

However when a man asks me, it quickly turns into him confidently asking if I had been with women. Of course, my preference for transgendered people is ignored since that is not as hot as their expectation of lesbianism. They expect me to tell a steamy anecdote about using toys or randomly making out with a girl at a sleepover. Really, they’re just describing to me some embellished porn scene they spanked to the night before. 

I’ve done this before. When I am imposed such an inappropriate question, I use to answer. I’d think, “Oh! It’s the truth, but it’ll surely refine his expectations of lesbian sex!” You do not have to talk about your sex life if you don’t want to. I have felt uncomfortable and it was clear in their leering eyes that they were imagining me doing that. It was disgusting. Men like that don’t care what is true or not. Your response goes in one ear and out the other because they’re just getting off to knowing you’ve been with a female. 

A man like that does not care about your sexuality. Hell he’d most likely be THAT guy that says homosexuality is a sin... unless it’s two, busty blonde chicks. It is disturbing, but not shocking that no matter what a woman says or prefers, it’s constantly fetishized. 

I am with women because I like them. Because we developed respect for each other. It’s appalling that I can change in a women’s locker room and my only thought being, “Did I pack my socks?” Men can’t use this excuse that their testosterone is too primal. Guess what? I’m a living being on earth with a sex drive, but you don’t catch me whistling at a female in the gym if she’s trying to just go on with her day. 

I don’t go up to straight men and ask about their sex lives. I don’t need to apparently since they’d like to expose their partners, anyways. Your sexuality does not need to be “validated” by some dude that wants to get his rocks off. You’re allowed to say, “I’m such and such”, and end it there. If he pries, tell him to F off.

So I let myself ignore the red flags, and resumed back with him after a discussion where he accused me of ignoring him, and moving on. I replied that he was doing the same to me. That was last Tuesday. 

Last night, I was at his place. We were on couch, enjoying each other. He went to put his hand down in my pants. And i said ""don't do it that way, it feels awkward, come around and do it this way."". He JUMPS UP, walks a few feet away and then says ""Don't tell me how to do my job!"" then comes back and lays on top of me with his arms around me. Sexy tines were over with but he wanted to cuddle and have me near him. When i asked him about a half hour why he said ""it's because you kept covering up with your hands and you know that is turn off for me. ""  I was not covering up, but whatever. 

Anyway, we get it back on he made such a big deal about ""wanting to please his woman"", so i let him go down on me to try him out. I faked an orgasm.  I realized that i cannot ""let go"" with him. And given he didn't jerk off that day, his cock was troublingly not has hard as it should be. This has been an ongoing thing with him. Given his history, he is probably porn sick and/or a sex addict, or god forbid, something worse. 

I need to end this. The question is how. I'm thinking of ghosting, but we have a history now. I almpost did it last night, but then i got a ""are you almost home baby"" text from him...so I didn't. So pathetic, my heart melting at a common courtesy. 

IMO, he is a former fuckboy who is trying to be legit now. But his former fuckboy ways have left him stunted sexually and emotionally. He was the type that when he was 35, he was dating a 22 year old.

I started dating this 28 year old guy recently; I'm 26. We've been on 6 dates in the span of about 3 weeks. I can say with certainty that he texted me back a lot more frequently at the beginning, and seemed really interested in planning dates, etc. Things have slowed down a bit since the beginning, and the last time we saw each other was Saturday, and before that, the Saturday prior. Not seeing each other for a week isn't my top concern - we are both busy with our careers and side hustles, and I don't think it's absolutely crucial to see each other every 2-4 days when first dating (although, I definitely would like to, and all of my relationships in the past have developed in that fashion). Also, to note, we haven't been intimate yet, as I asked him to get tested (I do this with everyone) and he made an appointment for early December to do that (he was very receptive and understanding about this, took action quickly).

There have been multiple (at least 3) instances over the last week where I would ask a question over text, and he wouldn't respond for more than 12-16 hours, or at all. Direct questions, like ""How was your day?"", ""So did you end up surfing today?"", ""So is Saturday at 6PM good?"", that end with a ""?"" sign. There would be a small text back-and-forth before that, which is why I felt like I'd get a response in a timely fashion asking a question like that.

For the ""Is Saturday at 6PM good?"" example, I texted him at 4PM on Friday with no response until Saturday morning, at which I texted him again asking if he was okay with 6PM or not, because I wanted to make plans, and he immediately responded (within a minute) that 6PM was good. When I asked him about it in person and expressed that my time is important to me, he said he just didn't think he needed to respond because he wasn't sure he'd be free at 6PM, but he sees that he should have told me that he wasn't sure instead of not saying anything because I was making my own plans for that day.

The other two examples, ""How was your day"", and ""So did you end up surfing today?"" were sent anywhere between 4-9PM and never responded to that night or even the next morning. Yesterday, I asked him ""So did you end up surfing today?"" at around 4PM, and he hasn't texted me back.

I just feel disconnected from him, frustrated, and discouraged. I see him check his phone enough in person when we're spending time together, like a normal amount, so I think it's safe to assume he's seen my text, and isn't responding. I also will disclose that I have a mild anxious attachment style, which I am working to heal with my therapist (last saw my therapist on Saturday!), so I am aware that I do like texting frequently and words of affirmation are important to me. But it's not like a teenager-level, ridiculous amount; I would be okay not texting all day long if there was a quick chat at night or sometime during the day, something like that. It's so easy to date when the guy is also a big texter, but it's hard when it's like this.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this matter.",35273,"Is this acceptable behavior, and if you were me, would you communicate or step away?",0,,,,1

Of course problem is he is nice, no deal breakers, so I started to catch feelings. Told him and decided to end meeting with him, since he told me from the beginning he is not ready for a relationship.

Now, he has messaged me saying he dreamed of me, specifically that I was still living far away and he took the train to hug me, or another instance we were in a car and my father was driving and he was anxious because he was my boyfriend and did not know what my father thought of him. He has also sent me cute coupley photos thinking I would find them cute. So the dream mentioning was the ice on the cake.

I asked him to stop sending me romantic stuff of any kind. He agreed.

Later in the evening he called me and asked if I wasn't busy , to see a movie on the phone simultaneously. 

I want to keep him as a friend, because he has been honest with me from the beginning, actually gave me advice, and inspired me with my career and happiness.

Anyone else have this long ass, dragged out disappointing experience? 

Any tips as to how to approach this? What would you do?

I've been a good supportive friend for 6 years, turned down his advances multiple times but we still talk friendly (1st mistake) 

How I realized he didnt value my long established friendship?

Via a text message 3 days ago:

Me: whats up dude how goes it
Him: goes good
Me: hows ur fam
Him: you can lay next to me and fall asleep and I'll watch over you, LOL

What in the actual motherfuck does that have to do with the topic? The shit??? 

I'm pissed beyond hell.

Which is why I'm here. I just learned of the term ""niceguy"" last week and holy shiz, hes like the poster child.

If you had a group of guys making fun of fat girls and one of them secretly has a fat girlfriend, he won’t defend her. He will think of her as less because she is not desired socially (in his group). He will probably start treating her worse or leave her.

In situations where women are involved, a woman will defend her man and risk losing her social status. Women tend to put men above their friends and family because of our awful socialization. Women are more loyal and will put up with more shit, unfortunately. Women will take care of a sick partner, a man will leave his sick woman.

We've been living together for a year and he is very respectful and we get along happily. 

Happily enough that I've managed to kick off some addictions (used to be an alcoholic &amp; recreational drug addict) and am planning to go back to school to further my career. 

Now that I'm sober I'm getting myself back out there, trying to reconnect with friends or make new ones etc &amp; I guess I feel like I'm new at this. Some guy friends from college and highschool are starting to take notice of this &amp; I've been messaging with a few of them over social media/text.  

I remember them being generally okay guys in terms of smart and fun etc. but I'm not sure if all they want is friendship. One of them moved far away after highschool and we lost touch. Another one is someone that I did fool around with once but we were just friends before and after it (back in my 'pick-me' days during college). Regardless I dont think I had or have any feelings for either of them. I did used to have a lot of male friends, mostly because I was a pick-me LVF but I didn't date any of them.   

Now I'm getting a few invites to hang out as they're 'back in town for a couple of weeks' or apparently come around to my part of town often etc. I've told my boyfriend and he's okay with it as I'm hoping its just a friendly catch up of old friends. I don't generally post many pictures with my boyfriend on facebook (or announce our relationship) as I have a conservative family and work friends &amp; generally like to go over personal stuff face to face (also my boyfriend is someone I used to work with).  Somehow I have a feeling that if I was to tell them I had a boyfriend directly they would either stop talking to me or give me one of those 'don't flatter yourself' responses. 

It has been over 5 years since I've seen any of these people but we used to be very close either in college or highschool. I have also been meeting up with old female friends from schools and I also wait until being in person to disclose relationship details because it's personal. When I was using I would just let the other person steer but now I would like to aquire some friends.

Been seeing a push pull, emotional crummer. Felt like he was “worth” chasing because he’s brilliant, an artist, did some stuff right, blah, blah, blah. The honest truth is my self esteem is at an all time low. I’m pushing 50, truly believe I will die alone and while my life is ok I live in a town where most peoples’ lives are way better than ok and I’m just generally down on myself right now. 
When I joined this sub I took a cafeteria approach to the info-chose what appealed to me and left the rest. Perhaps not the preferred approach but I must have internalized some good stuff because last night after another date/hangout (??) I was headed home and I thought stop leaving this man’s home in the wee hours in a state of confusion. So a mile from his place I called him without any drama asked him point blank: are we friends or dating or what? First thing he asked was are you outside? I’m guessing the plan was to come out and dazzle me as he knows he can. I said no I’m driving home. (hands free talk-safety first) so I repeated the question. He said it was confusing. I agreed it was confusing and said
“Joe, what are your feelings for me? I know you are capable of feelings. I saw you make a connection with the singer we saw tonight, I see you adore your cat while I sit next to you ignored.”  He said he enjoys my company and then trailed off. At that point I knew it was a lost cause. Knew I’d been played. Was a fill in for when his social calendar wasn’t full. So I said a few more things-how I felt because my feelings are real-but I did it unemotionally and when the silence on his end just continued I simply pushed end call. Timer came in at under four minutes. Three months of my life and me thinking if I could just be more (fill in the blank) he’ll pick me. 
So there you go. Honest confession from a woman who should have known better, and who did in her heart and mind. With the help of this sub I knew this behavior was this particular man’s ego serving strategy. Yes I wasted three months but the old me would have wasted more. So thanks everyone.

Here's my story:

24. Average looking, but I do have a nice body. Single for a long time. I'm really busy with school and work so I don't have much time to pursue hobbies or anything. Most good guys around me are already taken. I also live in a country where hookup culture is basically nonexistent. So if you don't find someone in school (majoring in an almost all-female field), work, through friends or in chruch (I'm an atheist), you're screwed.

So what do I do? I figure Tinder is a nice option to meet someone new that I otherwise I wouldn't be able to. So I set up a profile and do my best to avoid whores wanting ONS and condescending jerks who act like women should be grateful for their mere existence. I also avoid super desperate guys who want you just because you have a pair of tits.

That leaves you with a few guys. Then you start to have conversations. Most of them are boring as fuck. They have no interests, or even worse, are able to talk ONLY about their interests (made a huge mistake when I was fancying a coworker...he was super smart and we had long conversations about philosophy, politics, just about anything...I'm kinda a sucker for intellect. I was young and stupid and thought he was willing to talk to me about these things because he cared about my opinion. No, he just enjoyed the sound of his own voice and I was dumb enough to gas his ass up). 

So you weed out THESE guys, and then you go out with what's left. And that's one guy. He actually takes the initiative, he suggests pretty quickly we meet. We have a lot of similar interests and such. We meet and have a nice evening together. Again we have a lot in common, although I was kinda put off by his control-freakish behavior (I'm not gonna tell my whole life story, or my daily schedule to a guy who I barely know. But I mentioned I work Friday evening and he wrote it down in his planner that I'm busy on Fridays usually. I thought that was weird, but I didn't have time to truly process that). 

The problem? I enjoy being around this guy. But as a friend. I feel like he'd be a GREAT friend. He's funny, he's not a sexist, has some interesting hobbies, we have the same (very specific) taste in music. But I'm not attracted to him. I KNOW what true physical attracting feels and looks like. Been there, done that. See my little rant about a coworker above. And he wasn't an Adonis - far from that. But I was really attracted to him.

So this Tinder guy? Yeah, after three dates, there's no chemistry on my part. So I break it off. My friends think I'm crazy because we have a lot in common, he seems to be really into me, we went on three great dates. I had fun, but I didn't want to even kiss him, let alone do something else. He's not ugly (although definitely not super attractive), he's just...I don't want him that way.

A little side rant: He kinda looked better in pictures and he did really well hiding his lazy eye and the fact he's already balding. I don't mind these things actually, but my pics on Tinder were both in harsh daylight and under  profeessional lighting, I've had pics in full makeup as well as bare-faced ones. I just though that was the most fair thing to do, especially considering I have a mild acne problem. I could've used Facetune or soomething, but I didn't want to.  

So, am I the asshole here? Am I too shallow for wanting someone who physically attracts me? I'm not looking for a prime Brad Pitt, but he needs to have that special something. Am I dumb for breaking things off so soon? One of my friends says feelings develop over time. They do. But how can I fall in love with someone I'm not attracted to?

The worst thing here is the guilt I'm feeling for rejecting him. He went out of his way to make me have a good time and I feel like one of those girls these awful redpillers always rant about - rejecting a genuinely nice guy.

I would appreciate your perspective.",35196,Feeling guilty for rejecting a nice guy,0,,,,1

Ever since i turned about 11-12 i literally started getting hit on by much older taken (or even married) men. It's always made me uncomfortable, especially when i was younger. On top of everything i didn't have a loving mother who made me understand that it's OK to be naturally ""sexy"" or to have curves. She always made sure to slut-shame me and dressed me in super conservative clothing. ""You're not wearing yoga pants because YOU LOOK LIKE A PROSTITUTE"" and etc.

It really messed me up mentally because my own mother made me feel bad about my body and all the men around me sexualized and objectified me like there was no tomorrow (yes, including family members... my grandfather would discuss how ""big"" my boobs have became at the dinner table around his friends and etc.). Growing up i also got sexually assaulted more times than i can count. I had grown so accustomed to being groped and etc. that at one point i started believing that this was ""normal"", i didn't realize that people touching my boobs/ass/vagina without my consent is NOT okay and i thought that i deserved to be treated like that because my body and face are naturally sexy.

After a while (when i turned about 13-14) i became very severely anorexic. I felt so hopeless and i hated myself so much that i became incredibly self-destructive, suicidal and basically almost starved myself until death so that i could ""erase"" my curves and femininity because i was taught by my ""mother"" that it was a bad thing and because people tried to justify all of the terrible things that i had to endure because my boobs and butt are big for my frame and etc....

Long story short i somehow made it out alive and after i started recovering i immediately started getting all of that excess male attention once again. And unfortunately I've only been attracting taken men or complete fuckboys. Anytime a guy tries to talk to me the conversation either ends with a sentence similar to ""Sooo.. when did you lose your virginity?""/""Do you wanna go to my place?""/""How many guys have you slept with?"" and etc. or said guys are being really nice and sweet to me (without being vulgar) and then i end up finding out that they're actually married/that they have a girlfriend. 

It makes me feel even worse because i guess everyone sees nothing but a ""slut""/""sex toy"" in me although i'm literally a virgin. I don't even wear revealing/""IG baddie"" type of clothing (not that all of this would be justified if i were to dress provocatively). I actually have a very classic, preppy style and when i go clubbing and etc. i wear dresses that don't reveal a lot/anything at all. I don't go to ""cheaper"" neighborhoods/areas either... i get treated a million times worse there.

I've started to completely lose all kinds of hope. I was invited to a birthday party the other day (all of us were the same age) and a really handsome, ""sweet"" guy approached me. He was at the other end of the table (it's a huge table) and he came all the way up to me in order to ask me about my name. I only told him my first name and he said ""you have such a beautiful name!, my name is.... \*insert forename AND surname\*"". He was being extra touchy and put his face super close to mine although the music wasn't even that loud yet (it was the beginning of the night). It was very confusing because it looked like he was trying to hide the fact that he was approaching me... before coming up to me he went up to the guy right next to me and acted like he had to say something to him while looking me in the eyes throughout their whole ""conversation"" and i couldn't understand why. His super closeness made me uncomfortable anyways and i think he sensed it because he quickly got back to his place at the table (once again, these tables are LARGE, you can barely see the ending of it if you're at the other end of it).

Said guy went home really early without saying goodbye and i was confused about why he would explicitly let me know what his full name was AND repeat it so i can hear it well (yes, he did repeat it and i didn't even ask), especially knowing that i only answered to his ""What's your name?"" with my forename and that the party was very casual anyways (no one used their full name when introducing themselves). So searched his name up on IG and followed his account. When he accepted my request and followed me back i saw the 8428742842s of posts on his profile with his GIRLFRIEND. And i also realized that i had seen that girl at the party when i went to the toilet once so on top of everything he was there with her while he was hitting on me.

These situations upset me a lot. 3 days ago another taken guy was sliding in my Instagram DMs talking about what a ""goddess"" i am and etc. Today he uploaded a Snapchat story of him kissing some girl in his bed (his gf i assume). It's ridiculous because since all these guys are taken the only reason why they'd hit on me is because they think they would be able to sleep with me easily, i doubt any of them are seeking some kind of emotional connection knowing that they're taken. And these are not the only 2 guys with whom I've experienced this, it happens all the time but this literally happened in the short span of 2-3 days (i'm exclude the single guys that hit up on me in a very vulgar way these days because they were a lot too, i'm only talking about UNAVAILABLE men who go out of their way to flirt with me and act like ""good guys""). I cannot believe this and it makes me feel like trash. No one wants to take me seriously and i feel ridiculously objectified.",20719,Why do taken guys approach me ALL THE TIME?

I strongly feel they are dishing out some piss poor advice across the board that puts women in danger, particularly on Reddit, and so I wanted to address it in a post. So here it is side by side, so you can see the mind of a self aware strong savvy woman in comparison to that of a weak willed ignorant 'liberal' girl who often finds herself in dangerous/toxic/degrading situations with men.

***'It's not ALL men, there's no reason to be afraid of them' vs 'Assume its all men, take precautions and play it safe'***

Yesterday I got in an argument with a pick me hippy type on a female travel sub about women's safety whilst travelling solo abroad (I have travelled solo quite a few times now). The original OP had booked a mixed sex room, but it ended up being half empty, leaving it to her and some old dirty perverted man that was masturbating when she walked in , which continued despite how inappropriate it was. OP was used to using mixed sex rooms and it *'not being a problem',* but this situation made her realise the realities of being female &amp; that she had just had it lucky up to now (she ended up being moved &amp; reported the guy). I always tell women its better to stay in a private or female only room when travelling in a foreign country on your own - since you are already more vulnerable being a woman in a foreign country you're not used to. If you are staying in a hostel on a budget, you should only be picking a well reviewed one in a safe area- there will still be plenty of common areas &amp; events there where you can meet with guys...but generally a well reviewed Airbnb/hotel is usually the better option (there's a ton of other ways to meet people- bars/public transport/tours etc). I don't recommend mixed sex dorms in budget hostels because naturally they are going to attract homeless men, people on drugs/with criminal records and other nefarious low budget characters that you may never see again, thus there is a higher risk of them being opportunistic in mixed sex dorms (sex assault/theft/harassment) plus you are sleeping next to COMPLETE strangers which leaves you vulnerable at night - just because you are nice doesn't mean they are.  This, according to cool girl liberal logic, is me 'shifting blame' onto these women. ERM no I think i'd call it RISK management, acknowledging that you DO exist in a world littered with sleezy violent criminal men, and you do your best to avoid them &amp; keep yourself safe as possible. Throwing women to the lions is stupid advice, and could put them in serious danger they might not return from. 

***'Don't expect a man to fund you' vs 'Make it expensive to waste your time'***

Pick me logic is wilfully ignorant to the fact that men *deliberately* scam women for sex all the time, but finds great issue with high value (attractive/educated/interesting) women expecting a man to pay for a date they have been asked on. They believe this is allowing the man to think the woman owes/controls her, when in fact its the opposite because the high value woman still has a job and her own money (she is not financially reliant). Back in the real world, the majority of men are going on a date with you, flirting with you, taking you out, saying whatever you want to hear, JUST to get inside a nice warm 'hole' they can brag about, no matter how genuine, low maintenance or forgiving you are. When you consider how much money and time you could waste on dates with false start guys like this, it makes sense for women to be choosy and expect a man to pay on a date, because no matter if he's lying he will soon get bored of paying if he's just after that. It is also symbolic, because if hes happy to pay it signals hes generous, cares for others and demonstrates he can provide (9/10 he will still expect you to fulfil most emotional labour/cleaning/caretaking duties anyway, even if he is broke). If the man is broke &amp; wants easy NSA sex he should be making those intentions clear and seek women who are after the same. The act of men paying has nothing to with a woman's finances, because most men feel entitled to sex from you regardless of whether you pay half or not. Playing equal in a game that is still rigged against women, will just have you out of pocket &amp; make it cheaper for men to play you&amp; other women. Make it expensive to waste your time, so next time he thinks twice about playing a high value woman.

***'Men do it so why can't I?' vs 'Men's behaviour is problematic, why stoop to their level?'***

Just because men creep around cheating on their wives, not honouring their marriages, does not mean women should be helping them by playing the side chick role. Liberal pick me's will claim marriage is a sham (fair point for WOMEN), but that isn't an excuse to project this onto people who think differently and relish in breaking up someones home, which always results in emotional grief for the wife and kids. Sexual empowerment is not about being as sleezy and disgusting as men are, its supposed to be about closing the orgasm gap, challenging the ridiculous expectations that women stay virgins why men mess around, and about improving women's sex lives (demanding more pleasure). Smart girl logic is not inherently against casual sex, but instead advises that you be selective if seeking a FWB situation and make sure it overwhelmingly benefits you and that they are of high quality and very skilled (focused on your pleasure). If he is married and fucking you, it is blatantly clear he isn't trustworthy, doesn't know what he wants in life and is most likely codependent on his wife still (he is comfortable). Most times he will not leave the wife, and he will continue to string along the side piece, because simply that is the level of comfort you have allowed him to indulge in. Encouraging women to mirror men's pornsick rampant negligent behaviour will just result in women as toxic &amp; as untrustworthy as men, increase men's appetite for 'variety' and swell his sense of entitlement with little effort required, with more expense to the side piece because they will be judged more harshly for it than the husband. It will just lead to more abortions, more STI's, more unplanned pregnancies, more love triangle drama &amp; less respect for the woman. As a woman fucking a married/taken man, you are already in a weaker position than him from the minute you find out and continue to indulge him. As pointed out here numerous times, whether you're a 10/10 cool girl pornstar in bed, men still have a huge issue with women that have high N counts &amp; don't see them as investment worthy most times. Bragging about sleeping with 17 men this month, including married men, is not empowering, because *men's attention is cheap to attain*, and men get a pat on the back for this stuff whilst they will shame you for it. Women get hurt when you offer yourself as the sidechick to numerous men and it pumps their already inflated ego's...this behaviour can never be considered 'feminist'..it is just fuelling the problem.",20717,Pick me vs Smart bitch logic,0,1572179546.0,,,0

I used to be the kind of girl who would get crushes on men and it would turn a bit obsessive. I would fantasize about how good being with them would feel and I did things to make them aware of my existence. I initiated contact, I led our interaction, and I was forward with my seduction. I had a stronger masculine personality back then and I didn't mind taking the lead. I wanted to make them like me. Of course, it didn't work out. It only made the man emotionally unavailable and I think I was attracted to a man's emotional unavailability because I didn't have enough self-worth back then. I just didn't know any better.

Now I see some posts here where basically the OP is asking what moves she should make to catch the attention of her crush. She knows about his existence and admires him, but he doesn't know her. Or... she's friends with her crush and she wants to take it to the next level. I know that pleasure that comes from yearning for someone and the thrill of the unknown. ""Does he or does he not like me? I want him to notice me. I want to make him mine."" It's a drug, chasing after men; it makes you feel more alive. But oh, how our emotions mislead us! Allowing yourself to get carried away will bring nothing but pain.

My advice basically is... do not have a crush on anyone ever. If you ever feel yourself liking a friend, stop feeling that way, because if he's interested in you, he would have asked you out already. If it's a stranger that you like, stop feeling that way, because liking someone who hasn't noticed you is a sure way to put you in pursuit mode and FDS women don't pursue. Sure, you can flirt with your friend or make flirty eye contact with the cute stranger, but stop yourself from feeling intense emotions and infatuation towards them. Only entertain men who pursue you HARD. 

The best course of action is to become your best self and attract men to your life, while at the same time not letting yourself have a silent crush on anyone EVER. You only entertain men who obviously pursue you and you don't yearn for someone who doesn't know your existence or an acquaintance/friend who hasn't asked you out.",20675,"There is ZERO benefit to having a crush.

Although to my défense sometimes I don’t recognise it. Here’s an example: 

It was a tinder date and dude shows up and we go for friend chicken. I don’t have a problem with having fast food on a first date, but he kept saying it’s because he’s broke. Not that I need him to treat me anything or I mentioned anything about it. We later head to a bar and talked more about why we use the app. He’s finding a gf, I just wanted to meet new people, as my university has a 9:1 girl to boy ratio. Anyways, I told him I wasn’t interested in seeing him or anyone really at the point but he kept making advances. Like trying to hug, touch my thigh or kiss me. He ended up forcing my head around and kiss me near my lips and he looked so smug and bragged about at least getting one kiss from me. He also kept suggesting to go the the beach although it was already late at night and more than an hour away although I kept saying no. The list goes on and on.

But at that time I validated his actions by telling myself, he’s a dude and all dudes are like this. Thinking back, I realised how stupid that mindset is and how I should have just stood up and left. This was only one of the instances of bad dates I went on but each time I learn something new and I’m not making the same mistake nowadays. 
I also just prefer to date myself out instead of these meaningless dates. 

Did you girls have any dates like these? And how did you handle the situation? Personally I find it quite hard to just be very direct and tell the dude “no”.",20621,What’s a bad date you went on?,0,1572175921.0,,,0

By the way, I never ended up sleeping with any of these men, though I continued to date them to see if their actions were consistent with their own facts they revealed about their character. 
&amp;nbsp;

Example 1:
&amp;nbsp;

A few things he told me over months of conversation: 
&amp;nbsp;

- He “used” to want to have sex with a girl from every race.
- He jokingly/ playfully mentioned his history of being “kind of a jerk” and losing interest after sex. 
- He broke up with his girlfriend because they were long distance and he wanted to be with someone he could sleep with.
- He had been with 20-30 women
- He had never had a long term / consistent source of sex (especially from the same woman), and he seemed excited to think this was in his near future
- He’d say things like “no one is going to see us for weeks when we finally have sex” 
- He always assumed that I’d like pain and would bite my lips to the point of swelling
- hed never been with a girl with “pink lips” before (he was Indian).

&amp;nbsp;

As it turns out, he’s incredibly insecure, jealous, manipulative and projects his sexual desires onto you. Mildly to moderately narcissistic. Probably still the most desirable of the 3 I’ll be speaking of today. A lot of him exposing himself and how he treats women was a result of his own attempt at “dread game”.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Example 2:
&amp;nbsp;

- He had slept with over 40 women
- He had never had a relationship longer than a year (early 30s)
- He said he wasn’t attracted to ethnic girls
- When talking about an ex he jokingly told me how she had no will power (not his words) and when ever she’d try and stick up for her self, he’d be like “no you won’t” and she’d eventually comply until one day she just ghosted / blocked him 
- empathized with an old narcissist that was verbally abusive when I worked for him because I said he deserved to be alone for treating people the way he does
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Example 3:
&amp;nbsp;

- he told me he thought it was funny to troll his recently out trans friend about biology ( I’m most gender critical when it comes to trans stuff, but I still thought it’s fucked up to bully/cut ties with someone because their existence personally disgusts you (his words)).
- He never gave me a number, but said he’s had “so many night stands” with women that never wanted to see him again, so he stopped sleeping with them on the first night and they still never wanted to see him again lmao 
- encouraged me to watch Jordan peterson / Kathy Hughes video (which I actually thought JP make good points in the video, but it just shows where his views on women fall)
- when we talked about r/niceguys he had trouble relating to the women’s frustrations and clearly (though not outright) empathized with the nice guys. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

So I want to make it clear that w/o context and tone, it seems so obvious these are red flags, but conversationally, these men heavily downplay what they are saying by making it light hearted and laughing about it. Often, the point of their stories is not even to tell them their character flaws, but to let you know that they have other women that want them (dread). 

&amp;nbsp;

During my time with them, the first two men displayed clear characteristics of narcissism, gaslighting, insecurity/jealousy, desire to control women, sexual obsessions, and potential for emotional and maybe even physical abuse (at least in the 2nd guy).

The 3rd guy wasn’t as bad and mostly just had a bunch of resentment towards women, but still not someone you could be happy dating. 

Oh and they all wanted kids. Like very important to them, but continued to pursue a relationship with me despite my being clear on not wanting kids. A man that does that either does care about a future with you, or they believe they can change you.

Number 1
Ditch him if he’s the dick you don’t like. If you are a woman who does have preferences of dick, stick to it! If you feel his dick is not at all pleasurable then why should you continue? 

Number 2
Dump a man who says “I don’t lick pussy” even if that’s not your deal breaker. Because any man who says that shows that he doesn’t value women’s sexual pleasure.

Number 3 
If he does Lick pussy! Make sure he licks it properly!!! Yeah! Weed out those loser ass dudes who literally kiss your pussy and expects medals. 

Number 4 
Dump him if he has the Madonna/whore complex. Seriously! If you want a little more than sex and he doesn’t give it to, stop having sex with him altogether. Please don’t think FWBs are a way to relationships. 

Number 5 (most important) 
See to that he respects consent every second! A  lot of things that RPer /shit guys do is to violate her boundaries to “test” her. If u feel a finger up ur ass when you didn’t ask for it! Threaten to call the police if not calling the actual police. Yeah! That shit is actually illegal and can land him at jail if it only wasn’t for our fucked up justice system.

The challenge is simple: make flirty eye contact with 5 men daily. If you do more, that’s awesome, but you still need to do 5 tomorrow. Preferably, you do this with men you actually find attractive and would consider dating, but if you lack the confidence and experience, feel free to do it with men who aren’t as intimidating/attractive, just be sure to transition towards doing it with men who you *do* find attractive. We’re not in the business of making you lower your standards here. 

# The Five Second Flirt Technique

This is from the book, Getting to I Do:

&gt;“My technique is easy. It’s the way you invite him by your own body language to come across the room and ask you out. You don’t do anything more than smile, but if you do this properly, I promise you will have results.  
&gt;  
&gt;The first thing you want to do is to get into his line of sight. When you catch his eye, you must give him the most inviting and receptive look you can manage, for free seconds. Count them. Eye contact, eye contact, eye contact. No quick counts, no matter how nervous you get.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, catching a man’s eye for two or three seconds is quite normal. It’s when you continue to look at him for the fourth and fifth second that you indicate that you’re interested.  
&gt;  
&gt;A second way you attract a manis with your smile! Now you’re being flirtatious. Now he knows that you’re looking at and are interested in him.  
&gt;  
&gt;By now, because you’re flirting with a person you don’t want to be rejected by, you are probably in a panic. But here’s the good part. Even though you’re certain that he’s observing your meltdown, he isn’t, because he is too busy with his own anxiety and fear of rejection. At that moment, his worst nightmare is that he will come over to you and say something stupid, and you will turn away.  
&gt;  
&gt;So if you live through this Five-Second Flirt Technique and you’ve managed to keep your mouth shut, more likely than not this man will walk over to you and start talking. He may say something bright or stupid, suave or naive, but in effect he’ll open the channel of conversation, and now you can begin to respond. 

# Why this challenge?

**Online dating isn’t enough.** You’re not just relying on a dating website for your pool of candidates. Remember: there are plenty of men out there who aren’t on dating apps. You need to take advantage of this untapped market. If you live in a big city, you have plenty of opportunities versus just relying on a dating app, because depending on where you go, you can expose yourself to the type of men that you’re looking for. If you live in a smaller city, you can still go to social events to meet the kind of men you want.

**Subtle Flirting will attract more men into your life.** Before, when I used to go out with friends, I would just have fun with them and would just wait for men to approach me. I wouldn’t even make eye contact with them! In fact, I tried to avoid it so I won’t seem too forward. However, this year, I’ve revamped my approach and I actually have men who I would never think would be interested in me approach me just because I made strong eye contact with them and I smiled. I was a passive agent in the interaction, but now I’m more proactive. Subtle Flirting is what it means to be proactive as a woman, not approaching men. (Note that FDS doesn’t consider coming up to men “Girl Game.” To us, Girl Game in the initial stages involves influencing men to approach you. This means that you need to look approachable to their advances, but not needy for it in anyway.)

**This challenge will integrate Girl Game into your lifestyle.** The more you make this a habit, the easier it will be for you to meet men in person. You’ll gain the confidence to attract men and have good conversation with them. 

# How to Post Your Entries

So post below that you’re doing this challenge. Do the challenge and you can comment on your own post like so:

Day #1  
Target 1: Was feeling pretty anxious about this challenge, but was walking in downtown with lots of people, but why not. Saw a cutie in a suit, probably a finance guy, our eyes met and….  
Conclusion: Overall, I’m still not used to showing men interest, but hopefully I’ll get better soon the more I do it. 

# Make It a Daily Habit

The goal of this challenge to make showing interest in men a habit, so you can much more easily attract men in real life, which widens your options. You no longer have to deal with low quality men on dating apps. Many women these days rely on dating apps and not a lot actually know how to capture a man's interest and get them to approach. Being the type of woman who can do it, then, gives you a distinct advantage, and you're one step closer to finding a high quality man to commit to you. ;)",20439,Advance Your Girl Game: The Five Second Flirt Technique,0,1572168220.0,,,0

I wanted to make a more dedicated post about it, because I think it’s such an important topic. 

Date multiple men, so you can have more leverage to be able to keep a clear head and a pragmatic perspective of the value that each of those men bring into their dating interactions with you. And use this information to evaluate and decide which man would be the best for you to select for a relationship. 

Now whenever people hear that a woman is dating multiple men, the first thought is to assume that she is sleeping with all of them. And I want to pay particular attention to this point because it is super important for your dating success. 

Do not sleep with the men that you’re casually dating and assessing for potential relationship. I am giving you this advice, not only based on the fact that having sex with them gives them the impression that they do not need to be in a relationship with you in order to have sex with you, but some men use the guise of a potential relationship to get women to sleep with them. They are purposely vague about whether or not they want a relationship with you, often when they know deep down that they have no intention of actually making you their gf. They do this so that you can be fooled into thinking that as long as you’re patient and keep having sex with them, they’ll eventually make you their gf. 

Newsflash ladies: This rarely ever works. 

In fact, I would go as far as saying that it never works. And I’m sorry, but random luck is not enough for you to depend your love life on. 

Date multiple men. Go on multiple dates with them. Flirt with them, tease them in order to show that you are sexually attracted to them and are willing to one day have sex with them, if they act right. Allow them to pay for you if they want to and do things to impress you to show that they’re serious about you. But refrain from having sex with them. I know this goes against the now mainstream advice of having sex with every guy you date in order to keep him, but I’ve found that the opposite is true. 

If you wanted mainstream advice, there are many other subs and forums that would advice you otherwise. You’re free to go there. I’m not pro-casual sex. If you participate in casual sex, I’m not going to judge you. But your lifestyle is not in line with mine and I have found that it just does not work for me or for most women that I know. It also damages a lot of men too, but my focus is going to be more on what concerns and benefits you, ladies. 

My advice is to date them but do not have sex with them until you have concrete evidence of their seriousness towards you. Seriousness as evidenced by the amount of time, money, effort and commitment that they invest in you. Respect your standards. If you find that you’re very horny and can’t stand it, invest in a good vibrator, or while you’re still dating others for a potential relationship, find just one reliable FWB that is more invested in pleasing you than in you pleasing him. That means 90-100% of your sexual encounters should involve you receiving oral. I’ve had sexual encounters where me receiving oral is all that happened, and that should be your main priority. 

People will assume that you’re having sex with all the men you’re dating. What you’re actually doing with these men is none of their business and if people around you don’t believe that you’re not sleeping with them, then their doubts is really none of your concern. 

Can you do all of this and still encounter men that won’t give you the relationship you want? Yes. But you’ll more than likely wean them out most of them and have the ones you want.",20290,Date Multiple Men,0,1572163359.0,,,0

This is advice for how to get into a relationship with a guy who’s going to treat you like a queen and give you the commitment you want.

Make them wait for sex.  For months.  If you have to, pick one to be your fwb so you won’t be so thirsty, don’t tell any of your dates about him, and find the guy who is willing to date you for literally months with no possibility of sex.  Tell him you want to really get to know each other first before you decide if you want to be more than friends.  On your first date, ask him what he’s looking for, then tell him that you’re looking for something serious and that you want to really get to know someone well before moving further with them.  This is going to get rid of a lot of guys.  That’s what you want.  The guys who you get rid of with this were never really options for you anyway, they were just pretending to be in hopes of getting their dicks wet.  The guy who keeps dating you after this will be one you really connect with conversationally, intellectually, emotionally, etc.  and will actually be into you as a human being and not just a fuck doll.  
So yeah after you weed out all the guys you were never getting anywhere with anyway, the guys who want to keep seeing you are your real options.  Make them wait for months.  Really get to know them.  Don’t put any labels on your relationship other than friends at this point and keep fucking your fwb on the side if you want.  Keep it wholesome with your real prospects- just have fun with them but nothing sexual and honestly I wouldn’t even really kiss them much until you’ve known each other for months and are sure this is the guy you want a relationship and possibly marriage with.  Eventually he will push you for a relationship, at this point you tell him you like him a lot but that you want to make sure you’re on the same page and your goals are- whatever they are.  Marriage, kids, no kids, someone to travel the world with, whatever it is that you specifically are hoping to get out of the relationship.  Then if he’s on the same page with all that, congrats you have a boyfriend.  The only potential downside is if you go through all this and then he turns out to be bad in bed, you have to break up with him and it sucks.  I went through this process with two guys and the first was awful in bed so we broke up but then with the second one everything was great.

The reason for all this is because while sex makes women bond, it actually does the opposite for guys and prevents them from bonding with you or even really seeing you as a human being.  What will make them bond with you is talking to you, you laughing at their jokes, telling them jokes, hugging and cuddling.  You want to do enough of this before you have sex so that’ve built a really strong bond for you already and it can withstand the effects of sex on men, which is mostly just making them want to go fuck other women.

[This article](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-delaying-intimacy-can-benefit-your-relationship/) has some good info about the benefits of waiting for sex and the way that hormones cause women to bond from sex but it has the opposite effect on men.",20289,Make him wait for sex,0,1572163357.0,,,0

I went on a date with a guy I met online yday...he kinda sprung it on me and I wasn't fully in the mood but I thought fuck it, I haven't met a guy from a dating app in ages so i'll give it a go.

Anyway, so first red flag, I ask him to come to the door of the bar, so I'm not wandering around...he ain't tryna move and says 'I'm at the back' (yes I know I broke the no drinking on first dates rule, a mistake I will return to later LOL)

I eventually find him but I already know this isn't gonna go well.......

So I walk over and he's tall and I find him attractive at least and he has a deep ass voice. We get talking blah blah and he says he's a 'progressive' I'm thinking ok here we go......

He starts telling me hes a feminist (I haven't mentioned my feminist views at all by this point &amp; there is nothing in our past convos that would indicate I am) and says his country is so sexist, and slutshaming women is so hypocritical because men are allowed to sleep around blah blah

I'm thinking ahhh well that's sweet BUT in the back of my mind I'm remembering radical feminists telling me *'never trust a man who says hes feminist'*

He starts showing me all his feminist facebook statuses or whatever as proof to me cos he can tell I'm suspicious, and telling me how he has this female bestfriend he respects so much she is amazing blah blah (I feel like he could just smell I'm a feminist without me even alluding to it)

By this point he's getting a bit touchy saying oh don't mind if I'm touchy thats how we are in my culture let me know if it offends you. We keep chatting but honestly this guy has no sense of humour AT ALL so I'm not really feeling like getting touchy with him, he is making me feel stiff by being such a stiff person. He isn't like being flirty/funny and making me relax enough to do that. It feels like I'm on a date with a creepy professor if you know what I mean. Anytime I make a joke he doesn't get it and gets defensive (he does not read sarcasm). Just droning on about his 'feminism' and trying to get hands on thinking I'm so impressed (other couples were on dates near us and not doing all that anyways). Altho he is quite attractive/manly, I'm just not feeling it at a sexual level, even when I kissed him it felt off.

Anyway so after 2 drinks this motherfucker tries sending me to the bar (YEP THIS IS WHY U DON'T GO ON DRINKING DATES LADIES, IT IS TOO CHEAP FOR THEM!!)...I'm already like oh no he's one of those 'lets be equal' dudes, even tho the game is still heavily rigged against women.

I say I'm not thirsty, and wait for him to get another round. I don't allow myself to get drunk, I'm still pretty with it despite not eating.

He's getting more touchy at this point saying I'm being so stiff and British (nah I'm just not into PDA's on first dates lol bruh I don't even know you that well) and he mentions whether I will actually go to see him in London (he's moving there for a job soon) because 'women often say they will do things like that but don't' (I smell depravity/resentment)

So anyway its getting late and he's tryna convince me to let him go mine because its 'cold'. At this point the 'feminist' mask starts falling off and he's back to his entitled oppressor comforts trying to coerce me into us 'cuddling' at mine....saying he doesn't judge women for that stuff anyway....yeah sure. Anyway I blow him off cos I gotta get up early in the morning and we part ways. He looks VISIBLY disgruntled.

The next day theres a giant essay from him saying he thought I was beautiful and intelligent but I was too cold for him blah blah and how he needs more touching &amp; affection etc because of his 'culture' and basically trying to guilt trip me for not fucking him the first night. He basically said he doesn't want to see me again because of it. I can tell he's tryna bait me into some emotional caretaker response to validate him.

Immediately I'm getting butthurt stalker vibes. I tell him I don't get how he can claim he's a feminist and then get mad because he didn't get what he wanted. He then starts trying to backtrack like ohh no its not that blah blah I really like you are going to see me in London blah blah you not want to see me again? I get  another essay before I block him straight.

Then I get ANOTHER BUTTHURT essay on my dating app (forgot to block him there) calling me a dickhead and sexist and saying its all cos I'm a feminist I'm judging him....WTF BRO!! WE WENT ON ONE DATE!!

THIS IS WHY U DON'T TRUST MEN WHO SAY THEY ARE FEMINISTS! He was clearly using that as a manipulative ploy to make me think he wouldn't judge me if I slept with him straight away. Besides men can never be feminists (only allies) because they are NOT a woman. He clearly didn't have the first clue about feminism, and just expected me to take him home and fuck him even tho I wasn't really feeling it. Why did he feel entitled to come my place anyway? I was not exactly all over him and I was dressed in jeans and a classy blouse.

So yeah, this has kinda put me off online dating again because there's so many depraved dudes that are literal pyschos underneath on there. But besides going to a bar, I think my mistake with this one is I let him spring the date on me fast, we hadn't been talking TOO long and really I should of made an excuse to leave the minute he said he was feminist.

But just a reminder, to never trust dudes that wax lyrical about this stuff because they're probably saying it to coerce you into sex.",20284,ladies stay woke with these 'feminist' men on dates,0,1572162762.0,,,0

We’ve been together for approximately 3 years. When we first started dating, we would talk about a “five year plan” of dating before engagement and I always told him that either way, after 7 I would just break up with him the day after our 7 year anniversary if there wasn’t a ring on my favor. 

Maybe it’s unfair, but I was like 22 when we started dating and now I’m 25 and definitely ready for more commitment. We’re currently at the tail end of a deployment (he’s navy and been gone since April), and when he gets back he’ll be stationed elsewhere before we move to Austin in the summer.

We talk about buying a house together in Austin and that kind of thing, but I can’t reasonably give this man all the equity that comes with co-owning a home if he can’t commit. 

🤔  I think I’ve got the 6 months of no physical contact on my side, but I don’t want to manipulate him into proposing to me.

Just came across this sub recently and thought this would be a good place to ask for advice, as I really agree with some overall themes I’ve seen here such as setting the right expectations early and allowing the man to chase and win you over.

So I’ve never been in a scenario like this before, would love some input :) I (28F) met him (28M) about a week ago. He was here visiting, lives abroad and his plan is to move to my city eventually (next year or so). We had an incredible date together and have been keeping in touch. I’m certainly not putting all my eggs in this basket since a. he may not ever end up moving here and b. I’m not wanting to enter a relationship having it start as long distance but I definitely would like to keep in touch. We’ve made it clear we are both into each other and would like to stay in contact and he’s talked about coming back here at some point in the next few months too. 

What I’m not sure I’m digging is how the texting has been. We’ve been sending long multi part texts which started at once a day (as opposed to a quick back and forth. More email like) and I was into that but his responses have gotten slower. The last response from him was after two days, I responded the next day and now it’s been 2 days since that and nothing yet. That dynamic feels weird to me and I’m not sure how to handle it or if I am overthinking it. 

Now I know I can’t expect too much as we are not even dating and we don’t even live in the same town, but I don’t want to get myself in a situation where he won’t value me because he sees he can put in less and less and still keep my interest.

The term “Dating” isn’t widely used where I’m from and non-exclusivity is usually assumed but never discussed. This results in a lot of broken hearts and I’m not sure if it’s just how things are done here or if it’s the maturity of myself and the people around me. Anyhow, the result is, I find it difficult to bring up non-exclusivity (I have no issue discussing exclusivity when it comes to it) as a discussion to verbalise the assumption of non-exclusive. Is it okay to just assume the non-exclusivity, I generally don’t feel comfortable with just assuming non-exclusivity as I feel like I’m in a sense misleading them or just asking to hurt feelings. I also feel weird talking about it because of how strangely taboo the topic seems. 

• When should this be brought up? 

My biggest issue on timing this is that I consider the first time we meet as just that, meeting. I feel weird outlining exclusivity with someone I’m only meeting for the first time, and it’s not a date. I feel like laying ground rules out before agreeing to an actual date is weird too like “really enjoyed meeting you, we should go on a date together but btw you gotta agree to date me non-exclusively”. The more dates I have the more it feels like I’ve hidden some dark secret from them. It’s ridiculous and I know I’m overthinking this but I’d appreciate some guidance to getting this step down in a way that just flows with things and exudes the air of “of course this is how things are done, what did you expect? my full attention after 2seconds of knowing you, boy you gotta earn that, show me you’re worth my bothering” 



My rules and take on the strategy 
(discussions, advices, and opinions are welcome and appreciated):

- I’m planning on dating non-exclusively for at absolute minimum 6 months before I consider going exclusive with a guy. I’m primarily dating using OLD because my work/hobbies are all guys at least 5years younger than me which is too large a gap down at my current age. The nature of OLD means I’m starting from scratch in terms of knowing these guys and I need time to get to really know them before I’m going to commit anything to one. 


- The first time I meet any of them it’s just that, meeting them. It’s not a date, I will not go on a date with someone I haven’t met yet. This one’s pretty easy for me to communicate as I straight up say “sorry, I don’t date people I’ve not met yet but how about we do Y so we can meet?” anytime they mention the word date. 

- He will be immediately dropped if the date isn’t out doing something. Yes I game, no you do not get to then suggest gaming nights as our only date. (Netflix and chill included in this). 

- Sex: I’ve been a little quick of the mark in this department in the past I’ll admit but I’ve stopped that. My rule is no sex until we’re in an exclusive and committed relationship. (I do supposedly break this rule with one guy who I won’t date but is quite fun, but damn girls 6 months is a long ass time and that’s only if I meet the right dude too!)

- Phone calls and texting: you wanna talk to me? You can pick up the phone and call me. I am done with his millennial scared of the phone crap. I get a better sense of who you are and whether we connect or can even communicate through talking on the phone. It means I know whether you’re paying me attention or distracted by something else too. 
Rules on the phone:
      1. This is a conversation not a breathing contest. 
      2. I’m a busy B, lets keep it short and sweet so we’re both left wanting a little more. (There may also be a queue waiting).
      3. Txting is asynchronous communication. It does not require an immediate response and should not be used to hold such a conversation. Use it for plans and passing notes.  

- No more than four guys at a time. I’m too busy, three is ideal. I want another one? Pick one to drop first. 

- Don’t have two dates with the same guy in a row. I’m gunna get myself all excited and biased towards him and that’s not fair. I’m trying to find the guy who best fits me and my life, not just the last one I had tacos with. 

-Gut instinct goes. A red flag doesn’t have to mean he’s a terrible person, however, it always mean he’s the wrong one for me. Listen to it. 

I’m really curious to know how this compares to your personal approach/strategy/rules or if any of you have further advice or areas that are important which I may not have considered. I find it important to consider how I want to handle key aspects of dating ahead of time to ensure I’m making the decision rather than “the flow” making it for me.

This dim idiot finds everything amusing (simpleton), including receiving a nude whilst you just turned your back. He likes the forbidden fruit, drama, and gets a kick out of duping women to knock their esteem. This will follow often immediately after he feels he has you 'hooked' ...aka slept with him, bonded through Oxycontin, and started to catch feelings.

*Ask him where he was lastnight and he says 'with the boys' with a wide grin.....................RED FLAG*

* **Extremely fast texter**, you can make out he's switching between convo's very quickly as if he's bullshitting 4 diff Tinder girls on whatsapp....SIS!!! Its cos he is 
* **Snappy replies-** *'At my friends' 'yeh was good'* when you're used to something more elaborate &amp; him making more effort. He's dodging the topic, cos it puts him on the spot/makes him more guilty. Put him on the spot and think on your feet, probe deeper with a few specific questions relating to the alibi he throws u, does he stumble?
* **Lovebombing**\-seems TOO good to be true , flooding with compliments acting like he just saw jesus weeping through your pupils, too agreeable, seems too chivalrous for how attractive he is, too eager, too intense, too empathetic, too compatible. Your instincts usually flare up at this, but cos you fancy him, he's riled up the hormones and u secretly want it to be wrong you ignore it. Ask yourself, why there's a hint of doubt, and whether these types of men are common.
* **Won't ring you-** says he doesn't like talking on the phone, sticks to whatsapp voicenotes (less risky than a random call at your sidechicks), you don't have his instagram, he's a 'low key' guy (possible, but often BS). Basically, hes avoiding you finding his social media blueprint, from which you could monitor him/find more info.
* **Pics of kids on his phone-** could well be his niece, or his uncles wifes baby...but equally could mean he has a bunch of kids from his wreckless spermloading. Do not assume, try to probe when around his friends, look out for ANYTHING baby related around his house.
* **Overflated confidence**\-Something off about his machoism- he might have a deep voice, be 6ft2, be ripped or whatever else but there's something not quite convincing about his 'alpha act'......most likely his shit ton of emotional baggage and insecurities he's waiting to project on you through coercive behaviours. Basically his manly mature gentleman act is a farce. Chances are he's broke/not intelligent/in debt/mommys boy 
* **Controlling-**Mentions exclusivity quick- but only in relation to you. If you're v attractive/get a lot of attention particularly he will be concerned about this (they hate competition /idea of other men on your tail) and try to mate gate you/ambush you away from potential interests as early as poss. If its too soon/he hasn't demonstrated commitment, don't fall for this trap (1-3 months he could be a blocked contact)
* **Makes you paranoid-** Deliberately baits you, gives you ambiguous replies to straight forward questions, whilst grinning, hiding phone in an obvious hidden manner as if he wants you to THINK he's getting it in like that (even tho he's probably grafting his ass off or its his gran)....generally you're getting a vibe he's tryna rub something in your face. Fuckboys will do this sometimes when they want to be cowards/ kick you off the roster too, make it obv they're up to no good, so you will blow up and cut them off.
* **Blows hot and cold**\- classic fuckboy tactic, but effective, aimed to disorientate you, make you second guess yourself (worth/boundaries/approach/attractiveness) and get you on your tippy toes tryna claw back his attention. Often leaves u feeling like you just got spat out of a hurricane on the highway *'how did I get here?'.* Also could be sign he's lost interest, unfocused or got bored of the chase",15493,common redflags in f*ckboys,0,1570696456.0,,,0

I'm 21 and in one of my classes in university there's this really hot guy. He's like 6'5, muscular/fit, tattoos, dresses well, takes care of himself and he's extremely smart. I noticed his looks from the get go because every girl in the class was basically staring at him, but what I noticed more was his confidence when answering our professor's questions and his ability to form an opinion which something a lot of young guys lack. He always respectfully shares his opinion and gives others a chance to speak and when our prof asks an obscure question he always knows the right answer. He's pretty funny too (for a guy anyways, I don't find men too be funny tbh) and we were in a group project together and we spoke a bit and I really do think he's a high value male. Even though we're young its important to me that the guy I'm dating isn't broke and can take care of me to a degree, and I sense that he has some money (parents probably) because he drives a new mercedes and lives downtown by himself in a condo. 

I wouldn't say I have feelings in him as I have been training myself to not fall for a guy like this, and its working. But I def am interested in getting to know him more, he's a really kind guy and drove me home one night after we were at school working late on our project and opened the door of his car for me. I want to go on a date with him so bad to test him, let him pick the place, see how he treats wait staff, make sure he has no prob with picking up the bill etc. 

I think he does like me because I catch him glancing at me in class and we talk in class a fair bit.

My questions are: do you ladies think he's a HVM? I know he's a bit younger and not in like ""real life"" but does he fit the criteria? He's studying finance by the way.

I was never once bossed around and never even got into a single argument with the guy. I also met a man who'd give me $1k per date (again, even without anything physical) who also never disrespected me in any way. Both of these men were great friends who I enjoyed being with. I'm not mentioning these things to brag or to make this about sugar-babying, just demonstrating that I know what I'm talking about when it comes to showcasing myself as a woman to be treasured. I've used these strategies in my normal dating life as well.

I'd say I'm a Stacy, but I'm not model-tier. There are plenty more attractive women out there, especially when it comes to sugar-babying. So why did these men choose to lavish things on me over the perfect 10/10 women?

\*\*Your personality and interests are the most important things. \*\*

I know this sounds cliche, but hear me out. 

Of course, yes, looking good can matter. Pinkpilled ladies know what I mean, so I won't get into that here. But even if you look good, you still need to be interesting. This is what gives me the edge against the 10/10s -- knowing how to ""market"" myself. Your hobbies and goals matter \*immensely\* in attracting the right kind of man for you. Talk about that degree you're working toward, or that garden you put your heart into. It shows that you're not desperate to find happiness through a man and that you're a fully fleshed out, multi-dimensional woman....not just a replaceable piece of ass. If the men I dated only liked me for my appearance, I would have been replaced in a heartbeat instead of pampered like a queen for years. You need to find men who want to help you succeed in your goals, and talking about what you're most passionate about is the way to do it. Don't fake it. 

The type of man this attracts should ideally love hearing about your heartfelt passions \*even if he doesn't necessarily share them\*. This should be made apparent in any initial conversation you have. Any man who starts out focusing on your looks should be ignored. If you have a fully fleshed out and interesting profile, talking to some moid who can only come up with your appearance as a conversation-starter is absolutely not worth it.

Personality includes being kind and compassionate. Finding something you enjoy volunteering in won't just make you attractive, it'll increase your own personal happiness and sense of satisfaction with your life. Finding a man who also volunteers either his time or money is a great way to know if they enjoy helping others (and by extension, you).

I know talking about yourself can be difficulty for many people, but you don't need to say what your personality \*is\*. Instead, talking about the hobbies, values, or causes that you are the most passionate about will allow your personality to shine through. Show, don't tell.

Because all sorts of misogynistic tropes, scammers, being short blah blah blah and etc. It’s really not uncommon for them to post their complaints on their OLD profiles. “The womens is mean”  sums up men’s reasons for being single.

Rarely do you see men discussing what they do wrong (except for the superficial). They aren’t asking for advice on social skills, managing expectations, how to find mutual attraction and deciding what type of relationship works for their personality/lifestyle. Dating advice for men does not focus on practical advice on relationship creation. It’s basically game theory.


So men just whine and swipe. Basically everyone in their real life knows their career, sports team, hobbies, politics and that they are single because women are mean. They have receipts from online dating fails to prove it’s the women not them.

Anecdotally, I’ve met way too many who say they have low expectations for OLD. So then, what’s the point? They admit they rarely get a first date, a second date is basically a miracle and  they aren’t getting one off sex. But there they are, often for months if not years with OLD active profiles.

OLD failure is a man merit badge to prove they’re not “gay” or undesirable. They’re just another Nice Guy™️ victimized by women. 

I really believe that all the men I met (hundreds) had wanted to date me or anyone else they would act completely different. Especially since most already possessed the exact same social skill set that made them successful in other areas of their lives that are applicable to success in dating. 

For example I have met many men who in their careers have all sorts of stakeholders that they have to engage with- clients, bosses, co-workers, underlings and the general public. They  know the rudiments of socially acceptable behavior but refuse to apply it in their dating lives.  They understand “yes”, “no” and how to return a phone call- they know how to start, build and sustain relationships. 

So basically I am left with Occam’s Razor- that the simplest explanation is true: men who fail at OLD simply do not want to date.",36275,OLD men who whine about no dates don’t really want to date.,0,,,,1

1) May not understand that the woman is the prize in heterosexual dating and therefore thinks the act of picking is a male prerogative. 

2) Is hateful, hostile, competitive, spiteful or defensive to other women. 

3) Someone who is under the impression that you need another relationship to get over an old relationship - That’s called monkey bar dating and signals a fear of being alone with yourself. It’s okay to take time to yourself to do anything BUT date. Believe it or not that is a dating strategy. 

4) A pick me *can be* someone who multi-dates, **ranking** the people she dates - Having a hierarchy of people you’re dating is not Queen shit. If there is ever a good enough reason to create a pile/rank/pyramid of the guys you’re dating, you’re holding onto deadweight....Who is at the bottom and why is he there at all? 

4) Can’t be friends with admirable women, and instead gravitates to an insecure group of friends.

5) Someone who is consumed with dating and puts her entire worth in the status of “dating”- there is so much more to life. If you find you are constantly dating, or have never not been “seeing” other people, then you might want to take some time and think why. Dating/men even if you’re dating 4 guys, should still only take up 3 hours of a working day MAX (that’s assuming you’re awake for 16 hours). You should spend time with friends and family, invest in your career/livelihood, spend time on your hobby, physical exercise, and have some time doing absolutely nothing. 

6) Someone who dates without her own goals in mind - do you want a serious or casual relationship? There is no right answer, but don’t settle for something which is not what you want. 




“Pick me” isn’t: 

1) Someone who exercises empathy for the men they date whether or not they choose to continue the relationship. Emotional maturity is being able to draw boundaries **despite**feelings, NOT someone who pretends feelings don’t exist and draws boundaries on that basis. 

2) Someone who falls in love or misses their ex- let’s not forget love is an emotion. You don’t have to be with everyone you have feelings for. You can have love and compassion for someone and still walk away. You’re not a “pick me” simply for experiencing unrequited love or or experiencing not having your needs met. It’s all part of the compatibility journey - as long as you learn to walk away in good time, and you don’t linger in a sour/non-beneficial situation. 

3) Someone who chooses not to actively date because they’re still working through past trauma - I think just as a general principle all people (women and men) should still act with honestly integrity and emotional responsibility. If you’re an absolute mess, sometimes its actually better for you (and the person you end up dating) if you don’t date at all.

4) Someone who may have Male friends - you can still keep Male acquaintances and Male friends with the wisdom and appreciation of their male tendencies. Male-female relationships are possibly one of the few way #Maledepravity might ever be corrected. It’s a perfect position to observe and challenge these behaviours, and you could help another girl out. 


6) Someone who is okay with casual relationships or multi dating - Especially for the under 25s on this sub, it is important to remember that (depending on culture) we probably aren’t dating to marry just yet. We’re dating to gain experiences, have good consensual sex, and feel emotions. In this case the overarching standard you need for yourself is “does this improve my life and make me happy?”. It’s a surprisingly easy question to answer when you look at it that way. 


7) Someone who decides not to commit to someone who wanted to commit to her - in fact this is the opposite of a pick me. You don’t have to take every opportunity that’s thrown at you. Choosing not to be in a relationship does not mean that you must be insecure and need to find ways to “level up”. Maybe a busy job, school, and personal projects is what you’d prefer to commit to at a certain point in time, and that’s completely fine. In fact there is no better investment. 

8) Someone who admits that they’re at a low point - so many factors in life besides effort and self esteem can make your life hit a low point. Sometimes setbacks are beyond your control and simply being in a bad state does not mean that you are lazy or unworthy (as long as you keep your life goals in sight). 


9) Someone who considers that they may be the common factor in their dating failures - committing character assassination on all of your exes is a great way to justify moving on, but a sure way to guarantee you won’t move up. It’s not an effective means of resolution and actually it’s a narcissistic tactic commonly used by depraved makes (“she’s crazy”). You may not have been the villain in the relationship, but your judgement may have been at fault, and that’s something to consider.

Some of these guys are nice but lack a lot of the confidence and personality I‘d like in a relationship, and personally it feels as though they’re only interested in me because I found my own confidence. Some of them have been *very* persistent but thankfully I’ve been able to kindly reject them and move along. 

That being said, I’m getting tired of attracting the wrong kind of person.

I keep seeing women struggle to move on from past partners because the feelings are holding us back. Many of us have had to force ourselves to walk away from destructive relationships that weren't good for us but can't seem to let go of residual feelings for these men and thinking about them. Even after we've moved on, our mind still sometimes wonders about that old flame. Maybe we're stalking him on social media(s), maybe we're still obsessing over him and thinking about him constantly. Maybe it's been a day, a week, a year, or a decade of this happening. I'm going to be very honest. I still think about my one ex because he was the love of my life. I had to walk away because he turned into a violent man, seemingly overnight, and began threatening me. I left him for good but I still think about him sometimes. I'd say that my feelings went from being 150% invested and addicted/obsessed with him to about 30% still invested/addicted/obsessed with him. It's fading and I wanted to start a thread where women discuss the things they did  to help them get over their feelings for a toxic man, effectively, and for good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what is working for me: 

1. **Notice Other men** \- seriously. Sometimes we're so loyal and focused on one dude that we don't even LOOK at other men romantically or with lust. This makes our feelings for the man grow since he's the only one we're looking at, and the center of our universe. Make a conscious effort to start to check out other dudes, especially the hot ones. Try and develop a crush on someone else, lol. This will help you keep your mind distracted and break that ""he's the only one I have eyes for"" mindset. It will lower your desire to obsess and ruminate on your ex. 
2. **Date other men** \- After a breakup, it really helped me to straight up date other men. It helped me see that there were plenty of ""good attractive guys"" out there, and helped me feel less lonely and less desperate. It also helped me see that other men are interested in me and want to date me. You can never have too many ""good morning beautiful"" texts at a time when you might be feeling low or sad. You don't even have to go out with them if you don't want to. Simply messaging and chatting with other men who tell you you're beautiful and compliment you will lift your spirits and distract you from ruminating on your ex. If you do go out with other men, you'll have to shower, do your hair, do your makeup and invest in your outfit and get out of your house, and this is an amazingly effective way to lift your spirits. 
3. **Have a social life** \- Seriously. Make an effort to out with your friends and hang out with your family. If you don't feel like going out, invite your friends to come and chill with you at your house and binge watch Netflix or something. Simply being around others will help lift your spirits. Having all this support around you will help you feel loved, supported, and will lower feelings of loneliness. It'll also force you to get up, shower, do your hair/makeup and motivate you to get out and see the world around you. This will help lift you out of a fog and will help put a dent in you ruminating on your ex.
4. **Do those things which make you happy** \- Sometimes what we miss isn't the ex, it's everything we did when we were with them. Make sure you don't cut yourself off from those fun things you used to do with your ex because this will make you feel sad. Do those activities you used to enjoy. If you used to binge netflix together, binge netflix with someone else. If you used to game together, then do that with a friend or with another man. Don't cut yourself off from those fun activities just because your ex is no longer with you. You'll realize that when you're doing all those things you used to do with your ex, that you didn't necessarily always miss him, you sometimes missed doing that fun stuff and having fun doing those specific activities you enjoyed. 
5. **GO. TO. THERAPY** \- I am going to drill this into everyone's heads. You've GOT to take care of your mental health and stay on top of your emotional and psychological needs. Toxic thinking patterns and negative, self-defeating beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors can be modified with persistence, diligence, and skilled guidance from a competent mental health professional. This will help you feel better and it's worked wonders for me. What was particularly helpful was Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). What I did was go to therapy, and my therapist recommended this book ""Feeling good: The new mood therapy"" by Dr. David Burns. I downloaded it as an audiobook and listened to it over and over and over again until the messages stuck. I was persistent and did the written exercises, and brought them with me to therapy to discuss with my therapist. Eventually the messages clicked and I ended up downloading Dr. Burns' other books ""When panic attacks"" and ""Feeling Good together. THERAPY WORKS. I feel so much happier and more put together today than I did a year ago when I left my toxic ex and I don't want him back and will NEVER want him back. I've also learned to develop self-esteem on my own and derive my confidence from an internal locus of control. I'm eating healthier, sleeping better, and thinking more clearly as a result and I CANNOT recommend therapy enough. Please go!

Every time I get asked out I turn the guy down even when I’m interested. I just didn’t feel like dating since I’m so used to being single and can’t deal with clingy men. I like my alone time and I like personal space haha. 

This year I kinda wanted to go out and give these dudes a chance and open myself up. Well I figured some things out..... first of all most of them stop talking to you after they figure out you don’t only want to have sex with them. A guy I know asked me out and he literally just wanted to chill in his car? I mostly get asked out for a drink which is ok but chill in a car or ‘nEtFliX ‘N chiLL’ are you serious?????? Haha 

I don’t connect with most of them, it’s like they don’t have common sense. I hear quite a lot from most men that I’m smart and funny but honestly I want to date someone that’s smarter than me and almost every guy I met seems to have no communication skills or barely any good character traits or common sense. I’m just tired being the funny one and entertaining them like I’m a clown. 

Oh yeah and I sometimes feel like I’m ‘the guy’ if that makes sense??? Why is it that I have to pick the guy up with MY car and text HIM if he gets home safe hahahahaha???? Help him figure out everything and take care of him like he’s a kid????? And most of them are super emotional.  I like how most men talk about how emotional we females are but wooooow men are so sensitive! 

And honestly, there’s been a moment this week where I literally cried alone in my car at night in a random parking lot while drinking coffee cause I literally thought for a second that there was something wrong with me. 

I’m tired of hearing ‘you’re different’ ‘you’re so special never met a girl like you before’ bla bla heard it too much. I even got told by two diff guys that they would marry a girl like me. They just tell you what you want to hear and make you feel special and then they fuck up and apologize and try to fix it and make you feel special again so you fall in his trap and aaaaaaaa you know the cycle.

anyways that was my experience so far. Wasted my time. 🤡

Two years ago we’ve met again after time no seeing eachother. We’ve started having sex, and everything was very couple-sy, he was acting like my bf. I was in love. 

Then W told me he didn’t want anything serious/that he didn’t love me as a gf. AND HERE’S MY MISTAKE. I kept seeing him and being with him and I think my stupid self was thinking “if I can’t have his love at least I can have his dick). 

I was feeling miserable so I started seeing (a lot of) other guys, and it helped me get over him because this way he wasn’t “special” anymore. It felt good, seeing a lot of men but not caring about any of them.

Now W is acting differently, and he even told me that he doesn’t feel special anymore because I’m with a lot of
men, and that we’re like a open couple. But at the same time I don’t really think he loves me. 

And now I think that I never actually got over him, and that deep inside me I’m still waiting for the day he loves me.

Women earn less than men already. This issue gets more pronounced as we grow older and men are promoted while we remain stagnant. My dad started as a receptionist at Chevy and retired as the corporate head in our state. I bet the woman he started with is still a receptionist.

Here I'm sharing three observations from one of my favorite chapters, but I highly advise all the queens here to read the book in its entirety and absorb its wisdom. Stay safe, stay happy :-) 

&amp;nbsp;

# Dumb Like a Fox

 The **Dumb Fox Credo** as outlined here, allows for smooth sailing and no room for conflict:

* Agree with everything.
* Explain nothing.
* Then do what is best for you. It will make life a whole lot easier.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Dumb Fox Is a Clever Negotiator**


 The dumb fox doesn’t give up power, she simply creates the appearance that she does. And this very much helps her positioning power because she gets what she wants.


Here’s a classic example. A woman I know named Michelle told me about a man she’s seeing. On the second date, he asked her if she’d drive to his place. She was put on the spot and then pulled a dumb fox move. She ignored the request and very sweetly asked, “Would you prefer to get together another night? If tonight is inconvenient, I do understand.”


Michelle averted the question completely. She didn’t act upset or tell him what to do. She simply gave him a couple of alternatives, one of which is that she may not participate. Then she let him choose.


The beauty is that the dumb fox is agreeable, tactful, and always polite, so he thinks he’s in control (even though he isn’t). Even though the dumb fox appears oblivious, she is very aware. 

It’s no different than a successful business negotiation:

1. She doesn’t spell out where she’s coming from.
2. She’s prepared to walk away, if the terms aren’t favorable to her.

The dumb fox does both, without words. She negotiates with her willingness (or lack thereof) to participate. If the offer sounds good, she says, “I’d love to.” If the offer doesn’t sound good, she answers, “I’d love to, but I’m pooped.” She responds favorably when he behaves like a gentleman and backs off in a subtle way if his manners fall short.

The dumb fox doesn’t spell things out. The nice girl, on the other hand, makes the mistake of wearing her heart on her sleeve almost all the time. As one man named Paul said, “Women talk too much. If she’s upset, she’ll go on and on. I’d rather get into a ring with Mike Tyson for six rounds than hear a woman repeat herself over and over.”

Think about the last time a man spilled his guts. At first it feels like “bonding.” But the novelty wears off very quickly. Men want bonding, sure—below the waist.

The two-hour phone calls you love are a big mistake. He likes it the first time because he knows you’re interested. After that, he hates it. Don’t let conversations on the phone last too long. Don’t let yourself be perceived as a tiresome obligation. Keep the phone calls short and sweet—and he’ll never get tired of calling.


&amp;nbsp;


**The Dumb Fox Is More Mysterious**

The dumb fox knows that familiarity breeds contempt, so she doesn’t spill her guts on the first couple of dates. She lets the “cream rise to the top” without rushing things.


When you first meet a man, don’t overcompensate by doing all the talking. Don’t talk constantly out of nervousness. Keeping cool and quiet will give you more appeal, not to mention the ability to wield more power.


I was once on a date with a man I had just met. He began to share all the sordid details of his last relationship. I had no desire to listen, but I didn’t criticize him or make him feel “wrong.” I was polite. I simply asked, “So John, what’s your workload like at the office this week?”
    

The dumb fox does not ask, “May we change the subject?” Permission isn’t necessary.


The dumb fox also doesn’t tell him about her past relationships. You’re “a prize,” and you don’t have a long list of calamities to report. He doesn’t need to know that your ex-husband stole your appliances, is defaulting on his child support, and has a Mafioso brother who is doing time for racketeering. If he’s classy, he won’t be impressed that your last boyfriend is “still stalking you and can’t let go.”


If he asks about your ex, you say, “We went our separate ways.” Here’s another option: “We wanted different things.” The dumb fox relies on a “vague generality” when he asks for information that’s none of his business.


As far as what you disclose? Don’t volunteer bad information about yourself. He doesn’t need to know that you’re insecure about your thighs or that you haven’t been on a date in 7.2 months. Inquiring minds do not need to know.


Men automatically assume that, if you’re interested, you’ll do anything to “nail him down.” He immediately thinks you want “exclusivity”; you want to break open the hope chest and have babies with him. It’s important for him to think you’re different: You are relaxed, secure, and happy with him or without him. This is known as the happy-go-lucky formula:

&amp;nbsp;

When you are always **HAPPY**;


And he is always free to **GO**;

**The Dumb Fox Is True to Herself**

The fox is the smaller animal, and in the animal kingdom, the smaller animal is the prey. Therefore, the fox knows it is incumbent on her to look out for her own best interests, especially in the beginning of a relationship. On the other hand, the nice girl believes everything she’s told because it sounds good, which puts her out there to get hurt. The fox knows that, in the beginning, a man is likely to “flower up” his intentions; therefore, she must stay alert.


&amp;nbsp;

 

| WHAT HE WON'T SAY   | WHAT HE WILL SAY    | 
|:-----------|:------------|
| “I want sex and only sex, with no strings attached.” | “I’m interested in having a long term relationship!” |  
| “Give me sex, and I’ll pretend to be your boyfriend for a week.”  | “Trust me.” |   
| “Hey can I rotate you with three other women, like a pitching staff?”       | “You are so different.” |
|  “Wanna be the flavor of the month?”       | “I am so tired of the dating scene.” |


&amp;nbsp;

Trivia question: Which guy scores more women: the guy who “flowers up” his intentions, or the guy who tells it like it is? The point is, if he has a hidden agenda the last thing he’ll do is spell it out for her. So it’s up to the fox to figure things out on her own.


&amp;nbsp;


The reason the dumb fox doesn’t reveal what she observes is that he’ll show his true colors much more quickly when he doesn’t realize he is being watched. When a man talks about himself or past relationships, he may do so as a way of helping her “get to know him.” Rather than getting into heavy question-and-answer sessions, the fox keeps the conversation light. Why? The truest things are said in jest. He’ll tell you everything you need to know in passing conversation, with a joke or an off-the-cuff remark here and there. If he’s a wolf dressed up as a sheep, his whiskers will inevitably pop out.


When the dumb fox senses something’s “just not right” with a man’s character, she does not bring it to his attention. The only conversation the dumb fox has is between her two ears. As President Lyndon B. Johnson said, “You’ve got to know when to keep your mouth shut.”


When you tell someone who may be manipulating you what you observe, he will immediately try to talk you out of it. He’ll say, “You’re insecure” or “You’re prejudging me.” Are you prejudging him? You had better be. The only mistake is letting him know it.


&amp;nbsp;


The dumb fox is self reliant. She judges people by her own experiences. The dumb fox takes better care of herself and makes better choices because she lets time elapse and she watches to see how the man behaves. She trusts her observations and she trusts her animal instincts.


No hunted animal gives the “benefit of the doubt.” The fox senses danger and hightails it out of there. Never be around a person who has shown you he is a hurtful person. If he does this by accident, that’s one thing. But if he’s hurtful on purpose? Game over. You’ve learned everything you need to know.


In the beginning, have fun and go out… but keep your cards close to your vest. Most important, take your time. This will not only make you smart as a fox, it will help you keep your independence.


The nice girl loses an important protective mechanism when she assumes that life is fair, or that Prince Charming will always protect her. The smart fox is not governed by wishful thinking or the hope of a fantasy outcome, like Cinderella. Despite appearances, she trusts herself to watch her own back instead of giving a man the responsibility of doing it for her.


&amp;nbsp;



It’s what every animal in the wild does to survive, so that they don’t become “din din.” Above all, the smart fox understands—and adheres to—the first law of nature: Every animal for herself.",36214,The Dumb Fox Credo,0,,,,1

Like sure, be as manipulative as you want to have the short term fun. Free meals, sure. You can even return that coach purse or those sexy Valentino's he bought you to Nordstrom's for **cash**. The monetary value of all that BS is laughable though. I make more in two months now all grown up, than what I ""scored"" back then in my fun r/stupidslutsclub days (I'm embarrassed to say I kept a log.)

Or like sure, be as calculating as you want to find a guy that makes double/triple/quadruple what your guy next door makes. Meet a match though selective search, but don't bang him, make friends with him and his social connections (you don't want the guy that had to pay 10k+ to land a woman).  Check employee numbers, see if the guy is pre IPO or not.  Take a peek at his Mint stuff if he leaves his account open (maybe he wants you to see?)

But the kind of guy you want to land, do you want him to be dumb enough to fall for ""tips and tricks for playing men""?  The guys that you want are smart and tough enough to see through BS.  Successful men either want playthings or partners (think Melania vs Michelle, and more power to either one of those lovely ladies) what are you trying to build?

This is like, old school social climbing stuff. Maybe it's not what you're looking for, but the emphasis on generosity was low key gold digging and if that's what you're going for you're doing it wrong. Really **you don't have to lie and cheat**. Just have high standards and always come proper.

Men absolutely do commit heinous, manipulative acts against women- this is a sad truth. However, the way in which people in this sub- manipulating men to spend money on them and then leaving- serves only to stoke the flames of sexism. 

Many people on this sub appear to see the world in an entirely black and white lense, believing that all men are egotistical animals and thus women deserve to manipulate them out of their money. 

This is an extremely damaging, stunted way of viewing the world. I assume this comes from being hurt by a male sometime in the past, and is a way for women to cope. Even so, I hope everyone in this sub can eventually see that decent men do exist, and that love is not dead.

The argument that the people on here are female incels is not that this sub is full of women who can’t have sex, but that this sub is full of women who are just as emotionally inept and shallow as a male incel. This sub is in essence a vain attempt to fight fire with fire, effectively prolonging the abusive actions that come from both sides- man or woman.

No, I'm not a man pretending to be a woman as some post suggested lol and no I'm not trying to inflame. I agree with this sub 10000000% which is why I'm coming here for help.

The situation:

My friend (promise I'm asking for a friend, I'm married so all good) has been with her boyfriend for over 5 years and they live together. While I like him a lot, I think my friend can do a looooot better. They don't have combined finances and split things like household expenses, take turns paying for dinner but I've heard him nickel and dime her a few times. This is where I find the imbalance: the amount of emotional labor she gets put through compared to the financial support he provides. Hell, I'll say lack of financial support! She cooks, has to nag him to clean and do chores. She has to tell him HOW to do the chores once she's nagged enough and he decides to do them.

At the beginning of the relationship, they slept together pretty quickly. She's mentioned in passing how he's not generous in the bedroom therefore she's not too generous back. There's no engagement in the horizon....although they both talk about getting married. She doesn't have a job at the moment due to unfortunate circumstances yet she is expected to still contribute as if she still had her job AND contribute even more with house work!

I know other people's relationships are none of my business and I'm not planning on stirring shit. That's why I need help on how to advice her. What would you tell a friend that was in this situation? Telling her ""you're dating a manchild"" is out of the question.

I'm 27f and new to this subreddit, but I'm really enjoying reading through it and I think this is definitely the philosophy to dating I've been trying to adopt. When I chase a guy, despite what others encourage me to do, it NEVER ends well and I really am working on adopting the philosophy that if a guy is interested, he will pursue me.  I've been taking a dating hiatus for a while to find my own activities and work on my self esteem since I realize I've like rude, shitty men hurt me and really damage my self-esteem when I was the one who was in the right and they were just selfish assholes who were too shallow to appreciate me.  

There's this guy I've developed interest in - I'm in my last year of med school, and he's in his first year of internship (training after med school). We met during my 4 week rotation in the hospital where he works. We were on different services but had a lot of free time so he'd often come sit by me, talk to me, hang out, offer to help me with something I was learning, etc, and treated me like a colleague. He's a friendly, nice person but this was different than how he treated the other students. He then was on a different, very busy service the next two weeks I was there but he'd still stop by to chat with me, and on my last day we were in a room around a group of people but he came over and told me he'd miss me.

We didn't have each other's contact info or anything, so I figured I'd just add him on facebook a few days after I left to see if anything happened. i did that on Tuesday night. He accepted and was initiating messaging and conversation with me right away, sending me cute pictures, bringing up questions to keep the conversation going, etc. We kept talking intermittently - him initiating - through about Thursday evening, then we were just sending gifs back and forth so I stopped answering. Then he messaged me another pic on Saturday morning and we talked a little after that then I sent the last message - not requiring a reply - that was the end to that convo on Saturday morning.

I'm just getting anxious which I hate that I'm doing, so I'm going to have to get back into my usual hobbies and routine; I'll be traveling for interviews this upcoming week which will help.  But I'm just feeling kind of ehhhh since I was super hopeful when he was messaging me so much, and now I haven't really heard from him all weekend. I thought he would ask me out, but now I'm wondering if he just thinks we're friends or is nervous or lost interest or something and I have to admit I feel disappointed.  I'm planning on letting him initiate anything if he's going to, but I'm not feeling great about this. Does anyone have any advice for this situation in line with FDS philosophy?

I went back to school (currently in grad school) to build some confidence and self-worth as I felt like I was failing professionally (although my sister thinks I never was, I’m a financial analyst at an investment firm). 

As soon as I start dating, I realize that my efforts have been futile; I get attached extremely fast and when it ends, it is pretty much a devastating situation. 

(Long story, short: I met 32M on Hinge, he “love-bombed” me at first, like couldn’t believe his luck type love-bombing, every compliment in the book, mentally and physically. However, he was recently divorced with two kids and I knew he might have issues. It was a dirty divorce and he has primary custody of 12y adopted and 1-year old biological child. 

I was aware of the baggage, I was. First date, I was still myself I didn’t care much even though I did like him. We got intimate way too fast (third date, I have a problem giving in because I want it) and then his efforts tapered off. He stopped texting much, definitely stopped calling or calling back, we got in weird ego fights and got back together often. I wanted him to communicate with me more and I told him, he just acted super busy. Finally, he stopped making an effort to see me. That was the end for me. Seeing each other was all I had because we never fought in person, everything was always perfect. He stopped making an effort to see me on the weekends, only 2 hours during a weeknight when I came over after his children were asleep. I felt like a booty call and felt like I wasn’t worth any effort or time anymore. So, when he canceled plans last Friday, I expressed my feelings that I’m upset and blocked him (He blocked me before and broke up with me over really dumb fights). idk what he ever said or responded or if he even tried to contact me... this all in a span of 2-3 months. AND I AM ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED. I unblocked him 2 days later but didn't text him although I want to text him so bad and its eating me alive that he doesn't try to contact me.)

How long do I need to consistently work on myself before it is implanted inside me that I’m worth way more than the way he's treating me? 

My sister’s advice:

""You work on yourself with the hopes of finding the perfect man. you need to work on yourself not giving a fuck about that or marriage"" This, I find impossible. It indoctrinated inside of me that I need to get married and being 27 and single feels unacceptable.

Did I help my partner with cleaning his place? Did I cook, or help with some other chore? Did I sacrifice doing something I wanted to do in order to do something for or with him? Then I think about what I've gotten in return. Has he cooked for me or helped me with my cleaning? Has he done an activity with me that I wanted to do? More often than not, I've found myself putting in more than I've received. 

This is why I don't really date anymore. As a single person, all my time and energy is for me - not for an ungrateful partner. In the last three years, I've traveled to six countries by myself, learned some Japanese, formed some amazing new friendships that include activities at least once a week, learned to cook many new dishes for myself, been diagnosed with and started treating two chronic conditions, made strides at work, and learned a lot about computer science/programming. I don't think much of this would've been possible with a relationship to distract me. 

Ladies, I urge you to start checking in about what you're getting back from a man, if you're not already. Otherwise you risk years and decades of your life going down the drain as you prioritize him over yourself. Also, have your own goals for yourself and set aside some time each week to work on them without giving a thought to your partner. I guarantee that's what he's doing.",27530,Always ask what you're getting in return for your investment,0,1572311823.0,,,1

We’re both involved in a fairly niche sport and it’s a smallish community. Everyone pretty much knows everyone or at least knows *of* everyone. A few of our mutual friends had been commenting on how physically similar we were, and were shocked we hadn’t met yet. Eventually one of our friends threw a party and invited us both so we could meet. 

“Be careful hanging out with her,” said a guy (Scott) I was dating at the time, “she’s completely nuts.”

When I met her, it really was like looking in a mirror. We could have passed for fraternal twins. Despite that, we most definitely did not hit it off right away. My first thought when getting to know her was “I am *nothing* like this girl!” And I wasn’t. Being honest, I was a total pick-me-ass-bitch. I saw the way Ali treated the men she was seeing and was a bit horrified. “Won’t someone think of the poor men?!” wondered a younger, dumber me. What I didn’t realize was that she was just unapologetic in putting herself first. She refused to shrink herself or seem demure. She made her own plans first and if her date happened fit into them, so be it. When a fuckboy was acting up, she called them on it - loudly and in front of as many people as possible. Weak men absolutely *hate* all that shit. 

Those men who couldn’t handle her often confided in me after: “Your friend is psycho. You’re so chill. I don’t know why you hang out with her.” While I still thought those men were garbage, I’m ashamed to admit at the time I took that sort of comment as a compliment. I want to slap the girl that I was. Dear god - why did I care what trash men thought of me?

Despite what some guys said about her, she never had any difficulty finding men falling all over themselves to date her. That “crazy” girl was getting taken on exotic vacations, wined and dined, and bought Hermès and Cartier jewelry left, right, and center. 

Meanwhile, I was getting jack shit. I got just as much male *attention* as she did, but none of the guys who approached me actually seemed to want to treat me like a person. Ali, meanwhile, was getting flat out spoiled. I was happy for her, but it definitely stung. I was so confused as to what made men want to value her while they treated me horribly. I put every ounce of myself into dating. I was open, honest, and upfront always. Men told me how “different” I was from other women (lol) and how lucky they were to have me, how “easy” it was to be with me. I never complained when boyfriends blew off plans with me without so much as a heads up text. I never got angry when I was up late waiting. I didn’t bitch about being excluded multiple times every week so they could hang out with “the boys.” It was the same pattern with almost every single man I dated. Yet, after a few months I would always find myself buying the majority dinners, cooking everything, and cleaning up afterwards as well without so much as a thank you or even a fucking orgasm. 

One night, Ali and I went out to a club and ran into Scott, who was parked on a couch and sucking face with the clearly underaged girl on his lap. He never even saw me. Ali grabbed me by the hand, pulled me aside where no one would see me cry, and said “You know, Scott’s younger brother admitted that he’s really into you.” So the next week I fucked Scott’s more attractive, more successful, extremely well-endowed brother. 

More importantly, I promised myself I’d never be that pick-me, doormat girl ever again. Ali and I have been inseparable ever since. I owe it all to my “crazy bitch.”",27428,"A Love Letter to the ""Crazy"" Women",0,1572310911.0,,,1

Let me tell you where putting this into practice costs MORE than the actual date! 

Hair extensions: $300 + for the hair alone 
Installation costs $120 

For synthetic one time hair is about $30 but can rack up if done consistently. 

GOOD quality makeup and brushes cost $50 for foundation, liner and everything else can easily slip into $100, lets not even mention the cost PER BRUSH

These are all quarterly expenses so lets say the initial payment is $600 to be safe. 

Now, look at your wardrobe... do you want to be sexy or go in work clothes? 
Each outfit including accessories can cost $100+

Nails cost $60 for mani/ pedi, a coffin set costs $65 depending on acrylic or SNS. 

Eyelashes!!! $16 per strip, or $80 per individual installation! 


This is all cosmetic. If you want the date to go well you will need to be fully decompressed and that could mean having smoke or wine to calm you down or a meditation/ yoga class... this can cost about $40+ 


Now BEFORE the date you have spent about $X00.00 to sit in front of a man in a tee shirt. 

Do you think I'm being over the top? I've dated all star athletes and this is the bare minimum, with them. 
 




How to Never EVER Pay on a Date

Hi ladies.

This sub is in unanimous agreement that as women, we should never EVER have to pay on a date, and we should let the man take on that role. I've been dating for 4-5 years now pretty consistently, and I've had plenty of free meals and drinks since then.

# Choose the Right Target

I'm a Becky (6-7) in my early-20s and I can get guys my age (25-28) who are my looksmatch to buy me free drinks and meals pretty consistently on dates at mid-high-end places. If I want to experience fine dining (a bill that costs like $200+), I date older men (30+) because they can afford it. I can pretty much get free meals every day if I wanted to and if I schedule correctly.

You need to choose men who have a good white collar jobs or they have their own business. I typically date men in the tech or finance field. They have the income to spend money on a date compared to a man who doesn't make much.

# Be High Value

A key part to making this work is to look as good as you can. I wear a dress to all of my dates, heels, and I put on makeup. I rarely wear pants unless we do a physical activity. You need to emphasize the difference between you and your date: that you are a woman and he is a man. Wear earrings and put on a sexy perfume!

Be a good listener and a good conversationalist. Be interested in them as a person, ask questions, speak softly and in a girly voice, laugh softly, and don't interrupt them. You need to be fun to be around with so that they think that they won't ever think of making you pay the bill because they had a bad time. Even if you feel like the connection isn't there, still be nice to them and treat them well.",27214,"A huge hole in the ""never pay for a date"" theory",0,1572308703.0,,,1

I just want to get this out in the open right away, so I can prove a point. To add to this, we are now engaged! Here's some advice:

1. Don't make then man pay for everything. That's the b**** hoe mindset. My ex's (whom I really liked for about a year or so) went broke and couldn't afford to even go on walks in the park with me anymore because *surprise* he spent all his money. A great way to go is to go 50/50 on everything. And for you that didn't even pass high school and cannot divide, pay for every other date. Hell, if you pay and plan every other you might pay less. Just don't cheap out and me a little hoe who's only about money. The key is a great EXPERIENCE every time, got great AMOUNT OF MONEY spent. Wake up. You're in the 21st century.

2. Sex is great. But operate on your own beliefs. We're both Christian's, so we haven't yet. That's all the advice I have. Oh, and don't be submissive to guys at bars. Unless you want some I guess 🤷

3. Share and develop interests. My now fiancee (♥️) STILL plays video games. As of now, that habit has grown on me too. Video games are great ladies. Give them a go. He and I currently enjoy playing Destiny 2 the most. Little does he know what I got him for his birthday... Girls check this one out! --&gt; r/stadia

4. I guys the last piece of advice is more of a concept to grasp. Know that your worth isn't just monetary value, time spent is also a very valuable currency. I remember one date we just ordered a pizza and watched movies all day on the couch. It's still one of my favorites.


In conclusion, know that its both you and your man in it together. It takes 2 to fight, and 2 to love. Good luck ladies!",27006,Long term stratagy,0,1572306338.0,,,1

Why is money so important to you? I mean don't you value respect, love, giving you freedom, understanding and mental growth more than financial advantages?

Like wouldn't you prefer a poor man that really loves you as you are, supports you in anything you do, is there when you need him and totally loyal to you over a rich man who sees you as a pretty trophy? Don't you have any sense for self-worth? 

I know I'm generalizing now, but most men who earn a lot of money or who were born rich are way more self-centered and have a negative attutude towards women and live the patriachal lifestyle. So why is it so important that the man can add something to your finacial Situation? Don't you realize you're supporting the partiachal view by living up to these standards ?

To me it seems very ironical, that you value your feminine strengt and independency, but then change your personality and you're behaviour just to make men like you, even if you don't like themy, just to get them to pay for your meal (referring to the other post about getting a man into playing for the date every time). Don't you see that you are bowing to men by acting this way ? Seems like a double moral and very confusing to me.

#Nurture

[Nurture 1](https://i.imgur.com/XC4rwAl.jpg)

[Nurture 2](https://i.imgur.com/wyrdRn5.jpg)

**Abuse**

Relating to a child with a kind of “I'm annoyed by your existence, and your needs are a burden to me, so knock it off” attitude. Emotional, physical, psychological abuse. Leads to the child concluding they are bad. “Don't bother wanting anything, you won't get it”. Complex PTSD.

**Conditional Care**

The adult puts their wants over the child's needs. The child learns they must pre-pay their way into a relationship, earn love, earn their keep. ""You can't just exist and be loved"". Codependence. Fawning.

**Assertive Care**

Helpful, responsive and appropriate. Comforting, loving and freely given. A proper use of parental power for the best interests of the child. Also seen between adults when one is incapacitated. “Stay there, don't get up, I'll get your hot water bottle”.

**Supportive Care**

Recognizes the child's needs and asks what they would prefer. Lets them know they have choices and it's ok to ask for help, or decide if they even need help.

**Overindulgence**

Helicopter or lawnmower parents. Smooth all the obstacles. Make life easier. Has the effect of the child never gaining that vital internal curiosity to explore, learn, grow, make mistakes, or pride in overcoming obstacles and challenges. Severely stunts the child. Often seen on relationship subs regarding men who “try something once then seems to forget it, I show him how to do it and he never does it”. Manipulates to play the victim. M.O. Is 'inexperienced boyfriend, you'll have to show me how” puppy dog woe is me. Misidentified as lazy, selfish or narcissistic. But they're lacking the internal toolbox for learning.

**Neglect**

Again with the “urgh you're a burden”. Emotional neglect is insidious and often overlooked. You may think you had a great childhood because you had a house, food, clothes, toys and you weren't beaten or yelled at. But your parents frequently ignored you or told you to “stop whining”. Chronic lack of compassion, validation or acknowledgement of your emotional needs. Never talked you through your feelings, said it was ok to be angry or sad, never let you cry until you were done, or soothe yourself when you were angry. Leads to being unable to name your emotions, emotional dysregulation and inability to self-soothe.

#Structure

[Structure 1](https://i.imgur.com/EuQJRAC.jpg)

[Structure 2](https://i.imgur.com/2SPKTXX.jpg)

**Rigidity**

Fear based parenting. Overly Authoritarian. The parent is too lazy to set proper boundaries, so instils fear in order to get the child to suppress, censor and control themselves. Leads to defiance, rebellion, or overly fearful of authorities.

**Criticism**

Shame based parenting. Again to get the child to suppress themselves. Leads to being really good at problem solving, but never asking for help. More Complex PTSD

**Non-Negotiable Rules**

Reasonable boundaries for the child's welfare and so that they grow into a competent and law-abiding adult.

**Negotiable Rules**

Teaches children that there are two perspectives and two people in a negotiation. Compromise and win win. Empathy and thoughtfulness.

**Marshmallow**

Freedom without responsibility or consequences. Permission to be irresponsible and then ""My Dad's a lawyer"". No internal guilt or shame is instilled. Turns into a defective person, as seen in the books “Character Defect” and “In Sheep's Clothing”.

**Abandonment**

Drugs, alcohol, jail, depression, deadbeat dads. No-one cares about you kid. Guess how you turn out with parents like that..

------

The end of the book has steps for re-parenting yourself, if you've figured out which stage your parents failed you at.

It's not our job to re-parent men. If he's been abused, neglected, overindulged or abandoned, NOT YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM. You're busy doing the work on yourself and your own children. You're not signing up for another one. Once you detect a man is defective or overindulged, block and delete. They cannot be ""fixed up with the love of a good woman"".

Correct parenting creates healthy adults with strong internal discipline (appropriate levels of guilt, shame and a conscience), motivation, curiosity, routine and habits. Strong external boundaries when relating to others. Strong desire to obey the law, be pro-social and altruistic, without being selfless to their detriment.

So I've come out of a realtionship like a couple of months ago and since then been back on the dating scene. Men generally never seem to be attracted to dating me or taking me seriously.


I was speaking with this guy who I met from a dating app who I was actually interested in; long story short we went on a date, it went well and we still spoke after and I thought we had a connection. We arranged a second date then shortly cancelled on me due to an ""injury"" then ghosted my messages despite being active on social media. I deleted his snapchat then re-added him on snap after a couple of days. Asked him why he cancelled then he told me he had an injury and how he ""couldn't breathe"", asked me why I didn't believe him and I said I wasn't sure as he never even apologised, so then he apologised for cancelling.


He then avoided my messages and pretty much ghosted me completely after this. I think my theory might be that I might had been a little full on with him and sometimes messaging him first, which pushed him away, right? who knows. I even sent him provactive photos in the past. Maybe I was too easy? Maybe He sensed that I am an insecure girl?

Nevertheless it makes me feel extremely shit and unworthy of relationships. Why do I get treated so poorly by men?


Sometimes the wrath of my bdd kicks in, but then I remind myself  I get told I am attractive all the time (even got told by other women that I look like a model) I pretty much hit the gym all the time and have a fit body, have good ambitions and hobbies and been told i'm fun to be around.

 BS has known about affair for over 7 months now but a couple weeks ago she found out about the one night stand I never confessed about. She said she always had a feeling of how far it went but finding out finally gave her confirmation. Now she feels the need to want to ""do her own thing."" I see this as retaliatory but she argues that she needs to do this for herself. I understand that but I'm also thinking of what could happen after and I don't think she is thinking that far. We've progressed so well for the most part and I can't help but feel like after she does the deed that she will just see me as weak and lose compete respect for me and our relationship. I feel like maybe an evening-out of the playing field could put us on the same page but I'm also very afraid of losing her in the process. What if she likes it and wants more? I told her I don't want to know about anything until after and if it happens but I would rather it happen sooner than later rather than sit here wondering.

I've just been bouncing around all over since then, man. And I question myself--like, what is wrong with my brain? I am so full of rage. I look up people from the past who have wronged me and fantasize about making them feel as bad as I do. And, oddly enough, I am actually starting to like who I am lately--like, I am smart, I am funny. I never thought I'd see myself as smart.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a copy of the post: 

"" **Husband confessed to cheating after mental breakdown and walking out of home** 

&amp;#x200B;

 tl:dr: Husband disappeared from work and home without telling anyone after a mental breakdown, then he finally confessed at the hospital that he was cheating on me with a coworker the past 4 months.

Warning: this is going to be a long post. I found out about the cheating in the most dramatic way, and I'm at a loss on how to move on and I just need to talk.

About three weeks ago, I got a call from the police on my way home from work. It turned out that my husband's boss contacted them to do a welfare check on him as he had disappeared from work in the middle of the day and failed to show up for a meeting that afternoon. They were unable to find him at home as well. Long story short, I eventually managed to track him down using a feature of his phone, and found out that he was at a hotel in Quebec. Local police was alerted and they brought him to a hospital in Quebec. Me and his parents flew to Quebec the next morning to go to the hospital to see him. When we got to the hospital, we realized that he was not verbally speaking to anybody. He was sending me and his parents text messages to ask for simple demands like food or his computer, but apart from that, he did not speak a work to anyone. Eventually he managed to speak to a doctor at the hospital about what happened verbally in private, as they required him to speak in order to release him, and he really hated that hospital. And tbh I don't blame him, it was a horrible experience, no one checked on him the entire time he was there, and he was never able to speak to a psychiatrist like promised.

Anyway we finally managed to bring him home after a week and admitted him at a mental hospital locally. This was supposed to be the best mental hospital in the country. But unfortunately, it was Columbus weekend, so he was there for three days before he was able to speak to a psychiatrist. He made it very clear to me that he would not be able to verbally talk to me at all until he had spoken to a psychiatrist first. So when he finally spoke to a psychiatrist a week and a half after he walked out, he started to speak to me about simple errands like bringing him clothes/books/dinner verbally. I was relieved at first, but then I was still worried since he was still not telling me why he had a mental breakdown.

We also had a busy schedule coming up: we had a gathering planned with some friends that weekend, and he was scheduled to go on another work trip to Europe (he actually just returned from a work trip from Europe 2 days before he walked out...), and we also had a big trip planned to go to another country for a friend's wedding at the end of the year. He seemed to want to follow through with all these plans: he booked all the tickets for the wedding trip while he was still not speaking to me in Quebec, and he also got a tickets for a show in Europe for when he would be there in November. And I suggested to him that this might not give him much time to recover, maybe we could at least skip the gathering with friends, but he insisted that he would like to go. Meanwhile, I felt I was on the verge of breaking down myself, I didn't know what was wrong and I was scared that I did something horrible and I might accidentally trigger him without knowing. Finally, he decided that he could tell his dad what happened, so his dad went to the hospital alone one day to see him and he told him what happened. But I was still in the dark, and somehow his dad knowing while I still didn't know made it way worse. I felt like we were strangers and not a team anymore, since I was being let in to help.

Eventually I raised my concerns with him, and he said that his social worker/doctor had been pressing him to do a 'family session' during which he would tell me what happened. So I went to the hospital and sure enough, he confessed to me that he was cheating on me for 4 months. In a way I was grateful that this happened with his social worker and nurse present, I felt their presence reassuring in a way. If I were to find out alone with him, I didn't know how I would have reacted. Still I felt like the world crashed on me, I never thought he would cheat on me.

The other woman is based in the European office. My husband takes a trip to Europe about every 1.5 - 2 months. She is in her mid Thirties and just got married in September (we are both in our late twenties, but married for 6 years, we married young...I'll talk about that later in the post) The way the affair started was also a little sickening: We went on a trip in Europe together in March, and he brought me to the European office for a brief visit during the trip. And this woman was one of the people I met that day. She told my husband that she thought she was way prettier than me when she met me, so she decided to sleep with my husband and make him leave me. And of course, she finally made her move 3 months later. She bought him drinks one night after work when other people left, and got him very drunk. Then she started making out with him and he didn't resist...It's ironic because she did not leave any impression on me. I did not think about her until he told me that he cheated on he with her. And all I remember is a short woman in her thirties to forties with bright red lipstick. I know this is very shallow, but part of the emotional roller coaster I have been on after finding out is to do with my self-esteem. I would tell myself one day that I know for sure that I'm way better than her, and he was stupid. And doubt myself the next day that maybe I'm not as good as I think I am, and that's why he never resisted her advances.

Anyway my husband kept seeing her every time he would go to Europe for work. He claimed that they would meet up in the hotel room for sex for a few times while he was there, and it would usually start with her asking him if he wanted to see her that night, and he would always say yes. Then she got married in early September, and they saw each other again on his last business trip which was in late September/early October. After he flew back home, she texted him that she wanted to break it off. And then he created a fake email under my name, and sent her husband an email telling him about the affair while pretending to be me. She found out, so she started sending messages to the fake email address thinking it was me, and also started sending him angry messages too. And apparently she also called my husband with her own husband on the phone, since her husband wanted proof that the affair was real, and she was hoping my husband would lie for her. But of course he didn't. I found out about this later in the hospital. I knew nothing about it that weekend. When he came home that weekend, I noticed that he looked exhausted and really unkempt. I asked him if he were ok, but he said he's fine, just jet lagged and overworked. So I did not want to press it further to allow him to recover. Then on Monday, she was still sending him angry messages on work slack, and he also had a big important meeting with a client coming up on Wednesday, so he decided that he couldn't take it anymore and he walked out. His boss called the police after noticing he's missing and the other woman forwarded an email that he sent to her pretending to be me. Apparently in this message, he wrote while pretending to be me that this woman ruined his life and now he wanted to kill himself. I asked him if he really wanted to kill himself, he said no. He only wrote that to piss off that woman, but who knows...

My husband also says that this affair was strictly sexual. He said he only kept seeing her because of the sexual attention he was getting. He insisted that he did not have feelings for her or wanted to be with her. But when he told me at the hospital that day, I asked him if he still had lingering feelings for her, and he was just crying and couldn't answer. That made me really doubt that there was no feeling. And last night I decided to check his slack, and I saw that suspiciously all his chat history with her are from that Monday when he disappeared. There was no chat messages from earlier even though they have been coworkers for a year now. Anyway, I saw that she quoted one of the messages he sent earlier in one of her chats, and I saw that he wrote: I just think we could have made each other very happy. And she replied and said no we can't, I don't even love you. I asked him about this, and he said he doesn't remember, and he insisted again that there was no feelings, and he probably said that about sex, and he was annoyed that I was angry over this with no context. Since that message was a quoted message, I could not see the conversation when he said that. I find it hard to accept that explanation.

I have to say that things were not going too smooth between us since late last year. Late last year I was in a job that I did not like due to a toxic boss and limited career opportunities at the small company I was working at. I eventually decided to switch job and started a new company this summer. But while this was going on, I was very busy with my own work and job search. I did not pay as much attention to him. And his work is also always very busy. So we were putting less and less effort in the relationship. And to add on to that, we have always had some communication issues. My husband has the tendency of stonewalling people when he is extremely upset. When he is angry or upset with me, he would simply refuse to talk to me. And eventually when he felt a little better, he would start texting me, and then talk to me. This has been extremely upsetting for me since I want him to just tell me what is going on. I have spoken to him in the past about this issue, but we did not take this seriously enough. And it of course backfired now. From talking to his family, I realized that this behavior started when he was a teenager.

He also has trouble with intimacy sometimes. He has always been uncomfortable bringing up anything sex related, even to me. And the reason why he said he cheated was because the sex was better. I have to agree with him that our sex was terrible. But that was because we stopped putting in effort, and I always felt this distance from him. We married in our early twenties after college. When we first met, I wasn't sure if I wanted to be with him. I had to admit that I was an asshole back then. I thought he was sweet and nice but also not as attractive/cool as my past boyfriends, and I gave him shit about this the first month we were together. He, on the other hand, did not have much experience with girls. He was shy and a little nerdy. And I think he had self esteem issues when he was with me. I wish I could go back time and not be such an asshole, but I was young and shallow, I will always regret that. I fell in love with him the more time we spent together and I stopped being a jerk to him.

But as time goes on, he started to become more of a jerk to me sometimes. He had trouble with expressing affection sometimes. And this honestly is partly my fault...but he stopped wanting to kiss me at some point in our relationship. None of us could remember exactly when this started. But I think this happened when I would tease him and ask him to kiss me in public, and he would feel really shy and refuse to do that. And I found his shyness amusing at the time, so I would keep asking him to kiss me and he would refuse. And somehow that got stuck. Again, another thing I would not do if I had the foresight.

Another thing he would be mean sometimes is my appearance. Occasionally my skin would get a breakout on my face, he would always come over and point at me and say Huge breakout. I tried to brush it off since I know he's just teasing, I have to say it still made me feel like shit. I have always been a very skinny person. But earlier this year, I gained a little weight. And whenever I was changing in our bedroom, he would come over and pinch my waist and say chunky. Mind you, I was never that big, at my heaviest I was 130 lb for a 5 feet 6 inches tall person, and I have since lost 10 lbs. But this had a serious effect on my self esteem. I'm always on a diet and I got to all kinds of fitness classes, and I still feel fat. I know I'm not rationally, but it's something I can't shake off. It's funny because he's actually on the bigger side. I tried to ask him to start being a bit more active and eat healthier in the past, but I stopped doing that after we had a fight late last year. After that fight, he had a talk with me and told me that it hurts his self esteem when me and his family point out that he needs to lose weight. So I stopped bringing up his weight. And the last year, he has been particularly bad, and I think subconsciously he lost some sex appeal to me. This didn't help since we were already not putting effort into our relationship.

Last weekend he bought me makeup and perfume. He said it's because I used to wear makeup when we first met, and makeup reminded him of the good ole days. And the other woman wore a lot of makeup, and he said he subconsciously liked that because of that too. And he wanted me to wear perfume because he wanted to have a scent that always reminds him of me. But I'm not really convinced, he admitted that the other woman wore a lot of perfume, but he said this scent is totally different from hers. And that he's not trying to turn me into her or anything....

We started seeing a marriage counselor last week, and we are actually going to one later today. But I'm not even sure what I want to do anymore. I wanted to save my marriage at first, we do have good times together. But I can't get over the fact that he cheated on me like this. He has shown a lot of remorse since we talked to each other that Friday at the hospital. But it concerns me that he admitted that he still couldn't see things clearly until he spoke to me. I don't want to always have to point out the obvious to him. And I don't understand how his judgement was still so clouded after having had sessions with his psychiatrist at the hospital. And the last thing is, I feel our relationship is never the same after it's shattered like this. You know how a glass will always show cracks after it's glued back from shattered pieces? I feel like that's us right now. And I don't know if I want this.

How ordinary men can turn to soliciting sex from minors when they hit the wall, &amp; obviously is very scary to think about considering children. 

Way back when Dateline NBC's *To Catch a Predator* hosted by Chris Hansen was on the air - was a show about sting operations where men are caught trying to solicit sex from minors online. What's disturbing is how many men actually fell for these sting &amp; travel often, HOURS and across state lines to go to a home where they expect a 12, 13, 14, 15 year old girl to be home alone. 

Mind you, these are very ordinary men - mechanics, middle school teachers, etc. And are often not previously on any sex offender registry. These men are often fathers, Rabbis, Or teachers that teach children the same age as the decoy they go to have sex with - I remember watching one where the guy was **newly married.** 

TRP seemed to explain away men being attracted to younger women - but are grossly offended and are quick to dismiss these men as being deranged and out of the ordinary.

As an example, if a man you are with is talking about how hot other girls are in front of you and bragging about how they are checking him out, you might want to rationalize and make excuses for him, but if you consider that you wouldn't be okay seeing someone do that to your friend, nor would you ever try to say similar things to your man knowing that it could make him insecure, you can deduce from his actions that he is not being respectful, and therefore is not someone you can respect as your man.

I see women switching from partner to partner feeling unsatisfied and directionless, or bear unhappy relationships. emale dating strategy itsn't only to land the perfect man for you, but to be **happy** and to be in a good relationship,with yourself first.


You don't HAVE to date. Is having a partner with lots of means *absolutely* necessary? Riches aren't gonna make you happy, but stability sure helps... It might take time to be stable by yourself, but you're gonna feel so proud of yourself no?

I, personally, have the dream to have a small home, either a apartment in a city or a cottage deep into the woods. To be discontented, to have no stress whatsoever, surrounded by cats there and there in a eccentric decor suited to my taste, all that is my hope. 

Some might ask ""But you won't be able to pay that for yourself?"" I'm conscious of that, but I'll bulid that slowly, over the years, decades if necessary. All my own work, my own money  put into this thing called home to me. 


Having someone to depend on sounds like a nightmare, thinking that some day I might lose everything because of this one person. Instead, I would prefer someone that would add to my self-made happiness instead of being a fundamental part of it. 

Meanwhile I'll stay alone, since I know I'm unstable, in a economic sense, but I don't give up on my hope. And this is my DATING strategy.

I'm terrified of being lied to, of committing myself to a man who's deceiving me in some way, such as cheating on me or just not that into me and stringing me along. With that in mind, I find it hard to give anyone a chance.

But I DO miss dating, and I would like to try having a relationship again. My question is, how in the world do you stay sane? What do you tell yourself to make yourself keep trying? Even for the men I actually meet up with I tend to just ghost them later or we are mutually uninterested in continuing.

I've recently become the victim of a man who employed redpill strategies on me, at a very vulnerable time in my life (post divorce). He posed as a very warm and caring friend, concerned about my well being during the whole time of separation through divorce. I was very confused when later on he treated me very badly (only wanting to hang out, making sure I knew he was seeing other people). I only saw him a couple of times but it was enough to see that he had no respect for me and just wanted a situation where he could use me. 

The ex was my first and only relationship that lasted 14 years. I still have so much to unpack from that one but I basically lived the life of a pick me penelope to a very low value man.

I'm looking at all the posts and comments and my eyes have been opened. Thank you ladies. I've been seriously at a loss as to why men treated me badly when I gave so much of my self. This all explains it. They don't respect you if you don't start respecting yourself. Nobody ever really arms women with this knowledge. I come from a very traditional asian culture, a very male dominated ""please the man"" culture, women are viewed as a second class citizen. 

Needless to say it's been a process.

But one of the things I am going through right now is going through mistakes. Having these regrets. 'I should've' or 'I never should've' 'I can't believe I was so stupid to do that.' And I find myself lying awake thinking of these past situations. I'm trying to pull myself out of it but all I can do is beat myself up and feel anger at these shitty men.

The amount of men that have done verbal gymnastics to try and get me to have sex when I either haven't wanted to, wasn't in the mood, or wasn't in the mood *for them* is fucking mindblowing. Back before I had a backbone, I was occasionally convinced and always, always, always regretted it.

Please, for the love of god, if you are not 100% fully on board, don't have sex with him.

Don't have sex to keep him interested.

Don't have sex to be polite. 

Don't have sex to get attention.

Don't have sex out of pity or guilt.

Don't have sex because you feel like you should.

Don't have sex because he says he loves you or sees a future with you if he hasn't actually proven this with actions.

Most men would never debase themselves to have sex with someone they weren't attracted to out of some misguided effort to be polite or help some woman's ego, and neither should you. And sex is almost always completely for the man's benefit, as most are selfish and don't care if you get off if they don't care about you. And if he's pressuring you sis, he doesn't give a fuck about you and will be a bad lay regardless.

Learn from my mistake: I once hooked up with a guy because I felt bad for him. We matched on OLD, he seemed nice enough but gave me some sob story about how he's lonely and just wanted to ""cuddle"". I let him come over and he immediately started pressuring me for more. I didn't have tough skin at the time and have always been a people pleaser, so I went farther than I wanted to. Afterword, he blocked me on the OLD and text. It was humiliating and hurtful, and I was angry at him but I was more angry at myself because I didn't respect myself enough to stick up for me and stand by my own boundaries and advocate for my own comfort. This isn't my proudest moment and I'm embarrassed to share it, but honestly I have other personal stories of coercion and actual rape from men who didn't care about my boundaries, comfort or safety as I'm sure most of us do.

""No."" is a complete sentence. Don't have sex until you want to, and not until he's proven himself worthy.

I know I will get banned but I don’t post on Reddit anyway.  She wants me to show you ladies that there are some men who do wish to improve and respect you. 

It’s great there is a community like this to help women gain confidence and value.  Kindness isn’t popular enough regardless of gender.  Due to this sub, she has grown and free herself from a lot of toxicity.  A place where people truly understand her and her struggles. 

But it’s not just her, this sub has actually help me out. Ever since she told me about it I’ve been reading it daily.  Trying to learn as much as I can.  Trying to better myself and our relationship. 

I’ve mess up several times in our relationship and truly wish I had known about this place.  I could of gain rich insight instead I got my insight from other dating subs or forums that have only damage our relationship.  

Don’t know all the jargon or terms what I can share is what I’ve learn from this sub and the dating advice I’ve used that was extremely harmful. 

 I’m an early 30s guy who has been single for the last 8 years.  Only one gf and a handful of dates.  Here is the kicker I’m attractive and I’ve always wanted a long term relationship.  Guess it helps to mention I’m a nerd.  

Before Reddit I would sign up to some PUA (pickup artist) email list.  That’s how I learn to date.  Thinking there was something wrong with me , as a guy I naturally try to fix the problem.  A lot of these PUA teach guys how to walk up and talk to women. I’ve always found strong women sexy but many men are intimidated by it. 

PUA preaches using these strategies to find love while getting laid in the process of finding it.  PUA didn’t teach me to lead women on because I’ve been lead on and refuse to do that to anyone.  It did teach me to treat women not like individuals but a generalization.  

As a result I came off with douchebag tendencies mix in with my tendencies to be chivalrous.  I’m sure it was super confusing for anyone  I’ve dated.  Was told things like I needed to become this overly outgoing and expressive guy.   Because women love romance they love communication.  

That’s not a lie but it is a lie if it’s fake romantic gestures and there is such a thing as over communication.   The goal wasn’t to get to know a women but to win her over.   That was a major mistake for me and it has done lots of damage to my relationship. You can’t fully love someone until you take time to get to know them. 

Which leads me to the next thing Respect and respecting boundaries.  Various dating advice i read and learn never spoke about these types of things.  They preach touching a women to gage her comfort,  limiting the number of text and effort I put in order to show her I’m busy and have value.  That I’m a great catch by ignoring her.  Aka people want what they can’t have. 

Let’s talk about “No” because this has been problems for me in the past.  Tho I have manage to purge this by gaining new perspective from her and insight from this Sub. Not only did the last two women I dated were into heavy controlling stuff.  The dating advice I receive told me  a man has to be persistent.  If a women tells you she isn’t interested if you keep trying it can sway her.  Not taking about rape but I’m talking about what is consider harassment. 

Here is my dilemma as a guy.  I was pretending to be someone I’m not. That got me dates however it never got me love. The one thing I wanted.  

What did FDS do for me? It’s only been 2 weeks since I’ve started reading the posts here.   It open up my eyes to the daily struggles a female goes thru.  The problems the women I’m in love with has told me about.  How guys see you as just a hole with a pretty face.  Before this sub I didn’t even know about shit test and power struggles. 

I’m pretty dense at times and thought as a guy you have to prove your worth.  So you pay for dates you show her interest.  This whole I’m entitle to sex just because I got you dinner.  Like it’s shocking to me people think that’s enough. Yet at the same time I know almost every single women on here has exp something like this. 

Let’s get back to the topic of “No” , yesterday I read the Compliance Test post.   How women have been socialize  or thru violent men to give “soft no”.  Then how most men hear “No” and they start to negotiate.  I have done this I was taught this.  I’ve seen this in movies,  I’m not even talking about guys movies but romance movies. 

The Notebook for example and  a lot of romance movies has the guy being persistent and not taking No for an answer.  As a guy who wanted a gf , I saw this and thought that women wanted this.  It’s so romantic it’s so chivalrous but that was ignorant of me. In fact that’s how a person can quickly get a restraining order put on them. 

Then there’s the physical and emotional abuse you may go thru.  To know that you could face verbal and possibly physically harm for rejecting a guy.  That’s scary stuff and it all makes sense why you have to be on your guard.  

The women I’m in love with has dealt with absolutely horrible men.  I’m talking about men I would literally shove in moving traffic horrible.  She’s told me a lot about her past. But then I see what struggles and stories you ladies have been thru.  It helps me truly understand her frustrations and why her heart is so guarded.  She doesn’t even fully trust me as a result.  

Not all men are toxic some have mental health issues but damn there’s sure a lot of them.  I don’t know about the whole alpha and beta stuff but I do know there are strong men and then there weak men.  A strong man isn’t afraid to admit when he is wrong.   He is constantly trying to improve for he does not know everything. He doesn’t look to control a women, he wants a partnership with her.  A relationship is about growth not dragging someone down. 


I’m not a feminist or Pro anything outside of being Pro fairness and not being taken advantage of.   As a man I understand how violent we can be.  If you look at all the crimes happening today it’s generally males.  Rapist are usually men. Mass shootings, serial killers, pedos, kidnappers,  terrorist.  A gay man gets assaulted I’ve never once heard a women did it. 

Women are doing better overall in terms of education and slowly taking over the workforce in higher positions.   Especially with the internet women are rising up and gaining freedom and equality never before seen. 

What am I doing about my relationship?  Seeing things from her perspective,  taking time to understand and listen.  Learning how to communicate,  how to deal with arguments.   Because of her she taught me how to love and what it really means to love. Showing my love by giving her what few men ever have.  Respect, trust, patience and unconditional love.   We aren’t official , she even dates other people and that always breaks my heart.  However she isn’t my property nor have I ever view her as such. It’s up to me to show her I’m worth her risking her heart.   I’ll gladly take on that challenge every day.

For me to have an attractive boyfriend seemed like fantasy. I certainly didn’t think I deserved one anyway...
But I gave tinder a chance. I just turned 18 and never been with a man before. On my Tinder profile I had photos of myself with filters that made my face more beautiful and feminine. 
I felt fake, but I didn’t take Tinder seriously so it didn’t bother me.
On my first date ever, I really tried to look the best. I put on makeup the best way I can, styled my hair and put on the most beautiful clothes I had. Looking in the mirror, I think it was the first time I felt confident about my looks. I was thinking that I am going on my first date with a good looking guy that seems very nice and I “look good”.
Our first date was great, better than I ever expected it to be. 
We met for a second time but this time I wore normal clothes and had makeup on.
On the third date, I had no makeup at all and wore the daily clothes I wear. He didn’t seem like he was disgusted with my looks as I thought he would be. The way he looked at me was the same as he did in the first date. 
And when we became officially a couple, he kept looking at me like I was so gorgeous and good looking until we broke up. He described me as a 8/10...
Looking back on this relationship, im still surprised that I managed to have a man like him as boyfriend. He was at least 7/10 naturally while I was below average...
I think there had been some factors into this.
First, he didn’t have high standards. He said personality matters more.
Secondly, my Tinder pictures were great and I think I looked good on the first date. First impression is so crucial. And he liked my personality of course. Because our first date was so great, he already had a good impression of me. The second date was also great. I’m pretty sure we had already crushed on each other on the third date, which was why he was still attracted to me. I think being in love/crushing makes you think the person is more beautiful than they actually are.
So the key for getting ‘hot guys’ to like you (if you have high standards while youre below average) is to get them to crush on you and trying to look the best as you can until you’re comfortable being around them with no makeup.
At that time, I didn’t even think about all of those things. I just said, whatever happens happens. If he doesn’t like how I look like then fine. That is why i was confident on our dates which he liked.",30965,"How I, below average looking woman, got an above average man",0,1572542504.0,,,1

I have since grown up and I’m engaged to be married to a wonderful man who treats me like the absolute queen that I am.

Three years ago I matched with this guy George on tinder. We got to chatting and found out we worked in the same hospital. I was a med-surg nurse and he was a pediatric resident so it was unlikely that we would have ever crossed paths naturally because he worked with children and I worked with adults. It was sooo great to meet someone who was handsome, educated, and had a good career.

I played by “The Rules”... I never texted/called first, I never initiated dates, I never paid on said dates, I didn’t talk too much, and I didn’t hang out with him too much so that I could leave him wanting more. It was kind of easy to do because in addition to nursing, I also worked as a bartender on the weekends for extra money, and I hung out with my girlfriends. I was busy. This man wasn’t my whole life. 

An important detail worth mentioning is that we were both from the same country and we had the same values and understood the culture. However, I was a US citizen and George was not. He was in the US on a resident physician visa. 

Anyway, so my family loved George and my father treated him like a son. He would take me out to fancy dinners and clubs and pay for everything. He would take me shopping in NYC and would spoil me with gifts (gifts that I *never* asked for, he would just buy me stuff). But then I got too comfortable and slowly started breaking the rules. He gave me a key to his apartment and on my days off, I would hang out there, clean, cook, and do his laundry and dishes. I felt like it was the least I could do to help because he was working 14hr days and he spoiled me so much. I spent the night there a few times a week. I knew I was breaking the rules, and for a second I thought that I should pull back and stop hanging around too much or else it will bite me in the ass. But then he found out he was chosen for a fellowship in Miami starting in July and he asked me to move there with him. I was ecstatic. Then he asked to take me to our country for Christmas so that I could meet his family. I thought, wow, this is it. This is the man I’m going to marry.

We went and that’s when I realized that George’s father was a really big deal in our country. He was a highly revered military doctor and they lived in a mansion in the nicest neighborhood of the city center. They drove nice cars. His mom was a stay at home wife. We spent a couple nights with his parents, and then we stayed in their second vacation home by ourselves after that. 

But everything changed for the worse while we were there. He was always demanding that we hang out with all his friends, classmates, and cousins, but he never wanted to hang out with my cousins, saying that *he* paid for the trip so we were going to do whatever *he* wanted. I figured we came all this way and we were going to be there for three weeks, we could spare ONE night to have dinner with my cousins so they could meet him. He made me cry multiple times. We fought half the time we were there. I forced him to have dinner with my cousins, and afterwards he told me they were annoying and that he didn’t want to hang out with them again. When we went to stay at a hotel in the mountains, he asked me to pay for it because “he forgot his credit card.” So my dumb ass paid because I didn’t want to be stranded in the cold mountains with no place to go. I should have dumped him when we got back, but I was so blinded by love, I stuck around.

One night, we were talking about previous relationships and I mentioned that I used to date another resident a year prior, but it didn’t work out because he was afraid of commitment and he was a surgeon and always on call and the timing just wasn’t right. Then George said “You used to date another resident? Wow. Are you doctor shopping?” I broke down into tears because he was insinuating that I was a gold-digger. I told him that I met my ex at my bartending job and that he was my customer and that I had no idea he was even a doctor until our first date. It wasn’t like I was fishing for doctors. Even when I matched with George on tinder, I had no idea he was a doctor because he didn’t list that in his bio. I swiped right purely because of looks. I called him an asshole and left. The next day he showed up with expensive jewelry as an apology and admitted that he was an asshole for what he said. So I stayed with him, even though I should have ended it.

Soon after, George told me how stressed out he was because his residency was ending in June and he wasn’t sure how he was going to be able to afford living in Miami. He told me he was having money problems. When I asked him how he was able to afford all the fancy restaurants, clubs, and shopping, he said **his dad gave him an allowance every month.** His dad also paid his rent every month too, and even bought him the Lexus he was driving around. So basically he was broke. Residents don’t make a lot of money. He was making under $40k/year, and he resented me because I was making double that as a nurse, plus an extra $1000 on the weekends I would bartend. He would say degrading things like “I’m a doctor. I should be making more money than you. You’re just a bartender,” basically minimizing all the hard work I do as a nurse, just because my side hustle was bartending. 

At this point, he was also getting on my nerves because he was pressuring me do things that made me uncomfortable sexually. He was always begging me to do anal and sometimes he would try to slip it in “accidentally.” Then when we were working at the hospital on the same days, he would try to get me to fuck him in the on-call resident room on my lunch break, which terrified me because it was just a bunch of twin-sized cots in an open room and the door didn’t lock. Anyone could have walked in and I could have been fired. Sometimes when he was working overnight, he would call me and say “come to the residents room, no one is here right now.” I never did it for fear of being caught, but it was still humiliating. 

Then he started demanding that I pay for everything since I made more money. I was stupid and agreed to it. In addition to all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry I was already doing, I started paying every time we would go out. His friends came from Europe to visit us, so he asked me to leave and stay with my parents during that time so that his friends could sleep in our bedroom and he would sleep on the couch in the living room. I figured, okay, that’s fine. Four people in a one bedroom apartment sharing one bathroom would be really tight. So I was happy to go back to my own room and bathroom at my parents’ house. But then he told me to give my key back to give to his visitors so that they could come and go as they pleased. I reluctantly gave George my key back. 

While his friends were here, we went to NYC so they could do touristy things. George wanted to go to a nightclub, but there was an $80 cover charge to get in. He asked me to pay for it, but I said no. He said “why not? You can afford it.” I said “I know I can, but it’s not my choice to come here. We can go to another club that doesn’t have a cover. It also was not my choice to go to this expensive French restaurant or to stay in a hotel that costs $450/night. That’s on you. You know you’re short on money, so why would you choose to do expensive things?” We fought about that in the middle of the street until his friends offered to pay for his cover charge. I went back to the hotel room without him and cried. I never got the apartment key back, even after his friends went back to Europe. George kept saying “he lost it somewhere in the apartment and couldn’t find it.”Major red flag. 

The whole time my parents were saying to be patient and wait it out, that everything would get better and George wouldn’t be so stressed out when we moved and he was making more money. But I was truly depressed and unhappy. And just as I was going to bring myself to break up with him, George suggested we look for a new apartment in Miami, which lifted my spirits back up again. So we browsed online and George was suggesting all these crazy expensive apartments that are in waterfront high rises in downtown Miami. His favorite one was $4200/month plus extra for parking. I asked him how were we going to afford this? He said “well you can pay for it, can’t you?” I said no, I wouldn’t. If he wanted me to pay, then it would be something that I picked that was less money. I found an amazing fully furnished 2 bed, 2 bath home, close to public transit, it had a private driveway and garage at half the price. But he said he didn’t like it because it didn’t have a pool. I said beggars can’t be choosers. We argued for days about it. Finally we agreed on a studio apartment in a high rise. It was $2400/month and and he would pay for the parking separately.

He said he would go to Miami to tour a few places before signing any contracts. He booked a flight and left without telling me. I was heartbroken because I wanted to go tour them together. The entire time he was gone, he wouldn’t answer my calls or texts. I was 1000 miles away calling realtors in Miami setting up all these appointments for his apartment tours and he flat out ghosted me. He came home two days later than he said he would. 

When I confronted him, he said that he was busy running around with realtors and that he also met his new boss and toured the hospital and didn’t have service. Riiiiiight. A likely story. Then he said “good news though, I found an apartment. But they want first month, last month, and security.” In total, it was $8500. Of course, he didn’t have it. He asked me for it. So I wrote out a check for $8500, but I didn’t give it to him right away.

Y’all... I really do believe in God. Because the day before I was going to give him the check, I found out he had been cheating on me with another nurse and the reason he was dodging my calls while he was in Miami was because he was down there WITH HER touring all the apartments that I had picked out!! Apparently she worked in the newborn nursery overnight, which is how they met and also why I’ve never seen her or heard of her. She was engaged and was cheating on her fiancé with George. And yes, she knew about me, but George lied to her and told her that we had broken up months prior. She even posted a picture on her public Instagram of them together on the beach in Miami saying “I can’t wait to get an apartment with you!!” I confronted her and wrote to her telling her everything, but she left me on read. She didn’t care. 

It all came crashing down and everything finally started making sense. It wasn’t that he didn’t have money... he just couldn’t afford having two girlfriends because his daddy’s allowance wasn’t enough to cover everything. He had been cheating on me for several months. I guess he realized that he wasn’t going to milk me for my money and he found this home-wrecker, who I assume makes about the same money as me since we were both nurses in the same hospital. It wouldn’t surprise me if she was the one who paid the $8500 deposit for the new apartment. My dad was more upset and disgusted than I was. He thought that maybe George was looking for a green card. 

Fast forward a couple months.. I found out that George and the other girl got married. Which confirmed my father’s suspicions because George’s visa was going to expire and he wouldn’t be able to get another J-visa. Even though he was starting a fellowship, he couldn’t get another visa because the fellowship had to be in “an area of need” and Miami is not considered an area of need. So he married this girl right before his visa was due to expire.

So what did I learn from all of this?
1. Never pay FOR ANYTHING. If a guy plans something, he should be the one who pays. If he wants to go to expensive restaurants, clubs, and shows, he pays, not you.
2. Never move in with a man, or uproot your life for a man unless there is a formal commitment (engagement ring).
3. Never tolerate any insults or degrading comments from a man. 
4. Never feel bad that you make more money than your man. As the wise Miranda Hobbes once said, “I want to enjoy my success, not apologize for it.”
5. Never tolerate a man who leaves without telling you and ghosts you. 
6. Never date a man who expects you to do things that make you uncomfortable.",30957,That time a man made a clown out of me: lessons to learn from my personal experience,0,1572541179.0,,,1

I worked so damn hard for a whole year to improve my fitness, appearance, personality, career. I honestly had so much going for me and I was at the top of my game / world.  I was so happy and nothing in the world could destroy me.  If some inconveniences happened, I'd know to forgive and let go.  I was a really really happy person. 

\--- 

Long story short, I met this guy, and tbh I many levels above him.  The only reason I agreed to go out with him is because we had a few mutual friends and I just wanted to make a friend since it seemed like we had common interests.  I really didn't see him as a potential at all - he was completely **not** my type. 

Looking back, he had used EVERY. SINGLE. NEGGING. TACTIC. in the book to bring me down, destroy myself esteem, make me feel like I had to win HIS affection.  He'd find every single opportunity when we'd speak to absolutely belittle me and my accomplishments. I think his toxic philosophies spread like a disease because I now realized that the other males in ""our circle"" would do similar things to me. 

\---

Overtime, I started to feel really disturbed hanging out in a group with them - and honestly I didn't even know why! All I knew was that I started to withdraw from them after a while.  I now realize that every time we hung out, they'd knock down the self-esteem I worked so hard to build little by little, and constantly made me feel inadequate.

It's so fucking asinine yet 99.57% of us YEARN for men in our lives to play the bEsT fRiEnD role, as if any one of us can't count the amount of emotionally intelligent men we've **ever** met on one hand. 

I can buy that some of the men in our lives can give great objective advice, and are decent at problem solving, but what in God's dying universe drives so many of us to word vomit our deepest darkest secrets to them?

I'm thinking some of us who are the most guilty of this haven't talked to enough guys to know most of them don't even know their own best friend's birthday or mom's name. Men barely connect to **each other** on levels that aren't superficial. Please stop deluding yourselves with the fumes of hopeless romanticism and believing that ""love"" with men means ""knowing every little detail about one another"". 

My argument is exhaustive of almost all information that caused you trauma, or simply, does not add any value to your profile as an eligible bachelorette. If you're not comfortable with blatant lying, then cool whatever, ride your moral horse all the way to heaven. But *volunteering* unsavory sensitive information about yourself is some of the dumbest fucking shit I see women do all of the time, and even on this thread, it's validated by other women with responses like ""if he didn;t love you more after finding out you were trained by the football team at 16, he doesn't deserve you!""

Also, hard pill coming at you: there's a reason why you and every woman you know rarely picks up on just *how much* a guy sucks until wayyyyy later in the game...men don't get off on telling women everything about themselves!!

Anywho, here's a quick starter on things to shut up about starting yesterday:

* Stop telling them about your sexual pasts:
   * They will judge you. All of them.
   * No seriously...No man asks about this to make casual dinner conversation. They are asking about this information *precisely* to make a sweeping moral judgement about you...and assuming you have a body count north of 3, that judgment will **always** be negative.
* Save for brothers and dads, stop telling them about your dating woes: 
   * People are pack animals. As such, Men subconsciously value the opinion and perspective of men, which means the other side is that they subconsciously devalue or undervalue the perspective of women. That is to say: telling men that you've been mistreated by other men almost always makes *you* look bad. Naive or not, men believe the best of the female race are worshiped by other men...so please believe they've almost immediately decided you're less valuable once they hear you ""let"" an ex cheat on you a bunch of times. 
* Stop spilling your life's secrets and childhood traumas to complete fucking strangers on first and second dates. 
   * I mean...duh?
   * But also, ask yourself why the entire fuck you even do this? What tells you that when a guy hears you shuffled between foster homes as a kid, his first thought is ""mmmm yes, attractive. wife material. love her so much more now...""? What are you looking for, understanding? A quick therapy session?

The painful truth is that vulnerability on your end does next to nothing to foster a man's attachment to you...but it does tend to speed up how fast you get attached to men, which is one of the chief reasons to **stop** it, immediately. 

Don't forget: women are the social glue of almost all societies. Been to a great party lately? A woman probably planned it. Received a thoughtful birthday card from a couple (aunt/uncle, mom/dad, family friends) in your life? The woman arranged it and wrote the note. **Stop projecting your social nature onto men.** They can love you and care for you and respect you just fine while knowing only the most pertinent (and most impressive) information about you. This reality is completely amoral; Men aren't terrible for being about the worst possible choice of someone to spill your heart to.

In real life, I very rarely meet a woman in her 30’s that is immediately distinguishable for one in her mid-late twenties. Men are even more useless at guessing than other women are. The notion that we immediately explode into a pile of gray hairs and wrinkly skin our their 30th birthday should be laughable to any boy over the age of 13, yet, this concept of “The Wall” gets parroted by bitter Reddit losers as gospel.

A few years ago, I dated this guy. His cousin was literally a supermodel. Like, a shot/walked for Victoria’s Secret, you’ve-probably-heard-of-her supermodel. Being the intelligent, enterprising woman she is, she wanted to test the waters for a new business idea. Her idea just happened to be in the same industry I work in, so she hired me to do some consulting work.

The three of us were on a phone call one night and she told us to Google her to find a particular campaign she had worked on. Her information popped up on the right column of search results and my boyfriend immediately stopped.

“Wait. I'm five years younger than you! Why does this say you were born three years after me??” She’s *almost a decade older* than her Wikipedia page states, and no one has a fucking clue.

She laughed and said it was super common for models and actors to have completely fake names and ages. I don’t mean fake names like “Chanel Iman Robinson Shepard” decided to go by “Chanel Iman.” I mean like an unbelievably good looking woman was born with a super unfortunate name and had it legally changed to something completely made up so she could be more marketable. Some of them even have completely fabricated backgrounds. That “exotic” South African beauty? There’s a chance she might be from Ohio.

Soon after my appointment is up, I would (hope) to transition to graduate school. Pretty introverted, open minded and would say easy to talk to (once I get a feel for who you are and have control of my social anxiety).

The social anxiety (as well as other crazy illnesses) are due to me being constantly bullied through my looks in middle school and being “not pretty/attractive” in high school. There were other traumatic events I’ve been through too, but the appearance is one of the main themes. (Yes, I am currently seeing a therapist about it).

Anyway...in terms of online dating (Tinder, Bumble, etc) I have had matches and guys compliment me. Surprising, but it has happened every time I match with someone and get on there. Unfortunately, most (if not all) want sex of some kind and aren’t serious. So, I’m guessing I glowed up or am more attractive currently? Who knows lol.

Honestly, my experience with that makes me wary of online dating, so I am trying to see what tips I can master to approach (and be approachable to) guys in person.  I’ve been told that I can give off this “I’m not interested” or “fuck off” vibe (which, I find surprising as well because I would be “in the zone” and just focused on things, as opposed to wanting people to leave me alone (unless they’re legit creepy). So that may be a factor?

Also, uhm, the only men I seem to attract in person are men twice my age and not put together. At least, most of the time. My friends said that other guys (around my age and are put together) would give me signals, but I don’t want to misread them or think of it too much.

I just want to look (and be) the best I can to men so that I can be interesting inside and out. 

And before you say that “looks don’t matter, etc”, please be honest on how you try to present that line. Yes, personality matters too but many men tend to approach you based on looks alone then they decide if they want to get to know you (hence the posts on here saying that men would pursue women for sex and only sex). At least a consensus can focus on that.

**FDS women are similar to incels because of our extreme ideology of hating men.** *The truth?* We hate *shitty men* and we *will* use this subreddit as a platform for calling out their bad behavior so other women know what to avoid. However, we also make space in our lives for: 1) good male friends who respect women and appreciate our friendship, and 2) a loving boyfriend/husband who is serious about us and cares about us a lot.  We don't think that men are only good for their money. We look for great partners who are caring, sweet, intelligent, honest, loyal, and loving! These qualities are very important. However, another quality that we also look for is a man who is generous towards us and it's non-negotiable. Just because we care about a man's generosity and see it as one of the many measures one can have in determining a man's seriousness about you, doesn't mean that it's the only thing we care about. 

**FDS women must be ugly because only ugly women need dating strategies; all you need to do is to look hot.** The truth? Although women do receive a lot of attention from men, the majority of them are from those who only want us for sex, so our main objective is filtering out men who aren't looking for a relationship with us. Additionally, while looks do matter, in order to get a man to commit to you, you need to act like a high value woman so that he will cherish you. The tips we share here on how to act like a high value woman work; the overarching principles will get a man to treat you like you are the love of his life. 

**FDS women are mentally deranged.** The truth? How we appear online is vastly different from how we are in person. We don't talk as bluntly as we do online. Online, we have less filter and our thoughts are expressed in a way where we simply do not give a fuck. Our thoughts are crystal clear and we don't have to worry about using several social filters like we do in real life to seem more diplomatic and socially acceptable. 

Many try to paint /r/FemaleDatingStrategy as some sort of ""crazy"" new group of man-haters who seek to manipulate men, but the majority of our members aren't like that at all (a few of us are a bit more roguish than the rest though, including yours truly 😉). In the end, we like good men, we have standards, and we're your everyday women. All your misconceptions about us will be dissolved if you just take the time to keep an open mind and understand our perspective.",28603,"The Truth About FDS Women: We aren’t similar to incels, nor are we ""ugly"" or mentally deranged.

Of course, they value the connection that they have and her personality, but if you want to attract a man's attention and maintain it throughout your whole relationship, you need to put effort into looking good. When you're more conventionally attractive, you can attract men who are better-looking, richer, and nicer overall. You have more options. 

The key thing IMO is looking feminine. Here are some general tips: 

* **Dress in a feminine manner: wear skirts/dresses and heels.** The majority of men vastly prefer a woman who dresses like a woman. Dressing like this is a rarity these days, so you stand out and you make them feel more like a man. 
* **Wear makeup to enhance your looks.** Fake lashes/eyelash extensions, good eye makeup, blush, bronzer, foundation, lipstick = the whole shebang. Learn by watching Youtube tutorials. Be patient. It takes time and effort to perfect a look that works for you! 
* **This is an unpopular opinion, but lose weight and aim to look more slender.** Being slim is one of the biggest improvements you can make to increase your SMV. That's just the truth from my experience. I don't advocate disordered eating, but you can take steps to look more slim and fit. 
* **If you want to get plastic surgery (boobjob + BBL + fillers + rhino+ etc), go for it.** I've gotten some things done and they did make a difference in how I'm perceived by potential mates. Do the first 3 things though before considering surgery, unless you want to get surgery just to improve yourself. You don't need surgery to find a partner since you can date within or below your current league. But if you want to get men who have a higher SMV in terms of looks and wealth, yours needs to match or exceed theirs for them to consider you as potential relationship material. Otherwise, they're just going to use you for sex, but they won't commit. 

So ladies, do you agree that looks are the #1 thing that men look at? To what extent? What are you personal tips on how to look good?",28544,Look Hotter If You Want To Get a Boyfriend,0,1572347339.0,,,1

# I just don't get it?!

Please forgive me for length and rant. Just hurting bad and wanted to get this off my chest.

I hear all the time in the dating world about what women want in a partner and I seem to meet a lot of those qualities. I have a really good full-time stable job I've been at for 16 years.

I'm very independent and take good care of myself. I'm m/50, divorced and have lived alone for last 11 years. I have 2 teen sons who I see weekly.

I seem to have the height many ladies like, 6'2"" and I go to the gym to stay in shape. I'm kind to a fault, very generous and patient.

Never into the fwb's scene, not into hookups either. I've never done street drugs, don't smoke, gamble or have a criminal record.

I'm very open minded and value honesty and good communication. I dont play with people's hearts and I don't ghost people. I'm a little old fashioned and like to actually talk on the phone. I dont mind quick good morning texts but at some point it's also nice to hear a voice.

I don't lead people on. I reply to a text the very minute I can. I always make my significant other a huge priority also.

So why do I keep finding women who struggle to put the effort into a relationship? I got dumped not quite 2 weeks ago because my ex gf always struggled with whether she wanted to date anyone or just continue to focus on herself and her 2 kids.

She told me many times I was everything she wanted in a partner. But ended things because she said it no longer felt right and she really doesnt want to be in a relationship with anyone.

Before her I dated a woman for 2.5 years who just strung me along. She could never pull the trigger and commit to any type of long-term relationship.

I put so much effort into every relationship but rarely feel that from my partner.

I'm just at a loss, any advice?

But there's a catch - unless the man is in love with you, the second he orgasms, that power is 100% gone and he's ready to move on to other women (see Coolidge effect). This applies both in person (actual sex) and if he's masturbating to you on a screen. If you feel empowered that you have a lot of followers on Instagram who like your risqué photos, please remember that the minute they bust a nut you mean absolutely nothing to them. I recommend you to read your brain on porn for more details on how men's brains work.

Also, when I was young and inexperienced I didn't realize just how easy it is to make a man interested in you sexually. A man can have sex with you even if he doesn't find you particularly attractive. He might cheat on his gorgeous girlfriend with you and your biggest attraction point is that you're new. Of course, novelty wears off and you won't be a new woman for long, that's when you're discarded. Of course, a better looking woman is more attractive but her sex appeal also wears off pretty quickly. 

I was kind of an ugly duckling but I would still get attention from men. Then once I resolved the issue that was making me less attractive, I suddenly started receiving an overwhelming amount of attention from men. It was flattering but then the high turned into a terrible low when I realized how little I meant to all of those guys. I even had married men approach me, that was disgusting.

The good news is that making yourself attractive attracts all kinds of men. Men mostly agree on what kinds of women they find physically attractive, so if attract a lot of men interested in sex only, you will also attract a lot of men who are serious about you as long as your appeal and image are not too sexual/trashy. So you will have to be serious in weeding out the guys interested in sex only and remember to not get addicted to their attention. And definitely don't base your self worth on it",33252,Women's sexual power is very strong but it ends the second a man ejaculates. Don't get drunk on sexual attention ladies,0,,,,1

But what about the ""I waited 5 months, he invested so much into me, but after the sex was finally had, he went cold and ghosted me""? What went wrong, and how could this be prevented? 

The following is an extract \[paraphrased\] from the book ""The Satanic Witch"" which I found insightful. 

&gt; Women feel that any man to whom they sexually succumb must surely be forgotten insofar as any lasting romance is concerned. If a man is to be landed, it is thought, a girl must withhold sex until his commitment has been made.   
&gt;  
&gt; In reality, it is the man who carefully plans his campaign to snare the woman of his choice, and when that woman finally responds to his maneuvers, **his ego will not let him readily discard that for which he has so strenuously labored**. The woman who thinks that she will easily lose a man \[after having sex\] whom she has inspired to pursue her will actually find that she has to work at rejecting him, more often than not.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The surest way to lose a man—using sex or otherwise—is to worry about it.** **It is not the act of sexual submission that causes a man to leave you, but the desperation you project at the fear of losing him.** Women place a man in such a defensive role at having “ruined” them, that even those who might otherwise have sold their souls for the women in question, wind up sneaking out.  
&gt;  
&gt;**If a woman can free herself of the desperation she often feels for a man to whom she has given herself, his very pride will prohibit him from hastily rejecting what he considers to be his conquest**, unless he is one of the earlier-mentioned types who only respect a woman who kicks to the groin, gains his “respect.” If this is the kind of man you want, you must do more than simply deny him sexually, though. You must literally treat him like a worm. 

1) Firstly, it talks about how a man does not want to lose what he has laboured for - for sex to happen, there needs to be ""labor"" on his part. This is compatible with that FDS preaches: sex should come after exclusivity or otherwise a great investment. But what about the ""I waited 5 months, he invested so much into me, but after the sex was finally had, he went cold and ghosted me""? What went wrong, and how could this be prevented? 

2) The answer is often desperation. Waiting to have sex after commitment isn't the one big magical answer. Often times, when sex is withheld for too long, it can indicate that she is scared of losing him - this is when you give him the power/control. As the saying goes, **""Whoever cares less has the power"".** 

That's the whole premise behind not having sex too quickly - **you don't** ***CARE*** **that much about him** (just yet) - he has to *work* for your time, attention, companionship &amp; sexual intimacy.  You're not easily flattered or validated by his interest in you - *he* should be flattered that you accepted his interest and gave him a chance - YOU ARE THE PRIZE. 

The problem that could arise from taking this (effective!) strategy too religiously is this: when you become extremely over-zealous about sex after exclusivity, and otherwise show your fear of lack of commitment (including non-verbally), you are countering the effect that waiting of sex was supposed to have. **You're putting him and his commitment on a pedestal. You're showing how much you care, and how desperate you are to not lose him. You're giving him the power/control, and succumb to being the vulnerable one in the relationship.** 

Beware of excessively worrying about losing him. Don't put his commitment on a pedestal. You are the prize.",33040,The surest way to lose a man—using sex or otherwise—is to worry about it.,0,,,,1

Just want to say that I am so happy to have found this sub and begin taking no shit from anyone - especially LVM. Thank you all for your advice and support, reading all the posts and comments here has made me alter my old pickme ways. 

So, just a background, I am 27, in a good and established career that will take me very far in the future, attractive, socially apt, in shape, very intelligent and a total catch if I do say so myself. I live in a large liberal city and am finding online dating to be a waste of my precious time and very daunting. I've been single pretty much my entire life, and I've been dating for a while, but no luck. This past year I've levelled up my looks and really gone hard to get what I want in my career. I believe I am ready to meet the right man because I'll be a damn good partner. I've met maybe 2 guys in the past 3 years that I would have considered husband material, but I seriously fucked up my chances by investing too much too soon. I know better now. 

I'm at the point in my life where I believe I should start looking for the right person to settle down with. I want kids, so this is the main reason I want to get married. If I didn't want to have kids, I'd probably be cool staying single forever. 

I'm looking for a man on my level. High caliber, good job, charming, chivalrous, generous, smart and kind (and no baldies). I'm finding that these men are few and far between, especially in this city (the men here are wimps). I went out on a date tonight from CMB with a guy I thought might be a good catch, he ended up splitting the bill, plus he was a total let down in every other way. Lol immediate unmatch. I'm beginning to get discouraged. 

Do you ladies have advice on how I can find a HVM whilst not really having options in terms of mutual friends or connections? My family know some guys they could set me up with, but they live on the opposite end of the country and I will never move back there.

Any advice is appreciated!!",32981,Looking to settle down. How to find a HVM?,0,,,,1

# Would you ever date someone that you weren’t physically attracted to?

I (30F) have a guy friend (46M) who has always been there for me. We get along great and we’ve always been just friends. I’ve known he has had romantic feelings towards me for a long time. I have known him for like 8 years. The only issue is I’m not sexually attracted to him at all. He’s been really pushing me to be in a relationship with him recently and I’m unsure of how to respond or what to tell him. The last thing I want to do is hurt his feelings. Is it possible to remain friends after all of this? Would y’all ever date someone that you connect with mentally but are not physically attracted to them? Would you consider being in a relationship with a pretty significant age gap? I know if I were in love it wouldn’t matter as much but the age difference does bother me.

# Being lonely is getting tiring. I keep doing the same thing over and over, and getting the same outcome that I don’t want.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been putting myself out there for the past 5 years, with no luck. Granted, it’s nothing but dating apps so maybe that’s my first problem. But I don’t give many the time of day and when I talk to those I’m genuinely interested with, I hit it off. I don’t meet them right away as I don’t want to waste my time. I’m very open and honest and straight forward. I tell them what I want, what I’m looking for, and Ill answer any question they have. I get comfortable with them and I get this crush on them when it goes well. I always give everyone the benefit of the doubt and trust that they tell me the truth with what they want. But each time it escalates, I somehow manage to make it sexual. But that’s because I genuinely got to know them, like them, and now sexually attracted to them. Each time I meet them for the first time (at least the ones I’m really into) I have sex with them. And I think it goes well. There’s only a few guys I didn’t do anything because 1) I was new to it all and 2) we didn’t vibe. But there was only one guy I didn’t have sex with on the first day, but we did on the second. He managed to be my first relationship but that was a train wreck. Afterwards, each guy I’ve fucked on the first date and they have all have ghosted me after. Naturally who I am, I blame myself. But man, I’m just super frustrated because they tell me what they want, what they look for, and I believe it when so it seems that all they want is sex. The most recent guy, I thought we hit it off SUPER well. We had no intentions of sex, but I escalated it and I had the most amazing sex of my life. He spent the night (wasn’t planned) and during the entire night, he would constantly check up on me to make sure I was okay or if I needed anything. He tried to call off work the next day so he could hang out with me but his shift didn’t get covered quick enough so he left. But there was no wrong sign? But now, completely ghosted. I don’t know what I’d want from him but I’m just frustrated because I guess my pattern hasn’t proven successful at all. After he left, we talked but the conversations were a bit weird in the aspect that he didn’t hold up the conversation much. Then after a day of not talking, he told me “I was waiting to see how long it would take you to want to message me”. But now we haven’t talked in days. Super weird, super confusing, no answers or anything. This has literally happened every time beforehand. I don’t know what about me it is, or why I just can’t connect but it’s super disheartening.

Asking for what you want at reasonable intervals is not nagging. Expecting that your man will do the things he’s supposed to do in a timely manner, isn’t nagging. In fact, expecting that he would do it in a way that you prefer to have it done, is not nagging either. 

Nagging has become an easy word for men to use to shame women when they don’t want to do what is being asked of them. Its an attempt at gaslighting you. It’s very easy for him to brush you off as a nag than to draw himself away from that football game or video game or just general laziness, and do what is expected of him as a committed partner. 

You must not let this bother you. He’s free to call you a nag all he wants, as long as he’s doing what he’s supposed to be doing. Children will scream, “I hate you” until they’re blue in the face, whenever they want to throw tantrums and try to get away from doing what they should be doing. The adult way to respond is to not acknowledge their antics and remain firm in your request or decisions. You should approach this situation the same way. In fact, go as far as agreeing with him and saying for example, “yes, I’m a nag. Thanks. Now take out the trash like I asked you to do since yesterday. Feel free to continue to call me a nag on your way to the garbage disposal!” Basically, Agree and Brush off. 

Apply this to other aspects of your relationship, including listening to your concerns, re-assurance, spending time with you, moving the relationship forward, time spent on giving you sexual pleasure, and any other common relationship conflict.

When you’re able to show that you’re unaffected by his weak attempts to shirk his responsibilities/what is expected of him as a committed partner, not only will he respect you more, but the word itself will lose its effect, and you’ll get more of what you want done from him.",32861,“Nag” shaming is cancelled.,0,,,,1

# It isn't even about being top 20% for Tinder. It is more like being top 3-5%.

&amp;#x200B;

It is how I said. Check the Tinder stat from here.

[https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a](https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a)

If you just read it then the first thing you'll see is ""**In reality, the bottom 80% of men are fighting over the bottom 22% of women and the top 78% of women are fighting over the top 20% of men.** "" which is something that proves conventional truth. But if you check an actual graphic which also considers female's attractiveness, then you'll see that women above 60% (basically it means all more or less attractive) only go for the top 5% of men. It means that if you want to bang more or less attractive girls using Tinder then just being above average (at least on your photos)- just not enough. You should be the best of the best. And even a small 1% increase means everything. Basically being in the top 3% would allow you to get a few times more hot girls than being in the top 5%, and being in the top 1% is almost the only way to get the top 10% of girls, which is kind of ridiculous.

On other online dating apps, you can have higher chances. Just compare this to old OcCupid stat.

[https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/yourlooksandyourinbox.html](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/yourlooksandyourinbox.html)

Even though girls still consider 80% of guys ""ugly creeps"", you still have a high chance to get someone if you are within the top 20% and the difference isn't so huge.

In real-life though things aren't so sad, or else there would be a bunch of guys with harems of hundreds of women and average guys wouldn't be able to procreate at all. I think things are so sad online because women usually judge how attractive you are not only based on appearance but also on your charisma (game), social status, financial success, etc. It is obvious that you would need to be exceptional if you want to win while playing with a handicap. It also means that if you were ABLE to get in the top 1-5%, then you will have it rather easy. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

**TLDR**

Unless you can get in the top 5% with your photos (which is possible for many guys though) then you'd better forget about getting anyone fuckable from Tinder unless you are ready to rely on luck and swipe right for years.

I attended a 3 days industry conference. At said conference there was a keynote speaker. I won’t say his name but he’s been a world renowned economist for 25 years and has served under 2 presidents. 

He was brought to the conference to speak about the current and future state of the economy in the US and around the world. He also spoke on the trends he and other economist were seeing regarding the millennial and Gen Z workforce. 

He talked about the economy, how dumb the trade war is yadda yadda....Then out of no where, he went full FDS. I wish y’all were there to see it. 

He confirmed what all of us knew. He pretty much said 18-26 year old men are basically freeloading failures (he said it nicer than that) and 18-26 year old women are overachieving. 

He literally went on for 30 minutes about how the a lot of 18-26 year old men are embarrassingly under achieving to the point were they aren’t even setting career goals. He didn’t hold any punches. He said an alarming number of men in that age range aren’t participating in the work force at all (not even a part-time job or being a Uber driver), how they refuse to go to any type of secondary school and how they’re basically entitled babies who live with their parents. 

Anyway, this is very concerning to me because I’m 24 that means the men I’m suppose to be compatible with all have Peter Pan syndrome, refuse to grow up and handle adult responsibility. 

Ladies, we need FDS now more than ever. These “men” aren’t only trying to get sex and  relationships with the bare minimum effort. They’re trying to go through life with the bare minimum effort. They want everything done for them and handed to them. For some reason, they lack the pride men before them had in a honest hard day’s work.

# LTR decided to get a boob job

If you don't understand something ask in the comments please, I'm not a native English speaker. Me and my LTR have been together for almost 8 years, we got together in the German equivalent of the high school and have been together since the last high school years. Her boobs have always have been different, they are a bit misshaped since she got into puberty and they started to develop. Doctors said it's because of a defect that occurs during the embryo stadium.

She has always dreamed and has told me her dream of having ""normal"" shaped boobs. For me it was never an issue because I like them as they are and encouraged her not to get her boobs done but after all it's her body and her choice for sure. So she lately decided to get finally her boobs done after saving up for the last three years and met with a couple of the best surgeons in our country for consulting. The important part is that I made clear that she's is going to entirely pay it on her own, my service will just be to drive her to the hospital and back and she agreed with it. We spoke often about it and I support her choice but made clear that I'm not a fan of it and she does it all for herself. I also often made my point in discussions and told her that on the one side it's her body but on the other side people who get cosmetic surgerys are insecure about their appearance and that this can't be the one and only way to change that insecurity. My advice was to get some kind of therapy first. Her point is that she tried living with it but its an affordable and mostly safe surgery today and she wants to take all the risks to finally feel good in her body. She says that she hates the feeling to get naked even though we're together for so long and I've never said anything about her chest.

We're both in our late twenties and went through a lot and matured together. I get her point of view but I feel like she doesn't give much about my opinion in things that affect both of us and I start to question if she's still LTR material because of the fact that she has listened to me but completely ignores my opinion. What do you think, has anyone been in the same situation?

# Not Married But...

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 2 months and some days I feel like I’m not meant to be with her. I feel that there is someone better out there for me. I’m attracted to a specific type of woman, one that is sophisticated and classy due to my background. . My current girlfriend doesn’t have all of the qualities that attract me to a woman. I keep focusing on the qualities she doesn’t posses rather then the qualities she does . And I’m feeling that if I do end up marrying her, she won’t satisfy me in our marriage . Is this a problem everyone had before they got married or is this a clear sign I should end things with her?

Thank you for the community. 
I am about 1 year out of a long, loveless dead bedroom marriage. About 8 months ago, i got involved with a friend of a friend who turned out to be a fuckboy. Our chemistry was amazing and the sex with him really helped me get over my marriage. Of course, you all the know the story....eventually became addicted to the highs/lows, the oxytocin/dopamine, sex was always on his schedule, etc etc. I don’t regret the situation because i really needed/wanted the physical connection with someone after all those years and for a while, it felt good. Plus i learned a lot about men and modern dating during this time (the sad truths). 
But now I’m ready to move on from the fuckery to hopefully find someone i have chemistry with who also has some degree of emotional maturity/relationship potential. 
During the last 6 months or so, i have also done some online dating off and on. Casually dated another guy for about 2 months and went on about 7 first dates with guys i didn’t want to see again. 
I’m familiar with the concept of mantourage dating although where i live, it is hard to find even one decent guy to go on a date with at a time but i will certainly try. 
I welcome any general advice and specifically any tips on delaying sex. 
Do you have something you say when makeouts start to get steamy to let them know you won’t be having sex with them for a little while? (I’m not sure about 3 months or other specific time period but would like to try delaying longer than i have with the 3 guys i slept with post-divorce - was not looking for a relationship with any of them.)",26704,General advice and tips on delaying sex,0,1572304381.0,,,1

I was hoping to posit a few things for discussion. I hope it isn't too disjointed.

\--I have found the dating pool is even more limited for successful, career-driven women. I am going to law school next fall, and I have noticed any discussion of this or my current job, which is also white-collar if not terribly prestigious, tends to put men off. I am careful not to go on at length and only mention it briefly when asked. I am hopeful a new city for school will open up a new dating pool.... I would never tell the average person that I wouldn't even consider dating someone who makes less than I do, but it isn't really to do with the money. Men are so insecure when it comes to this, even studies show that women who out earn their partners are cheated on more often (*and* still do most of the household chores), and I don't want to deal with it. Big thanks to this sub for helping me be secure with that choice. 

\--Sometimes I feel as though the moment I try to get what I want-emotional support,  physical/emotional intimacy, etc-it puts men off, leading to a cycle of disappointment. It is incredibly discouraging to think that the very act of meeting my needs is a turn-off to men, and it really had me down when I first discovered this sub and actually thought about it what a terrible catch 22 that is...

\--I am in a transitional state with my career, so I don't want marriage. A lot of this sub seems to be geared that way, so I would love if others who do not have this as their end goal right now would share their experience. I am not sure how to set boundaries in this context. 

Background-A loser who was 7 years older snapped me up when I was 18. He actually pushed me into marrying him. He was attracted to my elevated social status (he knew my family growing up) as well as my youth. He was a terrible addict, and ended up overdosing.  He was manipulative and weak-he made me feel guilty for his abusive childhood and often said he would kill himself if I left. I remember thinking I couldn't live with that on my conscience, so I stayed.  He negged me when I would exercise or eat healthy, because it made him feel threatened. He was emasculated because I was so far out of his league. 

I have come back strong with school, exercise, and my career. I am very independent, but the actual trauma of his death ( No grief-I don't miss him) has left me damaged. With men, I try to walk a line between oversharing (turning men off) and expressing some calculated vulnerability (which can be a turn on, while also getting something for myself emotionally). I am curious if others do this or something similar. Circling back to a point above, is there a way to get support for life's difficulties without turning men off? I am careful not to overshare and am an extremely private person, though I tactically use it to maintain an air of mystery sometimes... I hope that makes sense. Also, I manage just fine by myself and I am not desperate for help. I don't think a man will fix my issues, it would just be nice to have support and I wonder how possible that is. 

Again, so sorry if this is disjointed-no offense taken if it is removed. I am just hoping for a stimulating, open-ended discussion on this rainy Sunday morning :)",26701,"Fairly new here.

And no this isnt about guys being against ""Strong women"", its about being against manipulative narcisists and sociopaths who are 0% unaware of themselves.



Being female only isnt about creating a safespace, its about being able to continuously ignore your flaws and creating a circlejerk like no other.



You are no better than r/incels r/mgtow etc. 
You have become what you hate most.



You're not looking for self-growth.

You're not looking to become a better person.

All that youre doing is creating one big circle jerk, ignoring or even worse- reinforcing your flaws, acting like everyone else was wrong but you.



If you're only being nice in order to get something for that, youre not nice.
You're a manipulative POS.
Relationships are about understanding, encouraging and loving each other.
Not about being a ""queen"" or some shit.



I hope even one person sees this and might changes their mind.



Because men arent your enemies. 

Assholes are.

And both men and women can be that...

Our  first date went well, and so did the second. On our second date, I made  sure to tell him that if his intention was to hit it and quit it, that I  would prefer to cut things off. My heart has been broken by a co-worker  before, and it is awful to see that person at work. I told him that I  liked him, but that I refused to be emotionally screwed over. He  responded by telling me that he liked me too and that every good  relationship starts off as a solid friendship, and that we should build  up to that. He told me that this was only the second time we had gone  out, and to give it time. He told me that we could be ""modified friends""  and that we would talk about it when we ""get to that bridge and cross  it"". He also told me that he rather not sleep with me until much later,  since it complicates things.

Does  this sound promising? For some reason, it bothers me that he only asks  me out on dates on weekdays and that I don't hear from him on the  weekends at all. I'm starting to think that maybe I'm a side piece? I'm  truly ""old-fashioned"" and I don't initiate contact. How should I  proceed?",25403,Does this guy sound legit?

I'm telling you this because I've heard countless stories of women whose men are fully providing for them who end up being totally financially dependent on them. Then when these men start treating them badly and losing respect for them these women have no where to go because they have no savings, no family or friend support and no professional value in the market.

Learn the difference between a man providing for you but being supportive of you having your goals and your own financial independence and financial abuse which yes, is a thing and usually a part or a predecessor to other types of abuse.

More recently I got to know that a girl I know who I thought was living the life with her millionaire boyfriend is actually living a nightmare and can't get out. Her boyfriend (fiance now but not really taking any steps to actually marrying her) made her stop working and fully provided for her but has made her life a living hell. Is abusive, as isolated her from everyone and won't let her get a job without screaming and shutting her down. He belittles her and is downright disgusting and disrespectful towards her. 

His latest was to open a cafe and having her work there to shut her up about him not letting her work... but the best is that he didn't even give her a contract and simply lets her use HIS card for what she wants as payment. Not an actually salary, not paying taxes, not having her own without him controlling her expenses. And the saddest part is that he says the cafe belongs to both of them and that she's the boss there but her name is nowhere in the business nor in anything like house or even the cars he gives her. A full mess and she won't leave because she says ""I won't leave with nothing, I must get something"". Sis, you own nothing at this point, no savings, no nothing, do you think you're really getting something when you leave if nothing is even in your name?

Don't take bums who want to live off you but also don't take men who want to provide for you in a way that they end up having total financial power over you preventing you of getting out if you want.
