302,"They're indeed not the same — far more men suffer genital mutilation then women, and far more die from it or suffer life-changing injuries:

You need to compare like-for-like. Some 950 million males around the world have suffered male genital mutilation, against around 130 million females. And most of those mutilations, to both males and female, occur in non-medical conditions:

Take a look at the *reality* of MGM for most men:

**NSFL**: Warning! Extremely graphic video of African male genital mutilation being performed on unconsenting young boys:

http://youtu.be/WPthgNqG1YY?t=2m20s

**NSFL**: Warning! Horrific photo collection from a Dutch doctor of hundreds of mutilated, amputated and seriously infected penises (many with gangrene) of African boys and men as a result of ""male circumcision"" - ie: sexual abuse and genital mutilation. This is just one, tiny area of Africa - where MGM is widespread. Most of these men will have their penis amputated; and many will die or commit suicide:

And of course they have recently started penile transplants in South Africa due to the thousands of boys that have their penises amputated each year.

305,"I agree that the shaming of women needs to stop, and that it is ridiculous that we keep looking at these sorts of trends in terms of female promiscuity.  There is a double standard, and women should be free to explore their own sexuality without shame.  

However as one of those 5% that married as virgins, I'd like to state for the record that I was not raised in a family where I was encouraged to stay in a marriage where I am abused in any way.  In fact quite the opposite.  I feel like it is shaming of my choice and invalidating my perspective to make a claim that broad and sweeping.  How many sexual partners you choose to have in your lifetime is a very personal choice that should not be shamed in either direction, whether the number is large or small.",K80lovescats,2016-06-08 15:55:31,2016-07-19 02:58:40,,t1_d40qegs,women,5,0,2016-07-19 02:58:40

I find it interesting that we still look at this only in terms of female promiscuity. That we keep shaming women for exploring their own sexuality.

323,"“My name is Sarah Jessica, and I own well over 100 pairs of Manolo Blahniks.”
 — Sarah Jessica Parker

Men and women are different in several respects, but the moment you get on to the subject of shoes, a chasm opens between the two sexes; it’s only for women that shoes become an all-consuming obsession.

“I can be in the dumps of dumpsters and go buy a new pair of shoes, and then it’s okay. Even if it’s just for the time being, for that moment it’s what I need.”
 — Britney Spears

Shoes can cost a fortune; yet while money itself does not bring happiness, a pair of new shoes brings on a kind of exaltation. Unlike clothes, shoes have a distinct advantage. Whether you’re fat or thin, short or tall, beautiful or ugly, you can buy all the shoes your heart desires. They are capable of making you feel sexy, elegant or sporty at a single stroke.

“To me, shoes are like pizza: There is no bad shoe.”

415,"A couple interesting findings in the [full paper](http://jaha.ahajournals.org/content/5/6/e003704.full)

First, women's overall mortality was worse (OR 1.11), though after adjustment for age and other factors the difference was smaller (OR 1.02 95%CI 1.01 to 1.03 p&lt;0.001) but perhaps still significant on a population level (though its pretty small).  This is different from prior studies in Japan and Sweden where mortality for women was lower (after adjustment).

Second, even when cath / PCI were used in women, outcomes were worse vs men undergoing PCI.  So the effect doesn't seem to be just less use of interventions.

Potential causes: per the authors, women presented differently.  Fewer had a shockable rhythm (more had pulse less electrical activity rather than VF / VT), fewer had bystander witnessed arrests, and serious comorbidities were more common.  Additionally, the authors note that survival bias could have contributed, as other studies suggest more men die prior to making it to the hospital.

Think about it. If ""she"" hadn't said anything to you, what would you be feeling right now? Nothing. Because you wouldn't know what he was doing. 

3. Block him and the ""girl"" on everything. Double check all your security settings on all your accounts and google each of your user names. If any of them lead to your actual real name, delete them and make new ones. 

4. Consider that this might be someone who already knows you in person - if he's friends with her on Facebook that may have been how he got access to the picture. Don't talk about this with your friends, particularly your male friends. If he's getting off on making you scared, and you talk to all your friends about how scared you are, he's getting off. If you stop being prey, he'll stop being your predator.

475,"I was diagnosed in March 2014 after a misdiagnosis of IBS and repeatedly being sent away, with the notion that the doctors were thinking it was all in my head. In March I had my first laparoscopic surgery that confirmed Stage 2 Endometriosis. It was a huge relief, but only for about 3 months. Then the symptoms came back and I was devastated. After many months of being on pain medication, a million trips to the doctor and changing my diet and exercise, I went back and begged for help. The doctor did not hesitate and offered a complete hysterectomy removing everything. Part of his non-hesitance was due to the fact that I have already had 3 children. I was scared, but desperate so a few days later I agreed. I went through the surgery and was immediately put on a 1mg patch of estrogen, because when you wake up, you are in immediate surgical menopause. I felt AMAZING for the first 6 months. Then, despite being on the hormone replacement, the hot flashes, decreased libido, and mood swings set in HARD. After a ton of research, I eventually found a better doctor. One who specializes in hormone replacement. I had my labs drawn (which my former doctor never did) and I was completely out of testosterone (yes the ovaries produce testosterone, even if its considered a ""male hormone"") and very low in estrogen. He recommended bio-identical hormones, testosterone and estrogen pellets that are inserted under the skin and last for 3 months. He explained how this form of medication dissolves slowly and your body takes what it needs, directly through the bloodstream. Meaning it is not absorbed through the liver. It is made from organic matter, genetically modified in a laboratory and very similar to the body's natural structure of these hormones. Hormone replacement therapy that is usually prescribed by mainstream doctors (premarin) is made from pregnant horse urine and it comes with many side effects, like strokes, clotting, heart attacks and breast cancer. Bio identical hormones do not have these known side effects. Because they are made from organic ingredients, the FDA wont approve them and it does cost about $250-$400 every 3 months depending on where you live. Anyways, I feel great now. My libido is back, like when I was a teenager!! And I have energy and sleep like a baby again. I have been through a shit ton to get where I am now, but it was all worth it. So far I have had no re-occurrence of endo symptoms and feel better than ever! And my husband is happy again too :)

483,"One of the most difficult things to accept about relationships, IMO, is the true reality of recognizing that the other person is an individual. I think that means recognizing their inherent autonomy, too. And this is terrible, because that means you fully realize that there's absolutely nothing you can do, in the end, to prevent them from doing very hurtful, selfish, or even violent things. You can try to influence them, love them, show them a good life with you, and all that, but if a person wants to do something, you can't stop them. 

So you start to realize that every second in a relationship is like a Mexican standoff of love. They can hurt you just like you can hurt them. And there is no pattern of behavior, no combination of words or actions, that can ever truly guarantee they won't pull the trigger. 

On the other hand, if you ever find someone who stays with you for years and years, this perspective can (ideally) give you the wonderful comfort that they are with you of their own free will. 

On the other other hand, you will never know if you have found someone who will ""love you forever"". You can be together 80 years, but there's always the chance that an independent, thinking, autonomous human being will leave you in year 81.

Okay, that wasn't as comforting as I had imagined it might be. And now I don't know why I was thinking it would be comforting. I guess I'm saying getting stabbed in the back like that is like when Neo in *The Matrix* gets vomited out of the pod he was in, and sees the real world. No more illusions that you can see someone and know things will last forever. No more dreams about soulmates who were meant for each other. But now you have the gritty, sometimes quite satisfying, awareness of what freedom means, and how hard it is to live with that. And if you find someone, someday, whom you love and who loves you back, and who stays with the process day by day instead of short-circuiting it for whatever reason, then I think the days you have together will be better than the days you might have without this awareness.

&gt; I think we&amp;#039;ll actually see a world where most babies born to people with good health coverage will be conceived in the lab.

&gt; The concern about the state or the insurance company or someone else, forcing you to pick particular babies, worries me a lot more than having parents make choices, though that raises its own set of questions.

&gt; I could imagine a state saying, &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re not going to pay for this via Medicaid,&amp;quot; which would mean that the roughly 40-50 percent of babies born in that state who are paid for by Medicaid wouldn&amp;#039;t get to go through this, and although they are not &amp;quot;superbabies,&amp;quot; adding another 10-20 percent health advantage to the babies of the rich over the babies of the poor is a bad thing.

Telling her story makes a difference because right now a lot of people don't know all the kinds of ways rape can happen. They don't know rape can look consensual. Hell there are some people who still think it's a stranger in a dark alley and if you weren't fighting it can't have been rape. 

If every woman (and man) told the story of their rape, people would be horrified at how frequent it is and they might realise it had happened to them, to their parent, sibling, child, friends. 

If people were aware of all the different ways rape can look like something innocent maybe they'd realise they can help stop it happening. Who knows.

""Don't ignore our hysterics and appeals to emotion!"" 

&gt;Liesl Gerntholtz, an executive director at Human Rights Watch, characterized the prostitution debate as “the most contentious and divisive issue in today’s women’s movement.” “There’s a lot of fear among feminists of being seen on the wrong side of this topic,” says Natasha Walter, the British feminist author. “I don’t understand how women standing up for legalizing sex work can’t see the ripple effect of taking this position will have on our idea of a woman’s place in the world.”

""My body, my choice...unless you want to offer sexual services. Then you must submit your will to the Cult of Feminism for the good of all Womankind.""

I'm actually grading student discussions on a relevant topic right now.

The indirect value of that labor, no less important to a family's GDP, has been sufficient to obscure its importance ever since. So sayeth the author.

If the guys know that their thoughts will be disregarded it may go a long way making them even less responsible.  Also, there may be some rights, after all it is their child, too.  I guess it would be for the best if we all tried to have sex with people we actually cared for and valued their opinions, even while being free to be the one who ultimately decides what to do.

1169,"I would think its a defensive or elitist response surrounding power or trying to achieve a power position.  When a compliment is given, it does not make you feel like equals. If the recipient is smitten by the complimentor, a ""thank you"" response would keep her in a position of still being in awe of him. If the compliment is unwanted (because the complimentor is not interesting to the recipient), she will give a deflective response, like the ones you've stated. If her response is not coming from an elitist position, she could have Defensive intent: she says it to take power away from the complimentor in order to not feel put in a place of inferiority to the complimentor. By taking away the power of the complimentor, the female can feel in a position of being above the complimentor, which implies that she is untouchable and protected from the complimentor from any further unwanted attention from him. If she's not being defensive to protect herself from unwanted attention, she could have Elitist intent: the female really thinks she is ""all that"" and already feels above the complimentor and doesn't need to acknowledge his observations as new information to her.  This keeps her in her already perceived power position and informs the complimentor that she is untouchable. The last option here is that she's simply being playful or coy -- because she already feels on equal ground with you -- and it's her attempt to elevate herself to a higher level than you, which would put you in the position of pining for her (giving her the upper hand).  All in all, I believe it to be a power play move. (source: 39 year old married blonde that would get a lot of compliments growing up which were mostly unwanted from the complimentor).  The only time I replied like this with a ""playful or coy"" attempt was to the man I married. It's been 12 years and we still play cat and mouse with the power in our marriage...we are both Type A.)


Edit: just saw your username; my thoughts are that if you really are a ""Mr. Pleaser"", then the type of woman you are receiving these types of responses from probably see your pleasing tendencies as weakness and not strength.

Sorry for the upcoming wall of text!

I was diagnosed after my first lap but I'm between stage 1 and 2, according to the nurse. Before the lap, they were fairly certain I had endo an

My symptoms have really existed for as long as I can remember. My periods were always painful, my cramps would force me to roll up in a ball on the floor sometimes. I went through that for way too long, I think. A doctor put me on birth control to suppress the pain from cramps and lesson the volume of my period. 

That helped for a while. A few months later, my cramps got worse. After two more months, I couldn't take it. The doctor switched my birth control.

A few months passed, my periods became more painful, and I went back. This time, when I explained it was the second time, the doctor had a suspicion that I might have endo. She put me on another birth control where I would control my cycle to only have my period every three months. I honestly was awful after about a year. I would miss my pill, forget what month I was on, etc. The pain started coming back. Midol stopped working. I was absolutely fed up. 

Then, my sister told me she had a surgery scheduled. Not strange for her, she has unfortunately had several health problems. She said her ovary had moved to her pelvic wall and needed to be moved, but that the doctor was concerned she may have endo because of our family history and her ultrasound.

My sister, after the surgery, was diagnosed for sure with stage 1 endometriosis. My mom and her mother have also had endo, although laps weren't really commonplace before they each had their hysterectomies. My sister was given the arm implant after the surgery and I decided that I should at least go talk to the doctor and see if he was concerned. 

He was. I saw him once, he scheduled an ultrasound, and my lap was scheduled after that. The lap took about an hour, but I needed a few weeks to recover. Now it doesn't hurt as much! There was a problem with some insurance paperwork not being sent so I got the arm implant half a year after my surgery. I really feel like a few endometrioma have come back, but it's certainly not as bad as it used to be. 

It sucks. Even with a full hysterectomy endo can come back. There's a lot more we know about it now than we used to, but it's still not fully understood. The lap isn't the cure. It does wonders, don't get me wrong, I just wish there was a better way to treat endo than excision surgery.

Tried a course of danocrine (steroid, I think). It stopped my period but had terrible side effects so I came off after six months and was back to passing out every month. For 15 years of marriage I used not birth control and had no pregnancy. At the age of 39 I had a tube and ovary removed because it was covered in endometrial tissue and causing difficulties. Immediately after I got pregnant, had my daughter followed closely by menopause and never another problem.

1291,"I am scheduled for my laparoscopy on friday. My story is long winded and unique BUT:

When i was 18 I went to my OBGYN for my annual exam. Dr found a septum in my vagina that went all the way into my cervix. Extremely invasive ultrasound later they found a second cervix attached to a second uterus. Did a dye test to get a better picture.
Since then I have had to get two pap smears at my annual (one on each side) That was 7 years ago.

Due to extensive family history of cancer in the female reproductive system my mom has me convinced I need to get one removed. (I have 0 interest in kids so I would just rather they take both out). New doctor finally relents and says he will CONSIDER a hysterectomy IF I see a fertility specialist and to see how traumatic a pregnancy will be and if it is even possible. 

I saw the specialist two weeks ago. Due to new technology being available and seeing someone who knew all about uterine malformations we were able to see that I only have one cervix and one uterus BUT the aforementioned septum stretches all the way from my vagina to the top of my uterus thus creating the illusion of two separate functions. 

I suspect that 99% of the reason I am scheduled for the laparoscopy is because she is going to be in there anyways to remove the tissue separating my uterus. This is all very new to me but it explains a lot about symptoms I have been experiencing. 

Side note: I was also diagnosed with PCOS so thats fun I guess.

Sorry that was WAYY TMI.

TL:DR- having surgery to remove excess tissue in uterus. Doctor will check for and remove endorsements if present during surgery. ",girlnextdoor480,2016-06-13 16:33:51,2016-07-20 10:16:23,,t3_4nw08o,women,5,0,2016-07-20 10:16:23

While more men are in the ""I hate vegetables"" category and continue to eat more meat and fat. I know I was guilty of harping to my SO to ""eat more vegetables, you can't expect to be healthy only eating a steak and nothing else"" ""Doctors say....blah, blah, blah"". The Science has almost completely turned around AGAIN to say cut out the sugar, eat the protein and eat the fat. I started a low carb, adequate protein, high fat diet about 14 years ago and lost boatloads of weight, and even though at the time my doctors were skeptical they couldn't argue with my numbers for BP, cholesterol and sugar. But still to this day any conversation with my Mother regarding cutting sugar and eating better fats and more protein, especially when I see her eating all the low fat packaged foods out there and spreading only margarine on her white bread while spouting ""I just think a little of everything is the way to go"" and ""it just doesn't make sense to eat more fat"" is met with derision and a snort of disbelief.
