I went to an all-girls school which had links to the local all-boys school. The boys from said school (not all of them, by any means) weren't really feminists. Or feminists at all, actually. I have a feeling that most of them are and/or were, but they didn't show it at all. Anyway, if ever any of them made dumb comments or did things, I was always one of the first to call them out on it.
I also believed that asking women in interviews if they planned to have children was wrong (because it's no one's damn business and men don't appear to get asked that). Places like Boots charging more for women's razors and tampon tax were also obviously wrong. The pay gap, cat-calling, sexualisation (need I go on?), I believed all of these were simply and morally wrong. I also believed that, at least in my lifetime, I'm 19, they might actually be dealt with. I believed all of this, mostly because I am often found signing petitions for issues like tampon tax and dress codes among other things.
Four days ago my mum told me that things are rarely fair for women, and until men start giving birth, that won't ever change. In the meantime, women have three options when it comes to almost anything (but mostly work): shut up, put up, or get out.
I immediately wanted to argue against that idea; 'but mum, if someone says x then you could go to the news or start a petition and that would change things'. But then I realised, while that might possibly help things in the long run, what about the individual(s) involved and their career(s)? You might have advanced society a fraction for women - who knows, maybe you haven't - but is it worth it? Maybe it really is just better to accept the situation for want it is, and then either shut up, put up or get out.
I feel a stab of malaise at the idea of women having no chance of being equal to men (and this is the UK we're talking about, a first world democratic country) but I also understand that I could save a fair bit of time and effort by simply accepting it. I'm torn. ",,My Mother told me...,,,,,0

Women at a business in Changchun city, Jilin Province, are now required to tell bosses a year in advance that they plan on having a baby, according to the state-run New Culture newspaper. 

The report, which has been widely shared in official nationwide media, says managers at the unnamed firm hope that making a ""timetable"" for maternity leave will prevent short-staffing. It does not say whether bosses can refuse requests.

The company’s HR director says China’s new two-child policy has left them ""helpless"" in the face of a baby boom. ""Some employees said that they wanted to take advantage this policy and have another child,"" Ms Zheng tells the paper. ""We have to consider the overall interests of the enterprise."" The company’s boss adds that hiring staff to cover maternity leave has proved ""impossible"" because of the economic downturn, leaving colleagues overstretched.

Thousands of social media users have weighed in with their thoughts on the Sina Weibo microblogging site. One woman says there are ""no benefits"" to the company’s plan, and that it ""only continues to hamper female employment"". That’s a view shared by some men, with one writing: ""We do not want to force employers to become more reluctant to hire female employees.""

But plenty of other users think the measure is necessary, with some describing it as a ""practical"" move.

So my last period started on May 11th (and my periods for April-March started either on the 11th or the 12th). This month it still hasn't come. I have taken two EPT pregnancy tests (only ones I had) a week apart, took the last one yesterday morning. Both were negative. Should I get a better brand?

Now. I did start a new antidepressant in April, had Bronchitis for the first 2 weeks of June, AND my hormones are aligning with new coworker's at two new jobs.

I am just gonna jump right in.... When I was 15 I was raped by a male friend, It's how I lost my virginity. Took me years to actually call it rape. Took me until I was about 20, 21 to actually accept it and call it what it was. This guy was older than me, and i was stupid to hang out with him. we made out and fooled around one night, but when he tried to have sex with me I said no and made him take me home. A few months later I got a boyfriend. The three of us went to the mall. at the mall they gave me booze, being young and stupid, I drank it. His mom picked us up and dropped off my boyfriend then went to my house. His mom went inside to meet my mom. We staid outside. I was tipsey, but not scared by him, he seemed to respect my no months ealier, i never thought he would try again. and i now had a boyfriend. He started kissing me. I kissed back. He tried to take my clothes off, I said no. I pushed him away. He got aggressive, he slammed me against the wall. I got scared. I begged him to stop. He ripped my clothes off. I was barely 100 pounds, he was a big tall guy. He got me to ground, held me down, and started fucking me without a condom. this was my first time, it hurt and i did not want it. I cried and begged him to stop. He didn't, he got more aggressive, he bruised me, muffled my crys with his hand, he had my pinned down with his weight......he came inside me when he was done. This all happened in my backyard while my family and his mom were inside. It was dark. When it was over, I pulled my clothes back on, went to my bathroom, laid in the bottom of the shower and cried my eyes out. I didn't tell anyone. This was my first time and I felt dirty. I felt like it was my fault, I knew he tried to have sex with me once before and was pushy and yet I drank with him and i feel like i put myself in the situation. i was stupid. I don't know why I didn't scream louder, why I didn't fight harder. The harder I fought, the more violent he got but I should have tried harder. I didn't get my period for two months but was too scared to tell anyone or get a pregnancy test. I went snowboarding about two months later and I face planted and got my period hard. I feel like i might have been pregnant and had a miscarriage. Finally I told my best friend and my boyfriend. my friend believed me, my bf did not and he broke up with me because now i was ""soiled"". But now rumors were spreading around school, that I fucked him and it was consensual. it was not. Word got out that I said I was raped. No one believed me, he taunted me almost everyday, walking up behind me at school saying ""can't be rape if you enjoyed it, you were so wet, and moaning..."" etc. my sister was in high school with me. finally got back to her and she told my parents. neither of them believed me. they figured if i was raped i would have told them and not showered, they just figured i did not want to admit i was sexually active. i spend years trying to forget this happened, then years crying about it. i never got professional help. finally i shoved it down so hard that i forgot and pretended it never happened. then 6 months ago at work....a guy had a crush on me, everyone knew seemed harmless. I am also engaged at the time, now married. One night when alone at work, this coworker locked me in the kitchen so i couldn't get out....no one else was there, we are alone. he sexually assaulted me, forced me to touch him, he ripped my clothes off, he tried to force me to suck his dick. I ran as much as I could, I decided not to use force because i knew from before I didn't want him to get violent. i tried to use my words to get away. i was so humiliated and scared. he had me restrained and his cock out, and he was seconds away from raping me. i was bent over and he was trying to shove his cock in me. I don't know how I got away, I don't but I did. i ran out of the kitchen and paced around outside, ""I should go tell security, I should go tell the cops"" but i felt like it was my fault. while i was deciding what to do, he walks outside and laughs in my face and says ""see you tomorrow at work"" I ran back side and had a melt down, called my now husband. he told me to call my boss. Obviously the guy got fired, he actually admitted to i. i went to the cops, filled a report, its more than i ever did the first time. but when she said id have to go to court and testify i dropped the charges. i couldn't do, i couldn't go to court and relive the first rape again and drag this out. i got transferred to a new location and i thought i was finally ok, until i realized all my new coworkers knew about it but just rumors of it. the other day a male coworker came up to me, knowing rumors about it and said ""hey, you ever been raped? watch out when you work this weekend, your gonna be all alone with the chef, he looks rapey, might lock you in the kitchen...."" i broke down. I am not ok. i was too embarrassed to get mental help for either situation and now i am being tormented. i was black out drunk 2 nights ago and tried to kill myself. My husband took me to a crisis center because he was scared i was going to kill myself. when i was 18 after the first rape, i had enough and i took my glasses off, closed my eyes, while driving and slammed on the gas let go of the wheel on an empty back road. i dont think i am going to do that again, but i know i need help asap. my husband took me that crisis center and i am finally gonna get help. im am going to call them monday and get help for my drinking and get therapy. if you read this far....thank you. i am a mess. im actually worse than i ever have been. im scared to leave the house, to go to work. if this has happened two times to me, either its my fault and i am an idiot, or its not my fault and it can happen again. im looking forward to making an appointment monday and trying to finally fix this. this is no way to live.",,29 year old rap victim need support,,,,,0

This friend of mine (we'll call her Amanda) and I went to the same schools up until university, and were almost always in the same class. We generally weren't best friends, but we were friends, though we've become more distant since university. I think if we were to run into each other, we could talk comfortably.

Now, why does this relationship concern me? Within the past couple of years, I was involved with a much older man (35 when I was with him) for a few months. Part of the reason was that my self-confidence was extremely low and I needed to feel accepted and wanted, so I was immediately attracted to anyone who showed me any level of admiration. This was mostly related to my sexual orientation (bi) and my less-than-supportive parents, and having come from a small town where the LGBT community was not generally accepted. Anyway, this man was also bi so I didn't feel like my orientation was strange at all. However, this man had some serious mental health problems, and the relationship was generally emotionally abusive (though there were instances of sexual abuse and ignoring consent boundaries), especially as it progressed. After having this experience, I'm concerned about the motivation for Amanda being in that relationship, and the power difference creating a power dynamic that enables abuse. She is a university student. Her boyfriend is much older than her, and is obviously much further in his career than she is.

Like I mentioned above, Amanda and I haven't spoken very much in the past few years because of university, so I don't fully know what's going on in her life. I don't know how willing she might be to tell me about any potential abuse because of that. I know if someone asked me while I was involved with that man, I would've had a hard time admitting anything negative because of my denial, suppression, and low self-esteem. Should I reach out to her? Would mentioning something about that relationship help?",,A female friend (21) is involved with a much older man (35) and the age difference concerns me.

I'm also a rape victim.  I take the subject very seriously.  So when an old friend of mine from 20 years ago met up for dinner one Eve and told me she was now bisexual because a lesbian had raped her... I became very empathetic.

The problem is that her story was very plastic, almost unbelievable.  I never, ever, want to be in a position where I doubt a rape story.  But I got a sense that either (1) she always had lesbian tendencies and was blaming the attraction on rape (generally known as the ""gay panic"" defense, or (2) she was not used to being in bed with someone as aggressive as she and she was trying to reconcile the idea of sharing control since the men she dated are usually not very controlling.

I am completely lost on this.  I would think that a heterosexual woman raped by a lesbian would make a woman *more* heterosexual... she would cling *more* to her man.  But what do I know, I'm a guy.

So some help here? ",,Heard a story about a lesbian conversion... through rape,,,,,1

So I'm sharing this here because I really want to get this off my chest, and can't really tell anyone else.

Last night, a bunch of friends and I decided on meeting up in a hotel room at the Kempinski just for fun. The plan was to chill, talk, eat, and just do what we always do. About an hour before, I asked one of the boys in our circle of friends if he could pick me up and we'd head to the hotel in his car (since I can't drive yet). He said that we should go to his place first, hook up, then go to the hotel, which I agreed to since I kind of wanted to sleep with him anyway.

Fast forward half an hour, and we're on his bed making out with him on top of me, trying to convince me to try anal. I'd actually never done it before and heard some horror stories about how painful it was, so I obviously said no. He continued trying to convince me and I reluctantly gave in after a few more minutes, because he just wouldn't take no for an answer. I told him to do it slowly and that he had to stop and get off if he hurt me too much, and he agreed.

This is the shitty part; he didn't go slowly at all, he just put it in there as fast as he could, and it hurt so much that I started screaming. I tried getting him off me and I kept saying ""no"", making it very obvious that I was uncomfortable and wanted him to stop, but he just kept going until he finished on my leg.

Right afterwards while I was getting dressed, I didn't really know what to say. He kept asking me why I looked so upset, as if he hadn't just hurt me. The car ride from his place to the hotel was extremely awkward at first because I was fighting back tears and not really sure why I was so upset it first. I just knew I was in pain. He kept pestering me while we were in the car until it turned into a full blown argument, and he didn't seem at all sorry for what he did. He said ""you agreed to it before we started"", ""at least I didn't cum inside you"", and ""you're just being bitchy and don't want to admit that you enjoyed it"". I told him he should have stopped when I was screaming and said ""no"" to him multiple times, to which he replied ""no is just a sex word. It's what people say when they're turned on and having sex"". Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think that's how it works?

I have no other option but to cut him out of my life completely at this point. I feel so uncomfortable around him and the rest of the night was torture for me. I cried for a while yesterday but now I'm not too sure how I feel. In my country, sex outside of marriage is illegal. So if I try and report him to the police, he'll get in trouble, but I'll get into even more trouble for being a woman having sex outside of marriage. Women here have gone to jail for that, while the guy just walks free, and it's happened so many times. This guy even dared me to go tell the police, because he knows I won't and I can't.

What should I do at this point? Is this considered rape? Am I overreacting?",,I was raped,,,,,1
