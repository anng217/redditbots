&gt;“Marriage is insurance for the worst years of your life,” she quipped. “During your best years you don’t need a husband.”

People should not be getting married because they don't want to be alone in the worst years of your life! That's completely wrong! You should get married because you want to love and cherish a person for the rest of both of your lives! 

I feel like sometimes modern feminism actively fights AGAINST marriage (which can be understandable because it hasn't had the greatest role in history) but i subscribe more to the feminism where women help women choose whatever they want with their life. If someone wants to be a stay at home mom its her choice. If she wants to work that's her choice too and moms/women should not be condemned for making their own choices.

I was surprised at how weighted it is towards the countries (n=12) who qualify as a team - that makes it super hard to get in from other countries.

  And also that a North Korean qualified based on medaling on vault, and that Romania didn't qualify.


&gt;Artistic gymnastics has allotments for 98 men and 98 women at this summer's Olympic Games in Rio. Twelve full teams may send five gymnasts each, allowing for 38 additional individual gymnasts.

&gt;The list reflects the results from the first qualifier at the 2015 World Championships in Glasgow, where the first eight teams earned automatic qualification to the Olympic Games. Brazil, Germany, Belgium and France secured the final team spots on Sunday. The four other teams competing on Sunday — Switzerland, Australia, Romania and Korea — each earn one spot to be decided by their respective National Olympic Committees.

&gt;In Glasgow, individual event medalists whose teams did not eventually qualify were also guaranteed berths to the Olympics. This only applied to one gymnast, North Korea's Hong Un Jong, who won the bronze on vault.

&gt;After team allotments and apparatus qualifiers from the world championships, that left 33 available spaces for individuals from Saturday's competition, with a limit of one per country. Five countries — Greece, Hungary, Mexico, Poland and Spain — had two gymnasts placing within the top ranks, and may choose to send either gymnast this summer. Two gymnasts who did not compete at the qualifier — Algeria's Farah Boufadene (who withdrew with injury) and South Africa's Claudia Cummins — were allotted qualification spots in order to ensure each full continental participation for Africa.",0,1460982106,,0,d27f1iy,t3_4fbccu,1.0,t3_4fbccu,4136.0,1463520501,1,False,women,t5_2qh8d,,,

Actually, I think it was not me, but the author of the post I linked to that said this, or at least that was how I interpreted the implications of what she said. 

The post was lamenting the 77/100 gap. If you look at statistical studies of that, whether done by men or by women, or whether by sociologists or economists, then what you find is that a substantial part of that gap does NOT come from whether women are treated fairly (although some of it does, with the number varying from one study to another). The remaining part of the gap comes from the fact that women make different choices than men. The most important choices are (1) how many years of uninterrupted work in their careers, and (2) choice of field of study or specialization. (A third, more controversial factor is that men are more aggressive and more willing to stomp on their competitors in order to get on top, but that is not an essential point.)

So anyone who says we should close that part of the gap (not the fairness part; I am with you there) is necessarily saying that they want women to be more like men.

Of course I am with you on the fact that this isn't the 50s anymore. The gap is a lot narrower than it was in the 50s. And of course it will continue to narrow as women converge with men, in many fields surpass men, in education. 

Of course many women enjoy working long hours and draw satisfaction from their careers. Some people think that is behind the curious statistical fact that never-married women make the same, or a little more in some fields, than never-married men.

I am talking about statistical generalizations and naturally there are many individual exceptions, but even in the 20-teens, the statistical generalizations have not fully disappeared.

I think you are exaggerating points on which we don't differ that much in order to avoid the question: Could it be, even in part, that the earnings gap exists because *men* (statistically, on average) make bad choices?

Since nothing was available in a small enough size I ended up just stuffing my bra with tissues, and you could definitely tell that's what I did because it was an unlined sports bra with lumpy tissues inside. 

Having a little padding can also help to conceal the natural shape of the breasts, which can be very helpful for a young girl who is just developing. It's hard enough growing boobs for the first time without everyone being able to see *every* outline of your breasts and nipples.

When a compliment is given, it does not make you feel like equals. If the recipient is smitten by the complimentor, a ""thank you"" response would keep her in a position of still being in awe of him. If the compliment is unwanted (because the complimentor is not interesting to the recipient), she will give a deflective response, like the ones you've stated. If her response is not coming from an elitist position, she could have Defensive intent: she says it to take power away from the complimentor in order to not feel put in a place of inferiority to the complimentor. By taking away the power of the complimentor, the female can feel in a position of being above the complimentor, which implies that she is untouchable and protected from the complimentor from any further unwanted attention from him. If she's not being defensive to protect herself from unwanted attention, she could have Elitist intent: the female really thinks she is ""all that"" and already feels above the complimentor and doesn't need to acknowledge his observations as new information to her.  This keeps her in her already perceived power position and informs the complimentor that she is untouchable. The last option here is that she's simply being playful or coy -- because she already feels on equal ground with you -- and it's her attempt to elevate herself to a higher level than you, which would put you in the position of pining for her (giving her the upper hand).  All in all, I believe it to be a power play move. (source: 39 year old married blonde that would get a lot of compliments growing up which were mostly unwanted from the complimentor).

&gt; Stowe Boyd, M.S., a New York-based futurist and analyst of emerging technologies, went even further, claiming in a 2014 Pew Research survey that in less than 10 years, by 2025, &amp;quot;Robotic sex partners will be a commonplace, although the source of scorn and division, the way that critics today bemoan selfies as an indicator of all that&amp;#039;s wrong with the world.""

If you don't have a problem with a woman using drugs for pain then you should also have no negative opinion on this as well. 

We know that when a woman is aroused and orgasms things have more elasticity down there, no to mention it works as a natural lube lol. And it makes you feel way more chill and relaxed afterwards and reduces the pain. If you've ever had orgasmed on the rag, you'd know it reduces the pain of period cramps. This is no different.

I think it'd be a great idea. If you can work with college students and push them to be successful, that can easily be a transferable skill to management and communications.

Management, in particular, requires you to deal with a diverse group of people and to be able to balance the needs of your employer with the needs of those you are managing. It requires a lot of leadership and a steadfast approach.

Two things that are valuable to any management position. But also highlights of a good teacher's skillset.

If you can handle teaching, you should do it. I say take the risk. :) Maybe see if you can maintain connections to the station, at least while you are still getting acclimated to teaching. Just in case.

tl;dr I'd take the risk, but be sure not to burn bridges. References and a good reputation are great to have. :)

Men and women are different in several respects, but the moment you get on to the subject of shoes, a chasm opens between the two sexes; it’s only for women that shoes become an all-consuming obsession.

“I can be in the dumps of dumpsters and go buy a new pair of shoes, and then it’s okay. Even if it’s just for the time being, for that moment it’s what I need.”
 — Britney Spears

Shoes can cost a fortune; yet while money itself does not bring happiness, a pair of new shoes brings on a kind of exaltation. Unlike clothes, shoes have a distinct advantage. Whether you’re fat or thin, short or tall, beautiful or ugly, you can buy all the shoes your heart desires. They are capable of making you feel sexy, elegant or sporty at a single stroke.

First, women's overall mortality was worse (OR 1.11), though after adjustment for age and other factors the difference was smaller (OR 1.02 95%CI 1.01 to 1.03 p&lt;0.001) but perhaps still significant on a population level (though its pretty small).  This is different from prior studies in Japan and Sweden where mortality for women was lower (after adjustment).

Second, even when cath / PCI were used in women, outcomes were worse vs men undergoing PCI.  So the effect doesn't seem to be just less use of interventions.

Potential causes: per the authors, women presented differently.  Fewer had a shockable rhythm (more had pulse less electrical activity rather than VF / VT), fewer had bystander witnessed arrests, and serious comorbidities were more common.  Additionally, the authors note that survival bias could have contributed, as other studies suggest more men die prior to making it to the hospital.

Mommaween,1328066554.0,,,t2_6t2xi,"I was diagnosed in March 2014 after a misdiagnosis of IBS and repeatedly being sent away, with the notion that the doctors were thinking it was all in my head. In March I had my first laparoscopic surgery that confirmed Stage 2 Endometriosis. It was a huge relief, but only for about 3 months. Then the symptoms came back and I was devastated. After many months of being on pain medication, a million trips to the doctor and changing my diet and exercise, I went back and begged for help. The doctor did not hesitate and offered a complete hysterectomy removing everything. Part of his non-hesitance was due to the fact that I have already had 3 children. I was scared, but desperate so a few days later I agreed. I went through the surgery and was immediately put on a 1mg patch of estrogen, because when you wake up, you are in immediate surgical menopause. I felt AMAZING for the first 6 months. Then, despite being on the hormone replacement, the hot flashes, decreased libido, and mood swings set in HARD. After a ton of research, I eventually found a better doctor. One who specializes in hormone replacement. I had my labs drawn (which my former doctor never did) and I was completely out of testosterone (yes the ovaries produce testosterone, even if its considered a ""male hormone"") and very low in estrogen. He recommended bio-identical hormones, testosterone and estrogen pellets that are inserted under the skin and last for 3 months. He explained how this form of medication dissolves slowly and your body takes what it needs, directly through the bloodstream. Meaning it is not absorbed through the liver. It is made from organic matter, genetically modified in a laboratory and very similar to the body's natural structure of these hormones. Hormone replacement therapy that is usually prescribed by mainstream doctors (premarin) is made from pregnant horse urine and it comes with many side effects, like strokes, clotting, heart attacks and breast cancer. Bio identical hormones do not have these known side effects. Because they are made from organic ingredients, the FDA wont approve them and it does cost about $250-$400 every 3 months depending on where you live. Anyways, I feel great now. My libido is back, like when I was a teenager!! And I have energy and sleep like a baby again. I have been through a shit ton to get where I am now, but it was all worth it. So far I have had no re-occurrence of endo symptoms and feel better than ever! And my husband is happy again too :)

bobbyfiend,1214336365.0,,,t2_36gej,"One of the most difficult things to accept about relationships, IMO, is the true reality of recognizing that the other person is an individual. I think that means recognizing their inherent autonomy, too. And this is terrible, because that means you fully realize that there's absolutely nothing you can do, in the end, to prevent them from doing very hurtful, selfish, or even violent things. You can try to influence them, love them, show them a good life with you, and all that, but if a person wants to do something, you can't stop them. 

So you start to realize that every second in a relationship is like a Mexican standoff of love. They can hurt you just like you can hurt them. And there is no pattern of behavior, no combination of words or actions, that can ever truly guarantee they won't pull the trigger. 

On the other hand, if you ever find someone who stays with you for years and years, this perspective can (ideally) give you the wonderful comfort that they are with you of their own free will. 

On the other other hand, you will never know if you have found someone who will ""love you forever"". You can be together 80 years, but there's always the chance that an independent, thinking, autonomous human being will leave you in year 81.

Okay, that wasn't as comforting as I had imagined it might be. And now I don't know why I was thinking it would be comforting. I guess I'm saying getting stabbed in the back like that is like when Neo in *The Matrix* gets vomited out of the pod he was in, and sees the real world. No more illusions that you can see someone and know things will last forever. No more dreams about soulmates who were meant for each other. But now you have the gritty, sometimes quite satisfying, awareness of what freedom means, and how hard it is to live with that. And if you find someone, someday, whom you love and who loves you back, and who stays with the process day by day instead of short-circuiting it for whatever reason, then I think the days you have together will be better than the days you might have without this awareness.

Source: Been there, had the ol' heart stomped on in a way somewhat similar to yours. Stayed alive. Life is better, now, though not ever perfect.

*Edit:* Since you mentioned love songs, here are some that got me through my divorce and the period after it. Also now you know a disturbing amount about my age. Probably not your taste, but it's evidence I'm legit. Who else would listen to songs like these on auto-repeat for months at a time?

Yes, society could hugely benefit form not enforcing gender norms on boys. They are just as destructive as enforcing them on girls.

Gender as a binary system is flawed and harmful to everyone involved.

Using clothing a makeup to distinguish one group through shame was the idea of my story. I don't honestly think most women ""like"" wearing makeup, but feel better without the negative social attention and derive satisfaction from feeling accepted by the herd.

&gt; I think we&amp;#039;ll actually see a world where most babies born to people with good health coverage will be conceived in the lab.

&gt; The concern about the state or the insurance company or someone else, forcing you to pick particular babies, worries me a lot more than having parents make choices, though that raises its own set of questions.

&gt; I could imagine a state saying, &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re not going to pay for this via Medicaid,&amp;quot; which would mean that the roughly 40-50 percent of babies born in that state who are paid for by Medicaid wouldn&amp;#039;t get to go through this, and although they are not &amp;quot;superbabies,&amp;quot; adding another 10-20 percent health advantage to the babies of the rich over the babies of the poor is a bad thing.

Sorry for the upcoming wall of text!

I was diagnosed after my first lap but I'm between stage 1 and 2, according to the nurse. Before the lap, they were fairly certain I had endo an

My symptoms have really existed for as long as I can remember. My periods were always painful, my cramps would force me to roll up in a ball on the floor sometimes. I went through that for way too long, I think. A doctor put me on birth control to suppress the pain from cramps and lesson the volume of my period. 

That helped for a while. A few months later, my cramps got worse. After two more months, I couldn't take it. The doctor switched my birth control.

A few months passed, my periods became more painful, and I went back. This time, when I explained it was the second time, the doctor had a suspicion that I might have endo. She put me on another birth control where I would control my cycle to only have my period every three months. I honestly was awful after about a year. I would miss my pill, forget what month I was on, etc. The pain started coming back. Midol stopped working. I was absolutely fed up. 

Then, my sister told me she had a surgery scheduled. Not strange for her, she has unfortunately had several health problems. She said her ovary had moved to her pelvic wall and needed to be moved, but that the doctor was concerned she may have endo because of our family history and her ultrasound.

My sister, after the surgery, was diagnosed for sure with stage 1 endometriosis. My mom and her mother have also had endo, although laps weren't really commonplace before they each had their hysterectomies. My sister was given the arm implant after the surgery and I decided that I should at least go talk to the doctor and see if he was concerned. 

He was. I saw him once, he scheduled an ultrasound, and my lap was scheduled after that. The lap took about an hour, but I needed a few weeks to recover. Now it doesn't hurt as much! There was a problem with some insurance paperwork not being sent so I got the arm implant half a year after my surgery. I really feel like a few endometrioma have come back, but it's certainly not as bad as it used to be. 

It sucks. Even with a full hysterectomy endo can come back. There's a lot more we know about it now than we used to, but it's still not fully understood. The lap isn't the cure. It does wonders, don't get me wrong, I just wish there was a better way to treat endo than excision surgery.

girlnextdoor480,1323148532.0,,,t2_6dt6l,"I am scheduled for my laparoscopy on friday. My story is long winded and unique BUT:

When i was 18 I went to my OBGYN for my annual exam. Dr found a septum in my vagina that went all the way into my cervix. Extremely invasive ultrasound later they found a second cervix attached to a second uterus. Did a dye test to get a better picture.
Since then I have had to get two pap smears at my annual (one on each side) That was 7 years ago.

Due to extensive family history of cancer in the female reproductive system my mom has me convinced I need to get one removed. (I have 0 interest in kids so I would just rather they take both out). New doctor finally relents and says he will CONSIDER a hysterectomy IF I see a fertility specialist and to see how traumatic a pregnancy will be and if it is even possible. 

I saw the specialist two weeks ago. Due to new technology being available and seeing someone who knew all about uterine malformations we were able to see that I only have one cervix and one uterus BUT the aforementioned septum stretches all the way from my vagina to the top of my uterus thus creating the illusion of two separate functions. 

I suspect that 99% of the reason I am scheduled for the laparoscopy is because she is going to be in there anyways to remove the tissue separating my uterus. This is all very new to me but it explains a lot about symptoms I have been experiencing. 

Side note: I was also diagnosed with PCOS so thats fun I guess.

Horrific photo collection from a Dutch doctor of hundreds of mutilated, amputated and seriously infected penises (many with gangrene) of African boys and men as a result of ""male circumcision"" - ie: sexual abuse and genital mutilation. This is just one, tiny area of Africa - where MGM is widespread. Most of these men will have their penis amputated; and many will die or commit suicide:

And of course they have recently started penile transplants in South Africa due to the thousands of boys that have their penises amputated each year.

Second, watch the speed and depth of motion they use during their sets and you'll notice they really are putting their bodies through it. All the girls on that list have a lot more lower body strength than most of the men we come across.
