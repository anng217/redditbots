awhq,,,"I grew up in Texas.  When I graduated college, I moved to Chicago.

There is no way I would have had the career I had or made the money I made if I had stayed in Texas. Not even when you adjust the money for the differences in state.

I worked in IT, first as a programmer and then as a database administrator.

I had a male high school friend try to get me to move back to my home state early on.  He was also a programmer.  I told him how much I made, told him what the state-adjusted value of that would be for Texas and asked him if I could find a job making the same money.

He said ""no way"".  We also discussed that fact that I would probably get no promotions to management, etc.

I'm not saying it was perfect in Chicago.  There was definitely discrimination, but it was a lot easier than it would have been in Texas.

Now this was back in the early '90s, but I have many friends who live in Texas and the women just don't have the opportunities that the men do, even if they put their personal lives on hold and do every bit as much or more than their male co-workers.

I think women can succeed just as well as men in a lot of markets, but the prevailing attitude of the place really makes a difference.

I finally moved back south (not Texas) when I retired, but I find that there is still a lot of ""built-in"" discrimination.  I do the financials for my family.  That means I set up all the utilities, I decide what insurance to buy and open those accounts, I do our investments, I pay our bills, etc.

Every single new account I set up, even those where I and I alone went in person, was put in my husband's name and not mine.  I've mentioned this to a few female employees of those companies and the response was ""I know, but I only work here and if I say anything I might get fired"".

I thought about making a stink but in the end, it's better for us if the accounts are in his name because he would have a harder time navigating changing them if something happens to me, while I can deal with it if something happens to him.

I still have a chuckle whenever we get a call from one of these companies and they ask for my husband.  I just hand over the phone and listen as he tells them he doesn't know anything about our finances and they need to talk to me.  He basically has to give them ""permission"" to talk to me about ""his"" account.",0,1472397349,,0,d7009xd,t3_4zdkdz,,1.0,t3_4zdkdz,339530.0,1473646861,1,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1423623326.0,t2_lafhh,,

Shaper_pmp,default,,"Nothing, in principle, but - again, with all the respect I have for you, which is usually a considerable quantity - that seems like a totally ass-backwards line of reasoning.

To recap on this conversation so far:

1. I quoted a claim.
2. You rejected the claim on the basis of *where you perceived it to come from*, rather than any actual evidence or reason you have to doubt the claim itself (I really don't mean to be a smartass, but this is an absolutely classic ad hominem fallacy).
3. I pointed out that actually it didn't come from the source you had a grudge against, but that it actually came from multiple other (and *significantly more credible*) sources that you apparently have absolutely no reason to doubt.
4. Assuming I've understood your reply correctly, you're now casting aspersions on *those* sources, based on nothing but the fact they were quoted by a website you don't like (association fallacy), and they're telling you something that conflicts with your beliefs (confirmation bias).

If someone makes a claim, you can reasonably ask for evidence or you can dispute it with evidence of your own.  When they provide evidence or support, you can attack the methodology of the evidence or the source of the support *on its own merits*, but attacking it merely because it supports the conclusion you're already seeking to invalidate is circular reasoning, and attacking it because it's quoted by another source you don't like is pure fallacy of association... neither of which are rational grounds to reject evidence or argument.

Again, I'm sorry to come off like a pedantic prick (and I really hate those asshats who just respond with a list of claimed logical fallacies in the parent comment just to try to make themselves look smart), but this whole conversation is completely mystifying to me.  You're usually a really smart and insightful poster and I genuinely value your ideas, but unless I've missed something huge somewhere (and my most profound apologies if I have), I genuinely can't make head nor tails of your reasoning process here - from outside it looks like someone with an unmovable dogmatic belief frantically back-filling and scratching around for any excuse to not engage with hard evidence that counter-indicates it.

On August 26, 1920, ladies in the United States were conceded the privilege to vote when the nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was confirmed. (The correction had really been presented numerous years before in 1878) 
HISTORY 
WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY is a day declared every year by the President of the United States to celebrated the giving of the vote to ladies all through the nation on an equivalent premise with men. Since 1971, when enactment was initially presented in Congress by Bella Abzug, each president has distributed a decree for Women's Equality Day. This determination was passed, assigning every August 26 as Women's Equality Day.

Shaper_pmp,default,,"&gt; a living fetus being murdered is an opinion. Whereas, a living woman's life being altered forever without her consent (in a possibly life threatening way) is a fact.

More accurately, the first one is a *definition* - an axiom, which to people who adhere to them are no less persuasive than facts.

To us, a foetus's personhood is an opinion, but to a pro-life adherent it's no less a *fact* than the idea that - for example - a black person is a real person.

&gt; The woman's life should trump the life of something unborn.

*Sigh*. You're doing it again.

First, you're conflating someone's life *changing* (no matter how involuntarily, or unfairly) with someone else being murdered. You don't need to remind me of the definitions we both agree on, but you really, *really* need to learn to conceptualise things from the other point of view, or you'll only ever talk past people, and you're never going to be able to say anything persuasive or worthwhile on the subject.

&gt; Whether the fetus is alive or not will be argued for eternity it appears, but you can't argue the life ruining consequences for some women who don't have access to abortion. Those women need to be taken care of and matter.

Let me try an analogy, to try to get you to at least *see* things from the other point of view.

**Warning:** It's going to be unpleasant, so please do bail out now if you aren't able to play with and discuss some fairly difficult ideas without getting upset.

Still with me? Ok.

----

Imagine you live in the deep south of America, two or three hundred years ago. Everyone around you owns slaves, and they can be bought, sold, maimed, injured or killed at their owners' slightest whim.

You, part of a distinct minority in the country, believe this is morally abhorrent - slaves are people, with inalienable moral human rights, including the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

You think that slaves should all be freed, and you *certainly* hold that it's self-evidently immoral to casually murder them.

Slave owners respond that slaves aren't *really* people at all - they're more like some sort of sub-human savage, like a cunning primate. Oh sure, they respond, with proper raising and education and training they may be able to one day *develop* into a proper, self-aware person, but that's not the same thing as *already* being a person, so short of that point you should be able to just kill them if you want to.

Moreover, slave-owners complain that they have a right to decide who lives on their land, and that trumps the slaves' right to life.

(Depending on how emotional you are at this point, you might even be tempted to ask what the fuck they thought they were doing buying the slave in the first place! Why didn't they just *keep their damn wallet shut* and resist the temptation to bid in a slave auction if they never had any intention of buying one in the first place?

This obviously isn't a completely fair reaction - sometimes people abandon slaves on your property that you then have to look after, sometimes people force slaves upon you that you don't even want, and sometimes you don't even know you're bidding on one until it's too late, but you could perhaps be forgiven for forgetting about all that in the heat of the moment when the alternative is the *systematic casual murder of innocent human beings*, right?)

Every time you object to the murder of slaves by plantation-owners, they respond with:

&gt; Well, what else do I do when I have more slaves than I can afford? I can't afford to keep them, so I'll have to scrimp and save and go without - I won't be able to move house or find the job I want, because I have to look after all these damn slaves I own.

&gt; What about my right to self-determination? **Why doesn't my right to live the *kind* of life I want trump their right to live *at all*?**

""That's horseshit"", you respond - ""they're clearly people, and you're clearly advocating their murder for little more than personal convenience!"".

""Well"", say the slave-owners, ""clearly there's a difference of opinion here. Whether black people are really people or not will be argued for eternity it appears, but you can't argue the life ruining consequences for some slave owners who aren't allowed to murder them when they have too many. Those slave owners need to be taken care of and matter.""

----

Made it all the way through? Excellent - well done, seriously. Breathe, breathe, count to ten... ;-)

Now, **exactly how convinced are you** to feel sorry for the slave-owners? Are you *remotely* influenced to support their right to murder innocent people for what ultimately amounts to their own convenience?

Are you tempted in the slightest that their imagined ""right"" to buy a nicer house or have nicer food to eat justifies the literal murder of any extra slaves they have that they don't want or need (remember, that they may well have casually bought themselves through negligence, poor planning or irresponsibility)?

Or do you perhaps feel *even more* disgusted with them for trivialising human life and their stunning, unbelievable levels of self-involvement and refusal to take responsibility for their own actions?

**That's** the mindset you're dealing with.

To clarify here **this analogy is complete bunk** - embryos and foetuses aren't African-American people, abortion isn't murder, gestation isn't slavery, a womb isn't a plantation in the American deep south and property rights and economic opportunities aren't the right to personal medical and bodily integrity.

**However**, I'm hoping that by giving you an analogy that you *can* understand, can you understand why your circular rationalisations and restatements of your position are so completely useless (hell, even *counter*-productive) in persuading a pro-life believer to reexamine their position on the subject?

What you have to do is *start* from their beliefs and axioms, and show that they're counter-productive, or factually incorrect, or self-contradictory, or lead to conclusions that the person you're trying to convince doesn't agree with themselves.

Circle-jerking and restating your position while *wilfully ignoring* their conceptualisation of an issue is pointless and frustrating at best, and at worst just makes your side of the debate look *worse* for unthinkingly trivialising things that their side thinks are important.",0,1471805767,,0,d6qviwn,t3_4yquy1,,5.0,t1_d6qtb0b,3362.0,1473525717,1,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1138282587.0,t2_1vzs,1471806594.0,
Shaper_pmp,default,,"&gt; My point is that people need to have more regard for the woman who is alive and in the world.

Yes, but that's just the pro-choice position restated again.

From the pro-life perspective you're arguing that that future-woman should be allowed to be *murdered* for the present-woman's right to maximise her medical options.

&gt; So what they're saying is that in the end that fetus (once born) doesn't have basic rights anyway. So WHY does an unborn fetus have more rights than the woman it turns into?

No, they're arguing that the right to *life* trumps the right to not be pregnant. Both life and bodily integrity are basic rights, but as with any two rights, when they come into conflict one of them has to take precedence over the other. You (and I) choose bodily integrity - pro-life people (unsurprisingly) choose life.

Don't get me wrong here - I'm pro-choice, and I don't agree their position mages sense, but until you learn to argue from the other person's point of view all you're ever doing is restating your position instead of debating or persuading anyone.

For example, to someone who thinks abortion is murder, whittering on about ""a woman's right to choose"" sounds monstrous, because to them you're taking about a woman's choice *to murder*. That's a lost debate before you even start.

Conversely, an *actual argument* would be to attack the definition of a foetus as a person, or to differentiate between things that with the right environment may form a person (say, sperm and eggs... *or an embryo*) and an actual self-aware individual with a wired-up brain, a consciousness and a sense of self.

Alternatively you can take their stated principles or priorities to their logical conclusion, and show that they lead to dangerous or abhorrent outcomes - for example, if they genuinely believe that the right to life trumps the right to bodily integrity, they should necessarily therefore agree that the government should be able to *compel* non-fatal organ donations from healthy people for terminal patients, which I think even most pro-life people would balk at.",0,1471796987,,0,d6qpry4,t3_4yquy1,,3.0,t1_d6qoj9a,2006.0,1473523634,1,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1138282587.0,t2_1vzs,1471800993.0,
Shaper_pmp,default,,"&gt; Neither option seems fair and neither option supports the basic human right for a woman to make her own health care choices.

This is a great example of a line of reasoning that seems utterly compelling if you *already* agree with its conclusions and framing, but completely worthless if you don't.

For us it's easy - foetuses aren't people, and it's a women's right to make her own healthcare choices.

If you disagree with that first assertion, however, you're literally arguing that women have the right to **actively murder** to maximise their healthcare options. You might as well try to persuade someone that women should be allowed to shoot someone dead if they need a liver transplant, or similar.

Since this data comes from CDC wonder death certificates, I wonder if this relates some how to the way deaths are recorded.

That definitely can lead to changes in what gets listed as a cause of death, as [described here](http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2012/10/moving-death-certificates-digital-age-unintended-consequences.html)

The years would be right for it:
&gt;Last year (2011), certifiers filed 80 percent of death certificates electronically, compared with 63 percent in 2010, 44 percent in 2009, 19 percent in 2008, and 3.5 percent in 2007.

The TER changed quite a lot about how death certificates are done.  Used to be the funeral home did a lot of it - the MD mostly filled in the immediate and contributing causes of death.  But with the electronic version you have a lot more boxed that you (the MD) have to fill out.  There were even other changes made part way through implementation

The indirect value of that labor, no less important to a family's GDP, has been sufficient to obscure its importance ever since. So sayeth the author.

It's the Boy Who Cried Wolf all over again. Every unjustified or weak claim isn't a cost-free action - claims that don't robustly stand up to scrutiny *burn* credibility and *reduce* sympathy and mindshare - they don't increase it.

I fully sympathise with the sexist trends in fashion and the sexism against women in society, and even I thought this specific example was weak and spurious.

Mentathiel,,,"This is for one ridiculous reason: Propaganda has caused us to forget that abusers are also human. Perpetrators are also human. Mass murderers are also human.

Abuser personality is also a huge problem that has to be addressed with therapy, much like victim personality that grows out of poor childhood or slow progression in an abusive relationship. Abusers are also suffering. They're not enjoying their fits of anger, they're not sadists who enjoy their victim's pain. They're trapped in their anger and insecurities and haven't learned a better way to channel them and haven't had a better, healthy, relationship model to look up to. That doesn't mean they're terrible people in every aspect. That doesn't mean there's nothing to love about them.

I'm not saying they aren't to blame for what they did. We have to hold people accountable, or else society dissolves. But they should also get empathy and help.

Modern propaganda has dehumanized abusers so much that to a person on the side, it seems like there's nothing to love about them. People try to label everything so black and white.

I think people can be empathetic to your cause without being through the abuse themselves. Sure, it's way harder for us to understand you going back once you've finally broken free, but that's because we've usually invested into helping you break free and believed you truly did. We were too optimistic, too trusting in your show that was played out so we'd stop worrying, nagging and pitying. And once we realize it was just a show, we're a bit angry at ourselves for believing in it and for 'not being good enough' to help you out.

in terms of the cup, i second what u/paper_aliens said- there are huge differences between brands. i found [this guide]( http://periodhacks.com/how-to-choose-a-menstrual-cup/) that has you start with figuring out where your cervix is so you can make sure your cup will fit at all. after that point, consider width, firmness, capacity, and suction strength before you buy. r/menstrualcups has some resources and anecdotes that can help. 

without knowing your current issues, i can't make a rec, but i have a lunette size 2 and like it. it's high capacity, which i need, but shorter than i could have gone for, so getting it out was a challenge at first. i chose it anyway because it's soft/supposedly has more gentle suction than other brands and i'm paranoid about my iud.",0,1474752878,,0,d80kzut,t3_54a2l5,,4.0,t1_d80jkeh,2332.0,1476019761,3,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1333059920.0,t2_7ay3z,,

Projects like Courage House are all over the place, and it has been very hard to get the press to pay attention to these criticisms. This piece will be a big help.

One thing I didn't see here is that sex trafficking is the smallest part of human trafficking, but these groups do everything they can to blur the distinction and ignore the traffic when it involves agricultural workers, housekeepers or any other type of work. They use the biggest numbers they can find to sway public opinion, without specifying that they only care about sex workers.

The real targets of the propaganda about sex trafficking are the young white girls in these congregations, who are meant to internalize all this savior behavior as a way to link them closer to their home church.",0,1474386820,,0,d7upr17,t3_53nq7s,,1.0,t3_53nq7s,3558.0,1475874185,6,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1189708654.0,t2_2p657,,

Marilolli,,,"1. If you are in a public bathroom and need to change out your tampon/pad it's not as easy as just pulling on a string. You then have to wrap it up in toilet paper and put it in the receptacle (if there is one) or throw it in the trash. There are people too embarrassed to do that and they'd rather just block the drain with their tampon. 
2. The cup is very bendy so when you put it in all you do is roll it up like a taco, push down and shove it in with your thumb. You might get a little blood on your fingers but that is something you should be used to anyway if you've had a period more than once.  
When you take it out there is a little nob you can pull on or you can just pinch it and pull it out. You dump the blood into the toilet then wash the cup out (just a little rinse is fine) then put it back in for another 12 hours. If you time it correctly you shouldn't have to do this in a public restroom.  
You know it is in right when it isn't bent and is a cup shape under your cervix. If it is uncomfortable then it is probably in wrong. Personally, I can't even tell that it is in there. 
  
3. It is completely reusable. If you want one for backup it's still cheaper than a lifetime of tampons. They have different sizes. Normally women who have had a baby use the larger size.  When my daughter is old enough for her period I will definitely be getting her a cup. ",0,1474318863,,0,d7tobhu,t3_531k8k,,,t1_d7tlawt,3750.0,1475847402,2,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1301166877.0,t2_50lsl,,

Though, I do try to use cardboard applicators as often as possible to make myself feel better on that front. but, on an icky scale, (remember, I haven't actually used a cup, so I'm probably wrong lol) but I find just the mental image of having to put a cup up there (I assume its larger than a ""super"" tampon) and take it out full of blood, clean it out in a sink or dump it in the toilet and clean it, then stick it back up there, a little nauseating. When instead I can pull on a string and never have to worry about it again. 

On the ""expensive"" side, I found a diva cup at the local target for like 35 dollars, is it a one time purchase? how often do you gotta switch it out if ever? 35 bucks is a lot to spend if you need a new one every time you get your period, but it you only need to buy it once then the price could be worth the buy. however, how do you know if its in right?? if it leaks you'd definitely know, but is there a way to know *before* you ruin your panties?

You're very fortunate that you have been given any raises you've deserved. However, as someone who knows and tracks my billables against industry standards, as well as keeping on top of what others in my field are billing and getting paid, I absolutely know that I deserved all the raises I've had to fight for. 

Perhaps you were lucky enough to work for very fair minded bosses throughout your career. However, companies normally try to keep salaries as low as possible, without losing personnel. I've never seen anyone happy to move money out of their own pocket and into someone else's, and since I have always worked for sole practitioners, this is effectively what I am asking for when I ask for a raise.

My boss lies to us a lot about how much money is coming in and going out. We know he is lying because we in fact prepare his financials and tax returns, and also speak openly and honestly with each other about our salaries.  When I asked for my most recent raise, when I took over the responsibilities of someone who left the firm for a higher paying position, he told me that no one had *ever* been paid that much at his firm, despite my knowing how much the person who left was getting paid when she started in that position. And I asked for *less* than that.

This is how he has always been, based on what other employees have told me. He'll tell you that there's no money and then in the same breath brag about his new Ferrari or Maserati (each one bought after each of our busy seasons in two consecutive years). 

So I don't think that people just get handed their raises when they deserve them. It seems like a very passive and naive viewpoint. ",0,1473180062,,0,d7bnryc,t3_51db7d,,3.0,t1_d7bm50v,2266.0,1475387715,13,False,women,t5_2qh8d,,,,
AlwaysABride,,,"I'm a 50 year old guy who has progressed in my career pretty much as far as I want to.  I have never *asked* for a raise.  I always just made myself valuable and the money followed.  IMO, that is the key to be successful in a career.  Of course, in ""dead-end"" jobs, you probably have to ask for raises to get one.

And on the other end of the spectrum, over my career, I've had quite a few people reporting to me.  Like you, it's anecdotal, but I have *never* had someone (male or female) ask me for a raise who actually was *worthy* of a raise.

I give you credit for the ""give me the raise I deserve or I quit"" approach that you took.  That is *exactly* what a person needs to do to put themselves in the best negotiating position - be equally happy with either outcome.  In my experience, if any of the people who have ""demanded"" raises would have given me such an ultimatum, my response would have been to get clarification on whether they were walking out, or if this was their 2-week notice.",0,1473177796,,0,d7bm50v,t3_51db7d,,2.0,t1_d7bhpab,6514.0,1475386670,-5,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1450667834.0,t2_t4bnz,,

Aethelu,,,"That's a bullshit opinion because I do use male products to save money and for quality. Women's razors at the same price (in the UK) are crap in comparison. The only good female razors are not even budgetable for me. I prefer men's shaving cream. I prefer men's roll on deodorant because it works so much better and the fragrance is stronger. 

Shampoo isn't on a pink tax because most shampoo is not 'pink' and other than adverts it's not generally aimed at women and tbh any man that cares about his hair uses the good shampoo anyway unless his hair is very very short in which case I've known some men to use shower gel instead because quality is kind of irrelevant at that length hence why men's shampoo doesn't emphasise quality. I can't even think of a shampoo labelled 'for women' whereas I do see them labelled as 'for men' literally because they're saying this is cheaper because it only washes the hair because you're more likely to have hair that short. It's no revelation that the better shampoos are not labelled 'for men' - they don't have a label.

Cottonbuds in the women's section of Boots cost more than the ones in the babies section which cost more than the ones in the more 'neutral' section where they sell own brand which do the exact same job.

There's the Tampon tax here in the UK where tampon's are considered a *luxury* and are *literally* taxed as such. They aren't a necessity or a thing people *need*. Can you imagine if men needed a plug to stop shit leaking out of their anus and someone told you to wear a nappy instead? That is what pads feel like for anyone who has heavy periods. Most people would probably think ""that's gross, I'd be sitting in my own shit."" Without a tampon women are literally sitting in a puddle of the lining of their womb and some blood.

I know you wont be able to 'trial' pads versus tampons but when you wear a pad and you go to the toilet, if you can't change it and you have to pull it back up, you have cold period blood pressed against you. When you do anything there is a high chance of a leak. They smell funny. If you have a heavy period and have to use the pads they feel more like nappy's and the material makes you sweat. If you aren't quick enough to change them they stain your underwear. Imo I want to use tampons and a light pad to catch leaks if I have to go any length of time without changing it. Therefore I'm literally being taxed because I don't want period blood to stain things and they are a matter of hygeine for women only - therefore less important because it affects the half of the population with less representatives in power. Even among that half, lots of women aren't aware of why it's even a problem because they are likely wealthier. I don't care where people come from, everyone loses some financial perspective and things change. Women who are frustrated by 'pink' tax and tampon tax etc are likely to be the ones who are hyper aware of their spending and are therefore not likely to be in a position change things. They/we have to convince other's of it's existence and the problem with it.

How about you stop telling women what to think and your opinions? We don't have to do some trial to test it out, we know it because we live it. You're opinion is no more valid than anyone else's.

Personally, I don't complain I can't afford the 'female' products, I happily buy the male products that ARE just as good. I'm irritated by the difference, irritated that it's not more widely known so people and families can save more money by paying attention.

I think the only one I've missed out is the moisturiser. Personally I buy E45 cream and Vaseline from the supermarket and a sensitive skin moisturiser from The Body Shop (which is in green and white packaging with plain writing). None of which I consider to be aimed at women more than anyone else and are usually found near the medicine bit. They're also the cheapest options I have found that work.

&gt; Rudimentary sex robots are already available at online stores over the border, and according to computing and society expert Dr David Kreps, the mainland could become a leading if not the main workshop for their production.

&gt; He believes that sex robots will become commonplace within the next 50 years, and that China, where the rare earth minerals required for computing and robotics are mined but not exported, is perfectly poised to play the lead role in manufacturing the products for what would be a lucrative, if rather contentious market.

&gt; Attitudes towards the acceptability of the nascent industry differ widely, with trenchant detractors arguing that sex robots could spell the death knell for love and genuine connection and foster sexist attitudes.

The key quotes for this article are (my emphasis):

&gt; There is one big question **this study can‚Äôt answer... why women start disappearing from management positions**. Was it that women were applying for the jobs and not getting them? Or were they deciding not to pursue management jobs, possibly because of the responsibilities they held at home?

and

&gt; It‚Äôs quite possible the answer is a combination of both. Researchers have found that the job application process can discriminate against mothers... **They tended to offer higher salaries to men and women** who were not mothers, and viewed applicants they knew to be mothers as less competent ‚Äî even when they were looking at the exact same r√©sum√©.

&gt; At the same time, it's almost certainly the case that some women are choosing not to apply for management jobs. Positions that involve supervising other employees ‚Äî being around to answer their questions and evaluate their work ‚Äî can be more difficult to succeed in if you have commitments outside of work.

In other words while there are undoubtedly still some sexist tendencies to overcome in employment, they seem to be primarily (perhaps even almost *entirely*?) knock-on effects from sexist tendencies in trends relating to childcare.

Employers are less willing to trust to *mothers*, not ""women""... and while that rule should apply equally to fathers too if there weren't sexist gender-differences in childcare behaviours, the article is silent on that question.  Moreover, even if (as seems highly likely) fathers weren't equally penalised, that would be a problem with (possibly sexist) statistical differences in childcare traditions, not sexist employment or wage discrimination.",0,1473498837,,0,d7grqwy,t3_5203ov,,1.0,t3_5203ov,38496.0,1475516680,4,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1138282587.0,t2_1vzs,1473499116.0,

&gt; LONDON - More women must be included in United Nations peacekeeping missions to help restore credibility to troops marred by accusations of sexual violence and to protect women in conflict, speakers at a U.N. defence summit said on Thursday.

&gt; Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie, an active campaigner to stop sexual violence in conflict, joined defence ministers and military chiefs from around 70 countries at the summit aiming to improve the performance of U.N. peacekeeping operations.

&gt; UK Defence Minister Michael Fallon and other speakers called on U.N. member states to double the number of women peacekeepers by 2020 after UN Women data showed just four percent of peacekeepers in 16 missions globally were women.

HadvoraMaya,,,"I second the whole pregnancy option, but please be aware that there may be other factors here that may prevent a pregnancy from showing up on an at-home urine test. I went through something similar a little over three years ago and much to my surprise, it was an ectopic pregnancy, which resulted in a rush from the ER into surgery to prevent possible life-threatening eruption/bleeding and (thankfully!) save most of the left tube, which was impacted. Prior to this, I had heard about ectopics, but always assumed the signs would be similar to regular pregnancy in terms of how they manifest... Boy was I wrong. Concerned, I did the stick test, but kept getting negatives, which is why after a bout of pain that prevented me from falling asleep (it had also somehow spread upwards to what felt like my shoulder blades, in addition to severe abdomen pain - I thought I was maybe having a heart attack...?) I ended up going with my SO to the ER.

Here, here. This line of thinking is so prevalent on college campuses - girls trying to convince themselves they want one thing when they really want the other. Attempting to be the ""chill girl"" when they really want something more. I see this time and time again, even with my friends. The girl gets hurt every time - and the only solution to this to, like the OG commentator said, put on the ""big girl pants.""
