valereea93,,,"&gt;Do women realize this? The power you hold now?

Women are roughly 50% of the population. So technically wouldn't we always hold about 50% of the power in any given election? (At least since we have earned the power to vote). I'm just as excited to vote in this presidential election as I am voting in my local elections. My vote counts just as much as everyone else's. 

&gt;Are you skeptical about it?

I'm not quite sure how to answer this one. I don't know what I would be skeptical about. 

&gt;Are women in general upset about the GOP's assault on reproductive rights?

I am very upset about any assault on reproductive rights. I feel very strongly about my right to choose and I do not want anyone else's moral or religious compass to dictate my life. 

&gt;Does the fact that Hillary's a woman and has such impeccable ""pink credentials"" matter a great deal in your choice for president?

HRC's ""impeccable pink credentials"" do not matter a great deal to me because I am not voting for her. Do I think it would be fantastic and amazing to have a woman in office? HELL YES! is she the right candidate? Not for me. No.

livingdope,,,"Thanks. Three things: I believe one of the best points is in Gracyanne Barbosa's diet where she says she consumes protein every 3 hours. Most pro bodybuilders advise 1.5 grams of protein for every pound of weight on your body if you're trying to **grow something**. Second, watch the speed and depth of motion they use during their sets and you'll notice they really are putting their bodies through it. All the girls on that list have a lot more lower body strength than most of the men we come across. So coupling the constant protein mixed with grueling sets using their exercises, I don't see how you can avoid growing glutes, hamstrings, calves, or whatever else you want in a reasonable amount of time.",0,1463850621,,0,d3e9txn,t3_4k87sg,,2.0,t1_d3dsrsk,47144.0,1466005725,1,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1456544381.0,t2_vndor,,,0

Think about how foolish your young girl friends are being.  The first one you just went into a bit of detail about is behaving incredibly immaturely.  Her problem is she has little self respect.  She is allowing herself to be used and humiliated (making her wait outside, being stood up and instead of telling him to go to hell, she comes back for more).  This boss is using his powerful position to use her, but he was probably the same kind of asshole when he was younger.  Some people are assholes and some people allow themselves to be used by assholes if the lust is hot enough, and their self respect is low.  

Maybe instead of writing the letter you posted, you can write them a pretty card that you write in how much you like them and how sorry you are to see them being hurt by these men who do not really care for them.

I was surprised at how weighted it is towards the countries (n=12) who qualify as a team - that makes it super hard to get in from other countries.

  And also that a North Korean qualified based on medaling on vault, and that Romania didn't qualify.


&gt;Artistic gymnastics has allotments for 98 men and 98 women at this summer's Olympic Games in Rio. Twelve full teams may send five gymnasts each, allowing for 38 additional individual gymnasts.

&gt;The list reflects the results from the first qualifier at the 2015 World Championships in Glasgow, where the first eight teams earned automatic qualification to the Olympic Games. Brazil, Germany, Belgium and France secured the final team spots on Sunday. The four other teams competing on Sunday — Switzerland, Australia, Romania and Korea — each earn one spot to be decided by their respective National Olympic Committees.

&gt;In Glasgow, individual event medalists whose teams did not eventually qualify were also guaranteed berths to the Olympics. This only applied to one gymnast, North Korea's Hong Un Jong, who won the bronze on vault.

&gt;After team allotments and apparatus qualifiers from the world championships, that left 33 available spaces for individuals from Saturday's competition, with a limit of one per country. Five countries — Greece, Hungary, Mexico, Poland and Spain — had two gymnasts placing within the top ranks, and may choose to send either gymnast this summer. Two gymnasts who did not compete at the qualifier — Algeria's Farah Boufadene (who withdrew with injury) and South Africa's Claudia Cummins — were allotted qualification spots in order to ensure each full continental participation for Africa.",0,1460982106,,0,d27f1iy,t3_4fbccu,,1.0,t3_4fbccu,4136.0,1463520501,1,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1387592855.0,t2_eg8zp,,,0

IslandEcon,,,"&gt; Who said women are trying to be like men?

Actually, I think it was not me, but the author of the post I linked to that said this, or at least that was how I interpreted the implications of what she said. 

The post was lamenting the 77/100 gap. If you look at statistical studies of that, whether done by men or by women, or whether by sociologists or economists, then what you find is that a substantial part of that gap does NOT come from whether women are treated fairly (although some of it does, with the number varying from one study to another). The remaining part of the gap comes from the fact that women make different choices than men. The most important choices are (1) how many years of uninterrupted work in their careers, and (2) choice of field of study or specialization. (A third, more controversial factor is that men are more aggressive and more willing to stomp on their competitors in order to get on top, but that is not an essential point.)

So anyone who says we should close that part of the gap (not the fairness part; I am with you there) is necessarily saying that they want women to be more like men.

Of course I am with you on the fact that this isn't the 50s anymore. The gap is a lot narrower than it was in the 50s. And of course it will continue to narrow as women converge with men, in many fields surpass men, in education. 

Of course many women enjoy working long hours and draw satisfaction from their careers. Some people think that is behind the curious statistical fact that never-married women make the same, or a little more in some fields, than never-married men.

I am talking about statistical generalizations and naturally there are many individual exceptions, but even in the 20-teens, the statistical generalizations have not fully disappeared.

I think you are exaggerating points on which we don't differ that much in order to avoid the question: Could it be, even in part, that the earnings gap exists because *men* (statistically, on average) make bad choices?

Take a look at the *reality* of MGM for most men:

**NSFL**: Warning! Extremely graphic video of African male genital mutilation being performed on unconsenting young boys:

http://youtu.be/WPthgNqG1YY?t=2m20s

**NSFL**: Warning! Horrific photo collection from a Dutch doctor of hundreds of mutilated, amputated and seriously infected penises (many with gangrene) of African boys and men as a result of ""male circumcision"" - ie: sexual abuse and genital mutilation. This is just one, tiny area of Africa - where MGM is widespread. Most of these men will have their penis amputated; and many will die or commit suicide:

And of course they have recently started penile transplants in South Africa due to the thousands of boys that have their penises amputated each year.

In fact quite the opposite.  I feel like it is shaming of my choice and invalidating my perspective to make a claim that broad and sweeping.

Men and women are different in several respects, but the moment you get on to the subject of shoes, a chasm opens between the two sexes; it’s only for women that shoes become an all-consuming obsession.

“I can be in the dumps of dumpsters and go buy a new pair of shoes, and then it’s okay. Even if it’s just for the time being, for that moment it’s what I need.”
 — Britney Spears

Shoes can cost a fortune; yet while money itself does not bring happiness, a pair of new shoes brings on a kind of exaltation. Unlike clothes, shoes have a distinct advantage. Whether you’re fat or thin, short or tall, beautiful or ugly, you can buy all the shoes your heart desires. They are capable of making you feel sexy, elegant or sporty at a single stroke.

“To me, shoes are like pizza: There is no bad shoe.”

Lung_doc,,,"A couple interesting findings in the [full paper](http://jaha.ahajournals.org/content/5/6/e003704.full)

First, women's overall mortality was worse (OR 1.11), though after adjustment for age and other factors the difference was smaller (OR 1.02 95%CI 1.01 to 1.03 p&lt;0.001) but perhaps still significant on a population level (though its pretty small).  This is different from prior studies in Japan and Sweden where mortality for women was lower (after adjustment).

Second, even when cath / PCI were used in women, outcomes were worse vs men undergoing PCI.  So the effect doesn't seem to be just less use of interventions.

Potential causes: per the authors, women presented differently.  Fewer had a shockable rhythm (more had pulse less electrical activity rather than VF / VT), fewer had bystander witnessed arrests, and serious comorbidities were more common.  Additionally, the authors note that survival bias could have contributed, as other studies suggest more men die prior to making it to the hospital.

Mommaween,,,"I was diagnosed in March 2014 after a misdiagnosis of IBS and repeatedly being sent away, with the notion that the doctors were thinking it was all in my head. In March I had my first laparoscopic surgery that confirmed Stage 2 Endometriosis. It was a huge relief, but only for about 3 months. Then the symptoms came back and I was devastated. After many months of being on pain medication, a million trips to the doctor and changing my diet and exercise, I went back and begged for help. The doctor did not hesitate and offered a complete hysterectomy removing everything. Part of his non-hesitance was due to the fact that I have already had 3 children. I was scared, but desperate so a few days later I agreed. I went through the surgery and was immediately put on a 1mg patch of estrogen, because when you wake up, you are in immediate surgical menopause. I felt AMAZING for the first 6 months. Then, despite being on the hormone replacement, the hot flashes, decreased libido, and mood swings set in HARD. After a ton of research, I eventually found a better doctor. One who specializes in hormone replacement. I had my labs drawn (which my former doctor never did) and I was completely out of testosterone (yes the ovaries produce testosterone, even if its considered a ""male hormone"") and very low in estrogen. He recommended bio-identical hormones, testosterone and estrogen pellets that are inserted under the skin and last for 3 months. He explained how this form of medication dissolves slowly and your body takes what it needs, directly through the bloodstream. Meaning it is not absorbed through the liver. It is made from organic matter, genetically modified in a laboratory and very similar to the body's natural structure of these hormones. Hormone replacement therapy that is usually prescribed by mainstream doctors (premarin) is made from pregnant horse urine and it comes with many side effects, like strokes, clotting, heart attacks and breast cancer. Bio identical hormones do not have these known side effects. Because they are made from organic ingredients, the FDA wont approve them and it does cost about $250-$400 every 3 months depending on where you live. Anyways, I feel great now. My libido is back, like when I was a teenager!! And I have energy and sleep like a baby again. I have been through a shit ton to get where I am now, but it was all worth it. So far I have had no re-occurrence of endo symptoms and feel better than ever! And my husband is happy again too :)

bobbyfiend,,,"One of the most difficult things to accept about relationships, IMO, is the true reality of recognizing that the other person is an individual. I think that means recognizing their inherent autonomy, too. And this is terrible, because that means you fully realize that there's absolutely nothing you can do, in the end, to prevent them from doing very hurtful, selfish, or even violent things. You can try to influence them, love them, show them a good life with you, and all that, but if a person wants to do something, you can't stop them. 

So you start to realize that every second in a relationship is like a Mexican standoff of love. They can hurt you just like you can hurt them. And there is no pattern of behavior, no combination of words or actions, that can ever truly guarantee they won't pull the trigger. 

On the other hand, if you ever find someone who stays with you for years and years, this perspective can (ideally) give you the wonderful comfort that they are with you of their own free will. 

On the other other hand, you will never know if you have found someone who will ""love you forever"". You can be together 80 years, but there's always the chance that an independent, thinking, autonomous human being will leave you in year 81.

Okay, that wasn't as comforting as I had imagined it might be. And now I don't know why I was thinking it would be comforting. I guess I'm saying getting stabbed in the back like that is like when Neo in *The Matrix* gets vomited out of the pod he was in, and sees the real world. No more illusions that you can see someone and know things will last forever. No more dreams about soulmates who were meant for each other. But now you have the gritty, sometimes quite satisfying, awareness of what freedom means, and how hard it is to live with that. And if you find someone, someday, whom you love and who loves you back, and who stays with the process day by day instead of short-circuiting it for whatever reason, then I think the days you have together will be better than the days you might have without this awareness.

Source: Been there, had the ol' heart stomped on in a way somewhat similar to yours. Stayed alive. Life is better, now, though not ever perfect.

*Edit:* Since you mentioned love songs, here are some that got me through my divorce and the period after it. Also now you know a disturbing amount about my age. Probably not your taste, but it's evidence I'm legit. Who else would listen to songs like these on auto-repeat for months at a time?

Gender as a binary system is flawed and harmful to everyone involved.

Using clothing a makeup to distinguish one group through shame was the idea of my story. I don't honestly think most women ""like"" wearing makeup, but feel better without the negative social attention and derive satisfaction from feeling accepted by the herd.

&gt; I think we&amp;#039;ll actually see a world where most babies born to people with good health coverage will be conceived in the lab.

&gt; The concern about the state or the insurance company or someone else, forcing you to pick particular babies, worries me a lot more than having parents make choices, though that raises its own set of questions.

&gt; I could imagine a state saying, &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re not going to pay for this via Medicaid,&amp;quot; which would mean that the roughly 40-50 percent of babies born in that state who are paid for by Medicaid wouldn&amp;#039;t get to go through this, and although they are not &amp;quot;superbabies,&amp;quot; adding another 10-20 percent health advantage to the babies of the rich over the babies of the poor is a bad thing.

Telling her story makes a difference because right now a lot of people don't know all the kinds of ways rape can happen. They don't know rape can look consensual. Hell there are some people who still think it's a stranger in a dark alley and if you weren't fighting it can't have been rape. 

If every woman (and man) told the story of their rape, people would be horrified at how frequent it is and they might realise it had happened to them, to their parent, sibling, child, friends. 

If people were aware of all the different ways rape can look like something innocent maybe they'd realise they can help stop it happening. Who knows.

I'm actually grading student discussions on a relevant topic right now.

The indirect value of that labor, no less important to a family's GDP, has been sufficient to obscure its importance ever since. So sayeth the author.

&gt; Rudimentary sex robots are already available at online stores over the border, and according to computing and society expert Dr David Kreps, the mainland could become a leading if not the main workshop for their production.

&gt; He believes that sex robots will become commonplace within the next 50 years, and that China, where the rare earth minerals required for computing and robotics are mined but not exported, is perfectly poised to play the lead role in manufacturing the products for what would be a lucrative, if rather contentious market.

&gt; Attitudes towards the acceptability of the nascent industry differ widely, with trenchant detractors arguing that sex robots could spell the death knell for love and genuine connection and foster sexist attitudes.

It is not uncommon for a doctor to write a prescription for Medroxyprogesterone (depo provera) so the patient can pick it up at a pharmacy using prescription benefits and then return to the office in order to receive the actual injection. So it most likely was an honest mistake on her part but this situation illustrates why it's so very important for people to understand their own insurance plans.

But still there is no maternity leave, so during all that time I hoarded sick time so I would not lose 8 weeks of pay. Having a child is a huge financial responsibility. I think my generation, or at least my group of friends, is a lot more financially  responsible than possibly previous generations.

Since this data comes from CDC wonder death certificates, I wonder if this relates some how to the way deaths are recorded.

That definitely can lead to changes in what gets listed as a cause of death, as [described here](http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2012/10/moving-death-certificates-digital-age-unintended-consequences.html)

The years would be right for it:
&gt;Last year (2011), certifiers filed 80 percent of death certificates electronically, compared with 63 percent in 2010, 44 percent in 2009, 19 percent in 2008, and 3.5 percent in 2007.

The TER changed quite a lot about how death certificates are done.  Used to be the funeral home did a lot of it - the MD mostly filled in the immediate and contributing causes of death.  But with the electronic version you have a lot more boxed that you (the MD) have to fill out.  There were even other changes made part way through implementation

Second son: I wasn't as fit as before and had a difficult pregnancy. I had placenta previa and was ordered off my feet for the last two months. Because the baby was sitting on the placenta, he was underweight so I was also ordered to eat more, higher calorie foods. Labor took two days and was beyond the most horrible pain I could imagine. I was not allowed an epidural. They kept thinking they'd have to do an emergency c section. I ended up having him naturally. I begged for something for the pain but was then told it was too late.

kymmiijii,,,"I didn't give him an ultimatum. However, it was my mindset going into the meeting. I did have another job lined up, but felt uncomfortable using that as a negotiation tactic.

You're very fortunate that you have been given any raises you've deserved. However, as someone who knows and tracks my billables against industry standards, as well as keeping on top of what others in my field are billing and getting paid, I absolutely know that I deserved all the raises I've had to fight for. 

Perhaps you were lucky enough to work for very fair minded bosses throughout your career. However, companies normally try to keep salaries as low as possible, without losing personnel. I've never seen anyone happy to move money out of their own pocket and into someone else's, and since I have always worked for sole practitioners, this is effectively what I am asking for when I ask for a raise.

My boss lies to us a lot about how much money is coming in and going out. We know he is lying because we in fact prepare his financials and tax returns, and also speak openly and honestly with each other about our salaries.  When I asked for my most recent raise, when I took over the responsibilities of someone who left the firm for a higher paying position, he told me that no one had *ever* been paid that much at his firm, despite my knowing how much the person who left was getting paid when she started in that position. And I asked for *less* than that.

This is how he has always been, based on what other employees have told me. He'll tell you that there's no money and then in the same breath brag about his new Ferrari or Maserati (each one bought after each of our busy seasons in two consecutive years). 

So I don't think that people just get handed their raises when they deserve them. It seems like a very passive and naive viewpoint. ",0,1473180062,,0,d7bnryc,t3_51db7d,,3.0,t1_d7bm50v,2266.0,1475387715,13,False,women,t5_2qh8d,,,,,1
AlwaysABride,,,"I'm a 50 year old guy who has progressed in my career pretty much as far as I want to.  I have never *asked* for a raise.  I always just made myself valuable and the money followed.  IMO, that is the key to be successful in a career.  Of course, in ""dead-end"" jobs, you probably have to ask for raises to get one.

And on the other end of the spectrum, over my career, I've had quite a few people reporting to me.  Like you, it's anecdotal, but I have *never* had someone (male or female) ask me for a raise who actually was *worthy* of a raise.

I give you credit for the ""give me the raise I deserve or I quit"" approach that you took.  That is *exactly* what a person needs to do to put themselves in the best negotiating position - be equally happy with either outcome.

Aethelu,,,"That's a bullshit opinion because I do use male products to save money and for quality. Women's razors at the same price (in the UK) are crap in comparison. The only good female razors are not even budgetable for me. I prefer men's shaving cream. I prefer men's roll on deodorant because it works so much better and the fragrance is stronger. 

Shampoo isn't on a pink tax because most shampoo is not 'pink' and other than adverts it's not generally aimed at women and tbh any man that cares about his hair uses the good shampoo anyway unless his hair is very very short in which case I've known some men to use shower gel instead because quality is kind of irrelevant at that length hence why men's shampoo doesn't emphasise quality. I can't even think of a shampoo labelled 'for women' whereas I do see them labelled as 'for men' literally because they're saying this is cheaper because it only washes the hair because you're more likely to have hair that short. It's no revelation that the better shampoos are not labelled 'for men' - they don't have a label.

Cottonbuds in the women's section of Boots cost more than the ones in the babies section which cost more than the ones in the more 'neutral' section where they sell own brand which do the exact same job.

There's the Tampon tax here in the UK where tampon's are considered a *luxury* and are *literally* taxed as such. They aren't a necessity or a thing people *need*. Can you imagine if men needed a plug to stop shit leaking out of their anus and someone told you to wear a nappy instead? That is what pads feel like for anyone who has heavy periods. Most people would probably think ""that's gross, I'd be sitting in my own shit."" Without a tampon women are literally sitting in a puddle of the lining of their womb and some blood.

I know you wont be able to 'trial' pads versus tampons but when you wear a pad and you go to the toilet, if you can't change it and you have to pull it back up, you have cold period blood pressed against you. When you do anything there is a high chance of a leak. They smell funny. If you have a heavy period and have to use the pads they feel more like nappy's and the material makes you sweat. If you aren't quick enough to change them they stain your underwear. Imo I want to use tampons and a light pad to catch leaks if I have to go any length of time without changing it. Therefore I'm literally being taxed because I don't want period blood to stain things and they are a matter of hygeine for women only - therefore less important because it affects the half of the population with less representatives in power. Even among that half, lots of women aren't aware of why it's even a problem because they are likely wealthier. I don't care where people come from, everyone loses some financial perspective and things change. Women who are frustrated by 'pink' tax and tampon tax etc are likely to be the ones who are hyper aware of their spending and are therefore not likely to be in a position change things. They/we have to convince other's of it's existence and the problem with it.

How about you stop telling women what to think and your opinions? We don't have to do some trial to test it out, we know it because we live it. You're opinion is no more valid than anyone else's.

Personally, I don't complain I can't afford the 'female' products, I happily buy the male products that ARE just as good. I'm irritated by the difference, irritated that it's not more widely known so people and families can save more money by paying attention.

I think the only one I've missed out is the moisturiser. Personally I buy E45 cream and Vaseline from the supermarket and a sensitive skin moisturiser from The Body Shop (which is in green and white packaging with plain writing). None of which I consider to be aimed at women more than anyone else and are usually found near the medicine bit. They're also the cheapest options I have found that work.

awhq,,,"I grew up in Texas.  When I graduated college, I moved to Chicago.

There is no way I would have had the career I had or made the money I made if I had stayed in Texas. Not even when you adjust the money for the differences in state.

I worked in IT, first as a programmer and then as a database administrator.

I had a male high school friend try to get me to move back to my home state early on.  He was also a programmer.  I told him how much I made, told him what the state-adjusted value of that would be for Texas and asked him if I could find a job making the same money.

He said ""no way"".  We also discussed that fact that I would probably get no promotions to management, etc.

I'm not saying it was perfect in Chicago.  There was definitely discrimination, but it was a lot easier than it would have been in Texas.

Now this was back in the early '90s, but I have many friends who live in Texas and the women just don't have the opportunities that the men do, even if they put their personal lives on hold and do every bit as much or more than their male co-workers.

I think women can succeed just as well as men in a lot of markets, but the prevailing attitude of the place really makes a difference.

I finally moved back south (not Texas) when I retired, but I find that there is still a lot of ""built-in"" discrimination.  I do the financials for my family.  That means I set up all the utilities, I decide what insurance to buy and open those accounts, I do our investments, I pay our bills, etc.

Every single new account I set up, even those where I and I alone went in person, was put in my husband's name and not mine.  I've mentioned this to a few female employees of those companies and the response was ""I know, but I only work here and if I say anything I might get fired"".

I thought about making a stink but in the end, it's better for us if the accounts are in his name because he would have a harder time navigating changing them if something happens to me, while I can deal with it if something happens to him.

I still have a chuckle whenever we get a call from one of these companies and they ask for my husband.  I just hand over the phone and listen as he tells them he doesn't know anything about our finances and they need to talk to me.

in terms of the cup, i second what u/paper_aliens said- there are huge differences between brands. i found [this guide]( http://periodhacks.com/how-to-choose-a-menstrual-cup/) that has you start with figuring out where your cervix is so you can make sure your cup will fit at all. after that point, consider width, firmness, capacity, and suction strength before you buy. r/menstrualcups has some resources and anecdotes that can help. 

without knowing your current issues, i can't make a rec, but i have a lunette size 2 and like it. it's high capacity, which i need, but shorter than i could have gone for, so getting it out was a challenge at first. i chose it anyway because it's soft/supposedly has more gentle suction than other brands and i'm paranoid about my iud.",0,1474752878,,0,d80kzut,t3_54a2l5,,4.0,t1_d80jkeh,2332.0,1476019761,3,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1333059920.0,t2_7ay3z,,,1

One thing I didn't see here is that sex trafficking is the smallest part of human trafficking, but these groups do everything they can to blur the distinction and ignore the traffic when it involves agricultural workers, housekeepers or any other type of work. They use the biggest numbers they can find to sway public opinion, without specifying that they only care about sex workers.

Marilolli,,,"1. If you are in a public bathroom and need to change out your tampon/pad it's not as easy as just pulling on a string. You then have to wrap it up in toilet paper and put it in the receptacle (if there is one) or throw it in the trash. There are people too embarrassed to do that and they'd rather just block the drain with their tampon. 
2. The cup is very bendy so when you put it in all you do is roll it up like a taco, push down and shove it in with your thumb. You might get a little blood on your fingers but that is something you should be used to anyway if you've had a period more than once.  
When you take it out there is a little nob you can pull on or you can just pinch it and pull it out. You dump the blood into the toilet then wash the cup out (just a little rinse is fine) then put it back in for another 12 hours. If you time it correctly you shouldn't have to do this in a public restroom.  
You know it is in right when it isn't bent and is a cup shape under your cervix. If it is uncomfortable then it is probably in wrong. Personally, I can't even tell that it is in there. 
  
3. It is completely reusable. If you want one for backup it's still cheaper than a lifetime of tampons. They have different sizes. Normally women who have had a baby use the larger size.  When my daughter is old enough for her period I will definitely be getting her a cup.

Mystery_Incorporated,,,"From an Eco-perspective I can see why the cup is a better choice. and the fact that you can wear it for 12+ hours is a plus. 

Though, I do try to use cardboard applicators as often as possible to make myself feel better on that front. but, on an icky scale, (remember, I haven't actually used a cup, so I'm probably wrong lol) but I find just the mental image of having to put a cup up there (I assume its larger than a ""super"" tampon) and take it out full of blood, clean it out in a sink or dump it in the toilet and clean it, then stick it back up there, a little nauseating. When instead I can pull on a string and never have to worry about it again. 

On the ""expensive"" side, I found a diva cup at the local target for like 35 dollars, is it a one time purchase? how often do you gotta switch it out if ever? 35 bucks is a lot to spend if you need a new one every time you get your period, but it you only need to buy it once then the price could be worth the buy. however, how do you know if its in right?? if it leaks you'd definitely know, but is there a way to know *before* you ruin your panties?

Since nothing was available in a small enough size I ended up just stuffing my bra with tissues, and you could definitely tell that's what I did because it was an unlined sports bra with lumpy tissues inside. 

Having a little padding can also help to conceal the natural shape of the breasts, which can be very helpful for a young girl who is just developing. It's hard enough growing boobs for the first time without everyone being able to see *every* outline of your breasts and nipples.

dogfur,,,"I would think its a defensive or elitist response surrounding power or trying to achieve a power position.  When a compliment is given, it does not make you feel like equals. If the recipient is smitten by the complimentor, a ""thank you"" response would keep her in a position of still being in awe of him. If the compliment is unwanted (because the complimentor is not interesting to the recipient), she will give a deflective response, like the ones you've stated. If her response is not coming from an elitist position, she could have Defensive intent: she says it to take power away from the complimentor in order to not feel put in a place of inferiority to the complimentor. By taking away the power of the complimentor, the female can feel in a position of being above the complimentor, which implies that she is untouchable and protected from the complimentor from any further unwanted attention from him. If she's not being defensive to protect herself from unwanted attention, she could have Elitist intent: the female really thinks she is ""all that"" and already feels above the complimentor and doesn't need to acknowledge his observations as new information to her.  This keeps her in her already perceived power position and informs the complimentor that she is untouchable. The last option here is that she's simply being playful or coy -- because she already feels on equal ground with you -- and it's her attempt to elevate herself to a higher level than you, which would put you in the position of pining for her (giving her the upper hand).  All in all, I believe it to be a power play move. (source: 39 year old married blonde that would get a lot of compliments growing up which were mostly unwanted from the complimentor).  The only time I replied like this with a ""playful or coy"" attempt was to the man I married. It's been 12 years and we still play cat and mouse with the power in our marriage...we are both Type A.)

Both daughters died of breast cancer (age 56 and 74).  My father and his sister (my aunt) must both have had it (aunt tested, father not tested) because my sisters both have it.

&gt; In Love and Sex with Robots: The Evolution of Human-Robot Relationships, AI expert David Levy predicted that by 2050, &amp;quot;Love with robots will be as normal as love with other humans.&amp;quot; He even promised that Massachusetts would be the first state to legalize marriage to robots.

&gt; Stowe Boyd, M.S., a New York-based futurist and analyst of emerging technologies, went even further, claiming in a 2014 Pew Research survey that in less than 10 years, by 2025, &amp;quot;Robotic sex partners will be a commonplace, although the source of scorn and division, the way that critics today bemoan selfies as an indicator of all that&amp;#039;s wrong with the world.""

&gt; &amp;quot;If I could press a button right now and have the choice of being with a sex robot or a real woman, I&amp;#039;d pick the real woman every time,&amp;quot; he says.

birthfantasy,,,"To me this has always been something that's made sense, I don't know why society is so grossed out by it. Her pain, her pleasure right? If you don't have a problem with a woman using drugs for pain then you should also have no negative opinion on this as well. 

We know that when a woman is aroused and orgasms things have more elasticity down there, no to mention it works as a natural lube lol. And it makes you feel way more chill and relaxed afterwards and reduces the pain. If you've ever had orgasmed on the rag, you'd know it reduces the pain of period cramps. This is no different.

orion300,,,"I don't know what it's like up in Canada, however, I do think the same general rules to getting jobs would likely apply.

I think it'd be a great idea. If you can work with college students and push them to be successful, that can easily be a transferable skill to management and communications.

Management, in particular, requires you to deal with a diverse group of people and to be able to balance the needs of your employer with the needs of those you are managing. It requires a lot of leadership and a steadfast approach.

Two things that are valuable to any management position. But also highlights of a good teacher's skillset.

If you can handle teaching, you should do it. I say take the risk. :) Maybe see if you can maintain connections to the station, at least while you are still getting acclimated to teaching. Just in case.

tl;dr I'd take the risk, but be sure not to burn bridges. References and a good reputation are great to have. :)

savabluent,,,"First off, please feel free to visit /r/endo, very friendly and helpful group!

Sorry for the upcoming wall of text!

I was diagnosed after my first lap but I'm between stage 1 and 2, according to the nurse. Before the lap, they were fairly certain I had endo an

My symptoms have really existed for as long as I can remember. My periods were always painful, my cramps would force me to roll up in a ball on the floor sometimes. I went through that for way too long, I think. A doctor put me on birth control to suppress the pain from cramps and lesson the volume of my period. 

That helped for a while. A few months later, my cramps got worse. After two more months, I couldn't take it. The doctor switched my birth control.

A few months passed, my periods became more painful, and I went back. This time, when I explained it was the second time, the doctor had a suspicion that I might have endo. She put me on another birth control where I would control my cycle to only have my period every three months. I honestly was awful after about a year. I would miss my pill, forget what month I was on, etc. The pain started coming back. Midol stopped working. I was absolutely fed up. 

Then, my sister told me she had a surgery scheduled. Not strange for her, she has unfortunately had several health problems. She said her ovary had moved to her pelvic wall and needed to be moved, but that the doctor was concerned she may have endo because of our family history and her ultrasound.

My sister, after the surgery, was diagnosed for sure with stage 1 endometriosis. My mom and her mother have also had endo, although laps weren't really commonplace before they each had their hysterectomies. My sister was given the arm implant after the surgery and I decided that I should at least go talk to the doctor and see if he was concerned. 

He was. I saw him once, he scheduled an ultrasound, and my lap was scheduled after that. The lap took about an hour, but I needed a few weeks to recover. Now it doesn't hurt as much! There was a problem with some insurance paperwork not being sent so I got the arm implant half a year after my surgery. I really feel like a few endometrioma have come back, but it's certainly not as bad as it used to be. 

It sucks. Even with a full hysterectomy endo can come back. There's a lot more we know about it now than we used to, but it's still not fully understood. The lap isn't the cure. It does wonders, don't get me wrong, I just wish there was a better way to treat endo than excision surgery.

Tried a course of danocrine (steroid, I think). It stopped my period but had terrible side effects so I came off after six months and was back to passing out every month. For 15 years of marriage I used not birth control and had no pregnancy. At the age of 39 I had a tube and ovary removed because it was covered in endometrial tissue and causing difficulties. Immediately after I got pregnant, had my daughter followed closely by menopause and never another problem.

girlnextdoor480,,,"I am scheduled for my laparoscopy on friday. My story is long winded and unique BUT:

When i was 18 I went to my OBGYN for my annual exam. Dr found a septum in my vagina that went all the way into my cervix. Extremely invasive ultrasound later they found a second cervix attached to a second uterus. Did a dye test to get a better picture.
Since then I have had to get two pap smears at my annual (one on each side) That was 7 years ago.

Due to extensive family history of cancer in the female reproductive system my mom has me convinced I need to get one removed. (I have 0 interest in kids so I would just rather they take both out). New doctor finally relents and says he will CONSIDER a hysterectomy IF I see a fertility specialist and to see how traumatic a pregnancy will be and if it is even possible. 

I saw the specialist two weeks ago. Due to new technology being available and seeing someone who knew all about uterine malformations we were able to see that I only have one cervix and one uterus BUT the aforementioned septum stretches all the way from my vagina to the top of my uterus thus creating the illusion of two separate functions. 

I suspect that 99% of the reason I am scheduled for the laparoscopy is because she is going to be in there anyways to remove the tissue separating my uterus. This is all very new to me but it explains a lot about symptoms I have been experiencing. 

Side note: I was also diagnosed with PCOS so thats fun I guess.

Sorry that was WAYY TMI.

TL:DR- having surgery to remove excess tissue in uterus. Doctor will check for and remove endorsements if present during surgery. ",0,1465835631,,0,d47h8jw,t3_4nw08o,,1.0,t3_4nw08o,5604.0,1469009783,5,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1323148532.0,t2_6dt6l,,,0

gzpz,,,"I have no proof but my gut tells me it is because women are the ones trying to be healthy by believing and following the accepted wisdom of the past 40 or so years that says eat ""good"" carbs, less meat, and very little fat.

I know I was guilty of harping to my SO to ""eat more vegetables, you can't expect to be healthy only eating a steak and nothing else"" ""Doctors say....blah, blah, blah"".

Mentathiel,,,"This is for one ridiculous reason: Propaganda has caused us to forget that abusers are also human. Perpetrators are also human. Mass murderers are also human.

Abuser personality is also a huge problem that has to be addressed with therapy, much like victim personality that grows out of poor childhood or slow progression in an abusive relationship. Abusers are also suffering. They're not enjoying their fits of anger, they're not sadists who enjoy their victim's pain. They're trapped in their anger and insecurities and haven't learned a better way to channel them and haven't had a better, healthy, relationship model to look up to. That doesn't mean they're terrible people in every aspect. That doesn't mean there's nothing to love about them.

I'm not saying they aren't to blame for what they did. We have to hold people accountable, or else society dissolves. But they should also get empathy and help.

Modern propaganda has dehumanized abusers so much that to a person on the side, it seems like there's nothing to love about them. People try to label everything so black and white.

I think people can be empathetic to your cause without being through the abuse themselves. Sure, it's way harder for us to understand you going back once you've finally broken free, but that's because we've usually invested into helping you break free and believed you truly did. We were too optimistic, too trusting in your show that was played out so we'd stop worrying, nagging and pitying. And once we realize it was just a show, we're a bit angry at ourselves for believing in it and for 'not being good enough' to help you out. We forget about you and about the fact that you have to make that final step yourself. We forget that there are more things to get over and mourn than just your abuse and that you've just lost someone important from your life. While I understand you might be angry with us and annoyed and reluctant to share things with us, I think it's important to, once you're ready, speak up like you did so more people would hopefully be more sympathetic and understanding or at least understand that you might find a more adequate support in a local support group or community of people who've been through similar things.",0,1470325228,,0,d64151q,t3_4v3l4n,,1.0,t3_4v3l4n,577312.0,1473218912,2,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1406312666.0,t2_hkjzh,,,1

Shaper_pmp,default,,"Nothing, in principle, but - again, with all the respect I have for you, which is usually a considerable quantity - that seems like a totally ass-backwards line of reasoning.

To recap on this conversation so far:

1. I quoted a claim.
2. You rejected the claim on the basis of *where you perceived it to come from*, rather than any actual evidence or reason you have to doubt the claim itself (I really don't mean to be a smartass, but this is an absolutely classic ad hominem fallacy).
3. I pointed out that actually it didn't come from the source you had a grudge against, but that it actually came from multiple other (and *significantly more credible*) sources that you apparently have absolutely no reason to doubt.
4. Assuming I've understood your reply correctly, you're now casting aspersions on *those* sources, based on nothing but the fact they were quoted by a website you don't like (association fallacy), and they're telling you something that conflicts with your beliefs (confirmation bias).

If someone makes a claim, you can reasonably ask for evidence or you can dispute it with evidence of your own.  When they provide evidence or support, you can attack the methodology of the evidence or the source of the support *on its own merits*, but attacking it merely because it supports the conclusion you're already seeking to invalidate is circular reasoning, and attacking it because it's quoted by another source you don't like is pure fallacy of association... neither of which are rational grounds to reject evidence or argument.

Again, I'm sorry to come off like a pedantic prick (and I really hate those asshats who just respond with a list of claimed logical fallacies in the parent comment just to try to make themselves look smart), but this whole conversation is completely mystifying to me.  You're usually a really smart and insightful poster and I genuinely value your ideas, but unless I've missed something huge somewhere (and my most profound apologies if I have), I genuinely can't make head nor tails of your reasoning process here - from outside it looks like someone with an unmovable dogmatic belief frantically back-filling and scratching around for any excuse to not engage with hard evidence that counter-indicates it.

On August 26, 1920, ladies in the United States were conceded the privilege to vote when the nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was confirmed. (The correction had really been presented numerous years before in 1878) 
HISTORY 
WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY is a day declared every year by the President of the United States to celebrated the giving of the vote to ladies all through the nation on an equivalent premise with men. Since 1971, when enactment was initially presented in Congress by Bella Abzug, each president has distributed a decree for Women's Equality Day. This determination was passed, assigning every August 26 as Women's Equality Day.

When I could text, “I’m outside your door,” stumble in, land in her lap and dissect the actions of some flakey dude I was dating in one breath and Lindsay Lohan’s sex list in another, and then watch “Six Feet Under” in silence over a pint of chocolate chocolate chip.

This is all very well, if you can find someone to mind your kid. Or if your ""best girlfriend"" doesn't mind the distraction of the kid every time. And if she's not out that evening doing some cool adults only activity.

Now sure, I can't relate to ""momhood moms"" - those that define Their. Entire. Existence. as motherhood.

But many women with kids are just like me. They're professional, educated, maybe on maternity leave or maybe not. They love their kids but they love their lives as well. We talk about a range of things. And it's *easier* because they understand the occasional stresses and disruptions and 100% sympathise in a way that never-parents (unless they've had some near-parenting experience like raising a younger sibling) simply cannot. I couldn't. I cringe at how unsympathetic I used to be.

Shaper_pmp,default,,"&gt; a living fetus being murdered is an opinion. Whereas, a living woman's life being altered forever without her consent (in a possibly life threatening way) is a fact.

More accurately, the first one is a *definition* - an axiom, which to people who adhere to them are no less persuasive than facts.

To us, a foetus's personhood is an opinion, but to a pro-life adherent it's no less a *fact* than the idea that - for example - a black person is a real person.

&gt; The woman's life should trump the life of something unborn.

*Sigh*. You're doing it again.

First, you're conflating someone's life *changing* (no matter how involuntarily, or unfairly) with someone else being murdered. You don't need to remind me of the definitions we both agree on, but you really, *really* need to learn to conceptualise things from the other point of view, or you'll only ever talk past people, and you're never going to be able to say anything persuasive or worthwhile on the subject.

&gt; Whether the fetus is alive or not will be argued for eternity it appears, but you can't argue the life ruining consequences for some women who don't have access to abortion. Those women need to be taken care of and matter.

Let me try an analogy, to try to get you to at least *see* things from the other point of view.

**Warning:** It's going to be unpleasant, so please do bail out now if you aren't able to play with and discuss some fairly difficult ideas without getting upset.

Still with me? Ok.

----

Imagine you live in the deep south of America, two or three hundred years ago. Everyone around you owns slaves, and they can be bought, sold, maimed, injured or killed at their owners' slightest whim.

You, part of a distinct minority in the country, believe this is morally abhorrent - slaves are people, with inalienable moral human rights, including the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

You think that slaves should all be freed, and you *certainly* hold that it's self-evidently immoral to casually murder them.

Slave owners respond that slaves aren't *really* people at all - they're more like some sort of sub-human savage, like a cunning primate. Oh sure, they respond, with proper raising and education and training they may be able to one day *develop* into a proper, self-aware person, but that's not the same thing as *already* being a person, so short of that point you should be able to just kill them if you want to.

Moreover, slave-owners complain that they have a right to decide who lives on their land, and that trumps the slaves' right to life.

(Depending on how emotional you are at this point, you might even be tempted to ask what the fuck they thought they were doing buying the slave in the first place! Why didn't they just *keep their damn wallet shut* and resist the temptation to bid in a slave auction if they never had any intention of buying one in the first place?

This obviously isn't a completely fair reaction - sometimes people abandon slaves on your property that you then have to look after, sometimes people force slaves upon you that you don't even want, and sometimes you don't even know you're bidding on one until it's too late, but you could perhaps be forgiven for forgetting about all that in the heat of the moment when the alternative is the *systematic casual murder of innocent human beings*, right?)

Every time you object to the murder of slaves by plantation-owners, they respond with:

&gt; Well, what else do I do when I have more slaves than I can afford? I can't afford to keep them, so I'll have to scrimp and save and go without - I won't be able to move house or find the job I want, because I have to look after all these damn slaves I own.

&gt; What about my right to self-determination? **Why doesn't my right to live the *kind* of life I want trump their right to live *at all*?**

""That's horseshit"", you respond - ""they're clearly people, and you're clearly advocating their murder for little more than personal convenience!"".

""Well"", say the slave-owners, ""clearly there's a difference of opinion here. Whether black people are really people or not will be argued for eternity it appears, but you can't argue the life ruining consequences for some slave owners who aren't allowed to murder them when they have too many. Those slave owners need to be taken care of and matter.""

----

Made it all the way through? Excellent - well done, seriously. Breathe, breathe, count to ten... ;-)

Now, **exactly how convinced are you** to feel sorry for the slave-owners? Are you *remotely* influenced to support their right to murder innocent people for what ultimately amounts to their own convenience?

Are you tempted in the slightest that their imagined ""right"" to buy a nicer house or have nicer food to eat justifies the literal murder of any extra slaves they have that they don't want or need (remember, that they may well have casually bought themselves through negligence, poor planning or irresponsibility)?

Or do you perhaps feel *even more* disgusted with them for trivialising human life and their stunning, unbelievable levels of self-involvement and refusal to take responsibility for their own actions?

**That's** the mindset you're dealing with.

To clarify here **this analogy is complete bunk** - embryos and foetuses aren't African-American people, abortion isn't murder, gestation isn't slavery, a womb isn't a plantation in the American deep south and property rights and economic opportunities aren't the right to personal medical and bodily integrity.

**However**, I'm hoping that by giving you an analogy that you *can* understand, can you understand why your circular rationalisations and restatements of your position are so completely useless (hell, even *counter*-productive) in persuading a pro-life believer to reexamine their position on the subject?

What you have to do is *start* from their beliefs and axioms, and show that they're counter-productive, or factually incorrect, or self-contradictory, or lead to conclusions that the person you're trying to convince doesn't agree with themselves.

Circle-jerking and restating your position while *wilfully ignoring* their conceptualisation of an issue is pointless and frustrating at best, and at worst just makes your side of the debate look *worse* for unthinkingly trivialising things that their side thinks are important.",0,1471805767,,0,d6qviwn,t3_4yquy1,,5.0,t1_d6qtb0b,3362.0,1473525717,1,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1138282587.0,t2_1vzs,1471806594.0,,1
Shaper_pmp,default,,"&gt; My point is that people need to have more regard for the woman who is alive and in the world.

Yes, but that's just the pro-choice position restated again.

From the pro-life perspective you're arguing that that future-woman should be allowed to be *murdered* for the present-woman's right to maximise her medical options.

&gt; So what they're saying is that in the end that fetus (once born) doesn't have basic rights anyway. So WHY does an unborn fetus have more rights than the woman it turns into?

No, they're arguing that the right to *life* trumps the right to not be pregnant. Both life and bodily integrity are basic rights, but as with any two rights, when they come into conflict one of them has to take precedence over the other. You (and I) choose bodily integrity - pro-life people (unsurprisingly) choose life.

Don't get me wrong here - I'm pro-choice, and I don't agree their position mages sense, but until you learn to argue from the other person's point of view all you're ever doing is restating your position instead of debating or persuading anyone.

For example, to someone who thinks abortion is murder, whittering on about ""a woman's right to choose"" sounds monstrous, because to them you're taking about a woman's choice *to murder*. That's a lost debate before you even start.

Conversely, an *actual argument* would be to attack the definition of a foetus as a person, or to differentiate between things that with the right environment may form a person (say, sperm and eggs... *or an embryo*) and an actual self-aware individual with a wired-up brain, a consciousness and a sense of self.

Alternatively you can take their stated principles or priorities to their logical conclusion, and show that they lead to dangerous or abhorrent outcomes - for example, if they genuinely believe that the right to life trumps the right to bodily integrity, they should necessarily therefore agree that the government should be able to *compel* non-fatal organ donations from healthy people for terminal patients, which I think even most pro-life people would balk at.",0,1471796987,,0,d6qpry4,t3_4yquy1,,3.0,t1_d6qoj9a,2006.0,1473523634,1,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1138282587.0,t2_1vzs,1471800993.0,,1
Shaper_pmp,default,,"&gt; Neither option seems fair and neither option supports the basic human right for a woman to make her own health care choices.

This is a great example of a line of reasoning that seems utterly compelling if you *already* agree with its conclusions and framing, but completely worthless if you don't.

For us it's easy - foetuses aren't people, and it's a women's right to make her own healthcare choices.

If you disagree with that first assertion, however, you're literally arguing that women have the right to **actively murder** to maximise their healthcare options. You might as well try to persuade someone that women should be allowed to shoot someone dead if they need a liver transplant, or similar.

The key quotes for this article are (my emphasis):

&gt; There is one big question **this study can’t answer... why women start disappearing from management positions**. Was it that women were applying for the jobs and not getting them? Or were they deciding not to pursue management jobs, possibly because of the responsibilities they held at home?

and

&gt; It’s quite possible the answer is a combination of both. Researchers have found that the job application process can discriminate against mothers... **They tended to offer higher salaries to men and women** who were not mothers, and viewed applicants they knew to be mothers as less competent — even when they were looking at the exact same résumé.

&gt; At the same time, it's almost certainly the case that some women are choosing not to apply for management jobs. Positions that involve supervising other employees — being around to answer their questions and evaluate their work — can be more difficult to succeed in if you have commitments outside of work.

In other words while there are undoubtedly still some sexist tendencies to overcome in employment, they seem to be primarily (perhaps even almost *entirely*?) knock-on effects from sexist tendencies in trends relating to childcare.

Employers are less willing to trust to *mothers*, not ""women""... and while that rule should apply equally to fathers too if there weren't sexist gender-differences in childcare behaviours, the article is silent on that question.  Moreover, even if (as seems highly likely) fathers weren't equally penalised, that would be a problem with (possibly sexist) statistical differences in childcare traditions, not sexist employment or wage discrimination.",0,1473498837,,0,d7grqwy,t3_5203ov,,1.0,t3_5203ov,38496.0,1475516680,4,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1138282587.0,t2_1vzs,1473499116.0,,1

&gt; LONDON - More women must be included in United Nations peacekeeping missions to help restore credibility to troops marred by accusations of sexual violence and to protect women in conflict, speakers at a U.N. defence summit said on Thursday.

&gt; Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie, an active campaigner to stop sexual violence in conflict, joined defence ministers and military chiefs from around 70 countries at the summit aiming to improve the performance of U.N. peacekeeping operations.

&gt; UK Defence Minister Michael Fallon and other speakers called on U.N. member states to double the number of women peacekeepers by 2020 after UN Women data showed just four percent of peacekeepers in 16 missions globally were women.

Is it possible you just need a bigger size?  You might just be a bit roomier up there?  Not sure if you can tell when you spin it, but worth a thought.

I've always just inserted it pretty much vertically.  Just get it right up there.

It took me literally 2 years of trying it, it not working, getting frustrated with it, and then getting annoyed with tampons and going back again to finally make it work. 

What works for me: using a bit of water based lube, the origami fold, inserting at a 45 degree angle (not all the way horizontal), pushing it up as high as I can get it (it ALWAYS leaked when I wore it down low), making sure it's fully open, and instead of rotating it, I swirl my finger around it a few times while pushing upward",0,1462338623,,0,d2s36ln,t3_4hsdws,,1.0,t3_4hsdws,10843.0,1465622945,4,False,women,t5_2qh8d,1285846497.0,t2_4e2du,,,0
