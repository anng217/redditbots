1. **No one gives two shits about single middle aged men.** No one. Literally nobody. At all. People step over homeless men in the streets everyday like it’s nothing Bih! Feel free to MGTOW until your hearts content! 

2. **Rates of suicide are highest in middle aged men.** Why? See #1. Nobody gives a fuck about middle aged idiots who failed to integrate themselves into a community! These dummies purposefully isolate themselves from people and have no support group, get depressed and off themselves!


3.** Women go “WGTOW” all the time and we don’t need a “Movement”.** We just go get a couple of cats and be happy somewhere. Being a “cat lady” is 100% a choice and for most of these women quite preferable to be being bothered with a man. And most of us will have kids that will tale care of us.

4.** “Loneliness” is a male problem.** Women have vaginas. Bitch we can make brand new people whenever we feel like! We make ALL the people! The fuck men going to do without us?

5.** Old pussy is still pussy and therefore has value.** Old women still fuck! It’s the men who have problems finding someone to be bothered with their old decrepit ass which is why they’re always dying to get married at that age.

6. **Most women outlive most men**. So even best case scenario, women will likely “be alone” toward the end of their life. Even if you “do everything right” chances are he ain’t gonna make it. So why sit around and be bothered?

7. **Single Women are happier and healthier by every discernible metric**!

First date we had a great dinner and drinks at this nice restaurant then went to a bar and played darts and pool. I personally wasn’t expecting to have this much chemistry with him at all. Towards the end of the date he says we should hang out again the next day, I told him I’d let him know. The next morning he texts me and I end up going on another date this time we get brunch and play bowling and skee ball at this really nice place, then we go and watch this indie movie at a small theater because we both had that interest in common. We hang out a bit after the movie then head home. For both of these dates he paid fully, I did the whole pretend to reach for wallet thing but he responded with “with you’re with me you’ll never had to worry about that”. We held hands, shared Eskimo kisses and even made out towards the end of our second date.

This past week our texts have been a little wish washy and I called him out on it and he literally asked me when I was free to call me and apologize over the phone (which was really nice). Anyway, Thursday we plan our third date to the board game place which would’ve been really fun for Saturday night (today). I didn’t hear from him all day today so I decided to text him first to confirm if we were still meeting about 3 hours ago, and his reply was “Hey im so sorry. I am not going to be able to make it tonight :/“. My friends said not to reply which I haven’t. But I need a bit of advice:
1. Should I just take this as a lost cause and move on even though we had two amazing dates?
2. Should I reply to him or just wait for him to (hopefully) reschedule?
3. And overall, being a college student I though dating older guys would prevent this whole “cancel last minute sort of thing” is that the case based off of experience?

I’m fairly new to the dating scene and being a senior I’m college it’s tough because I feel like everyone in my generation is on the whole fwb thing. Which I like on occasion, but trying to find a guy who wants an actual relationship tough, my friends keep telling me to lower my standards so I could finally get a boyfriend but I’m too stubborn to do that. I’m also a virgin which tends to drive guys away a lot of the times. I’m fairly good looking, tall, although I could dress a bit better. Anyway, general advice is also appreciated.

Not because of how they are, but because they were able to build a whole community based off on getting the absolute most that they could out of themselves and dating/sex. They give each other advice with the goal of coming out on top and have built this comaraderie as a result. It saddened me that I couldn’t fathom women having something similar for themselves. 

I was initially over the moon when I found out about the existence of redpillwomen. I thought it was what I’d been looking for all along. I wrote many posts and got *some* good advice but as time went on, I realized a grave truth. These women weren’t focused on getting the most out of dating for themselves; they were focused on getting the most out of dating for MEN. All of their advice was given with men’s feelings in mind. While that’s all great and dandy, redpill men are definitely NOT like that. Actually, I’m pretty sure that the core of their ideologies is NOT giving a shit about women’s feelings. I couldn’t only stomach so much of these women protecting the very men who are disgusted by the idea of protecting them. Red pill men are for all for men. Red pill women are all for men. Who’s all for us?

* Please no MLM bullshit - no, we don't want to know about you being a 'boss babe' selling stupid vitamins. 
* Minimise the amount of food photos you post. Unless it's an absolutely Godly photo or birthday cake. Nobody cares you've had two cookies &amp; a cup of coffee at Starbucks on Tuesday and a croissant on Wednesday. 
* Don't overshare. No sappy vague descriptions - it looks like you can't handle your problems in your real life and need to fish for approval online. 
* Try not to make your page all about your relationship if you have a boyfriend. People come onto your page to see you, not your constant love-bombing - it makes you look like you're overcompensating. A real relationship doesn't have to be played out online. 
* Keep selfies to a minimum or avoid them completely - awkward photos taking from upward angles are just...not helpful for anyone.

Anyways a few days after that I asked him out and then he never responded??? But kept following me on Instagram?!!?! I gave it a week before I unfollowed him/removed him from my followers and unmatched on hinge, but I still find myself thinking of all the things we talked about and second guessing myself. Like what if I hadn’t asked him out would we still be talking?? I guess I’m just really confused :( he checked off all the boxes for me and now I keep thinking that there’s no one else out there like that.

A Pick Me is someone who excuses, justifies, or even tolerates bad male behavior because they think it makes them desirable. A Pick Me seeks validation from men for her tolerance of low effort bullshit. She doesn't value herself, and gets her security from male attention. 

How do I know this? Because I was one, for a long time. I let men make demeaning and degrading jokes about women (hell, I made them myself). I put up with low effort breadcrumbing because any attention was better than none.  I engaged in sexual activities I didn't want because I wanted to be seen as *having value*. In short, I didn't like myself or care about myself, so the validation I received from men kept my self-esteem afloat (or so I thought).

**How to spot a Pick Me:**

* Trying to be *one of the guys*
* Selling out her gender (""yeah, bitches are crazy"")
* ""I'm Not Like Other Girls""
* Normalizing lazy, low effort, low quality dating tactics by men. Advocating approaching/initiating with men, agreeing to low effort dates, insinuating that you have to provide sex to ""keep him interested"". Nah, girl. 
* Criticism of non-traditional gender roles, putting down women that don't want children, passing judgement for working moms, etc.
* Only having male friends (not saying this is true for everyone, but if she can't keep female friends that's not a good sign)
* Readily takes on the ""mommy"" role with men (cooking, cleaning, being too appeasing or accommodating, putting up with bad behavior, makes excuses for abuse/gaslighting/cheating)

  
**How to stop being a Pick Me:**

* You have to recognize your own worth. Something is making you trust mens' opinions of you more than your own. Do some soul searching and get to the root of your feelings of inadequacy. Therapy, journaling, support groups, meditation, researching codependency, and building strong female friendships that will act as sounding boards and build you up when you need it. 
* Remember that if you don't value you, a man won't value you. Men don't like to constantly have to reassure their partner; it's insecurity and weakness and even the most patient man will grow tired of it eventually. Don't walk into a relationship half a person, expecting him to complete you. **Only you will ever complete you.** The best he could ever do is enhance the life you've already created for yourself.
* Don't change yourself for him. He doesn't care if you're, like, *super* into baseball. He has friends for that. If that's not true to *who you are*, don't do it. You can be a supportive and engaged partner without molding your personality to fit his interests and lifestyle, and you can show interest in what he loves without letting it define you. Unless you're actually into baseball, then do you, girl.  
* Take honest stock of the relationships and activities in your life. Are you doing what you love, and spending time with people who truly care about you? Or are you trying to cultivate a persona of someone ""likable"" because that's what you think you *should* do? It's not too late to become your most honest self.

I later told him I still have feelings for him.

What happened was, he kept sending me memes back and forth and shitty auto tuned fuckboy music, for more than two weeks at that point. And he kept using me as an emotional punching bag and forcing me to absorb his daddy and mommy issues (I really did not mind but at that point if someone was going to be opening up to me on that level, I wanted to be in an actual relationship with them) 
And I lost it and said “look I want you to actually put in effort. Texting is not effort. I am asking for bare minimum” 
Bare minimum is what I wanted. 
Then I got messages like “you have school and I have work, your parents are too strict, we can’t make it work realistically” then “I choose to bury everything that makes me emotional” and then he had the nerve to tell me “I wanted to get high with you to see if we have a physical connection” “I wish I hadn’t opened up to you in the first place” etc

     Dating is a game ladies. Even in marriage, you’re still playing that game until you die. You always want to have the upper hand when your dating. You can love him all you want but it should not exceed his love for you. Every move you make is a STRATEGY.  You gotta play with his mind AT LEAST a little bit to stay on top. Don’t give your absolute all to a man because what else will you have for yourself? Don’t be too available, keep him on his toes, stay PRETTY, and keep parts of you a mystery. I’ve been in love before and still had the upper hand and power in the relationship because I did this.

I also believe your looks are a big part of your dating experiences. You have to dress and look like you can attract the type of man you want. Never do your makeup? Wear baggy clothes and sneakers? It may be a problem ladies 😭 it’s proven you get treated so different when you look polished every where you go; the difference after you level up is unreal!

Now I know we have all been guilty of this at some point, however if you analyse the average pickme out there, they are constantly doing this, wearing their awful relationships and rejections as a badge of honour *'I'm just too nice, why won't want anyone love me???' 'my last ex ghosted me'.* Just don't do it, even if you think its to 'compliment' him or because you think he's different. I used to do this in the past when I was younger &amp; naïve, *'my last ex was such a loser he cheated blah blah so I'm not looking to get messed around but you seem nice hehe!*' and every single time it came back to bite me in the butt. This is just handing the devil a map to your brain and its triggers. This is you telling him you have baggage, and he is possibly a rebound you’re not ready for, because you’re still hurt over your ex. To him this is you voluntarily putting a banner on your head saying ‘I have low esteem, validate me!’ whether you realise it or not. This just sets the bar low, he is thinking wow she was willing to put up with that, then she’ll probably fall for it again or at least put up with the bare minimum.

Lets introduce your new ex: He was a great guy, we had loads in common, same sense of humour/same morals, he was a gentleman and always taking me out, we did a few long haul trips together that he paid for...I felt really bad about ending it, cos I know he's a good guy but he just wasn’t *the one* for me, you know??

Super sweet and innocent. He’s thinking, OH he treated her well and she STILL cut him off, she must not be in a rush to settle? I respect that..I guess she really knows what she wants and is looking for something serious. Oh, I guess this is going to take some work then, If I want to stay in her good books, she's used to being treated well. He's also thinking, you must of been special for a guy to go to that length. Listen girl, we know no matter how nice and attractive you are, some men will attempt to devalue you and treat you like shit....but this new guy does not need to hear that. He needs to get the impression you're high value.

Now yes, this may scare him off and have him reconsidering if he knows he's low value and used to scraping by with his cheapo takeaway meals, half assed dick and occasional spurts of kindness, but that’s exactly what you want. If he's on the bullshit, he won't want to meet up to those standards its too much effort since he's just after sex. If he's broke he knows he won't be able to take you away somewhere any time soon and those fancy places you like going will soon make him reconsider because he's not trying to invest in you and he knows you'll wise up sooner or later.

I get it, it comes up in conversation and your telling a guy a long story about how bad some men have treated you in the past and how much healing you had to do yadda yadda .. 

This is a bad idea.

First of all, a lot of men don’t care about the abuse you went thru and it often does not add anything beneficial to your budding relationship. You’re essentially giving him the blueprint to you. 

Tell men how well past guys have treated you, how much your ex gave you and how much they were absolutely smitten with you. I often do this and it works (also because it’s true). It’s harder for them to devalue you and toss you out as damaged goods or whatever. You always want to seem like the girl every guy is lucky having.

I promise you, telling men your sob stories and vulnerabilities does not benefit you in the long haul. Of course they love vulnerability but it’s best to be strategic about what you reveal.

Let me know if this isn’t allowed 

Am I missing something?

Obligatory apology for my mobile use, I have no excuses for spelling and grammar.


So I’ve recently started seeing this guy who has been insanely nice and seems to really have all his stuff together. We’ve been on about 7 dates within the past month and a half and have taken it to the next level and are now sleeping together. We don’t get to see each other really all that regularly because we’re both pretty busy, but so far everything has pretty much gone perfectly.


So on to why I’m actually here. 


First of all, I don’t actually know how serious he wants to take things. We have a pretty big age gap and he has children and I don’t, so we had agreed to start seeing each other casually. Lately he’s loosely thrown around the bf/gf terms and has been using pet names (babe/sweetheart), but I haven’t met any of his friends or his children. I really do like him so I don’t mind it leading down this path, except for the fact that I feel like I’m missing something. That’s the main reason I’m posting this.


Now to catch you guys up a little, my relationships in the past have almost always been long term and pretty unhealthy. Because of that I also have minimal dating skills that are up to date. 


Since meeting him he’s been super polite, doesn’t pressure me at all and has a really calm easygoing demeanor. He has a stable career and what sounds like a stable support system with friends and family. He’s opened up about a few things that can be red flags but has been seemingly upfront and honest with those. My main problem is that I feel like I’m missing something with him. Now obviously I don’t know him really well, we haven’t been seeing each other all that long so I’m not talking about basic things, but more like a secret that’s like crazy messed up in one way or another. 


So to wrap up a way too long post here: Is this guy too good to be true or am I just so used to the men I’ve met being fucked up?

Fuckboys love GE Girls because they provide a semblance of stability and a steady stream of love, affection, and other benefits from a devoted woman while they continue to play the field. It's maximum reward for very little or no effort on their part. Fuckboys offer up all kinds of excuses for this behavior, saying things like ""I don't want to settle down right now,"" or "" I'm just looking for a casual thing"" or ""I only do open relationships"" (open for him but not for you), but on the other hand they will butter a GE girl up and tell her she's the ""special"" one out of all the girls he sees, or that he likes her best, or that she's the one he can see himself settling down with... someday. They are good at dangling promises of commitment without ever delivering.

The trouble with fuckboys is that they can be extremely charismatic, so women often end up as the GE girl without quite realizing what they've gotten themselves into. If you're hung up on a guy who insists on the right to keep playing the field while you're the one waiting for him to come home, take a hard look at the relationship and see if there's a balance between what you're giving vs what you're receiving.",24566,"Beware becoming/giving the ""Girlfriend Experience""",0,2019-10-28 16:04:15,,

We got back together and it has been a never ending mind fuck ever since.

Six months, ladies. Six months I crushed on this dumb ass fucker, who knew I was too good for him. Today, after months of reading through the sub, months of reading books like *He’s Just Not That Into You* and *Why Men Love Bitches*, I *finally*, fucking finally, see the light. I made all the stupid mistakes: being too available, being emotional, being needy, being “chill” and “cool” and overall being a big stupid dumb ass. I paid for dates. I stayed up late for his “needs”. He cancelled on me left and right.

Finally I removed him from SM, hardest was snap since we were besties (lol, what a fucking insane app this is). I will never date anyone that uses Snapchat again. Lesson learned. Thank you ladies so much for your hard truths. Thanks for this amazing space for women. 

I re-downloaded bumble last night and as much as I hate dating, I know I need to get out there and the quicker I do that, the quicker I can forget this guy.

Just remember that “I’m not like other girls” “I’m chill” “I’m low maintenance” “Other girls don’t like me, I prefer to have men as friends” “Women should be more like men” “Men are simple, women are complex” are pickme statements and attitudes, which may give you short term attention, but will not produce long term lasting results that benefit you when it comes to dating. 


Here’s the comment:


Chill” is the most self sabotaging word a woman can ever adopt for herself. 

Chill will get you dick but won’t get you the man 

Chill will get you “u up” texts at 2am but won’t get you “would you like my help” texts when you’re preparing for an important presentation

Chill will get you “I’m just not looking for anything serious right now” type of speeches but won’t get you “I want to build a life with you”

Chill will get you plan B in the morning after regrettable sex but won’t get you Advil and Chicken soup when you’re doubling over in menstrual cramps 

Chill will insist you go Dutch while the woman sitting beside you has never had to even pretend to reach for her wallet on a date 

Chill will get you low effort Nate but won’t get you I’ll do anything for you Matt. 

Stop that nonsense and delete chill from your vocabulary. Men will only give you the level of respect that you give yourself. If you don’t require anything from them, they won’t give you anything. Adjust your mentality and treat them accordingly.”

A person I wasn't familiar with was in the place I feel most safe, and I feel that his inappropriate boundary pushing with me escalated insanely fast in plain view of everyone, as did his drinking. I was deeply uncomfortable with his behavior but felt foolish for having snapped at him already once, guilty for making everyone else uncomfortable, and felt too outnumbered to speak up against his behavior. Behavior that pushed me to retreat to my locked room, unable to sleep for hours, making sure my stun gun was in reach, and listening intently for movement outside my door, afraid of this drunk man who had been plainly acting erratically towards me all night with no consequences. I still remember how fucking gross it made me feel when he would turn and look at me, almost leering at me.

I spoke to you about it hoping you saw my side and came away feeling betrayed. You didn't hold him accountable at all. ""He was drunk. He didn't know.""

Of course he was drunk. He had been pushing boundaries since the beginning, and being drunk is a GREAT social excuse to push boundaries and get away with it. He's acted socially inept in the past, and you've pardoned it to me, saying he needs to be taught. Of course he keeps acting socially inept, he knows he's not going to be held accountable for his actions and he can continue pushing boundaries as he pleases because everyone thinks he ""doesn't get it"" and ""needs to be taught""

This is why women get raped and assaulted and this is why they don't report it. I was scared of him sexually assaulting me. I wasn't the one he sexually assaulted, but this is his first step. He got so drunk and has a history of being inappropriate, so he knows he can get a pass this time around these people, and probably a few more passes too. He knows people will dismiss this behavior now. He knows the women he makes uncomfortable won't be taken seriously when they complain. 

I don't wish to discuss this any further, as I'm having an hard time dealing with it as it is. Pushing boundaries like he does is the a step into abusing people and I felt like you should be aware of that and how I felt. """,106913,I was put into a horrible situation by my roommates and wrote this to them out of frustration,0,,,

Should you avoid dating this guy? The signs will be there in the beginning. Namely

Narcissist is insecure, thinks the world revolves around them and lacks EMPATHY.

Signs of an insecure man is actually HARD TO SPOT. They’re like a chameleon. You need to be extremely discerning to pick up on a guy like this. But today I’m going to give you a HUGE PRO tip. The signs to watch out for AND how to “test” him to see what his true character is.

1. A sense of egotism. Watch out for the guy that boasts A LOT. This one is really tricky to spot. Yes he could be trying to impress you, but it’s also very likely he is extremely insecure.
2. A persistence to get their way. But this is very subtle and charming. Especially when you’re “unsure” or lack confidence in yourself. Is he regularly super insistent about what you should do, buy, eat, dress? Bad bad sign.
3. HATE being wrong. Eg. disagree with him about something on the first date and watch how he reacts? Does he subtly and charmingly try to manipulate your views so you “agree” with him? What if you stayed strong to your opinion or even flat out DISAGREED with him?
4. Bashes his ex or bashes any other singular or GROUP of people. Eg. calls his ex crazy, nuts, lazy, selfish, insecure, childish. Test him: ask him how he contributed to the end of that relationship? How did he contribute to being fired? How did he contribute to having money stolen from him? Can he hold any accountability for his actions? BIG ONE. Can he give specific details? Or is it something real general and generic. (NOTE: everything he complains about with his ex, will one day be the SAME complaint he has about you.)
5. He is 10x enthusiastic about you from the get-go. Talking to you for 8 hours a day. Spending all day and night with you after your first date. Moving in after a week.
6. He says ALL the right things. And you “want” to believe him - yet there is zero “long term” consistent proof of anything he’s promising you.
7. Lack of patience for your attention disguised as “care and concern”. Does he FREAK OUT if you don’t respond back when he wants you to? Test: don’t respond to him for one day and see how he reacts. Tell him you got busy, your phone died etc. I’m not for game playing, but this is one where you DO need to “test” him for.

The woman most susceptible to this kind of guy is a MASSIVE PEOPLE PLEASERS.

This is another reason why you should BANISH and STOP all people pleasing behaviours. It’s very low value behaviour, very fake AND you attract the most insecure, needy, narcissistic, emotionally abusive kind of men.

Be disagreeable, be yourself, stop people pleasing, and you will automatically spot this kind of guy so much faster.",12723,Signs You’re Dating A Narcissist On The First Date,0,2019-10-04 03:12:10,,

I just have an interesting question that I would like to hear your opinions and advice over because this question is constantly on my mind whenever I go on dates with guys but when do you feel is the right time to sleep with them or “go there”? I’m my situation I am not seeking hook ups or “casual fun” in anyway because I have found it’s not for me and I’m ultimately looking to eventually be in a relationship with the right person and I tell guys this straight off the bat before I even meet them. I also tell them I won’t be sleeping with them after the first date because I’m not the kind of person who just jumps in to bed with any guy who shows a bit of interest. The guys that are okay with this and want to proceed meeting me and continue on going on dates is fine but then if I don’t sleep with them after a few dates they do a slow fade and drop me even though I flat out told them at the beginning not to expect it for a while until I’m fully comfortable.

My issue is I don’t feel comfortable sleeping with guys after a couple of dates because in my eyes no matter how long our dates go and how much we’ve been talking they are still complete strangers to me. I’ve made shitty mistakes in the past of sleeping with dudes too soon after telling me that they are looking for a relationship and that they are serious about me only to find out 9 times out of 10 once the deed is done they slow fade me and tell me that they thought they were ready for a relationship and are only looking for something casual or they just complete ghost me lol.  And yes I know rookie mistakes I made! 

So with these things in my mind and reading a lot of dating forums I have read that most guys start pulling away after 3 or 4 dates if they ain’t getting any and will naturally assume I’m not interested or I’m a prude. So how long do you make them wait before going there?!",12586,When is the right time to sleep with him?,0,2019-10-03 22:51:50,,

I’ve been through a lot of painful shit these past 4 months, and these last couple of weeks have been the fucking worse....

I’m 27 and I met a guy on Tinder 4 months ago, who’s 59 and going on 60 in about 6 months. When I saw his Tinder profile he didn’t look 59 and he didn’t have his age displayed, he looked about 48 and now I realize the reason he didn’t really look his age is because he dyes his white beard. He has the facial folds of a man in his late 50’s but the beard dying made him look younger.

After being single for almost 2 years, I was so desperate to have someone in my life. I have extremely low self esteem and I don’t think that I’m physically attractive, so because of this I have been settling for any man who would give me attention. I now realize that I am better off alone than getting involved with sick and depraved men like the one I met 4 months ago....

From the beginning there were a million red flags that I ignored with my rose colored glasses on. I knew this guy was a piece of shit but I still convinced myself that loving this frog would make him turn into a prince eventually. Boy was I wrong...

A month after we were dating he started sending me very explicit porn pictures of other non-white women at 2:00AM in the morning from his Tumblr account which is chock full of porn (even cuckold porn which I now know that he is really into because he is a fucking cuckold himself), and he was asking me if I wanted to dress like these women. He claimed that he did not have a fetish for non-white women but his Tumblr account and the fact that he showed me that he watches porn called Cockasian proved otherwise; when I came over to his house for the first time he showed me a porn disc that was in his DVD player that read “Cockasian” on the front of it. If someone has a sexual fixation for certain races and is looking at pornography of certain races then they have a fetish for that race, plan and simple. Especially since he began to say fetishizing words to me, saying that I’m his “black queen with the hot black pussy” like wtf. He always tries to convince me that he doesn’t have a fetish... He looks at Sports Illustrated magazines of non-white women so how the hell can he say that he doesn’t have a fetish?

He cranes his head in the direction to look at other women in the streets and then deny that he wasn’t looking. And he even told me that when he watches porn he looks at other women’s genitals in a “clinical way”. Like he’s a fucking gynecologist, what a stupid fucking excuse to look at porn. 

He’s told me that he thinks it’s okay to be sexually attracted to his friends. When I asked him what race were most of his friends he said that they were non-white because he was not attracted to white women. 

Just recently I got into his Tumblr porn account and I saw him subscribed to a lot of porn blogs, even cuckold porn blogs called “black dick in my white wife’s pussy” , “fuck my wife”, and he was even following shemale tranny porn and porn blogs showing black dicks. He even asked me two times could I let another man fuck me and I told him no because that’s disgusting and fucked up.

My stupid ass got pregnant by him in July and he didn’t want the baby because he hates children so I went to go get a medical abortion thinking that was best for the baby. The abortion seriously fucked me up mentally....I was 7 weeks pregnant and I saw the baby fall out of me in what looked like a clear water balloon....I saw that the baby was in my sanitary napkin when I went to the bathroom and that was one of the most extremely traumatizing experiences I have ever had in my life..I don’t feel the same after having that abortion....I really wish I would have kept my legs close and I wish I would have never met this man.

He is porn sick and he got pissed at me when I was telling him how him watching porn made me feel disgusted, and he angrily told me, “all men watch porn so get used to it. The purpose of watching porn is to indulge in the fantasy of being with someone else without actually being with someone else”.

I’ve been feeling like it is too late for me to not settle for less and get a decent man because I felt like a good man will see me as disgusting for being with this sorry excuse for a human being that I call my boyfriend. This is the most fucked up relationship I have ever been in and I felt like I would be a defeating my purpose for wanting a good man when I knew better to not get involved with this piece of shit.",12508,Is it too late to want respect and not settle for less?

I know that may not seem like a lot, but it is what it is. My latest relationship ended out of nowhere, with the guy rebounding THREE DAYS LATER and is now in a long term relationship with her (someone we both knew whom he complained about a lot). I have a lot of frustrations, but mostly I’m frustrated that the men I’ve encountered expect the women they’re with to support them in a high-pressure and time-consuming career. However, when I need/ask for the most basic support, it becomes an arduous task for them! I’m a conductor (former band director) and my LTR my first couple years of teaching was really unhealthy (later found out by working with my therapist that it was emotionally abusive). I almost didn’t apply to grad school because of this guy. Every single guy I’ve dated has been a musician in the profession, so understands the demands of hours of rehearsals, having to be at football or basketball games for a long time, the pressure of putting on concerts, but for some reason there’s this double standard for when they need support versus when I need support! 

I feel like I am a solid person that would make a great partner, but I’m not willing to compromise what I want for my career. Maybe I’m looking in the wrong places, but I’m frustrated at not even knowing where to start dating! I’m trying to avoid dating other musicians, but honestly it seems like those people have the most in common with me. Any advice is welcome.

I've personally been on dates with guys who turned out to be married, guys who turned out to have violent criminal histories, and one guy who actually raped me. I'm not looking for sympathy, but I do want to point out some tips for you beautiful ladies:

**- Stay talking on the app.** It's a common TRP strategy to get you off the app and onto a messenger (text, whatsapp, snap) ASAP so they can unmatch you and escalate things sexually very quickly without getting reported. Don't fall for it. Keep convos on the apps until you meet in person, maybe even longer.

**- Observe how he responds to boundaries.** I posted about this yesterday, but I told a guy on Tinder that I wouldn't be meeting him in person for the first time at his home because that's not safe, and he lost his shit. He accused me of disrespect, and called me almost 80 times from blocked and unblocked numbers, whinging that he wouldn't be ""disrespected by women anymore"". Obviously this is an extreme case, but look for hints that he isn't respecting your boundaries or feelings. Things like negging, too much sarcasm (you'll know it when you see it), calling you a prude, badgering you for responses or criticizing slow responses, etc. All red flags.

**- Trust your intuition.** Gavin De Becker, in his AMAZING book **""The Gift of Fear""** said,  “At core, men are afraid women will laugh at them, while at core, women are afraid men will kill them.” Your gut instinct is a phenomenally powerful tool, and if something seems ***off***, it probably is. If he wants to meet privately and pushes back against meeting in public, block him. If he is dodgy about answering personal questions or is giving inconsistent answers, block him. If he gives you sketchy social media (i.e. a Snapchat that was made that day), block him. If he doesn't want to give you his last name or other identifying information that would make you feel more comfortable, he's hiding something. The amount of guys that want to **have sex with you** but don't want you knowing **basic fucking information** is too damn high. I'm not saying ask for his social security number, but basic info (name, occupation, general location) should be obtained before getting physically or emotionally invested. If he acts like that's too much, it's because that motherfucker has a wife and kids.

**- Ask the hard questions.** If you're looking for a hookup/FWB situation, don't let him shame you into not asking the important questions. Things like when he was last tested, his philosophy on condoms (pro-tip: ALWAYS FUCKING USE CONDOMS), his personal sexual preferences... These are all things you **should ask** and he should be **happy to answer**. If he pushes back against condoms or bitches about them, bye Felicia.

 **- Follow common sense.** If he plies you with alcohol, pushes physical boundaries too quickly, makes sexist/racist/demeaning jokes, or otherwise makes you uncomfortable *in any way*, GTFO. I went on a date with a guy who seemed cool over text. We met at a bar and immediately, everything I said he would aggressively counter with *""Is it because I'm black?!""* I would ask him questions about himself and he would keep going back to ""Is it because I'm black? That's why you're asking about what I do for a living? Is that why you want to know what my hobbies are?"" It was a huge indicator to me that he had some latent aggression, and it made me super uncomfortable (plus, if I were racist, why would I be on a date *with a black guy?*) Thankfully one of my friends happened to be at the bar so I made an excuse to go talk to her and he left. I say all that to say, you don't owe anyone politeness. You don't need to stay in an uncomfortable situation because you don't want to *hurt someone's feelings.* You bet your ass 99% of guys wouldn't stick around if they were the ones being made to feel uncomfortable, and it's time we women stop putting ourselves at risk or staying in a shitty situation just out of guilt.

1. Mediocre and avoids risks   (hello dating apps are virtually risk proof. Especially with “unmatching” features

2. Trapped by daily routine, gave up on goals. (Any guy that logs onto a dating app DAILY is trapped in a daily routine. C’mon ladies) 

3. Never faced bullies, avoids confrontation (this has GHOSTING written all over it) 

4. Rely on others to make decisions (probably a mamas boy if you dig deep enough to find out) my last tinder date flatout told me he was a manchild. 

5. Physically Weak (most men in dating apps are alcoholics and drug addicts and to me that = physically and mentally weak)

6. Friend zoned (their on the dating app and not with the woman of their dreams for a reason) 

7. Can’t say no or stand their ground. 

8. People make fun of them. 

9. Does nothing productive, throws potential out the window and chooses to be lazy. 

10. Make excuses 

11. No style, borderline slob 

12. No eye contact (I was on a date looking the man in the eyes the whole time and instead of taking it as me being present and respectful, he said I was giving him “sex eyes” 🤣😂🤣😂 that was a first)!

13. Not getting laid much (something 99% of men on dating apps complain about) 

14. Big Ego (🤢) 

15. Not a leader (why would a leader be on a dating app? He’s not!) 


It’s very clear to me that there are many alpha females looking for alpha males in the wrong place. 

Watch the video and tell me if you think you’ve come across some Beta Males trying to disguise themselves as Alpha Males. It’s very clear to me that I’ve come across many on dating apps.

Classic cheater who also sexually and emotionally abused me from time to time (though I didn't realize it was abuse while I was with him). After finally leaving him, I started dating again. I took about eight months to try to repair myself, but I ultimately still had low self-esteem and self-worth after all I had been through with my ex.

This reflected in my dating life. The last guy I dated was a prime example of what you don't do. I chased, I texted first, and I put him on a pedestal. I was his therapist and dotted on him. I treated him to outings. I did anything he wanted. I was down to hang out whenever he wanted, even it was a last minute date. I thought about him all the time. I was eager and tried very hard to please _him_ without expecting him to please me.

What ended up happening? 

Despite being the nice, considerate girl, I was slow faded after we had sex a couple times. That sucked and I was convinced it was me. I was convinced I was ugly. I wasn't attractive enough. There had to be something wrong with me physically, right? Why else would a man you treated well and did everything for walk out of your life? Sure, I had men at work hitting me up all the time. Yeah, a man on the street corner chased me down just to tell me I was beautiful. But if I was actually attractive, it didn't add up. 

That's when I found this sub. 

Instantly, I totally overhauled everything. Everything I'd been taught. Everything I thought was ""right"" was now turned on its head. I immediately got busy. I started up with my old hobbies I had relinquished after getting serious with my ex. I started salsa dancing again. I rekindled my love for French. I connected with friends I was isolated from in my relationship. I lived my life for me. 

What ended up happening? 

The same thing that always did. 

Men asked me out. 

Only this time, I changed the way I approached the men who asked me out. 

I wasn't always available. I didn't stop time and space to go out with them. If I had plans already? I stuck to them. If they asked me out at the last minute? I turned them down. If they wanted to see me then they needed to show me they planned our date in advance. My time is valuable. I would not be available _whenever_ for their convenience. 

Also, I didn't put them on a pedestal. These were _just_ men. They had proven nothing to me. Had they proven their value? Had they demonstrated their commitment to me? No, and I could easily live with or without them. I had my own life to live. My world no longer revolved around the men in my life. I was no longer interested in chasing because I could take them or leave them. 

Last, and most importantly, I valued myself. As I got out into the world more and did the things that once made happy again, I realized how valuable I was. I was smart, I was interesting, I was healthy, and I was kind. Before, with the last man I dated, I did not feel that was enough. I felt that despite all I had accomplished in my life, I was still lacking something. And what did I do? I compensated by chasing him and doting on him. Hoping that he would overlook the false deficiency I made up in my head. 

Now, I knew my worth. I knew how much of catch I was. Instead feeling lucky to have a man who had proven nothing to me, I now felt that a man would be lucky to have _me_. This subtle switch in a my frame a of mind made all the difference. I had upped my standards I knew all I brought to the table. What did he bring? And more importantly, how was he going to show it?

So thanks to everyone for this sub! Thanks for the advice and the amazing book recommendations. In just a couple months, so much has changed. I went from depressed and doubting my appearance/worth, to having two high-value men chasing after me. I hope I can continue to pass this knowledge down to other women!",11764,Implementing these strategies has changed my dating life. [Long Post],0,2019-10-02 19:22:15,,

We, as women, practice self-care in our appearance. We take meticulous care of our skin, hair, and bodies. We are careful about what we eat and we exercise regularly. Most of us have had skincare routines since we were in middle school. We have always managed to make time to take care of our appearance, even between our education, careers, and hobbies. That being said, at thirty and beyond all that hard work pays off big time for us.

&amp;#x200B;

[Women practice self-care at a young age.](https://i.redd.it/pn9krtm7vtp31.png)

**Males on the other hand?**

The average thirty-year-old male already has a receding hair line. His face has begun to bloat from the excessive alcohol usage and poor diet. A flat tire is already beginning to form around his mid-section. He has pre-mature wrinkles, sun damage, and uneven skin tone because he washes with Axe-3-In-1 Hair, Face, and Body Wash everyday and as never picked up a proper skincare product in his entire life. Throw in the erectile dysfunction from excessive pornography consumption throughout his youth?

Voilà, there you have it folks.

**The Male Wall.**

&amp;#x200B;

[Women are far more meticulous about caring for their bodies. ](https://i.redd.it/8g5x6k0yutp31.png)

Not only do men hit the wall, but they hit the wall *hard* and *fast* because they have done the absolute bare minimum to take care of themselves their entire lives. The female ""hitting-the-wall-at-thirty"" propaganda, on the other hand, is an absolute myth. It's a lie they propagate to comfort themselves about being turned down by that twenty-something-year-old woman that is way too good for him. ""*Someday she'll be thirty and no on will want her*,"" he says to comfort himself.

We all know that's complete bullshit.

Men will pursue a woman at any age. We need only to look to the older women in our lives to confirm this.

**The reason men who brigade this sub like regurgitate that false folklore is simple.**

1. They are low-value males.
2. They feel threatened.
3. They are offended and angry that you have standards. (Especially standards they cannot meet.)

Males that propagate this myth want to grind you down. They want to make you afraid. If you fear ""maxing out"" at thirty you're less likely to have high standards and present yourself as high-value woman. You'll be more anxious and insecure, and thus more likely to settle down (literally, settle) for a male that has nothing to offer. Why? Because you fear approaching this *mythical* wall. Take a closer look at the context in which these men bring up this argument.

*Example From a Previous Thread:*

* Woman discusses wanting men to pay for dinner.
* Male gets offended and threatened.
* Male tell her not to expect such treatment when she turns thirty.

Now let's *dissect* this interaction:

* Women sets out an expectation/standard for men in her life.
* Man reacts negatively because he is a low-value man who is threatened by a standard he cannot meet (monetary).
* He attempts to make her insecure to lower her standards.

[Low-value men \(aka losers\) become angry when you have high expectations.](https://i.redd.it/szc5g9ztutp31.png)

**Keep in mind that the men who propagate this myth are low-value.**

The type of men who brigade here (MGTOW, MensRights, Braincels) are low-value males. They have little to offer women and thus prey on women with low-self worth. They pursue women who have low-standards and little self-respect. By implying that you will become worthless ""post-wall"", they are attempting to make you feel low-value. (If you feel low value, you're less likely to hold men to high standards.) These men are both lazy and entitled. They feel they should be able to sack a woman without in any real effort or investment. *They don't want to have to prove they are worthy, likely because they are not.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Never abandon your standards, regardless of your age.**

Now that we've broken down this myth, remember never to abandon your standards. By internalizing this propaganda you will only put yourself a disadvantage. The moment you stop loving and respecting yourself (by seeing yourself as approaching or past the *mythical* wall), you become insecure, needy, and seek male validation. You don't want that! You must always remember your worth. The wall does not exist. You are a high value woman and your value is not tied to a number. You are allowed to have standards always.

Real men respect and want women with standards, boundaries, and self-respect.

My last bf commented on how I look good without make up and added, ""at least to him"". The next day I told him how cute his dad bod is and how I only dated super buff guys before. 

Don't take shit from men. Give it back to them with a smile on your face.

**Questioning your intelligence and emotional stability -** Also logical thinking, education and knowledge of certain issues, because they feel threatened by smarter and more educated women.

When a man implies you're not rational/intelligent enough, remind him of some stupid, irrational, emotional thing they did or said. When my of my exes implied women are the emotional gender, I reminded him of the time we nearly broke up and he started crying, thinking I will leave him. 

**Questioning your abilities** \- For example, men frequently questiioning driving skills of women despite being much more deadly on roads. This is one of my favourite statistics. Ratio of men vs women involved in deadly road accidents is 9:1. Men are wreckless drivers who project their own lack of driving skills into women, who are much more careful drivers by comparison.

**Questioning your sex life and relationships -** judging you for sexual past, because they doubt their own sexual prowess and penis size. It's best to keep them in mist regarding this. If you speak of your exes, never speak in things your bf would be interested to know (too graphic and too sexual topics such as partner count and penis sizes). You don't want to put those images in their head unless you really want to hurt them and evade answering any kind of.  Men ask these questions because they're silly sometimes and like hurting themselves, but lucky for them, you're smart and you know how to deal with this:

Speak only about *behaviours* of your exes that you would or wouldn't like to see in your current bf - ""oh my ex really knew how to listen to me. I love men who are good listeners"" and ""my ex was a dear, but such a slob. His dishes were always dirty, I hated his apartment"". This will guide your bf in the right direction. 

**Questioning your world/political views** \- This depends on the intention. If a man is really interested in let's say, your feminism, and wants to know why you're a feminist, tell him about it. If he's obviously being negative about it, give him a specific reason for why you're a feminist. My reason is ""because women didn't try to gang rape me when I was 13, men did"" and usually makes them shut the hell up. 

If he continues to push mgtow/right wing/anti female bullshit, I keep my smile on, block him on my phone and never see him again.

Left wing men aren't necessarily great either since they're defenders of porn and prostitution, but they're better choise to date and far more flexible. Studies show conservative men are, on average, less intelligent and more aggressive. Since I want only the best genetic material, I avoid right wing men and choose left wingers.",24336,5 Common ways men gaslight you,0,2019-10-28 14:05:12,,

Hey ladies, 

I’m going to start a series on ways to be aware and counteract some common tactics that redpillers use to try to manipulate women and share with you some of my experiences and basically things that I’ve tried and that have worked to either shame them for their behavior or ways that I’ve used their foolishness for my own benefit. 

I’m a huge advocate of women being aware of the existence of redpill subs. When a woman asks me for any kind of dating advice, I typically find a way to mention it, tell her about the tactics they commonly advocate and use to get women to sleep with them and to take advantage of women. For some, I show them redpill subs and links. Sometimes, they have a lightbulb alert where they recognize that some of the tactics have been used on them, some of the common RP phrases seem familiar, and they share how they were confused about their feelings and weren’t sure how to respond. 

Again, the advice given on this series is derived from a combination of experiences I’ve had dating some highly suspected RP men and just from the things that RP men on reddit and other forums list as their tactics. 

Let’s start with number 1:

**Negging**

- “You look good in this light”

“You’re pretty for a black/Asian/Hispanic/(insertanyminorityhere) girl”

“You have nice hair...is it real?”

“You have pretty eyes, are they colored contacts”

“Your hair is stunning, but your roots are showing”

“You’re not my type but I can see why some other dudes would be into you”

Basically, a neg is a backhanded compliment, and the aim is to knock off your self confidence/esteem and make you feel less attractive or less valuable, so that you might possibly give him a chance. Men know that they’re low value, and so for a lot of them, trying to convince a woman that she is low value, is the only way she would consider having sex with them. Or sometimes it’s used as a way to get the girl to be the one to try and prove herself to him. 

The most important thing about negs is that you can recognize them. This is because I know that not every woman is witty enough to think of the best comeback on the spot. And so even though a comeback would be the best response, every neg might be slightly different and the context in which it’s said might be different. 

If you’re not the witty type, once you recognize that you’re being negged, the best thing to do is to say nothing while staring at him for a few seconds, smile and then walk away. It sounds simple, but since the goal of him negging you was to make you kinda insecure to the point where you accommodate him, acknowledging his neg and then walking away would make his attempt unsuccessful. 

If you are the witty type or you do want to say something and can’t think of anything else in that moment, a guy’s height is always a good never-fail target. Men get very insecure about their height. Making any comments about it, will drop their self confidence down a peg and have him try to prove to you that despite his height, he still has some kind of value. Even if he’s already a tall guy, making a comment about how your ex was taller, would knock down a few layers of confidence that he may have been deriving from being relatively tall in the first place. 

Here are some other examples of ones I’ve personally used:

“Your short height is so cute!”

“You’re wearing that? You must be confident in your masculinity”

“That’s a great story, would probably be funny if you told it better” 

“Oh” accompanied by a slight sad face/frown after he pulled down his pants right before sex. And then say nothing’s wrong when he asks. 

“Your hair is cute, I didn’t know men wore haircuts like that”

“I don’t usually date short guys, but for you I’m considering it” 

“I love that shirt. It hides your belly very well” 

“You’re cute but I bet a beard would make you look more like a man”

...stuff like that. Feel free to adopt any of these into your arsenal for whenever you’re being negged by a guy. 

Also, don’t listen to the men that’ll tell you that negging doesn’t work on guys. It’s a lie that’s designed to fool women so that male manipulative tactics have a better chance of working. A lot of men are dumb and very easy to manipulate. They’re very dependent on their self confidence and any hint or suggestion that they may not be as good as they think they are, ultimately makes them start trying to qualify themselves to you. Sort of as an attempt to prove you wrong. Use this to your advantage. 

Your seemingly unimpressed attitude will draw him in and this hot guy who had projected confidence would become putty in your hands. Works for me and I know it’ll work for you too. 

Enjoy!

Hey ladies, 

I’m going to start a series on ways to be aware and counteract some common tactics that redpillers use to try to manipulate women and share with you some of my experiences and basically things that I’ve tried and that have worked to either shame them for their behavior or ways that I’ve used their foolishness for my own benefit. 

I’m a huge advocate of women being aware of the existence of redpill subs.

For some, I show them redpill subs and links.

We desire the same love and affection in which that the majority of us, who are genuinely good people, and make great partners, will try so dearly and go out of our way to provide to you.

When I first took a look at this subreddit, in honesty, I was genuinely disappointed. 

Many women preach about how they just want a good guy to love and comfort them, but don’t seem to realize that they would have this if more of you would give your attention to the men who aren’t always striving to try and look popular or cool or whatever. I think that this is largely the reason that many of you women whom I have seen posting on this subreddit seem to be exclaiming that you can’t find a single good man, or that we are all terrible but this is entirely untrue.

Do you really believe that you deserve to have a man in your life who provides these things that you all say you want in a man, like support, maturity, love, respect, compassion, the list goes on. Do you really believe that you deserve those things when you guys are on this subreddit talking to each other about how you don’t even give men chances, even if there are zero “red flags” about the men who are simply wanting to get to know YOU, not as an object or anything like I’ve seen some people describe that you believe men treat you as, but as a real person, who that man is attracted to, and wants to get to know?

Seriously, ladies. I saw some things that caught my eye in this subreddit, primarily the sexism.

I’ve noticed that many of you women on this subreddit, whether intentional or not, whether you can admit to it or not, are being extremely sexist. I say this because I saw several things right when first discovering this subreddit which caught my eye. For example, I saw a “Dating Strategy” that said “How to never, EVER pay for dinner” and you see, this really caught my eye, and really disappointed me, because that would mean that you women are preaching about gender equality, and most men support you entirely, but you guys still choose to make choices like that dating strategy which go completely against gender equality.

Hear me out on this, if men and women are completely equal, then what makes you think you should not ever even help out to pay the bill for dinner, just because that is supposed to be “Society’s norm”? 

I think that the best advice I could give you women, coming from a male, is that you need to show the respect, love, and passion towards the men you are attracted to just as much as the good men go out of their way to show to you. Also that, ladies in this subreddit whom have made posts about how you think all men are evil, or you cannot find any man who will simply show you the respect that you want, or “deserve” then you should try giving the men who genuinely just want to get to know you for you a chance, and also maybe check yourself, and think about your values and your possible subconscious, or unintended inequalities towards your male counterparts, and maybe try something different.


Now I am most definitely not saying that most females are sexist towards men, or don’t give them the respect in which that they themselves desire, but just that, for those of you who may think this way, even just a little bit, maybe try something new, shoot your shot, talk to the guys who are less of social-butterflies, I bet it can help you find what you’re looking for.



Thanks for reading, by the way.


Also, I only chose to make this post because I recently got into a relationship with the girl who I’ve been crushing on and wanting to talk to for months, and everything is going amazing. Why? It is because when I just poured my heart out to this girl, she gave me a chance, was honest about herself, and gave me her heart just the same, and that only happened because she was willing to give the guy who was more introverted, much less of a popular person, or social butterfly, a chance. 


Be safe, and please, once more, be open-minded and respectful towards us men. We might try to look tough or a certain way, but truthfully, almost all of us have just buried our emotions and are big softies desperate for a loving relationship with somebody who actually understands and cares about their feelings.",23683,"I’m not female, but this seems like a good subreddit for me to talk about this.

He got mad that I dare to tell him he's not supposed to watch this kind of stuff. He told me he has a shit filter and watching won't affect him and he can watch different points of view and pick what's his opinion. 
I asked when was the last time he watched something  with different point of view ( something saying that women are not evil)
But I knew the answer. 
My boyfriend is rather conservative, I often lecture him about things related to women and other races/genders. 
I said I can't be dating someone who agrees with this kind of opinion. He agreed and told me we should break up. (We've been dating for 2,5y and moved in together recently)

2. ""Openminded"" woman are open to be cheated on. *HIM: Babe I wanna see another girl  YOU: But we said our relationship would be monogamous HIM: Why aren't you openminded about this? YOU: Because I communicated my boundaries and am sticking with it.* 
3. ""Openminded"" woman will accept the excuses for his behavior
4. ""Openminded"" woman are okay with being told what to do and that they should ""go with the flow""
5. ""Openminded"" woman will not challenge his ego

Just say no.

In terms of dating, not having a strong base/ friend group/home/family makes me live bait for predators (narcissist in particular). 

So basically my question is 

1) how do I attract a wholesome kind of person? I have a lot of trauma and I need to be able to trust the person if it’s going to be anything other than superficial. 

And 2) Who is my family? Who should they “fear”? Who is the higher authority who will “approve” of them?

It's a place where we can talk about dating strategies, support each other in our own dating journeys, and to have a sisterhood to lean on. For those who don't know what Discord is, it's currently the best chatting platform on the internet to connect with your friends. You can safely and easily download the app on your phone and/or laptop! **I highly recommend joining this community so you can have instant access to chatting with like-minded gals who can guide and inspire you. It's a moid-free space.** 

Here's the link: [https://discord.gg/awCFKgw](https://discord.gg/awCFKgw)

In order to get verified and let into this server, **firstly,** please answer the following questions and message them to me on Discord (not on Reddit). Be as detailed as you want.   

1. What's your age and location?   
2. What are your current goals with men and dating?    
3. What are you currently doing to improve yourself (or what you're planning to do)?    
4. What lessons on dating and men have you recently learned?    
5. What's your Reddit username?  

**Secondly**, you have two options to verify that you are indeed a woman. We do this to avoid moids in our server. 

**The first option:** Send a selfie of you holding up a paper that has your Discord username on it.     
**The second option:** Record yourself reading out loud the answers to the 5 questions above on vocaroo.com and then send the link to me. Note that [vocaroo.com](https://vocaroo.com) only allows recording on laptops and PCs, not on mobile.

After my disaster bar date this week with the'male feminist', which I stayed pretty much sober for, I am point blank refusing this. Its easier for them to pull the *'take turns', 'you get this round'*...rather than a sit down meal. And then you can expect that on every date ever.

I've had 2 this week tryna plan a fun 'night out' drink date  - mmm no thanks. With me being a huge 0-100 lightweight that rarely drinks anymore, this is NOT a good idea lol. 

 You need to keep your head on straight and have your best super feminine girl next door persona going on *(yeah you know the one, ease them in before the feminist comes out)*. If you have too many vodkas and start grinding all on his groin on the dancefloor- you know that's gonna turn left super quick. He knows this, which is why he wants to get you drunk.

Lie, say you're not a big drinker, say you're on antibiotics, say you have a hangover from lastnight, say your dad died from alcohol poisoning (ok maybe not the last one). 

If he springs it on you or something with 'I know this great bar!', say *'Oooh you know what I'm kinda hungry and I need to line my stomache first',I know this great place..'*. That's nice and innocent, and he should oblige.

They’ll misbehave and overstep their boundaries from time to time, but they can be trained. I have a few ideas of an appropriate punishment for a man if he is to disobey.

1. Squirt Bottle


Now this is a classic method to control an animal, and it unsurprisingly works on men too (since men are animals). Fill a squirt bottle with warm water, and anytime your man says something you don’t like, spray his face. For extra punishment, mix in some hot sauce in the spray can as well so that it burns when squirted on their eyes. Remember, if he fights back after being squirted, he committed assault, and you can get him thrown in jail for years. It’s a flawless strategy.


2. Threaten To Accuse Him Of Rape


Anytime your man says or does something you don’t like, scare him with accusations of rape. You have the power to get him thrown in jail for life, so why not use that power to your advantage. 

3. Whip Him


Now this strategy of punishment is more expensive, so I’d recommend forcing your man to pay for it. Get him to buy a whip, so that anytime he misbehaves, you can whip him. If he refuses, threaten false rape accusations on him. If he fights back, that’s assault. Truly a flawless way to punish a man. Make sure to whip the same spot if giving multiple lashes to leave a permanent scar to remind your man what happens if he disobeys.



Please give your own strategies to punish men in the comments, and like this post if it helped. If none of these work, you could always bite his dick while giving head which has worked for me before. Thank you for reading.",22618,How To Punish Your Man,0,2019-10-27 22:00:53,,

I contacted him yesterday to have the screenshots as proof and he told me that since we met on a dating website, I should be expecting this.

When I told him that people meet on dating website to date and not to be groping the butt or boobs, he told me to grow up. 

He showed no remorse for his actions and even had the audacity to say that I enjoyed it. I told him that I never said and that I told no to kissing/touching my boobs and that I was feeling so uncomfortable- how he cannot remember all that?

I posted on the residency sub and everyone asked me to report him. 

This morning I spoke to someone whose husband is a retired police officer in the US and they told me not to report it. Because it has a lot of grey area and the police would question why I went again with him to ikea after he groped me the first time  and why I didn’t stop the date after meeting him at the restaurant?

And what was my tone when I said no. Did I say it firmly ?

I am usually very timid. I said no but I didn’t shout and say no. So they said all that could mean I was playing hard to get. It would just go to court and would just leave me miserable.

And if I complained to the Program Director and if he loses the job that he tried so hard to get for so many years that could make him very angry and he might try to physically harm me anytime later.

So they are asking me not to complain.

I have decided not to complain to the police because I don’t have the financial support to do that. 

I was planning on complaining to the PD - should I report him or not? If I report him to the PD and if he loses the job, I am very scared if he will physically harm me like find out where I live and kill me or something.",101687,Update to my previous post- about me getting groped on the first date.,0,,,

For starters, I’m a 17y/o and a senior in high school. I’ve always higher standards and been high maintenance but in school the past 3 years, there was a significant change in my views and I was starting to be more libfem. It doesn’t help that most of my friends are pickmes. But thanks to this sub and femininity youtubers, I’ve become more high maintenance than I’ve ever been in the past. 

But anyways, today I was at the mall with my friend (G). I got all dolled up for this and made sure I looked very elegant and classy just so I could feel good about myself. In the jewelry section at many places, I said how I only want sterling silver or gold plated items which G found a bit extra of me but she was fine with it. Later we passed by a bedroom shop and they were having a sale on bedsheets. I mentioned how I needed bedsheets but I prefer 800-1000 thread count and that the bedsheets on sale were of cheap quality. Then G said I was high maintenance really loudly that the girl in front of us looked at me and started listening in our conversation and laughing. I said “and that’s a good thing” and G said “yeah I guess” hesitantly. More happened but I don’t want to make this passage longer than it needs to be. 

I’m really happy. I like leveling up and I can’t wait to be in college and pursue high education. Also, I’m so proud of myself that I don’t care about the girl that was laughing at me when she heard I was high maintenance. In the past, I would’ve felt super bad if I didn’t meet anyone standards. But now I meet my own standards.",101685,I just got called high maintenance🥳,0,,,

I said that sounded awful and I truly wanted to marry for love only. They aren’t into arranged marriages just marriage at any cost.

Just a quick reminder that Coronavirus is NOT an excuse to accept LV behaviour from dates. 

Many men have been appearing online during this time thinking that it is ‘safe’ for them. Safe in the sense that they now have excuses for not putting in the effort. Safe in not wanting to get to know a date properly. Safe in not making any future plans.

Let’s not lie to ourselves and to our gut instincts. When someone really wants something— they find a way to get it or they find an excuse. Obviously we should be keeping to the limits and measures put out by our country of residence in order to allow everyone to exist in a healthy environment. However, we should also be seeking out opportunities to get to know others with other ways of contact.

We are still able to chat on the phone or through an online call. We are still able to deliver gifts through the mail. We are still able to show our care and appreciation through ways that are contactless.

Be very wary of men who will tell you online that they ‘have no guarantees for your future’, who don’t message back, who don’t put in the effort to make you feel special and who will actually bring up the coronavirus as an excuse for only chatting through an app with you half heartedly. Couples have found a way through wars, politics unrest and they will be able to find a way through the pandemic. Do not accept lack of effort just because we all wear masks and are confined at home.

The LVM had been a major scrote, who was obsessed with sex, had all kinds of abusive kinks, and constantly ignored the fact that I was uncomfortable with all this. He never said a decent sentence about me in the way of a proper conversation, never asked me how I was, nothing to indicate that I meant anything to him. Despite me calling it quits and trying to be my own self, respect my own boundaries and stand up for myself, he kept lurking around, messaging me, again with no signs of apology and full entitlement. 

What amazed me and basically told me it was some kind of sickness that this LVM harbours, is when he used to text me, and unsend his messages- like very often. Gaslighting and keeping me on the hook! Used to send follow requests and then remove me from his followers, then keep following me and unfollow me- the whole childish rigmarole of social media follow/unfollow dynamic. 

After months of blocking him, I see a “like” on my OLD from him on one of my pictures that he really liked. When I ignored responding to his “like” he just deleted his profile from the app to essentially show “he unmatched” with me.

I know I’ve tried really hard to not be a pickmeisha and further his LVM actions, but it just gets to me how much of an ego trip he gets from doing something to irk me or get my attention and then undoing it to show what, umm, that he doesn’t want this anymore? I’d really like some FDS insights on how I should read into this? 

Also, have again blocked him from everywhere so that’s something I’m absolutely taking from all the brilliant FDS queens out there! ❤️",101659,Scrote sickness galore!,0,,,

They claim they go 50/50 because they don’t want to invest in a woman who is going to ghost them and waste their time. While I understand that fear, it comes from a place of inadequacy. Men who think like this know they are insufferable and nobody likes being around them, so instead of going to therapy or introspecting, they punish the people around them. 
 
Could you imagine going through the hiring process and thinking like this with a company? “Well I’ve wasted my time on interviews in the past, so now I’m going to show up dressed casually and care less to win them over. I also won’t upgrade my resume to help me stick out from the crowd .” It doesn’t make sense to pursue something without pursuing it at all. 

As we’ve all addressed, women statistically make men’s lives easier. They are the ones who seek us out because they lack solid, loving relationships with other men and can only find intimacy and care through romantic relationships with women.  That’s why they expect us to be their therapists, sex slaves, maids, and more. We are an investment to them because we make their lives easier. 

So would it be smart for an investor to put as little money into an investment and still expect all the benefits of being a majority shareholder? No. So why do these men think it’s okay to go 50/50 during the courting stage? Because they have nothing to invest with to begin with. Physically and metaphorically they are broke. They know this. Do not let a man convince you going 50/50 is okay. He is hoping you are insecure enough to not realize how much of an investment you are and still get all the benefits.",101657,A man going 50/50 is him expressing he is insecure,0,,,

We got married this summer and I can truly say that he is the love of my life :) 

When we first moved in together, there were no surprises at all because I already knew him so well. Life was actually easier because I didn't have to cook, clean and do groceries by myself all the time. When I was living with roommates, I would often eat random stuff because it was so tiring to cook for myself everyday. Now that my husband also cooks half the time, I'm eating healthier and eating less takeout. We both care about making the other person's life easier and so this makes living together really easy. 

Here is a list of things you can look out for to see if you and your SO would be compatible as life partners: 

1. Do your core values align (i.e. religion, spirituality, political beliefs, etc.)? How would you both like to raise your children (if that is what you both want)? 
2. How do you both view money (i.e. are you a spender or a saver)? How would you both like to sort out finances once you are married? How much debt do each of you have, and how do you plan on tackling this once you two are married?
3. What are your life goals/dreams? What are your partner's life goals/dreams? Are these goals compatible (i.e. career, lifestyle, kids or no kids)? 
4. Have you both lived with roommates before? Living with roommates teaches you to respect other people's spaces, to divide chores, pay bills together, and be flexible with other people's living habits. I have friends who have never lived with roommates (they only lived with family, then alone) and they had a lot of trouble adjusting to living with their SOs because they were very rigid on how they would like their home to be like. 
5. Spend lots of time at each other's places. It is nearly impossible for someone to fake being clean every time his girlfriend comes over. I saw that my husband's apartment was cleaner than my place lol. My room is always messy and I told him that if he lives with me, he'll just have to accept this. Thankfully living with him has forced me to be more clean because I have to be considerate for him too, and not just look out for myself.
6. Discuss expectations for your everyday lives. Will you have friends come over frequently? Do you want some time alone to relax, instead of spending all your free time together? How often would you like to see each other's families? What is your daily routine like? 
7. Travel together!!! Travelling brings out people's true character. It shows how someone reacts under stress, how someone plans, and how they deal with unexpected things. My husband and I didn't get tired of each other, even though we were together 24/7 for 1 week in a foreign country. By the end of the trip, I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him, experiencing adventures together. We had so much fun together, we didn't argue, and he even became awfully sick for the past few days and I had to take care of him. We functioned like a team of best friends and it was honestly my favourite trip ever. Even now during quarantine, we don't get tired of each other. We'll just lounge around together, while I read and he plays video games with his friends. Even when there is nothing new to talk about, we just feel so comfortable with each other. 
8. Watch how he treats his family, especially the women in his life. My husband is very close with his family and they are so loving towards one another. I am also very family oriented, so this was a huge thing for me. 
9. What are his views on women? Does he recognize his privilege as a man? My husband is very pro-women. We both used to watch porn, but when I discovered how awful the industry is and asked that he stop watching it, he did. We frequently have discussions on feminism and sexism and he is always eager to learn more. 
10. When you communicate issues, does he actually take this into consideration? For example, I told my husband that I didn't like when he did this one thing. He actually listened and stopped doing it! Communicating only works if you the two of you are already in a healthy relationship with mutual respect and love. 
11. How does he act during times of hardship? I am a sexual assault and rape survivor and I now suffer from PTSD. My husband has actually witnessed me at the worst points of my life, and he has done nothing but support me this whole time. When we just got engaged and I didn't have insurance yet (I just started my job), I didn't want to get a therapist because of how expensive it was. He paid for my therapy sessions because he told me he cares about my mental health and well-being. 
12. Does he support your dreams? I wanted to study abroad while we were just dating and he was 100% supportive. We had a temporary LDR and it only further solidified how much I wanted to marry him. I want to do my masters next year and he is so on board, even though this means that I'll be losing half my income temporarily. 
13. Is he generous with his time, money and in bed? A man who is generous in daily life will be generous in bed too. Does he go out of his way to make your life easier, or do sweet little things for you? 
14. Finally, is he committed to you? If you find yourself having to beg for commitment (whether that is to become exclusive, or to get married) then he is just not into you and you need to leave. 
15. Does he make you feel loved everyday? My husband always compliments me. We always cuddle. He always tells me he loves me. We work different shifts, so when he's at work he'll always text me ""good morning"" or ""how are you?"" texts. He'll buy me random sweets or my favourite food on his way back from work, or while he's doing errands, just because! He is just so sweet :)

Throughout the last years of my life (I'll turn 23 in December), I've gotten noticeably uglier than when i was, say, in high school.
I've never been super pretty, not even average, I'd say below average. Now, i am aware that I've never even been feminine: always have had a tomboyish style and way of being in general, but still i used to get the attention of men anyway. 
Unfortunately, as i said before, i got phisically worse: copious hair loss due to chronic stress and thinning of hair, my back got crooked and my face has become gaunt due to not sleeping and eating properly.
All this stress and worsening of my phisical aspect and health has definitely been due to mental health conditions I've suffered since i became a teenager (depression, anxiety, BPD, and a period of anorexia who, of course, was praised by people as i lost a lot of weight) who gotten worse through these couple of years due to me deciding to date LVM and consequently getting screwed over.

Now, since i realized the errors of my way, I've noticed a thing: 
- when i was prettier than i am today, men didn't bat an eye when i rejected Them because i wanst interested, (I've never been mean about the way i did it), at most they gave me a bad eye. 
- these days, when i don't give my time to some man who wants me to send nudes or entertain him, i get insulted and called names because i am already ugly so i should be glad somebody gives me their time of the day.",106690,have you noticed this double standard? what does the FDS communicate think about it?,0,,,

The man posting, as well as his wife, is into the lifestyle. He had the nerve to tell his wife that he had the best sex in his life with another woman they were swinging with.

Amazing sex differs for each gender. Women report having the best sex when they feel safe, secure and comfortable with their partners AND their partners are willing to please them (along with an orgasm too). Men have the best sex when they are enacting a fantasy and/or their partner is confident and passionate in bed.

Men complain that too many women ""starfish"" in bed, don't like sex or participate in half assed sex. Men internalize this because how a women behaves during sex becomes a reflection of himself. Porn star levels of performance gives his ego a boost and make him feel better about himself. Men supposedly love their partners through sex since they have a difficult time expressing their emotions ( this makes no fucking sense when they cheat though). Too many men use sex as a band aid instead of dealing with their emotions. In the end, sex is just ego food for men because it makes them feel good. 

What men don't realize is that they tell on themselves when they complain that the women they're with aren't passionate in bed. Either you suck in bed and/or you judge women for liking sex. If a guy is hitting those Os, she's not gonna lie there.

Women have to be comfortable in the bedroom to feel sexy. If they feel like they'll be judged, they won't go the extra mile to be passionate.

This all stems from the fact that women aren't raised like men are. Women don't have their parents' blessing to sexually explore themselves. Men are taught about the game, get boxes of condoms and are told to sow their wild oats. Women are taught that liking sex is wrong and get advice on how to keep themselves pure. They see societal consequences when women dress provocatively or have too many partners. Women don't want to be labeled or judged for possibly looking like a ""whore"".  

I feel like more women would sleep with men sooner, but they want to avoid being labeled a whore. Some men say that they can't be in a relationship with a women without sleeping with her first. What they fail to realize is that most women need to feel safe and secure to have sex. If she feels you're trying to use her, she won't have sex with you. This is why too many men lie to get sex from women. Women need to and have the right to date you to figure out if you're compatible outside the bedroom first.

The men that leave women after they refuse to have sex early are only looking for sex. Because they picked with their dick, they fail to realize that the woman isn't compatible in the long run. This type of thinking is how dumb groups like the mgtards happen. They were thinking with their dick then have the nerve to get upset when their gf/wife cheats or something.

If men stopped judging women for liking sex, worked more on making them feel comfortable in bed and were willing to please them, men would have passionate sex.",106647,Sexism Affects the Quality Of Sex,0,,,

He hides the relationship from our mutual friends. He throws unreasonable tantrums at me. He makes me feel horrible at times.

He went on and off for so long, I asked if we were FWB, he denied and agreed we were seeing each other. But of course we were never officially. We had a long off period and when we were on again, it feels more like FWB situation. I wasn’t against it since I only wanted to spend time with him even if it meant to have sex.  And he’s obviously a lot sweeter when he wants to do the deed.

Last night we talked about it again and he confessed he had feelings for me, but not romantically. Basically he’s so comfortable with me but doesn’t see a future together. I knew this at the back of my mind, it hurt so much but it was also a wake up call.

I (26F) was platonic friends with a fuckboy (27M) for sometime before he started flirting and asking for more. He said he wanted a Long term relationship and I agreed, on the condition that we were exclusive. It goes well for 2 months, in which he flirts and takes effort in building the relationship. 

Out of the blue, he went into depression and said his feelings are not growing and rejects sex (partly because I think he felt bad he couldn’t make me cum all the time, though I’ve explained the problem is with me since I can’t even cum all the time when masturbating).

We go back to being friends but he sometimes acts like a Boyfriend. Within a month of this we have since went out twice, he continues to  tease me frequently and pays for all our meals, pokes my sides/sat on me to tickle me, and held my hand and put his arm around me (and gently stroked my arm) when he noticed I was cold. He also brazenly told me he was looking at my boobs.

Less than a week from holding my hand, he now tells me he is going back on tinder to continue sleeping around. He said he told me because I don’t approve of this side of him and might disappear from his life; unlike other girls who he has slept with and cut contact from, he wants me around. By his own admission, I am the only Friend here that he is texting regularly (rest of friends are back in hometown) and the other girls he slept with all don’t keep in contact.

 I’ve been dating others because I don’t bother waiting for him. Should I cut him off entirely? Out of the people I’ve dated, and whom I’m friends with, this selfish ex is arguably the person with the most common interests with me, and I’d hate to lose him. But I can’t explain what is going on between us when asked by this guy who might be interested in me.  

My question is: if we remained friends, would this turn other potential suitors off? 

TLDR: fuckboy pursues me claiming he wants a LTR. Fuckboy resumes to fuckboy ways but acts like my Boyfriend. Does this damage my dates?

Mine was short-lived, intense, and it taught me these things:

1. **Don’t talk about sex a lot even though he's your boyfriend.** Maintain its mystery. Talk about your fantasies every now and then, but don't do it often. It should be a treat for him. 
2. **Lie about your romantic and sexual past.** It's none of his business. If he asks, you've had less than 5 exes. They all treated you great. Don't tell him you've been cheated on before. Make him think you're too good for that. Trust me: there's no need to feel guilty about embellishing the truth. If you want maximum success, just do it. The people who get what they want in life aren't afraid to get their hands a little dirty. 
3. **Don’t appear too crazy in bed.** Keep those naughty fantasies to yourself. 
4. **Slow it the fuck down.** Meet twice a week max if he's your boyfriend and once a week if he still hasn't made it official. You need to protect your heart. Don't agree to exclusivity before 3 months has passed. You're doing this to protect your heart. 
5. **If you've had emotional struggles before, don't reveal it too early.** Reveal it after 6 months or later on. Your confidence should be earned. 
6. **Don’t talk about your past men.** Keep it super vague. He doesn't need to know. 
7. **Reserve the naughty acts till after 6 months or a year.** If you want him to love you and treat you well, be content with passionate vanilla sex. 
8. **Even when you’re in a relationship, still maintain your distance.** Make sure you go to social events at least 3x a week where you meet new people and see your friends. Spend the majority of your time working on your career, gaining new valuable skills, working out, reading, and socializing. Live a full life. If you're in the same social circle as him, limit seeing him there. You meeting there doesn't count as a date. 
9. **Don’t give too much of yourself too soon.** Make them earn every fucking thing. Slow it down.

Then he told me he didn't love me anymore in july.

Now he came back, saying he did a full switch of his personality, that he wanted to destroy everything good before and became a manipulative jerk at some point in his life because of certain people betraying them. And he was afraid of commitment, of seeing that we were going to have a future together. He has mentioned he tried doing stuff with other two girls but it never went all the way because he couldn't keep it up with them for some reason. 

&amp;#x200B;

That he suffered the whole time we were apart. But he was not messaging me?, he was treating me like a coworker(yes we work together so we saw each other daily after the breakup) and sort of like a friend. But he has realized he doesn't want me to be his, he wants me to be with him. That he doesn't care if I am less motivated or I get at my worst or best, he has decided he wants to embark on this life journey with him, even mentioned marriage and kids. That he is sure he loves me and is proud of it. And he has repeatedly told me he loves me. These past few days he has treated me like I always wanted him to treat me, with intimacy, soft touches, little lovely things and actions. has bought be 61 roses for the 61 days we've been apart. he even cried and he never cries. 

He said he has changed completely from being destructive and all that bad stuff to this, to simply being his purest self who loves me, that he now think differently overall and will be kinder to his parents and so on. That he has decided I am the one he wants to spend his life with, and knows he fucked up and lost my trust and hurt me a lot, and will work hard to regain some part of it. That he feels small in front of him. The one who used to treat me like shit, ignore me and my messages, not show me any romance, not being nice to me in a physical way even, now is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is I am scared of this now. i have suffered a lot, this was my first relationship. Going back to dating guys, it has been scary. I am a bit infatuated with another guy as well. This ex was my first love, and seems to love me now, but I don't know if I will ever care about him like my old naive self did. It was a toxic relationship and here he is now promising it will not be anymore.. he does seems changed and I am thinking of giving him the chance to at least date, I can't just jump back to being with him. I am guarded with guys. This sub has helped me as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think he is bullshitting? Everything he says seems sincere. I will run the other way the minute he seems to go back to his toxic self, which he keeps saying won't ever happen, that this switch of him being good and loving me is permanent...",16860,Ex who dumped me came back saying he loves me.,0,2019-10-25 20:43:15,,

Short story:

I knew HandsomeThug since I was in. middle school, he lived around. the corner from me. We knew each other in passing, but I always thought he was attractive. Years later I move back to my hometown and we exchange numbers. He seems really interested in taking me out, and I oblige. We go out, it was fun. I love bombed him on the first date and made him feel really special, not because I was trying to manipulate him, but I was so aloof at the time I thought I really liked him based on his appearance alone. Anyway we end up at a nightclub one night, I see a few celebrities there, and one of them was tugging my arm overtime I passed him but I would ignore it for my date. I was a local celebrity at the time, simply because of the people I knew and places I would go, and seeing them on a regular basis so it never fazed me. This made act more interested in me, but I didn't really think much of it. We get to my house after the club, and I was so horny I fucked him on the second date. My bedroom was a MESSSSS I was embarrassed that he saw my place in that state. Prior to this we ate and watched a movie and after making out I told him I had one rule: If we have sex stay the night with me (because I needed to cuddle) this asshole fucking starts getting dressed to leave directly after he loads the condom!!!!!!!!! He made this speech about how his class was at 10am and it was already really late and he would return. I told him that's not acceptable and if he leaves make sure to delete my number too. I didn't give any fucks about anything  in that moment besides the contract he agreed to. Anyway I blocked and deleted him after that, felt used and dirty for giving him sex. He pops up EIGHT YEARS LATER and finds my facebook with a message to please call him because he needs to speak to me. Naturally I do because I'm interested in what he has to say. so we spoke and he said  Sorry blah blah blah can he see me again. I said I'm not interested but thanks for the apology. I hang up and this sorry pos sends me a dick pic. I have never been so livid in my entire life. I think I actually became violent. So this goes on for about 3 months he is making new facebook pages contacting me daily, full stalker mode. I block every page and every new number he texts me from. I can't change my number because: fuck that. Anyway he wore my defenses with his persistence and he got me on the phone again, but this time I lead him to a textnow number I got from an app to create the illusion that I got a new number.  I answer and say what's up? Completely ignoring all the bullshit this one fuck cost me. We chat as if we're long time friends and he actually sincerely asks me on a date this time. I agree to the date, with my defenses up. We plan for next Friday, and I tell him to meet me two states (and $30 in tolls) away from our hometown at a bar in the downtown area. He agrees and I actually continue texting him throughout the week, as if nothing ever happened. I speak to him the day of the date and he asks me if Im still going. I said yes Im getting my nails done. So %pm rolls around, the time that I'm supposed to meet him, and he calls to ask where I am. I told him that I was headed there but there was major traffic and I would likely be late. He says that's fine he'll have a drink while he waits. I said ok, then in 30 minutes he calls again to see where I am. I tell him I had car trouble I'm still on the way. He tells me fine he's having another drink. In 20 min he calls me again to say where are you and I said to come outside I'm walking up to the bar now. He goes outside, and says where are you? I tell him I'm right here, he goes where I don't see you, I said 

""You didn't see the red flag?""

No matter how low down on the market, these men still feel entitled to a mate way above them, because being born as a man, in a patriarchal society, puts them in a place of privilege- whether they are consciously aware of it or NOT. The patriarchy has paved this for them over a very very long time, it becomes embedded in their psyche, identity and collective values which they cling onto tight. They can feel the tip of a wave coming for them...*.and they do not like it.* Why would over entitled low value men want to be kicked off their thrown &amp; be stripped of their benefits? *This* is why they call feminists hysterical and say the 'patriarchy' is a lie, its a classic manipulation tactic to make us seem unstable and unbelievable. Its gaslighting, because they know the dire state women find themselves in, and they know it is wrong they lie to these women, and use and abuse them. Feminists have rattled the cage they kept and continue to keep us in... which is why they're despised by most men who benefit from this.

**They know deep down women have the power in this sphere and always have, we select the genes, THEY aren't entitled to a high value female mate in the wild**, so they established a hierarchy that puts men at the top at a better advantage, particularly for incompetent unattractive men that would otherwise struggle to attract a good mate. They established this by chaining women to domesticity and childrearing way long after they needed to for survival purposes *(obv at some point it did make sense for women to stay at home &amp; attend to their children, whilst the man did heavy labour shit &amp; protected them- this would keep the woman and the child (most important) safe from harm, disease &amp; predators)*. However  at some point...they realised they could *extend this* to maximise their own benefit.

 Once survival was less of an issue *(humans had moved to the top of the chain &amp; the threats to us were less significant)*, men decided that they quite liked having these women docile and stuck in the home because it meant they could get ahead. They saw a window of opportunity, if you will- they saw an opportunity to give incompetent men power and assert that over high value women, they otherwise would have no access to. They were giving the puny, incompetent men a leg up the mating hierarchy. They actively excluded us from spheres of power; economics, law, politics, sciences etc...and instead we learnt how to focus on cooking for our man, looking pretty, repairing clothes etc *(this is genuinely the type o shit my grandma got taught in the 50s)* and how to be a good wife. We learnt some similar things to men, but not all and this was deliberately so. This meant that society was mostly built by men and history reflected this account, all the historians, inventors, scientists, lawyers, politicians, philosophers etc were mostly male.

 It is not that we were naturally inferior, we were shamed and silenced if we wished to contribute to society outside of the home, we were laughed at, threatened and degraded for having desires, dreams, aside from having children and making meals for men. Only men were allowed to be true individuals with fulfilling lives, whilst women picked up for them. Men were the gatekeepers, and they were on average physically stronger, they were essentially *abusing* the main advantage they'd evolved to have in order to PROTECT women/themselves/offspring to guarantee survival. Male aggression was not intended to harm and abuse women, because *CLEARLY* women are essential to their survival, their higher levels of T and subsequent aggression is to FEND OFF PREDATORS and protect their offspring, NOT to cause wars and slaughter women, which THREATENS SURVIVAL. Think about it, it makes NO sense these men defend mindless aggression that isn't to protect themselves *(and is why we put people in prison for it unless its out of genuine defence)*. We were scared of them, physically *(which is natural WHO DOESN'T want to survive)*, but we were ***never*** mentally inferior to them which is why more women are killing it at college now than men.

We were discouraged from sex outside of marriage, and babies out of wedlock *(my great nana told me some women were put in mental homes for doing this).* Because of this, many women like my grandma ended up not very smart (understatement but sad), and stuck dealing with a violent husband because divorce was frowned upon &amp; she had children. Here we have a classic example of this power dynamic skewed to favour undesirable men: a violent man, that got a nice submissive wife (my gran was pretty hot in her days aswell), who outside of patriarchy, would of left him high &amp; dry. Humans are unique in that they have more consciousness than most animals, thus their threshold for qualities in mates is higher, as we live much longer and are far more aware of whats going on, plus we have much more complex emotions. *His physical genes being strong alone* is not good enough, he needs to prove himself to be component enough to protect/provide for the child *over a long human life span*, and have personality traits that would be beneficial to the womans/child's health and safety. She will also want chemistry etc for her to spend such a long time with him, this obv does differ person to person, for all kinds of reasons. Clearly this man *fell short*, because he was a threat to her wellbeing and safety- *still the patriarchy granted him his nice submissive wife.* She still has a scar on her ankle from when he smashed a glass on her foot. 

Now when you consider the full impact of this on a global scale..............you can truly grasp how we got here, and why women are facing so many of the issues they do today still. Men have purposely objectified us to keep us docile 'AM I SEXY ENOUGH?' , they hold us to ridiculous beauty standards to keep us inferior and scrambling over them, as well as putting a dint in our finances, that were often controlled by the head of the house, the man. This also made us hypervigiliant, self conscious and needing validation from them, and worked *to the benefit of men.* Men were allowed to look like their natural selves but for women this was not enough, women had to perform femininity by shaving and wearing makeup &amp; keeping slim even if the man was gross. Sex was a given and men could rape their wives as the contract of marriage saw her as his property- **only in 1991 was the marital rape exemption challenged by UK law (just 30 years ago)**..sex without consent in marriage was not seen as rape before then (thats how consent came about)...and so this gave nasty men, or those incompetent in the bedroom or lacking in size a huge example as well. Men raping us is another dirty tactic, wanting to force pregnancy on us, or force their penis for sexual gratification alone, when it is the WOMAN who chooses the mate (female animals in the wild DO NOT enjoy being raped either and will kick them off). 

They did not have to be nice to have sex or work at pleasing the woman because women were reliant on them for a roof over their head (and childrens) as well as money/validation/safety and to be seen as socially acceptable ......*now do you see where these entitled attitudes come from?* They were entitled to sex no matter if they were shit or if she wanted it- this is clearly not how it works in the natural world, because PATRIARCHY is not natural- its a hierarchy of power designed to *oppress women for the benefit of men.* Feminism as an act of resistance against these chains, and has only taken impact in SOME areas of the world, often concentrated in wealthier countries, but not all. There are still many places where this the norm or worse, still many places where women have no access to education or are married off at 16 to men twice their age. And even in the areas we have penetrated, there is still a lot of work to do, because all these changes are mostly recent in terms of world history. The patriarchy had been established as the norm for a very long time, mostly by religious indoctrination, but not since the dawn of time *(important to note, it is* ***NOT*** *the natural order of things).* Religious indoctrination has been successful in establishing patriarchy, because it is tied up in the spiritual, the essence of life, death and family values. To challenge this, you are seen as attacking the 'essence' of life, peoples deeply held beliefs they often comfort themselves with in times of distress and so you are seen as committing a sin, so it is effective in shaming people. **But the patriarchy is NOT natural, men are clearly** ***abusing*** **their strength (designed to protect women) to ABUSE them through domestic violence, threats and rape and MEN are not** ***LISTENING*** **to us on this or attempting to CHANGE.** They can't use the 'survival' caveman bullshit excuse, because their behaviours are going directly against the survival OF WOMEN by doing this.

The thing is, it IS time women woke up, played this dirty game dirtier *(all the smart ones do)*, and got a global mating strategy of their own. ESPECIALLY high value women who are educated, smart, attractive, strong matured, loyal and caring *)* \- these women have put in the WORK to be an attractive competent mate and need to STOP allowing themselves be undervalued because they can be getting so much better. On a global scale, *we will never* raise the minimum threshold of competence for men if HIGH VALUE WOMEN keep settling for LOW TIER trashy men that cheat on them. We will never do it, **we are only as strong as the WEAKEST LINKS.** And right now, there's still a lot of them *(the handmaiden pick me's who are always anti feminist and seem to lie about orgasms more).*........SISTERS??? WHY do you think we are finding it so hard out of here? Why do you think that average looking man feels comfortable to talk you like a piece of shit on his foot? Why do you think so many men with sweet f all to over are so entitled? Why do you think so many highly attractive women with depth, humour, nice dress sense, hygiene, interests, and a good education keep getting PLAYED out and LIED to by shitty lower tier men?? Why do you think women keep going back to violent and abusive men who don't love them? It's not a coincidence, this shit happens all over the global, on a daily basis and for the average high value woman it will *happen again and again grinding her esteem down* until she WAKES UP and starts to play dirty *(aka fair &amp; meet men at THEIR level)* because this game is skewed against her. Is it because they were born a man, and its naturally like this or because of the patriarchy they are born into? 

Beta males, moids and fuckboys still get the better mates because handmaidens cave and settle, THEY DO NOT DEMAND MORE OR BELIEVE THEY CAN GET WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM, because they keep women insecure, jealous, yearning, overworked, traumatised, scared, fearful of 'the wall'. There is NO reason for them to step up with this privilege in place and so they keep breeding and leaving and abusing and using these women. WHY DO YOU THINK THERE ARE SO MANY LIKE THIS? They would of been struck out in the wild.

These men gaslight us on everything from cheating to rape to domestic violence to sex trafficking to transgender nonsense to how they use us for emotional labour to running off from fatherhood. They tell us what we WANT to hear, but don't actually respect us most times, see our humanity or care about our opinions and feelings. If they did, the patriarchy would have been abolished and women *(the most important sex in terms of welfare due to us being the ones that have babies, the future)* would be no longer suffering these issues or nagging men to listen to our suffering. Most do not believe we are equal, even the ones who say they are, they are in a position that is too tasty and beneficial to them..........just like the ugly moid who is too comfy with his handmaiden to even bother treating her with respect. **WHILST WOMEN SUFFER, EVERYONE SUFFERS, BECAUSE THEY ARE ONES RAISING THESE CHILDREN AND FUTURE ADULTS. WHEN THEIR LIVES IMPROVE, SO DOES EVERYONE ELSES, INCLUDING MEN.**

And why would they? The dynamic benefits them...you have attractive smart women with their own apartments, scrambling over some average or below dim bozo with no manners. If he plays her off, then he get more and more scrambling after him. He gets to weaken her self perception and limit her actual scope of her options because of this. Then he can sit back , relax and decide which ones he wants to pick off, and better yet the WOMAN will do most the work looking after his offspring.

We know when women settle and overlook thing this *does not guarantee* he will treat her better. But it *does* guarantee the man has the upper hand

We raise women to HIGH standards, so men receive the MAXIMUM benefit with LITTLE to offer. These men would be chucked out the gene pool in previous times, they would not be competent enough, but women of today are still happy chasing these men as if they are the prize.

&amp;#x200B;

This is why I refuse to settle- time to put men back in the WILD, in their natural HABITAT, where only competent mates attract a COMPETENT female mate\*\*. If we have to go most our lives without men, SO BE IT. If we have to access sperm banks SO BE it.

I know a few of you have played the puzzle 2048 and it can be tricky but its super doable. I like to shuffle very quickly and sometimes I make a horrible move and every move I make after that is super critical, as it could end the game. One time I got 2048 between two 64s and I needed to pair the 64s to get to the next level but it was extremely difficult, as I had little wiggle room. My strategy for the game is to line the numbers up 2, 4, 8, 16 perfectly so that every time I make a new list on top of it the numbers meet and I continue going higher exponentially. The problem is when you get a number like 2 next to a 256 you have to be very careful to turn that two into another 256 to continue. So my movements are binary. i simply only move down and right to line them up. When I have made a bad move I use this (until you HAVE to go up because its the only possible move) until I have buried the number I was trying to get rid of and the numbers are aligned again. 



I know that was a whole bunch of blabber for non gamers but think of that as a metaphor for relationships.

How do you even conceive about being high value when you're a covered in red flags? Here's the details:

I'm early 40's, never married, only LTR was less than three years to an agoraphobic x-rockstar, currently graduate school (borrowing $$$$$$ for it), very little money, ill-fitting clothes (very tall weird body shape), and to boot a highly stigmatized STD (genital herpes.) I know I'm a project. I'm trying to change careers and get in a better position, but I have a big hill to climb. Due to severe family trauma mostly due to shitty men I kept men away. I'm 100% working on myself. I'm in therapy, going to graduate school, can't do anything about the herpes except pray for acceptance. I do know I'm smart and I'm funny.  But, I'm also in LA, where image is everything. So, am I deceiving myself in thinking I can be high value, when nothing about me is (or at least compensate)? 

Please don't tell me to go to the herpes site.  It's a joke. Due to lack of standardized testing (STD panels don't usually test for herpes) a lot of people don't know they have it (1 out of 6 people have it, but 80% don't know they do).",16480,How to be a high value woman when on paper you're a total project (low value)?,0,2019-10-12 20:28:36,,

Here's why. You need to see first hand the type of tactics they pull so that you can be fully armored when you meet a man that you would consider marrying. You need to be very experienced in red flags, spin strategies, all of the sick shit men do to get us in bed. You are not there to do anything but take him as a case study. The douceyer the better. Literally take notes on his actions every step of the way, try to have a good time and leave. Drink dates are perfect because it would cost you no more than 40 min of your time at the very least. Long term dating douches is a really good way of learning, ESPECIALLY sociopaths. Dating a sociopath was literally the best/ worst thing that ever happened to me.

While I was texting with him I got a text from my ex bf saying he wanted to die. I have not spoken to this guy in some time and we were together for several years so I talked to him and gave him some advice which he expressed a lot of gratitude for. I told the current guy what was going on and he lost his shit and said he had no words and was going to bed. This morning I texted him to let him know I had no feelings for anyone but him and that I’m just an open book and that’s why I shared what was going on with him. Well he wrote back later and said dating me is out now but that he makes a “great friend”. He also said that he could not and did not want to reply to the stuff going on in my life (very little really, he’s being super insecure) and therefore he’s done with me. 

I replied that I was hurt by being rejected for things in my life beyond my control and that I didn’t need more friends and wished him well. I told him I was deleting his contact info and to please not contact me. I’ll be fine and keep writing (I’m working on a book and poetry and he asked me to keep going with that). I then went and deleted his contact info, the convo we’ve had for almost two months and all the videos he sent me - it’s all gone.
I told him I would not bother him with my baggage anymore (all it was was that ex texting me because I’m the only person he could ever open up to), and I said I would not validate his sister’s claim that “all women are crazy” but that I will say that some men are far too insecure to form bonds with women.

This is mine. I highly recommend it as a healing practice, it helped me get a lot of things out of my head.

Tim,

I want to talk to you. I want to tell you some things I never had the backbone to tell you before, and should have. You deserve to know, and your future victims deserve for you to have heard it.

You sensed my weakness when we first met. I was eager to please and easily charmed. I had little experience with men and the experiences that I had were all very bad. I was exactly your type. You charmed me, and listened, and got me to open up to you in ways that I had never opened up to anyone, I shared parts of my life and my story that had never been told. You took my desire to feel seen and loved and to feel beautiful, and you promised me that you loved me. You started to build a future with me that I had never seen for myself, we talked of the children we would have and the life we would build together. 

If I had been wiser or more calloused, I would have seen the signs. I would have seen how quickly you confessed your love, how easily you ingratiated yourself into my life. How readily you let me serve you and cook for you and clean for you. How you were okay with letting me pay your bills and take on your problems. How you laughed at my weight loss and said it would be a game for you to make me gain it all back. Real men don’t do that, but I had so little experience with real men.

You took a fragile girl made of glass, and you shattered her. When I found out that you cheated, one of the girl you cheated with and I became friends, and my heart ached for her. You promised her a beautiful future, you talked about the children you would have with her and the life you would build together. She even looked like me, because your victims are easy to spot: we’re all desperate to be loved and seen. My heart hurt for her in a way yours never will. She deserved better, every woman deserves better than you. After I found out you cheated, I tried to understand why? What was wrong with me? What did I do, or what didn’t I do enough of? 

When I think of people who do bad things, I try to understand why. Who hurt them that caused them to hurt others? But that’s the thing: nobody hurt you. You had an easy childhood, which transitioned to an easy adulthood. You had every opportunity to develop a strong character. You had resources and support and love. You had both of your parents, you had stability and safety. And you took all of those beautiful things, and made an ugly life out of them. 

You sought me out not because I was weak, but because you are weak. You will never find a strong woman on the merit of your character, because you have none. You are the perpetual abuser, someone whose life will in service to hurt and pain. I hope you grow old and women grow strong and see you for what you are. I desperately hope for strength for the women you encounter, because you are nothing without your manipulation.

People say that adversity makes us strong, but you didn’t make me shit. I made me strong. Every day I healed, and I learned, and I became better. I sat on the floor and glued together the fractured pieces of my heart, because I am the only one who can take care of me. You took my love and my effort and my money, but I’ve made them all back and then some. When I’m pursuing my dreams and making my goals a reality, you will keep spinning your wheels and abusing people because you are not just bad, you are evil. You don’t have a redeeming character arc, you are not the hero in anybody’s story. 

""Bitterness is drinking poison and expecting it to kill the other person."" I’m not angry with you anymore, and I don’t pity you. I grieve for your victims, and will spend my life making other women strong to protect them from people like you.

P.S. you still owe me $800.

For some BG info: 

I've always been overweight (20-40 lbs) despite exercising. I was normal weight 2x, through anorexia by age 11 and through obsessive exercise and CICO at age 16. my metabolism was probably wrecked by those events and why I was never able to lose weight that way again. I also have PCOS and insulin resistance, which I just found out about 1 year ago (23yrs old) and that finally gave me a concrete reason as to why I needed to cut out carbs and sugar in order to function like a ""normal"" woman. Well, 1 year ago I started to lose my hair, they found a benign tumor in my pituitary gland that messes with hormones, so that likely had to do with it. I lost about 50% of my hair, and I got a hair piece, then a wig, and I shaved it all off 3 months ago when I started my first out-of-college job. I look in the mirror and I don't feel like me. If I'm honest, while my confidence in myself and my abilities have grown so much, I feel like ""me"" until I look in the mirror. I already went through the depression and am still working on acceptance. It doesn't consume me like it did before, but it has completely stagnated my dating life. I am able to do what I do and take care to better myself because of hopes for the future. 

But sometimes those hopes are not enough to make me happy, or to replace a person. I am in NYC and I have yet to make many friends. I often am alone and I don't mind as I always find new things to learn, it's just not how I want my life to keep being. I mean this in terms of friends and men. I get so much more attention when I wear my wig, but tbh it;s not that comfortable. My hair seems to be doing better, so I'm hoping to grow it out and get a hairpiece again as that was the most comfortable. I know guys prefer my wig hair, and it sort of makes me feel like an impostor when I wear my wig, even though I didnt chose to lose my hair...I just don't look as good with my short hair. Some edgy hipster dudes who are not my type say it's cool, but it's not elegant, I'm not into looking edgy. Also, I don't make a lot of money so I really have to budget for months if I want to get a new wig or something hair related. Sometimes, I just break down and will stay inside and watch netflix and eat ice cream or something. 

We all have phases that are hard, I know that one day I will be at a better weight, have a new wig or hair piece, and hopefully some friends, but until then all I want to do is rest and focus on me. This tends to isolate me though, any advice?

Often women tend to feel they are not 'good enough' when a man starts acting trash or disrespecting them/showing less interest. They start thinking they need to lower their standards or this man doesn't see any value in them at all. You start to think you will never find a good guy that sees value in loyalty....

HONEY, HERE'S THE REAL TEA- THIS IS *RARELY* TRUE FOR A HIGH VALUE WOMAN!

The fact is women are far more likely to settle than men are, and this has been backed up by studies and divorce rates (women are more likely to initiate divorce). We are far more likely to date down in looks /education and overlook red flags / undesirable traits than they are...*'well I'll give him a chance, he could be a good guy or going through stuff'.* And men are certainly less likely to settle when it comes to attraction, even if they are below average looks wise themselves.

You can be attractive, smart, well dressed, healthy, well read, interesting, well travelled, caring, kind, funny, honest and trash men will STILL treat you like gum on their shoe or just a piece of meat. These men you settle for will STILL lie to you and think they're the shit.

This can be because of several reasons besides you: THEY are insecure and don't feel like they have enough to stop you from straying (they can tell you have enough options &amp; are goin further in life than them), THEY are immature and have not spiritually developed yet (girls are for fucking, nothing more), THEY are running away from personal issues by fucking several women to boost their esteem (*I'm the man! Sob, why I can't I earn more!),* THEY haven't got their shit together and feel its not a good time to get into a relationship (mental health issues/financial instability), THEY don't think they're good enough (cheated on/not ready to trust yet) or THEY have not worked on their resilience/communication/self work and struggle to open up emotionally (which is essential to a mature longterm relationship.

More women settle than men (this is changing slowly), and its in men's interests to knock your esteem down, so they feel comfortable. So you don't feel like a threat, so they don't have to address the parts of themselves they feel anxious about, so they can keep you from moving on and discovering your equal.

They have a variety of ways they do this:  going hot/cold deliberately in order to make you yearn them, hiding themselves, lying about where they live/career, putting you down, testing your patience to see if you'll get emotional and validate them (they're insecure), acting with an overflated ego, trying to control you, putting you off travelling, belittling/rolling their eyes at you knowing more than them, making you paranoid they receive more interest than they do (men are ALWAYS receiving less interest unless they're top tier) etc

SO ALL I'LL SAY IS

If you're dating a dude that only has one in demand factor such as he is attractive....but he's bummy, not smart, not particularly interesting but you kinda maybe think he's a nice person cos he's cute sometimes but then he went cold and is getting disrespectfil

DON'T INTERNALISE their projections! And DON'T SETTLE. Know what you have to offer, and stop letting low market men think you are not good enough! There is a guy out there waiting to find someone like you, or is on his way to becoming the high value man you will find in a year or 5 from now!

This is the fuckboys no1 trick.....and it has fooled so many women I've seen who are high value and have settled in 2 or 3 departments only to be treated like shit and staying for the children. Don't be fooled!!!

You cant go around giving your goods to any man that asks or is there. Youre killing the pussy stock market. If the supply is high the demand goes down. Its simple economics. 

Remember, if your goal is a long term relationship you need to keep your mileage low anyway. Plus the men that are looking for a spin will be gone by the 3rd date anyway. 

You are also going to have to pay for the 5th or 6th date. He needs to see effort on your part as well. Dont be a user, you will inly create more MGOTW fucktards, and they are asexual so the human race will die off eventually 😂 

But in all seriousness if you look at Arab countries where the women are women are completely covered, the men are HORNY AF. That means they are willing to do anything to get a woman, including court a woman properly (wow, who wouldve thought 🤔)

Lastly, you need to match the fantasy that he already made up in his mind when he met you. So if you give him all of you too early he will ghost because he thinks youre easy. (For his purposes, you are)

Exception to the rule: If you have an exceptionally more glamorous lifestyle than him (live in a mansion, have a few luxury cars, own a yacht, etc.) and you have sex with him ONCE then disappear and return he will be so disoriented that  his interest will have peaked over (unless your vagina is loose, do kegels)

2. He's gainfully employed, is in the middle class or better, or has a business
3. He's educated at the bachelor's degree level, or greater.

5. He's a gentleman. Will open doors, hold elevator doors, and does those little ""chivalry"" gestures for me.

I’ve been reading these methods, and, while I follow them, what I’m successfully doing is filtering out clowns. So I’m not getting used anymore, so that’s good. I was single for 2.5 years before I started this stuff and, 6 months after that, still in the same boat, except the time wasted is spread out between more men, because I cut them loose faster. 

But what’s not happening- that I keep hearing about in success stories here- is these guys that *are* stepping up, as a result of these methods. Treating some of you like queens, really making an effort! I’m not sure if I’ve ever experienced such things. I see myself just stuck on a hamster wheel of filtering out what has got to be a good 20 guys in the past 6 months, and never getting done with it. Out of them, maybe two seemed like they were super into me, but there were problems with those guys (unemployment, soon-to-be long distance, really bad kissing, etc.). The consistent failure in this blur of men has been kind of damaging. No sex in nearly half a year now because I stopped with hookups, which is all that’s been available. My profiles look pretty good, but I don’t get the “tons of messages” I hear other women here are getting. Your ability to level up to these guys that actually try almost seems too good to be true.

So for those of you who are not only filtering out duds, but actually *also* getting guys pursuing you (who I’m assuming you’re attracted to), are you all 8’s or 9’s? Are you all in your 20s? Are these guys you date significantly older and worried they’re running out of time? It just all seems so foreign to me, the part of this strategy that leads to being coveted. Tell me about you?

I was chubby and not great looking and that made me an easy target at my first high school. Boys 3-4 years older than me used to verbally abuse me, throw things at me, beat me, and once they even smashed a bottle over my head. I went to my guidance head and she attempted to track some of these boys down and nothing was done about it other than they were given warnings because it was my word against theirs, I’m sure she even said “boys will be boys” at one point. She even went as far as to blame me because i kept on going where they were (the school had all mobile phone service blocked and the back playground was the only place you could get a signal and I had really bad anxiety and I needed to call my family every break and lunch). After that my family soon pulled me out of that school and I was moved to an even worse one.

The next school was in a really bad area and I was assaulted almost every day by boys in the years above me. But it was different this time because they weren’t just insulting my appearance, they were making loads of sexual comments to me, but at the same time I knew it was sarcasm? They used to trip me up, punch me in the face, pin me up against walls all the time whilst saying that I was sexy and they wanted to fuck me. I eventually stood up for myself and when I felt someone trying to trip me up I grabbed him and punched him square in the jaw, also the whole time I was at this school I was 12. When one boy started saying things about my 12 year old ass I told him he needed a slap in his stupid spotty face, he then called me fat and the usual crap. This was also around the time of the “damn Danial” and “what are those” memes, and since Adidas superstars weren’t my shoe of choice that gave them even more ammunition to trip me up, I eventually started hitting back harder and eventually I was basically thrown out to the point my guidance head said “I wouldn’t bother coming back if I were you”. By some miracle I then earned a scholarship to a private school.

The private school was different because it was all mind games. The boys didn’t do that much to me physically at this school but they were always making passive aggressive comments and making fun of my weight. The uniforms weren’t flattering. They always asked about my sexuality and I told them I was asexual (this still stands to this day but at the time I was a prepubescent 13 year old), all the stuff that had happened previously caught up with me and I went in to a deep depression, the comments from the boys (and girls) at this school added fuel to my depression fire. A year and a half later I was medicated and was getting better but the boys were still making nasty comments and treating me like shit. At the end of the year one of the private school boys decided he was going to hit me because I said his friend was being rude to me, so I left a year early and went to college. 

At college now boys treat me like dirt and think just because I’m fat I’m insecure and desperate.

It is not enough to just set them, you need apply them. 

Your boundaries may be different from the next woman’s boundaries. That’s okay. If you personally have zero tolerance for a lying man —whether it’s a white lie or he’s lying about his age—cut him off the first time. When you pick up on red flags earlier in a relationship it is easier to move on. 

During the first few months of dating people are on their best behavior. If he’s lying in the first few months how do you expect him to act in 2, 4, 6 years. 

Your boundaries are your friend. They help weed out the men who want sex or a relationship for the minimum effort. Bare minimum boyfriends turn into apathetic and passive husbands which created resentful wives. 

Boyfriends who are  wishy-washy when it comes to showing you their affection and how much they love you aren’t all of a sudden going to become attentive adoring husbands. 

Your boundaries and standards do not make you a bitch. For instance, there is nothing wrong with a college educated woman with a high paying career wanting a college educated man with a high paying career and refusing to settle for less. There is nothing wrong with an ambitious woman wanting an equally ambitious man and won’t settle for manchildern or lazy bums. If you do half the house work and expect your boyfriend to do half the house work too it doesn’t make you a nagger.

In terms of romantic relationships, just keep in mind that your significant other isn't guaranteed to stick around--even if you exchange vows with them--so make sure that you retain a certain level of independence. It doesn't mean you can't form a deep bond with them, but if they leave you abruptly, you always want to be in a position where you can take care of yourself and move on within a reasonable timeframe.

We had similar goals in life and we became exclusive for few months until he just dropped the ""I fell out of love with you"" bomb despite him being head over heels for me few months ago!! We had plans of getting married already (which is by the way my whole goal. I wanted to find a man who will marry me). 

I saw the posts here and realized my biggest mistake: I was too available for him. 

I fell in love and gave him everything I have now he's done with me because being available and giving 100% of me made me look so easy for him.

I mourned and now I'm done. Seeing the posts here made me realize some stuff and my actual worth.

Before we became exclusive I dated men with high value and they chased after me. Spent a lot of money for me. Gave me everything I hint that I want. Some of them even flew to my country just to date me only for me to say no but it never stopped them. 

During my mourning process I had this shitty thought that I'll never find a man like him and BOY I was so wrong. I'm not unlovable. I'm worth it. I'm a queen and I had men chase after me. Men in high positions, men who can pay for my vacations, men who can just drop so much money just to buy me shit I think of. I realized why they were so head over heels for me. I didn't give them a single fuck. I was so unavailable to them because I was too focused on dating this guy who, now, just broke my heart into millions of pieces.  I have so many options and I should never make myself too available for someone. 

Women, thank you for making me realize all of this. You guys just made my whole healing process faster and soon I'll be ready to doll up and meet new people. I know my *worth* and I'm gonna act like it.

I highly value myself - to the point where I've denied sex to guys because I didn't think they were worth it. 

Well... it turns out that's an easy way to get yourself to 25 without ever having sex! 

Because most guys, especially young ones (20s), behave in a manner which I don't respect and therefore, I cannot psychologically allow myself to be intimate with them. 

Is there a point where your standards are too high? 

I want a guy who's educated, ambitious, but knows how to let loose once in a while, and first and foremost, likes me as a human being and respects me.

It seems like this is a particular issue for minority girls from what I've heard and read. I'm Indian-American, and most of my brown friends who couldn't get a guy to commit had to lose their virginities in FWB situations, even though they admitted it wasn't ideal.

Hey I just wanted to get some advice and feedback on this situation. So about 1 month ago I met this amazing guy on a dating app (36M), and I thought I was living in a dream. I’m a 26 year old woman btw. So I'm somewhat picky, but he pretty much checks almost every box of what I want in a person. Also when we met I felt an instant, almost karmic soul connection. I have never been comfortable with someone as quickly as 1 date. It felt like we had known each other for years. He said he felt the same way. Our first date was actually so amazing that he extended it longer, and the next day asked to see me (so our second date was literally the day after our first date).

So I'm going to try to make this brief and sum up the most important parts, but I need to give you some background so you understand. Since even before our first date, he was not big into texting (I'm not either), and he has mentioned that he is horrible at texting. Also he owns his own company, is a workaholic, and is extremely successful (multimillionaire status). I feel like these factors contribute to my confusion about our communication. We recently had our fifth date together. We slept together on the third date (not sure if that matters), and had an amazing sexual connection. Here is where my confusion is, and what my question is about...between dates, we have barely texted. So I'm very confused on how he feels. I've known him a little over a month, so we have went on about 1 date a week. I am someone who almost never initiates communication with a guy, but with him I have found myself initiating communication quite frequently...or else I feel like our connection will fade. For example, a lot of times on our dates, aside from texting right after to let him know I got home, that was it...for about 3-4 days there would be silence unless I reached out. Once I reach out he responds rather quickly, and after I reach out he has usually initiated hanging out again.

So obviously he is into me if he keeps asking me on dates and spending time with me. Also he is extremely sexually attracted to me, and makes that really clear. It's just, if he is barely initiating communication with me between dates what am I supposed to think? It's really confusing. We've been on 5 dates and I want to continue seeing him, but I don't know what to think when I don't hear from him for days and then I have to reach out. I am not into small talk or texting a lot either, I'm not very needy, but it's nice to check it once every day or every other day especially in the beginning stages of dating so I know he's still into it. So my question basically is, what do you think about his communication? If he has been consistently inviting me on dates and acting into me, why would he be putting so little effort in communication? Should I even keep initiating communication or let him reach out? I really don't love doing it, but I'm so serious about this guy. He checks every box and I can really sense a future with him, so I want this to work out. I have no interest in pursuing anyone else. If we have a sixth date (I am confident we will), should I mention the lack of texting and say I don't know how he feels? I'm not sure how to say how I feel without coming across the wrong way (desperate, insecure). I'm really not into games at all and just want to be honest. Also, any overall feedback/advice is totally appreciated on this entire situation, I love hearing thoughts/feedback from outside sources.

Secondly, it gives you the opportunity to test their sexual self control. If you have to ask a man more than once to leave then you know he’s going to be a pushy boundary disrespecting asshole. You have to start to get him Trained up the first time.

**A bit about me:** I wasn't born good looking or with good social skills. I dedicated around 3 years of my life to approaching thousands of women and going through a painstaking process of improving fashion, fitness, vibe, conversational skills, and everything else to become good enough to pull women home every time I go out.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/cz5ny6/my\_insane\_3\_year\_pickup\_journey\_from\_hardcase/](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/cz5ny6/my_insane_3_year_pickup_journey_from_hardcase/) 

I'd say that this whole process was a lot harder than I expected and I had to really hone in on all of the fine details from facial micro-expressions to body language to even getting elevator shoes to actually see real results. I'd say that the dating world was incredibly harsh for me so I learned to become a ruthless and manipulative person in order to get results. I honestly think that based on my experiences, the average woman is significantly smarter than the average guy as they are able to sense even the slightest fuck-ups or inconsistencies in my facial expressions and tell that I'm up to no good and I really had to practice thousands of times to actually get it right. I'm not kidding when I say I've had an easier time selling software to multi-million dollar companies than picking up women. Women are smart and have great natural instincts and social awareness. It got to the point where I seriously started to wonder why the elite power holders and decision makers in society are mostly men and not women. Then, I had my first few relationships and figured it out: Women go from smart to retard levels the moment they fall in love with a guy.

**Here are some of the biggest mistakes I see women making:**

1. **They become completely different people after having good sex with a guy.** There's so many instances where I'll be chasing a girl and she's genuinely smart and socially savvy, but as soon as we fuck, they start to chase me and I'm in complete control of the relationship. Oftentimes, I'm not even intentionally trying to form trauma bonds or get into abusive relationships. The women just become so retarded and attached after sex. They'll start cooking and doing favors and I'm just like, ""what the fuck?"" and exploit the fuck out of them with no repercussions.
2. **They suck at power games after a relationship is formed** \- This is something that puzzled me because like I said, I really do believe the average woman is many times smarter than the average guy but for some reason, whenever I get into a relationship whether it's fuck buddies or a Long term girlfriend, they completely lose all sense of self respect and let me walk all over them. I don't even use sophisticated tactics. All I do is occasionally threaten to leave whenever they do something I don't like. That's it. I threaten to leave, then walk out the door and every single time, the girl will call me and beg for me to come back after a few days. It's pathetic, honestly. I never viewed them in a different more loving light after they beg me to come back. I just think to myself what a pity it is that these otherwise strong, capable, professional women can't even stand up for themselves. I would never be able to make a guy cook, clean, and do laundry for me. Never in a million years unless I paid him. Yet with women, it's simply a matter of threatening to leave over and over again until they start doing everything I ask. I think girls need to learn to be stronger and actually start dating other men and calling bluffs.
3. **They focus on looks and sex after a relationship is formed** \- I don't think I've ever wanted to get married with a girl just because she's really good at sex, yet I see all the time, girls try to have a lot of sex over and over again with guys they really like to try to lock them down. It does not work. I've never felt any emotional connections just from pure sex and looks. What women should do instead of find some way to help a guy on his personal mission in life. Most guys women are attracted to have strong personal presence and charisma which comes as a result of following their personal mission in life, whatever it may be. If women could just find some way to fit into that personal mission, then the guy would be happy to propose marriage or any other thing without any begging. Find some way to help out in the personal mission without giving away all the power and form a relationship based on mutual respect.

That's my thoughts. If only women could learn to separate their emotions from their decision making and learn to play more tactically and strategically post sex, I really think they would hold most of the power positions in society because they have naturally better social skills than men. People say women aren't as mentally tough as men but that's mostly bullshit as well. The highest level ultra-marathoners are women. Just stop letting emotions get in the way of sound logical decision making in relationships after sex, it's that simple.",21852,My observations on female dating strategy as a Guy who approached thousands of women,0,2019-10-27 18:35:29,,

Give it to them, selectively, don’t just think they are amazing and better than you. You have things to bring to the table they do not, and if they like you they will admire you too.

He’s an extremely nice and genuine person (as in he’s not doing it for show. I even DMed a girl from his Instagram profile who he was friends with in Highschool and she said he’s one of the nicest people ever). He’s about 5’9, so not super tall, but he has a very cute face and smiles a lot. I’m 18 and a freshman, and he’s 20 and I believe is a junior. Anyways, we’re both college students, at universities about 2 hours apart.

So we’ve been snapchatting back and forth and occasionally texting as well, just getting to know one another and stuff. Sometimes I leave his snapchats on read just to see how he reacts and he usually double snaps me, so it gives me the vibe that he cares. 

So now the main topic. He said he really wants to see me, and wants to get to know me better, so I told him to come over here. So he drives to my university, we meet in person. He’s just like he was online, very nice very friendly, we go out to eat and he pays, the whole 9 yards. So we get back to my dorm and end up doing it. And this is where I can’t get past mentally.

The sex was awful. I’m not gonna lie, his dick was slightly below average (like MAYBE 5 inches) and I couldn’t really feel anything to be honest. I could tell he was really trying to pleasure me, but physically it was just not possible whatsoever.

When he left he seemed kind of embarrassed, and now he’s been talking to me less this week. This whole thing happened over the weekend. My problem is that I really do like him, I just need to be sexually pleasured and he’s not doing it for me. At the same time I’d feel kind of guilty breaking it off with someone who is basically ideal, doesn’t act like a typical mood, and actually cares about me, just because of sex.",21682,Should I break it off with him?,0,2019-10-27 17:50:14,,

So nice to have found this thread.

So the other day I was watching a documentary on Alec Missnik, or whatever his name is, and I kind of fell down the rabbit hole of incels and I was deeply disturbed. If you don’t know what they are, please, go look them up.  They would have remained in meme obscurity had this Alec guy not tried to mow over 17 people with a truck, killing 10 of them. Killed them! For literally just being women. 

I have never hated a man and trust me I have reasons from here until next year for hating them.  Despite having been raped, cheated on, stolen from, had a gun pointed at me, a knife in my face, screamed at, shamed for no reason, and been lied to—the way these men hate women is way more than I have ever hated them. 

And I thought, wow what gall these motherfuckers have.  They sit there in their underwear—probably—masturbating to some lame ass porn in mommy’s basement (the grand cliche) and wishing women would give you the time of day for just existing! They are entitled twits.

Yet at the same time they scorn us for being intelligent, they scorn us for trying to have a decent wage, a normal semblance of life without having to be gawked at, or worse, touched by some creep, all because we don’t want to FUCK them? Are they even serious? Apparently they are. 

We can’t even talk about video games, or do things like fix computers because men think they have the goddamn copyrights to it.  They think they own the copyright to the whole damn world. Including apparently, our goddamn vaginas. 

Ok this is more of a rant than a discussion but go with me here...I promise I have a point. 

So yeah. These male echo chambers are really something else. Meanwhile I’m over here upset because I had to resign from a job I love because I can’t take my child to work and I have no one to watch her on the 200000000 teacher work days that public school decides to force on me.  Her father happily moved to Oregon and sends me child support to save face and pretend he is a good dad. Whatever.
My female boss (who brings her way smaller grandchildren) said no.  So 8 years probably down the drain unless the other campus hires me.  This is the shit we have to deal with and they swear they have it sooooo bad. I don’t say this for anyone to feel sorry for me. I decided to make a child so I know these are those sacrifices a mother makes. I take full responsibility for all my actions.  I’m just saying it to prove that men live a much cushier existence.

I just graduated with a bachelors because I was a single mom. I’m over here making sure my child is fed, clothed, does her homework, gets good grades, plus work, plus manage the rental house my father left me, after he passed, feed the cat, make sure he is also healthy, manage the pool, manage my house, drive over 60 miles back and forth from work to my kid’s school, do laundry, do school projects, write papers, write books, all the while these imbeciles are calling women like me and my mother (who busted her ass all her life to raise two kids on her own because my dad wasn’t there) they dare call us stupid? 

We create life.  We can manage multiple situations at once, multiple people, we make things thrive and grow and they dare say they are better than women because they have some sausage full of meat and a sack with little slimy balls in them? Please, these boys, need to sit down and shut up.  

First of all incels are crybaby wimps. Just the fact they are begging for sex is pathetic. Women do not beg for sex, it’s beneath us. 

Even men laugh at them, because most men know that’s definitely not the way to go about women, but let’s be honest,  it applies also to life.  No one should be that pathetic. It’s unnecessary.  

I guess what I am trying to say is that I was insulted. I was insulted because I have played my whole life by men’s rules and at 43,  and they dare say we don’t play by their rules? Seriously? What the utter fuck?

I have decided I just don’t care to impress men any further.  Just to spite them, I am becoming a VOLCEL. That’s right. I’m literally not having sex voluntarily.  Not because I cannot, because surely I can, but because there are so many men who don’t deserve the woman I have become and will be.

 I would rather my vagina shrivel up and house a merry band of spiders than give it to any idiot any longer. And to men, I say  to you, it’s not a threat, it’s a promise. I will be a goddamn voluntary celibate.  I can do it too.  I got tons of toys. 

Until such a time when men learn to be a little nicer and smile just a little more (baby cakes), I’m mthrfking done.  

Because you know what? Men need us a lot more than we need them, especially at my age.  I want a man that understands the rules of life.  And if they want to sit there and cry in their beers about how terrible women are despite probably being leeches to their mothers, they can go and have that sausage party all on their own without me or hopefully without any of you. 

Until then the fabulous magical pixie land I own between my legs is closed until further notice. So I guess join me, or not. Do whatever you please, but  this has been brewing for a few days and I thought it may be something that would appeal to ladies such as yourselves. We seem to share common ideals and thoughts. Although, I could be wrong.  

Anyways, I’m open to discussion from my kinfolk.

We are long distance which is difficult but we usually make it work. I am in college while he took a gap year and takes a night class 2 days a week. 

I have depression, anxiety, PTSD (rape), and chronic pain. I deal with them well usually, I was in therapy for years, I do much better now. DB (damn boyfriend) has anxiety as well, last year he really struggled with it, it was difficult for me to stay with him through that time. Although we were long distance he was very needy, he had a lot of anxiety attacks and I pulled away, but ultimately any time he needed me I was there, I even would drive 4 hours one way to see him to make sure he was okay on weekends when I could. He is doing much better now, this was a year ago and we worked through it. 

Que Rant: DB needs to be there for me, and not just when it works for him. We will be texting in the middle of a conversation and he says hes tired and wants to sleep, which is normally fine. It bothers me we never get to finish the conversation though, it is never brought back up unless I bring it up and I feel like I shouldn't always have to. He's the one that ends it it would be nice if he would think enough to continue it later. 

Well last night I was having anxiety, DB knows it's depressing me I'm planning my own birthday, (I threw him a surprise party with all of this friends from 4 hours away, organized all of the food, booked his favorite location (a hobby I do not enjoy) and got everything ready, I then had to drive 4 hours one way for the party.) I love birthdays I love planning them but what depresses me is the fact I go out of my way for others and I still have to plan my own. I am also hitting an age I never thought I'd live to when I was younger, this birthday is freaking me out, which DB is well aware of. I know I am young (ab to turn 20) but I lost so much of my childhood it saddens me I'm ab to be an adult. 

SO while I was expressing my anxiety over my birthday I didn't get far before DB says he's tired and might fall asleep. I say I need him and he says that he'll stay up, not even 2 minutes later he's asleep and I am panicking alone. It made me feel sad he didn't stay up, and more sad when he never brought it back up today.

That brings us to a few minutes ago, we were in the middle of a conversation when he says he wants to sleep, fine but I bring up the fact he always does this, and then the conversation is never continued and last night I could've used him. He says he's sorry but keeps insisting he wants to sleep as I am trying to express why I am upset, which pisses me off more he's doing exactly what I am saying is upsetting me as I'm saying it! He could've said ""okay I'll stay up because it is clear you're upset, I'll do better I'm sorry, something. While he did say he's sorry it was also always followed by he wants to sleep because he has work tomorrow. Well buddy **I** too have to wake up for my class at 10 (same time his work starts), then do work for my next class, go to my second class (both classes 1.5 hours straight, to then go to work, followed by a lecture. **I** too need sleep, but I am so upset for the second night in a row I cannot sleep and it pisses me off he is sleeping soundly not caring how I feel. 

I told him how whenever he needs me I will stay up, not complain, and help him. DB said I can sleep and he doesn't care if I go to sleep when hes struggling. Sure he says that now but next time he calls me crying I am sure he won't feel the same way. I told him I am not capable of just letting him be upset, I cannot just leave him alone, that I care enough I won't sleep to help him.  He just said he needs sleep and we'll talk about this tomorrow and that was that. 

Even when I was visiting him, when he wanted to sleep that was all that mattered, it didn't matter if I wanted to talk, hang out, or anything, when he wanted to sleep that was that. He made no effort to do anything else. I do not see his family much and my last night at home I was talking to his family and he just took his dog, went upstairs, and laid there for 30 minutes when I was with his family. He didn't tell me he was going to bed and it surprised me when I finally went looking for him and he was laying there on his phone all of the lights off. 

It is getting to the point I need to be selfish and say I do not care if he wants to sleep because I need him, but he doesn't even put in the effort to stay awake, he claims he does but he lays there, eyes closed, lights off, between texts, not trying in the slightest. 

Well now I am so pissed off I can't sleep and God I wish him a very restless night.

Absent favorable qualities to a mate, the male will gleefully rape and kill his way to one. This is true in just about every species of creature on the planet, especially mammals such as ourselves, and especially on the local-level — which is why violence is highest between people who are close to each other relationship-wise. As humans, we funneled the male murder drive — as is evident in crime statistics by gender —primarily into War, where incels that couldn’t compete for female attention would go to violently take it by force from those weaker than him. 

&amp;nbsp;

For a brief period of time the bloodlust of incels could be sated and there would be eras of peace and prosperity among civilizations if enough incels were killed off in the previous wars to mitigate their violent impositions. Victorious incels then became the new Chads and established doctrines that enforced civic contracts between citizens ensuring that incels would be provided mates in return for them not going full retard and killing and threatening everyone around them if they provided tax money and weaponized their violence for the state, which had so generously litigated the landscape of inter-personal relations in such a way as to force women to be dependent upon men as a class. This was most easily done by stripping them of their rights to vote and work, similar to the slaves kept by the pre-eminent violent male class at the time.

&amp;nbsp;

Essentially, pretty much all of human history has been a cycle of males killing and raping everyone because they can’t get laid. It’s therefore no surprise that they’ve evolved to be ruthless unfeeling monsters, those who didn’t were either killed or enslaved by those who did. Historically, as societies liberalized and men could no longer leverage the violence of the state to render women dependent on them, they took up arms and went to war. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you want it put in a politically correct way: monogamous pair bonding makes men less violent.
Here are some examples of the well-developed body of basic evolutionary-biological/psychological/anthropological evidence (and theory) supporting that claim.
The Competition–Violence Hypothesis: Sex, Marriage, and Male Aggression https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2016.1216153
“...men who transition to a monogamous, or less competitive, mode of sexual behavior (fewer partners since last wave), reduce their risk for violence. The same results were not replicated for females. Further, results were not accounted for by marital status or other more readily accepted explanations of violence. Findings suggest that competition for sex be further examined as a potential cause of male violence.”
Here’s another paper, with a long list of relevant references:
Why Men Commit Crimes (and why they Desist) http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0735-2751.00110
Luckily (?) though every hundred years or so one of the males comes up with a good idea that makes society a little better for everyone before they, males, rage quit and destroy everything. This accumulation of significant human knowledge constitutes the basis we use to dictate the rules we enforce upon people via the pre-eminent patriarchy that’s monopolized violence at that point in time, hopefully and eventually.

&amp;nbsp;

To kind of give you an idea of how much of a crapshoot this process is:
Anatomically modern human beings are about 200,000 years old. We’ve only made slavery illegal about 100 years ago. Spousal rape was legal 50 years ago. Women went to college at the same rate as men 25 years ago. And this is true almost exclusively in liberalized western civilizations, because we have monopolized violence, which as I mentioned earlier means we get to set the rules based on the aggregate human knowledge we’ve collected.

&amp;nbsp;

**Fortunately however, the comforts of modern society afforded by the aggregation of human knowledge I discussed earlier has rendered the incel weak and docile.** He is able to diverge his violent bloodlust into things like pornography, r/MGTOW, and r/The_Donald. We culturally condemn toxic masculinity at least in public. Violent males are put into cages before they go full inceltard. Etcetera. **Most importantly however, the wage gap affords men the ability to financially enslave the various debt-ridden dependent debutantes of their dreams.**
Amidst the begruntled moans of being stripped of raping and pillaging and enslaving and the other various past-times of patriarchical society I’ve referenced, there is a hesistant nod of aggrement among the gentlemen of our civilized society to not kill everyone as long as they’re in a better financial position as a class than women (and slaves of course) on average.

&amp;nbsp;

after WWII we got so fed up with the impotent wanton violence and capriciousness of them that we instituted gigantic social reforms that gave women independence from having to depend on them to survive and raise children, hence the ensuing exodus of engagement and the devastating deluge of divorce. 

***Mother Nature is now correcting for this error by washing the 80%+ of obsolete male chromosomes from the gene pool.***

***Men simply don’t know how to compete for female affection and attention in a world where women no longer literally starve without depending on them for jobs and schools they were literally barred from and are showing their true colors in an age where you can no longer legally rape your spouse and treat her as a slave.
Male culture never developed the traits women actually find attractive because society has enforced a patriarchy through violence by the male-controlled state, and so once that patriarchy is dismantled their true ability to court female relationships is shown in its pitiable true form.***

&amp;nbsp;

They’re already being naturally weeded out of the gene pool as women gain agency through the legal protections and economic opportunities afforded them by our liberalizing society. Incel movements are an emergent edifice of this metamorphosis of modern politics and economics, but their violent outlashes are frankly nothing new.

hat’s why I’m personally very mindful of the rise of violence and fascism from the conservative alt-right clowns gunning down people around the world.

Anything a person chases in life runs away.**

**2. The women who have the men climbing the walls for them aren’t always exceptional. Often, they are the ones who don’t appear to care too much.**

**3. A woman is perceived as offering a mental challenge to the degree that a man doesn’t feel he has a 100 percent hold on her.**

**4. Sometimes a man deliberately won’t call, just to see how you’ll respond.**

**5. If you start out dependent, it turns him off. But if it is something he can’t have, it becomes more of a challenge for him to get it.**

**6. It is your attitude about yourself that a man will adopt.**

**7. Act like a prize and you’ll turn him into a believer.**

**8. The biggest variable between a \*\*\*\*\* and a woman who is too nice is fear. The \*\*\*\*\* shows that she’s not afraid to be without him.**

**9. If the choice is between her dignity and having a relationship, the \*\*\*\*\* will prioritize her dignity above all else.**

**10. When a woman doesn’t give in easily and doesn’t appear docile or submissive, it becomes more stimulating to obtain her.**

**11. Being right on the verge of getting something generates a desire that has to be satisfied.**

**12. A man knows which woman will give in to last-minute requests.**

**13. Whether you have terms and conditions indicates whether you have options. Almost immediately, you present yourself as a doormat or a dreamgirl.**

**14. If you smother him, he’ll go into defense mode and look for an escape route to protect his freedom.**

**15. Whenever a woman requires too many things from a man, he’ll resent it. Let him give what he wants to give freely; then observe who he is.**

**16. A \*\*\*\*\* gives a man plenty of space so he doesn’t fear being trapped in a cage. Then..he sets out to trap her in his.**

**17. If you tell him you are not interested in jumping into a relationship with both feet, he will set out to try to change your mind.**

**18. Always give the appearance that he has plenty of space. It gets him to drop his guard.**

**19. More than anything else, he watches to see if you’ll be too emotionally dependent on him.**

**20. He must feel that you choose to be with him, not that you need to be with him. Only then will he perceive you as an equal partner.**

**21. If a man has to wait before he sleeps with a woman, he’ll not only perceive her as more beautiful, he’ll also take him time to appreciate who she is.**

**22. Sex and the “spark” are not one and the same.**

**23. Before sex, a man isn’t thinking clearly and a woman is thinking clearly. After sex, it reverses. The man is thinking clearly and the woman isn’t.**

**24. Every man wants to have sex first; whether he wants a girlfriend is something he thinks about later. By not giving him what he wants up front, you become his girlfriend without him realizing it.**

**25. A man intuitively senses whether sexuality comes from a place of security or from a place of neediness. He knows when a woman is having sex to appease him.**

**26. Bad habits are easier to form than good ones, because good habits require conscious effort. Waiting encourages this effort.**

**27. If you pull the sexual plug at the last minute, he’ll label you a tease.**

**28. If he makes you feel insecure, let your insecurity be your guide.**

**29. A quality guy fantasizes about a woman who genuinely loves sex.**

**30. Any time a woman competes with another woman, she demeans herself.**

**31. When there is that undeniable “spark,” there is only one key to the lock.**

**32. Let him think he’s in control. He’ll automatically start doing things you want done because he’ll always want to look like “a king” in your eyes.**

**33. When you cater to his ego in a soft way, he doesn’t try to get power in an aggressive way.**

**34. When you appear softer and more feminine, you appeal to his instinct to protect. When you appear more aggressive, you appeal to his instinct to compete.**

**35. He’ll let a woman who becomes his doormat pay for dinner on the first couple of dates, but he wouldn’t think of it with his dream girl.**

**36. The token power position is for public display, but the true power position is for private viewing only. And this is the only one that matters.**

**37. If you give him a feeling of power, he’ll want to protect you and he’ll want to give you the world.**

**38. When a woman acts as though she’s capable of everything, she gets stuck doing everything.**

**39. Men don’t respond to words. They respond to no contact.**

**40. Talking about the “relationship” too much takes away the element of the “unknown” and thus the mystery.**

**41. Men respect women who communicate in a succinct way, because it’s the language men use to talk to one another.**

**42. When you are always HAPPY; And he is always free to GO; he feels LUCKY.**

**43. If you allow your rhythm to be interrupted, you’ll create a void. Then, to replace what you give up, you’ll start to expect and need more from your partner.**

**44. Most women are starving to receive something from a man that they need to give to themselves.**

**45. A woman looks more secure in a man’s eyes when he can’t pull her away from her life, because she is content with her life.**

**46. The second a woman works overtime to make herself fit his criteria, she has lowered the standard of that relationship.**

**47. You jump through hoops any time you repeatedly make it very obvious you’re giving your “all.”**

**48. You have to keep from being sucked down into quicksand. Unless you maintain control over yourself, the relationship is doomed.**

**49. Jumping through hoops often has a negative outcome: He sees it as an opportunity to have his cake and eat it, too. But when you stay just outside his reach, he’ll stay on his best behavior.**

**50. The nice girl gives away too much of herself when pleasing him regularly becomes more important than pleasing herself.**",20833,100 Attraction Principles from “Why Men Love Bitches” (#1-50),0,2019-10-27 13:31:55,,

I have to, because 90% of the time, if I don’t take initiative, it becomes an endless thread of messaging, until someone reduces it to one word answers and the other loses interest as a consequence. Anyway. 

I extract some info from their profile, and come up with something interesting for us to do. They’re always game. Helps that I’m paying. It works out well in that at the very least, I get a makeout session, if not more. Ladies, I’m not even masculine. It’s just 1) I’m not one to want to wait around for things to happen 2) It’s not like I’m going to have to worry about setting a precedent since it’s unlikely it will last and turn romantic anyway and 3) I don’t attract women who are leaders, I attract women that are even more femme and submissive than me (which I didn’t know was possible) 4) I don’t spin a ton of plates...I go out with very few women, so I can afford this. 

My point is, when I come to think about what it takes to plan a date...it’s not rocket science. And yet, it seems with men, it’s like it’s some sort of baffling mathematical equation. I have to be explicitly clear, like they’re children, and I don’t understand it. I’m the leader in literally every other aspect of my life, and all I want is someone who can manage to set a day, time and place convenient for me to get to that’s kind of interesting. In this city, that is ridiculously easy. There’s so much to do. But it’s like they’re at a loss and can’t figure out how Yelp and Google work. 

I can’t figure if they’re just juggling too many chicks (not my problem!) and can’t afford to take them all out, or if this simple, simple task is too much for their brains. Or, I just don’t inspire them enough (I’m always working on maxxing), because like I said, I’m hardly masculine, and yet, when I want something, I make the effort....I can’t imagine having like 100 times the testosterone and still waffling, and asking the woman to help me plan a date, because I “can’t figure out what to do”, if I really wanted to see her. Or maybe they want the lowest effort option, and there are either a ton of women willing to do the work for them, or they’d rather just be sexless for life than have to work for it (which totally goes against what I understand about testosterone and motivation but whatever).

I don’t know the reason. But what I do know? I *do* put in effort for my dates with men...I take an hour to get ready, I don’t wear the most comfortable clothes, and it takes every ounce of my willpower to not take the reins from them. Because if I do, I’ll never be able to gauge his level of *romantic* interest.  So it’s on *him*, showing up in his t-shirt and jeans after 5 minutes of getting ready time, being the gatekeeper to relationships, to plan and pay for the dates. Period. Do not settle for less. It’s hard, because most guys just don’t try for me. But I won’t settle for someone refusing to put in this basic amount of effort....because if I can manage to do it on the other side of dating, so can they. I know what it’s like to be in their position, and IT’S NOT THAT FUCKING HARD. End rant.",20788,"“If I can manage it, so can they.”",0,2019-10-27 13:04:40,,

A few guys will agree that only the short dudes are the ones complaining. But why do they pretend to not understand? What is the point of being purposely ignorant? You’re short John, pretending to not understand why women like tall guys isn’t going to help you get a date. You’re just going to look like a tool, regardless. I feel like I’ve had to ELI5 to these idiot morons just because it makes me so irritated. And I’m super blunt about it too.

It’s biology! Same bloody reason men want to be bulky/ripped like Dwayne Johnson or some Calvin Klein model. Because they know women don’t like scrawny dudes with Spongebob arms. It’s not rocket science! Like HELLO!

In fact most guys I’ve known are insecure of being short, or shorter than their guy friends.

I don’t feel like a girly girl when I’m taller than a dude in heels. I feel like Hulk. It’s creepy! 

Men are so bitter, it’s both pathetic and hilarious. Then they have the audacity to say it’s shallow. Yeah, Chad it’s shallow... was it shallow when you chose Susan over Charlotte because she had big boobs and blonde hair! Oh right, it’s only shallow when it hurts YOUR feelings.

Why else do many of us send DMs to women we see all but crying out for help in other subs? We all deserve the best. All of us deserve a healthy and loving relationship. 💜👑

We don't hate LVM or even NVM. We just wish they were HVM. As a woman, I want to listen to men who listen to me, help my sick partner when I know he would do the same, and clean with him instead of *for* him. I want to be able to tell my partner about any trauma I went through growing up without fear they will use it against me just because they're upset about something (or whelatever their excuse is). To either share in the emotional labor and/or we both get therapists. Etc. 

We don't need HVM, we just know they're the men who add value to our lives. When someone adds value to my life, I want to add to theirs too. As women, we are naturally inclined to give so much love, and *we just want it returned*. 

Now, I am not a completely unbiased woman. For example, I hate rapists of every category. *They* are subhuman to me. Murder rarely has a good reason but rape *never* does. 🤮

//**TRIGGER WARNING; Sexual abuse, rape**//

I really don’t mean to be negative here but it’s just a thought I had last night. So when I was in HS we had a classmate who had a very sweet and caring older brother, *everyone* he met immediately liked him because of how charismatic he was. This classmate had a very good bond with her brother too. She ended up introducing him to our music teacher and they dated for a while. Well everything’s well until one day she opens up to us about how her brother used to molest her when they were younger (he’s about a decade older) it was a very emotional moment for our whole friend group since it turned out most of us had been abused by a family member. Surprisingly we all still had great bonds with our abusers so we didn’t blame her. She had forgiven him but still wanted to share her story. 

It did make me think last night, so many men have done similar things but their victims had quietly forgiven them so no one ever finds out. I wouldn’t ever want to be with a guy who did something similar but at the same time I was too scared to out my abuser as well. I honestly don’t know where I’m going with this, but I hope someone understands what I’m saying here.",101605,Do you ever think about how many HVM are/have been secretly bad people?,0,,,

They said I look like a whole new woman and they wanted to know what change I have had in my life. I just told them nothing really but I sat down and realized, I haven't seen them since before FDS.

My skin has cleared up since a lot of my anxiety has dissipated and even my speech pattern has changed (for the better). I no longer stress about my relationship because I have come to the conclusion, if he leaves or cheats - I know it will not reflect my value and I know that it just means he was not the one. I do not hold as much anxiety around my relationship which feels amazing.

Once I joined FDS, I realized I was asking the world of what I was not even asking myself. I am not single, but I still follow this and implement the principles where I can and thus, much more positive about myself.

To think I would see a result physically blows my mind a bit. Even others are noticing a change and this really confirms, FDS works!

Thank you SO much ladies! This has genuinely impacted my life in a positive way and I can't wait to see what comes next. I appreciate all of you beautiful and strong women :)",101588,Just got asked what has changed about me by someone I have not seen in a few months,0,,,

I’ve lurked this sub for ages but haven’t really commented or felt bold enough to make a post. And honestly I constantly felt called out but was too stuck in undervaluing myself, and accepting shitty treatment from others, to really let the message sink in.

I was the definition of a pick-me. Convinced myself that I wanted to send nude photos, was okay when they were posted alone, and honestly ruined my brain and pleasure sensors by watching depraved porn, because the guys I was with liked it. 

No surprise that my self-esteem was low and I would bounce from disappointing “relationship” to “relationship”. I had been abused, physically, sexually and emotionally. I didn’t see any good in myself because I only had feedback from LVM who were happiest when I was at my lowest, because then I’d accept any behavior. 

After a particularly brutal breakup, where it felt like I was losing the love of my life, something slowly started to change. 

I was devastated at first. My entire life revolves around him, and in return he was avoidant, withdrawn, and would regularly betray my trust (still texting ex’s, commenting constantly on other women’s bodies, etc)

I finally felt at my breaking point. So I started therapy, reprioritizing my financial health, and focused on my hobbies and interests. I got back into creative writing, began the seriously hard work of overcoming untreated mental health issues, and started reconnecting with all the friends I’d been neglecting.

And within six months I was like an entirely new person. The kind this sub regularly is uplifting and pointing to as a goal to hit. Enjoying my alone time, engaging in hobbies, and putting more effort into my career, resulting in a promotion. 

But the idea of dating again seemed terrifying. And just when I was thought I was ready, my ex was back in my life. 

And for three months I threatened all of my growth. I was back to sobbing on the phone to my exasperated friends. So confused as to why this man wouldn’t change. Only wanted sex, on his terms, and at times that worked for him. 

I was back to accepting degradation during sex and having far more regular panic attacks.

I hate to say that another man rescued me. Because that sounds like pick me bullshit. But maybe it’s that another man, who’d been in my life for awhile, as a validating friend, helped connect everything I’d read here, and everything I knew for myself. 

It was like seeing in color for the first time of what a relationship could/should be, and what I deserve as my right. Someone who is very clear about his intentions (a future, marriage, children). All things I wanted but pretended not to so I could increase my chance of being “picked”. 

Here was this man, respectfully on my periphery until I was ready, expressing an immense interest in everything I had to say. Constantly offering to pay for every little thing, planning future trips, and crossing state lines at my request, to spend as much time with me as I’d allow. 

He’s warm, funny, inviting, with his own life filled with his own separate hobbies and interests. He wants to be my partner in life and support me in any area Im unsure in. 

I finally got my head out of my ass, took some more time to work through the BS with my ex in therapy, moved slowly, and am now in a committed relationship with a man who makes me feel valued, loved and secure every day. 

So thank you FDS. This is the first place and community that gave me a much needed wake up call. That demanded I respect myself and not accept the crumbs that LVM barely offer. 

Thank you for supporting women and wanting the best for them. Thank you, thank you. This place gave me the courage to finally love and take care of myself, which in turn finally left me open to accepting the love I deserve.",104322,Finally Done Learning The Hard Way,0,,,

From the stories I hear, however, cultural misogyny is still rampant, particularly in 'traditional' engineering fields). What are some STEM red flags that you ladies have experienced? What would you recommend for vetting men in these fields?

The first thing I would ask about are female classmates, even if they graduated many years ago. Were their many females that they went to class with? What was their perception of those women? Red flag responses:

🚩 Any insinuation that those women flirted for grades.

🚩 Any unsolicited ""insight"" those women's relationships or romantic lives. This is a HUGE red flag for a lack of respect and objectification of women in general. You are asking about women in an acedemic/professional setting, why else would he skip to their sex lives?

🚩 ""They had it easier with staff/professors.""

🚩 ""I was too afraid to talk to them for fear of sexual harassment."" Or remembering an of them by a sexual harassment claim alone.

🚩 ""I studied with one of them, but things never went further."" Went further where? Did things go further with the men you studied with..? 

🚩 Resentment over those women not paying attention to them.

🚩 ""My girlfriend was jealous of them 😏"" So you were triangulating off of women at school/work? 

🚩 ""They always complained about being around men."" Or ""there were a few cool ones that were just one of the guys""

There are many other responses that are not red flags: ""I honestly don't know, there weren't too many off them,"" or ""they didn't really stand out."" One could even go so far as acknowledging the shit that those women dealt with (they did, believe me), because some men seem to have a semblance of social awareness.

The OP had left an abusive man, who was also bipolar, and was now pregnant. She wanted to know if he would change🙄
I spoke about her considering an abortion due to the fathers mental illness and the genetic component, his abusive nature, the fact that he didn’t want her pregnant, etc. She removed the post but sent me a message that mental illness isn’t a “death sentence” and that her own father is schizophrenic, and she’s fine being alone, and her child will be treated if they present w mental illness. 

Here are my takeaways:

* She’s right, mental illness isn’t a death sentence. But don’t underestimate how tough it is to have a mental illness. I have one. Before being diagnosed as an adult, the rage, depression, recklessness and feeling of “otherness” was present from when I was a KID. Like, I have memories in kindergarten that relate to my illness. Since I was not diagnosed until I was an adult, it was untreated this entire time, except from me becoming more self aware and attempting to treat myself. No medications, and I wouldn’t have been able to afford them anyway, esp In my early twenties. Medications aren’t always cheap, and my illness requires that my medicine gets adjusted constantly. I’ve just started getting help, so I don’t even know what this will mean going forward- side effects, etc.

* With that said, we need to have serious conversations about the father of our children’s mental health, our own, and our parents mental health and co sister the consequences. Then make decisions going forward. I was never really a fan of children but I’m pretty sure if I had been diagnosed earlier, I would have never had my own. Also, the mental illness doesn’t go away, you just deal with it better. I’m considered high functioning, but that doesn’t deny the fact that every day I have the urge to kill myself. I just ignore it now. Like a sober person ignores drinking. Hopefully when I begin therapy this feeling will fade. 

* Again, I’m not trying to hate on people with mental illness. This is my perspective. My mom was divorced and my dad is abusive, she was always caught up with that and was super distracted from her children. They both have mental illness, looks like I’m the only one who has it though, from a sibling perspective. However, I have told no one about my diagnosis, so they could have their own secrets too. Stigma too strong, maybe one day🙄

* Aside of the mental illness portion, the fact that the father is abusive is pretty bad too. He may fight for custody, he may have access to your child. You can’t leave the state if he denies you, etc etc. She stated he wouldn’t do that, but these men will be the biggest deadbeats, taking you to court over and over again, for trivial shit. I’ve seen friends lose their jobs because of repeated court visits. They lost money hiring lawyers. They lost precious time. 

* I actually don’t believe in abortion for myself but I’m a firm believer that it benefits women. Thankfully I was never in the position to have to decide to have one or not, but I’m still grateful for it. It’s something to seriously consider when you become pregnant and you have no relationship with the father. Or for whatever reason🤷🏽‍♀️

* The point of this post was to help ladies understand the consequences of dealing with abusive men, men with untreated mental illness, and to understand that family history can affect your child. We don’t talk about special needs/mental illness/other physical ailments enough, and we should. 

* Again, we can’t foresee our future and what it holds but we absolutely can make the best decisions with our choices with men. Vet for the best, period. Having a child is so much easier when the father is a willing participant.  If you have to post if your abusive boyfriend will change, probably not the best guy. Just sayin....them consequences fall swift and hard when they want to.",104309,Understand the consequences,0,,,

It’s an account of one ship and her crew in particular, but also discusses at length what life was like for whalers and their families in the 1800s. It also gives shocking detail about the actual killing and slaughter and use of the whales, the scale of which (both the size of the individual whales and the extent of global whale slaughter) almost defies comprehension. Of particular interest are the “Nantucket Girls” – essentially, the women left behind by the sailors as they left on years-long sea voyages – if they returned at all. 

One might assume this would be a disturbing, depressing and lonely life for the women left behind on a small island community. In fact, it was quite the opposite! Here’s an excerpt from Philbrick’s book:

“Perphaps no community before or since has been so divided by its commitment to work. For a whaleman and his family, it was a punishing regimen: two to three years away, three to four months at home. With their men gone for so long, Nantucket's women were obliged not only to raise the children but also to run many of the island's businesses. It was largely the women who maintained the complex web of personal and commercial relationships that kept the community functioning. J. Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur, whose classic Letters from an American Farmer describes his lengthy stay on the island a few years prior to the outbreak of the Revolution, suggested that the Nantucket women's ""prudence and good management ... justly entitles them to a rank superior to that of other wives.""
Quakerism contributed to the women's strength. In its emphasis on the spiritual and intellectual equality of the sexes, the religion fostered an attitude that was in keeping with what all Nantucketers saw plainly demonstrated to them every day: that women, who on Nantucket tended to be better educated than the island's men, were just as intelligent, just as capable as their male counterparts.
By necessity and choice, the island's women maintained active social lives, visiting one another with a frequency Crèvecoeur described as incessant. These visits involved more than the exchange of mere gossip. They were the setting in which much of the business of the town was transacted. The ninteenth-century feminist Lucretia Coffin Mott, who was born and raised on Nantucket, remembered how a husband back from a voyage commonly followed in the wake of his wife, accompanying her to get-togethers with other wives. Mott, who eventually moved to Philadelphia, commented on how odd such a practice would have struck anyone from the mainland, where the sexes operated in entirely different social spheres.
Some of the Nantucket wives adapted quite well to the three-years-away, three-months-at-home rhythm of the whale fishery. The islander Eliza Brock recorded in her journal what she called the ""Nantucket Girl's Song"":


I have made up my mind now to be a Sailor’s wife,
To have a purse full of money and a very easy life,
For a clever sailor husband is so seldom at his home,
That his wife can spend the dollars with a will that’s all her own,
Then I’ll haste to wed a sailor, and send him off to sea,
For a life of independence is the pleasant life for me,
But every now and then I shall like to see his face,
For it always seemes to me to beam with manly grace,
With his brow so nobly open, and his dark and kindly eye,
Oh my heart beats fondly towards him whenever he is nigh,
But when he says Goodbye my love, I’m off across the sea
First I cry for his departure, then laugh because I’m free,
Yet I’ll welcome him most gladly, whenever he returnes
And share with him so cheerfully all the money that he earns
For he’s a loving Husband, though he leads a roving life
And well I know how good it is to be a Sailor’s Wife.

Nantucket Girls have even entered a bit into Pop Culture. I love this song by The Tossers, a musical adaptation of the Nantucket Girl’s Song, with a few extra lines added to the poem:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Zi7p2WXo

Additional lines from the man’s point of view:
Oh I'm a man that's handsome, I'm strapping and I'm young
And when I’ve got a job to do, the job gets fuckin' done
I want a love to keep me happy, I want a love that's true
And of all my past endeavors if it's smitten then I'm with you
So I'll put on my buckle and shoe and I'll comb up my hair
And I’ll tighten up my belt and shirt so it's handsome I'll appear
And I'll work both day and night to keep the money rolling in
So I can come back to my love, so I can see you again.

And from the Woman’s point of view:
Oh to walk the street or countryside whatever I may know
I know that I will be okay where ever it is I go
I'm sorry I don't want children to follow at my feet
I'm happy by myself not chasing kids into the street
Oh I wasn't born for marrying for the game or for the blame
And when my friends do call me I like hearing my own name
But when he says goodbye my dear, I'm off across the sea
First I cry for his departure, then I laugh because I'm free!

So there you go… a little bit of upbeat history (herstory?) to get you through the week! And a reminder that high-value men and high-value women transcend time. The qualities that we strive to create in ourselves, and the qualities that we look for in a partner, are intrinsic to our humanity. The qualities that make a man attractive in 2020 are the same qualities that made a man attractive in 1820.",104306,Nantucket Girls – High-Value Women of the 1800s,0,,,

'He's only picking on you because he likes you'. 

Can. We. Please. Stop. This. 

Nobody who likes you and values you as a person, will be mean to you. This child is obviously not a very nice child, whether through poor parenting, poor judgement, or other unknown reasons. 

Why is it that when a girl is bullied in school by a boy, it's because he apparently fancies her, but when she's bullied by another girl, the other girl is a horrible child? Why is it, when a boy bullies a girl in school, it's because he fancies her, but when he gets older, the same behaviour is classed as abusive? 

My partner very gently tried to tell her all of the above, but said he couldn't shake the feeling that he didn't take him seriously ('boys will be boys'), and that if were to be another girl with bad behaviour, the lady would be marching in the classroom to see the teacher.

There are many factors involved in the dating break but coronavirus was not one of them for me. I met a terrifying sociopath online and was pretty traumatized from that situation. Before that I met the typical crop of LVM online. About 50-100 men. I was very interested in a couple of disgusting ones who were hot/cold charming players. I really tried to properly date but I didn’t yet really get the concept that LVM were not going to magically change into HVM if I did and said all the right things. I actually blamed all my dating problems on me slipping up. I would then keep dating them and hoping they would treat me how they did before I slipped up and ruined things. I see the posts other women on FDS make where they are still giving men chances and replying to texts they are above. I think it’s possible I was having such awful dating problems before because I was simply oblivious to this stuff. I am considering dating again. I am not sure I want to yet but I feel like I am so different mentally now that I cannot imagine attracting the same LVM.

I told my ex that back home, sometimes my dad beats me and my mom, and usually it’s random outbursts. It was really bad when I was younger but has calmed down a bit. I have asked my mom numerous times to leave him and she tells me I’m crazy and that he’s the “gem of her life”. I’m also a 1st gen immigrant and calling the police on him would alienate me from my whole family back in the homeland.

I felt like I needed to tell him this because my personal policy was I couldn’t date someone who wasn’t okay with my home life as is (because I’ve tried everything I promise). He didn’t handle it well and told me I was never allowed to talk about it because he couldn’t handle it.

I’ve changed that now and obviously don’t want to bring it up early in a relationship. I never tell friends about this so why would I tell a boyfriend early on?

But what I have trouble is I just can’t be married to someone or be in a long term relationship without them knowing the real story with me. Marriage involves families and I don’t want to live a lie that I have a perfect family with my future husband. I want to feel relaxed that he knows the real me and the baggage I come with and can still love me and offer emotional support from time to time.

Like bro???


Let me give some examples. This usually happens in cases of male and female friends. 



I had a male bestfriend but now became an acquaintance because of ex. Ex never liked the fact my friendship with him was so positive and bubbly and that it actually made me happy. Whenever this bestfriend would come to visit me from another state, I'd post pics and ex would literally fume. Also, told me not to associate with him much. Later on, he broke up with me stating I made him feel jealous about bestfriend. That fucked up with my mind for quite some time like I wouldn't do any such thing because honestly I loved him so much, I talked about him to my grandparents which is a huge thing here in my place and I've never done it with anyone. Everyone around me told me that his insecurities were responsible for his jealousy and not what I did. But his friend also started blaming me.



Anyway, I begged, pleaded him to come back and he came and everything was sorted but then came the emotional abuse or maybe the abuse became more clear. He berated me a lot verbally and I finally got the courage and left his ass but he still plays the victim to this day. Anyway, that's not the point, the point is, all this time, behind my back, he himself was emotionally cheating on me with his female bestfriend and maybe even hooking up. He made me cancel my flight tickets for his birthday and someone flew all the way from the north end of the country to the south at his place for his birthday and surprise surprise, it was his bestfriend. So yeah, they could have hooked up too. I saw the red flags and I avoided.",106535,Have you noticed this distinct hypocrisy in men?,0,,,

He should pull out all the stops. Lighting and music to set the mood, massage, oral, and obviously an orgasm for you. Total respect. Total passion, pleasure and joy. 

What kind of a man fails the first time and thinks that's okay? I'll answer, a man who doesn't give a fuck about you *and* has no damn sense. He's too dumb for you. Let the streets have him. He's a loser. And sexist. 

99% a man who did give me an orgasm the first time gave me an orgasm every time we had sex. But I never had a man who failed to give me an orgasm the first time ever start succeeding either at all or with any regularity, let alone meeting the bare minimum which is me orgasming every time. Just. Like. Him.

Don't have sex with the guy until he proves himself with his hands and his mouth first. Make him WORK for it. If the guy can't make you come without his dick he's probably not going to succeed with it and doesn't care to. It's really fucking easy if they put in effort and time. He should be researching how to be a good lover to a woman.

Women aren't even orgasming anymore than they were back in the 1970s. 50 years ago! 50 years. And now on top of that we're also being expected to put up with anal rape and abuse, being slapped in the face, spat on, called names and insulted and abused. All for the dude's dick. Why? He's already got enough going on for his dick every time he has sex. 

It's our turn!

Let him wear the degrading lingerie and gyrate around to turn ""me"" on. Let him talk about how he better service me orally because I cooked him dinner or went grocery shopping. Let him dread the anal abuse on his birthday. LOL not really because this is a gross, disgusting and exploitative way to view sex. But this is how low value men think about us and our bodies. And they show it with their treatment of us in sex.

Sex is the most intimate and vulnerable area of our lives. And it is where women are most exploited and abused.

So, I have this friend. We’re about the same age. She’s 31. I’m 30. Both of us are single and dating.


We mostly use online dating because it’s just impossible to meet anyone in LA area. Especially right now.
 

Soooo pretty much everything everyone says about men and what they’re looking for is absolutely true. Men do not care about anything except how “hot” you are. I’m not even going to say attractive or pretty because I consider myself a pretty girl but I know I am not ‘hot’ but other than being pretty I offer SO.MUCH.MORE. And I would describe my friend as ‘hot’ but yeah I’m being honest so I’ll say it, I have a prettier face than her and again I offer more than just a pretty face. But because she has that ‘hot’ vibe to her, she gets 100 times more attention than I do and I’m really really not an attention seeker (she is) nor do I care for that type of attention and that’s why this is not me comparing myself to her.

But this past year has seriously been so eye-opening for me. It has made me realize that men truly only care for appearance and it has to be a certain type of look, like I said being just “cute” or “pretty” or even classy and beautiful doesn’t cut it lol you need to be ig model hot I swear haha. Because I personally have always viewed her as like…. I’m just going to use unfiltered terminology here. I viewed her as an attractive, fun but not very intelligent girl. She’s also very needy like she basically just wants to find a husband to supplement her life financially but she also wants to be attracted to him so she won’t just settle for a sugar daddy. I am constantly rolling my eyes at a lot of her behavior, like she posts a lot of thirst traps on social media, she’s very like “LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME” and I always assumed that her tactics would eventually catch up to her and idk I thought older, successful men in their 30’s (which is what we’re both dating) would eventually choose someone more sophisticated rather than some club-going, Instagram-obsessed, hot chick..? I’m just appalled at how men aren’t turned off by her attention seeking ways.

Like I’m aware that I come off more as ‘gf material’ I guess you could say. But the thing is we’re both trying to get into relationships, like she is too. I don’t think she comes off as ‘gf material’ at first glance though but that is what she wants. And I’ll be honest she isn’t the type of girl to sleep around a lot and I’m not at all either. But like here for example, we’ll both go on dates okay. And we realize the guy isn’t serious so we cut things off and are like okay whatever he was only trying to hook up and we’re not down for that. But the guys she goes out with will stick around and keep hitting her up for monthsssss even if she turns them down every single time but the guys I go out with literally disappear into oblivion, like it’s like I didn’t even exist….? And like that makes me think okay is it cause I’m just not as attractive? I’ve never had self-esteem issues honestly and I still don’t think I do but I do wonder like okay… what’s going on…. If those guys cearly aren’t getting what they’re seeking why do they keep hitting her up and why don’t my guys do the same with me?? And so it makes me feel like all the things I tell myself about how ‘oh maybe I’m just too gf material’ isn’t even true since no guy wants to commit to me but like they’re not even turned off enough by me to want to hook up either…? AGAIN, not that I want that but you know as a woman I really do wonder…. And then she also wants a relationship, and nobody is out here committing to her either but her dm’s are flooded with messages cause obviously these guys are soo into her.


Oh!! Craziest part of the story is, she is divorced (I’m not) and she still spends basically every weekend with her ex-husband, she’s not sleeping with him though and treats him very poorly, like very demanding and he spends all this money on her. I keep telling her she needs to stop using him or maybe just get back with him because I think that’s what he wants but she says no because she’s not attracted to him. Anyways so yeah the craziest part is that she spends every weekend with him but talks to/dates all these other guys who have no idea she’s hanging out with her ex-husband and her ex-husband also doesn’t know about her other guys either and I’m just here like…. I can’t even get one guy to like me back… lol  


So moral of the story. Life is not fair. Nice people don’t finish last. And life is most definitely not like the movies. And that is the conclusion to my vent, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",106516,"My life is like the movie ‘Something Borrowed’ except in the end, I don’t get the guy because life is not a movie.",0,,,

I’m not currently dating anyone but am desperately trying to move on from my ex and am still learning how to decipher LVM behaviors.  I feel sharing my experiences will not only help me move on but also help warn other women of this behavior and keep vigilant. Feel free to share your own! I was inspired by a mixture of my feelings and another thread where you guys deciphered things.

-why was there a blow job video (someone giving him head) on your phone when we were on our like third date? You really left it open, “forgot”, and then showed it to me?! You didn’t exactly rush to stop it either.

-Why did you only decide to “want to marry me” because I took your mom to the gym? He said that’s how he knew.

-Why did my “chore list” get exponentially longer over time? If I didn’t keep up- he’d be very angry and would tell me I’m worthless and to just “keep doing what I’m doing, because apparently that’s my best.”

-Speaking of chores, why did you get so angry with me anytime the sheets weren’t done? Why did you hate me so much for this? I knew I’d be in BIG trouble if I fucked up the timing of new sheets on the bed and when he wanted to sleep. He would yell for 30+ mins and tell me not to interrupt and tell me how horrible I am to him and contribute nothing.

-Why did you consider me to be selfish? Yes I stayed with you and you paid for our meals. But you didn’t exactly act selfless yourself. Anything you ever did for me got thrown back in my face. 

-Why did you tell me to start a business only to get pissed that it became successful? Why did you start saying that I should work for your company and that there’s more money and potential for me there? 

-Why did you buy a brand new truck when I was truck shopping myself?

-Why did you start trying to charge rent? 

-Why were you obsessed with trying to take videos of me giving you BJs? 

-Why did you begin requesting BJs or quickies every morning only to deny me every single time when I tried to do what you asked? 

-Why did you always promise good sex later only for it to never happen?

-Why didn’t you want me anymore?

-Why were you always resentful towards me for not giving you a BJ and letting you come on my face on vacation? “I paid for it, fuck yeah I expect BJs! I’d give head if I got a free vacation” of course he was an asshole on vacation so I wasn’t in the mood to do it! 

-He would also say he would fuck his partner all the time and clean the house if they paid for everything. “you’re not even a good bangmaid” he said to me in all sincerity. Yes I made the mistake of explaining how I felt he was trying to make me that. 

-Why did you get angry with me when I couldn’t help you do certain things physically? “God I forgot how small you are.” And he’d wave me out of way and huff and try to do the thing himself. And I mean like trying to lift or move a fully loaded trailer or lift something ridiculously heavy for a woman of my stature. 

-Why did you always say you were so happy I was pretty and lucky I was hot, and that I deserve better and I’m too good, only to scorn me for ever wearing make-up or pretty clothes. “Its not you” he would say.

-Why were you so into BJs and threesomes? 

-Why did you insert your finger into my ass without warning or asking? Why did you care SO much that I tried anal with an ex and didn’t like it? How is it empowering for you to do the same thing to me that I know I don’t like?! The control aspect of this makes no sense to me. 

-Why did you start saying how much you loved Erin on the Office? “God I LOVE her”

-Why were you so mean to me when I cut my finger open and the meds wore off so I was crying in pain asked to be comforted? How could you just scold me, roll over, and start snoring?  I lost a chunk and five months later still have weird nerve sensitivity.

-Why did I always have to be positive for you to be so negative? How could I be when you made me feel so on edge every single second of every single day?

-Why did we always have to take showers together? 

-Why did you resent me so much for staying “for free” every night when I tried to stay at home. “No please don’t leave” he would beg every single night. 

-“I got this. I want you to save your money.” You would say only to be resentful in the manners that have been described above. 

-Why wouldn’t you clean up the puppy pee? You would literally leave it there to dry and rot. 

-What was so wrong about me? Why was I never enough? Why did you keep me around? 

It felt really good to let all that out. I know he was obviously terrible and these aren’t red flags but straight up abuse. I just can’t wrap my head around all of it. I just don’t understand how someone could be so cruel. I don’t understand how he could straight up ruin my self-esteem, move on and begin dating two weeks after we broke up. I bet he was going to keep looking for his wifey baby mama while I stayed around at least trying to make him happy. If he didn’t actually just cheat, which I felt he did. It was better than nothing to him to have me try and fail to meet his standards. I understand a lot of this and FDS and the handbook saved me. But it still just really fuckin hurts! I tried so hard to love him and be the best for him because we were talking about having a future, but he was stringing me along. And it makes me feel worthless deep inside. I know I have worth but have to admit it took a chunk out of my armor. I feel ugly and useless whenever I think about how he treated me. He was a piece of shit and I was an unaware pickme. I know so much better now but it just doesn’t take the hurt away.",106491,Help a Sister Decipher these NVM Abusive Behaviors,0,,,

Giving men endless chances is a sure fire way for them to take advantage and use you. If a man wants the chance to be in your life, the onus is on them to prove that they are worthy of consideration. The onus should never be on you to keep making excuses for them, or explaining away/accommodating their poor behavior. Furthermore, you do not have to explain why you want to end a relationship. You do not owe anyone an explanation, because nobody has a right to your time, attention and energy. Protect your space and peace by getting used to leaving situations that are bad for you without explaining yourself (unless you want to).

This morning I picked the kids up and I brought up something related to something financial and he just did what he always does which is gaslight and bullsh*t and turn it around on me and make himself the victim. Booohoooo. I stayed for so long because he’s extremely good at manipulative kind games and me being pretty normal and straight forward couldn’t wrap my heart around it because I can’t and don’t think it act like that so I stayed and thought u was at blame.
Anything so he tried to pull that sh*t on me this morning and I, in my most deadpan, unemotional, Grey rock, registered Nurse face and voice told him in no explicit terms that XYZ  is due that that I’ll go through the proper Aka legal channels to get what I am owed. Long story I’m not going into it right now.

So that set him off and he proceeded to have his 100% typical and expected toddler-esque temper tantrum and when I didn’t budge, get intimidated or apologize he stomped off fuming.

I get home and got this email asking why I am now so aggressive and that he logged in and paid it. Yes my being “aggressive” just was so unexpected. I didn’t cry, I didn’t apologize, I didn’t look scared. I just stop giving into his sh*t so that made me “aggressive”.

Dating for men is so so hard! Women only like 20% of men! I’m a nice guy and we always finish last!”*

But...how many of us have given the “nice guy” who is shorter than our preference, or fatter than our preference, or less ambitious than our preference, a chance and still had to put up with their low value behavior once your “novelty” wore off. 

Yes, dick is low value and abundant. But pick mes and impressionable young women (almost all of us at some point) are *also abundant*. The fact of the matter is: if we are giving average, unspectacular men with one or two decent qualities (like doesn’t hit us or neg us - yet) a shot, there are going to be other women of our same caliber who are willing to give these men a shot at well. A lot of these men have actually found their niche in appearing to be the non threatening option, when all they are are a wolf in sheep’s clothing because they know how low the bar is for men. If he washes his hair he’s already in the top 20% of men. It’s not that hard and they know it. 

In other words, if men are not hot enough to have women voluntarily throw themselves at them rock star status, these average joes consider the dating market “impossible” and bemoan the ease in which their mythical butt buddy “Chad” can sleep with any woman he wants. What they don’t tell you, is that they’ve still managed to collect an arsenal of past pick me dates to send nudes to on Snap Chat. They’re also in a plethora of online “relationships” with cam girls they’re genuinely obsessed with, who will strip for them  and make them feel like Kings for a buck. Yes, this includes your brothers and your male best friend. I’m sorry love, but do they tell you when they jack off? No. But they do it every day, multiple times a day, to deprived ass shit. We have to wake up. There is no such thing as an innocent man unless he’s straight up asexual. 

What this does is create a deep sense of abundance mentality that men hide in public. Why would they hide this? Because the innocent, celibate, desperate for love act works on vulnerable women looking for their unicorn. MaYbE iF hE lOoKs liKe sEtH rOgAn hE’lL lOve mE. 

So they get online and act like undesirables with soooo much love to offer. They then use this angle to pick up a PLETHORA of women who are usually fresh out of a failed relationship with someone they were actually attracted to.

**Worse yet are the average but cute enough guys.** LADIES. THESE types unspectacular dudes are the WORST. They also happen to be my personal go to when dating. You are not the only one who thinks he’s “cute but not too cute.” I grew up being friends with these type of men and their game is A-1.  Red Pillers talk a lot of shit, but if he falls into this category of cute but not intimidatingly so, his rotational dating roster  is likely to be impressive in this age of lib fem fuck buddy era. Cute but not too cute guys who can wipe their ass and cook themselves lunch are a very HOT commodity. God forbid he has a decent job. If they can land someone like you, chances are they’re running game on a lot of women. This is not about feeling competitive or insecure. It’s about learning the game and not getting played by manipulators. 

On the off chance you really stoop to the ground and give a dude who is genuinely repulsive to women a shot. Well first, sis - re-evaluate your decision and realize you don’t like him, you like the ego boost he gives you. But secondly, *your  acceptance of him automatically boosts his perceived value to others. Especially pick me women.*

Any man, hot, short, ugly or fat, can tell you that dating above his league does literal magic to their “sexual market value” (I know I need to stay away from the trash heap that is PPD, but it gets me thinking). Because this part is TRUE. 

BOTH of my exes began to be literally  approached by pick mes who had ignored them their whole lives until they started dating me. Both of my exes, who treated me like a queen for years, not only gave into the temptation, but began seeking it out, all the while doing everything in their power to convince me they love me and only me. 


The point of this post is NOT to incite insecurity or a sense of completion with these invisible women. It is actually to help dispel this prevailing theory that men are hopeless loveless victims with no options. 

Sometimes the difference between a man who decides to **act** high value rather than low value are his options. I personally think no man IS high value, he can only ACT high value. It’s not a personality trait, but an active decision he makes every single day when no one is watching. 

Never ever let your guard down ladies. If he’s cute, he knows it. If he’s not cute but knows how to stroke your ego just right, he knows it. If he’s bomb and bed and can treat you like shit just cause he can help you cum, he knows it. 

I’m tired of acting like men are these clueless buffoons. They may be buffoons but they are not clueless.

I’m posting both to seek advice in the specific area of non-exclusive dating as it’s a new concept to me. I’m also posting this as a way of recording where I’m at and internally clarifying my rules and adaptation of this strategy. I’d love discussion and commentary on any aspects of it that you may have advice for. I’ll front-load the questions I have which relate directly to the title as idk how long this post may end up just yet.


The exclusivity talk. 

• Assume non-exclusivity or ask?

The term “Dating” isn’t widely used where I’m from and non-exclusivity is usually assumed but never discussed. This results in a lot of broken hearts and I’m not sure if it’s just how things are done here or if it’s the maturity of myself and the people around me. Anyhow, the result is, I find it difficult to bring up non-exclusivity (I have no issue discussing exclusivity when it comes to it) as a discussion to verbalise the assumption of non-exclusive. Is it okay to just assume the non-exclusivity, I generally don’t feel comfortable with just assuming non-exclusivity as I feel like I’m in a sense misleading them or just asking to hurt feelings. I also feel weird talking about it because of how strangely taboo the topic seems. 

• When should this be brought up? 

My biggest issue on timing this is that I consider the first time we meet as just that, meeting. I feel weird outlining exclusivity with someone I’m only meeting for the first time, and it’s not a date. I feel like laying ground rules out before agreeing to an actual date is weird too like “really enjoyed meeting you, we should go on a date together but btw you gotta agree to date me non-exclusively”. The more dates I have the more it feels like I’ve hidden some dark secret from them. It’s ridiculous and I know I’m overthinking this but I’d appreciate some guidance to getting this step down in a way that just flows with things and exudes the air of “of course this is how things are done, what did you expect? my full attention after 2seconds of knowing you, boy you gotta earn that, show me you’re worth my bothering” 



My rules and take on the strategy 
(discussions, advices, and opinions are welcome and appreciated):

- I’m planning on dating non-exclusively for at absolute minimum 6 months before I consider going exclusive with a guy. I’m primarily dating using OLD because my work/hobbies are all guys at least 5years younger than me which is too large a gap down at my current age. The nature of OLD means I’m starting from scratch in terms of knowing these guys and I need time to get to really know them before I’m going to commit anything to one. 


- The first time I meet any of them it’s just that, meeting them. It’s not a date, I will not go on a date with someone I haven’t met yet. This one’s pretty easy for me to communicate as I straight up say “sorry, I don’t date people I’ve not met yet but how about we do Y so we can meet?” anytime they mention the word date. 

- He will be immediately dropped if the date isn’t out doing something. Yes I game, no you do not get to then suggest gaming nights as our only date. (Netflix and chill included in this). 

- Sex: I’ve been a little quick of the mark in this department in the past I’ll admit but I’ve stopped that. My rule is no sex until we’re in an exclusive and committed relationship. (I do supposedly break this rule with one guy who I won’t date but is quite fun, but damn girls 6 months is a long ass time and that’s only if I meet the right dude too!)

- Phone calls and texting: you wanna talk to me? You can pick up the phone and call me. I am done with his millennial scared of the phone crap. I get a better sense of who you are and whether we connect or can even communicate through talking on the phone. It means I know whether you’re paying me attention or distracted by something else too. 
Rules on the phone:
      1. This is a conversation not a breathing contest. 
      2. I’m a busy B, lets keep it short and sweet so we’re both left wanting a little more. (There may also be a queue waiting).
      3. Txting is asynchronous communication. It does not require an immediate response and should not be used to hold such a conversation. Use it for plans and passing notes.  

- No more than four guys at a time. I’m too busy, three is ideal. I want another one? Pick one to drop first. 

- Don’t have two dates with the same guy in a row. I’m gunna get myself all excited and biased towards him and that’s not fair. I’m trying to find the guy who best fits me and my life, not just the last one I had tacos with. 

-Gut instinct goes. A red flag doesn’t have to mean he’s a terrible person, however, it always mean he’s the wrong one for me. Listen to it. 

I’m really curious to know how this compares to your personal approach/strategy/rules or if any of you have further advice or areas that are important which I may not have considered. I find it important to consider how I want to handle key aspects of dating ahead of time to ensure I’m making the decision rather than “the flow” making it for me.

This dim idiot finds everything amusing (simpleton), including receiving a nude whilst you just turned your back. He likes the forbidden fruit, drama, and gets a kick out of duping women to knock their esteem. This will follow often immediately after he feels he has you 'hooked' ...aka slept with him, bonded through Oxycontin, and started to catch feelings.

*Ask him where he was lastnight and he says 'with the boys' with a wide grin.....................RED FLAG*

* **Extremely fast texter**, you can make out he's switching between convo's very quickly as if he's bullshitting 4 diff Tinder girls on whatsapp....SIS!!! Its cos he is 
* **Snappy replies-** *'At my friends' 'yeh was good'* when you're used to something more elaborate &amp; him making more effort. He's dodging the topic, cos it puts him on the spot/makes him more guilty. Put him on the spot and think on your feet, probe deeper with a few specific questions relating to the alibi he throws u, does he stumble?
* **Lovebombing**\-seems TOO good to be true , flooding with compliments acting like he just saw jesus weeping through your pupils, too agreeable, seems too chivalrous for how attractive he is, too eager, too intense, too empathetic, too compatible. Your instincts usually flare up at this, but cos you fancy him, he's riled up the hormones and u secretly want it to be wrong you ignore it. Ask yourself, why there's a hint of doubt, and whether these types of men are common.
* **Won't ring you-** says he doesn't like talking on the phone, sticks to whatsapp voicenotes (less risky than a random call at your sidechicks), you don't have his instagram, he's a 'low key' guy (possible, but often BS). Basically, hes avoiding you finding his social media blueprint, from which you could monitor him/find more info.
* **Pics of kids on his phone-** could well be his niece, or his uncles wifes baby...but equally could mean he has a bunch of kids from his wreckless spermloading. Do not assume, try to probe when around his friends, look out for ANYTHING baby related around his house.
* **Overflated confidence**\-Something off about his machoism- he might have a deep voice, be 6ft2, be ripped or whatever else but there's something not quite convincing about his 'alpha act'......most likely his shit ton of emotional baggage and insecurities he's waiting to project on you through coercive behaviours. Basically his manly mature gentleman act is a farce. Chances are he's broke/not intelligent/in debt/mommys boy 
* **Controlling-**Mentions exclusivity quick- but only in relation to you. If you're v attractive/get a lot of attention particularly he will be concerned about this (they hate competition /idea of other men on your tail) and try to mate gate you/ambush you away from potential interests as early as poss. If its too soon/he hasn't demonstrated commitment, don't fall for this trap (1-3 months he could be a blocked contact)
* **Makes you paranoid-** Deliberately baits you, gives you ambiguous replies to straight forward questions, whilst grinning, hiding phone in an obvious hidden manner as if he wants you to THINK he's getting it in like that (even tho he's probably grafting his ass off or its his gran)....generally you're getting a vibe he's tryna rub something in your face. Fuckboys will do this sometimes when they want to be cowards/ kick you off the roster too, make it obv they're up to no good, so you will blow up and cut them off.
* **Blows hot and cold**\- classic fuckboy tactic, but effective, aimed to disorientate you, make you second guess yourself (worth/boundaries/approach/attractiveness) and get you on your tippy toes tryna claw back his attention. Often leaves u feeling like you just got spat out of a hurricane on the highway *'how did I get here?'.* Also could be sign he's lost interest, unfocused or got bored of the chase",15493,common redflags in f*ckboys,0,2019-10-10 08:34:16,,

Real men don't fall for you, which is why you will never be satisfied and the male you think you deserve is ever fleeting. you cannot ever be satisfied.

look at him and say in a very matter of fact manner: *'Do I look like a woman that pays half to you?'*, then raise your eyebrows. Literally make him feel ashamed to have even of asked, he will laugh it off nervously and get out that damn card.

Sorry, being real now, the only type of men that ask you to pay half are LOW market men going on tons of unsuccessful dates, therefore they wanna stay cheapskate cos they are not confident anything will come of it. I can tell you that for a fact

Who cares if he thinks you owe him sex........who CARES. Men are widely known to be entitled bullshitters, make him pay.

If you get too generous in the beginning don't be surprised sis, when he starts joking 'you gonna treat me' 'you get it babe' ''thought you were an independent woman'....then it'll be the 'I'm short have u got x'....'I'm broke' 'I got laid off'..'wanna help me drown my sorrows'. Men are v simple creatures, if they see an INCH of opportunity they will take a mile. Never be generous with them, they will not appreciate it.

The fact is it is almost always low market rejects or broke unstable men that will do this. A real man puts his money where his mouth is

I've noticed a few of the more attractive fuckboys try dipping their toes in joking about this stuff now (testing the waters bc of equality debates/menz rights bs), which I don't find amusing at all. I can tell u why that is.......because more pick me women are offering to pay half, in a bid to prove their 'Independence', aka men pleasing bs trying to spoil them with ZILCH knowledge if he's serious. A meal is not a CONTRACT him paying is him putting his money where his mouth is , showing investment and making it more expensive for him to fuck around. Why make it cheaper for him? **A MANS WORDS ARE VERY CHEAP. That is why they pay.**

I literally refuse to pay for a mans anything &amp; its never stopped me having longterm relationships. They are far more likely to BS you /cheat than vice versa. WHY would you be paying and pampering a man to BS you. You will end up looking v silly. A lot of these 'I SPOIL MY MAN' women , lmao, I can't even. Lets just say 9/10 they are being naive/being cheated on and the man is laughing behind her back about how much he gets out of her. He may be all lovehearts and rainbows on instagram, but not behind her back. Handmaidens do women everywhere a disservice. 

Only time you should be working out mutual finances is when you're years deep into a committed relationship and even then he must be well trained to know he takes the lead.

You have to have patience and you have to really practice diligent self care and boundary-setting, but if you stick to the principles outlined here you will attract only high quality men. 

I was stuck in a four year relationship with a manbaby. I was a live in mommy essentially.  I was 27 at the time (he was 33) and he wouldn’t commit and he wasn’t what I needed or wanted.  

I had come across some materials from Sami Wunder (I took plenty and left plenty, I didn’t follow her program to a tee) and I decided to leave my ex. I also decided that I wasn’t going to be the forever girlfriend anymore and I was not going to settle for less. 

I stopped chasing. I stopped calling, emailing, texting, and all other initiation with men. I wouldn’t show up or ask to clarify plans if men only said “hey, did you want to meet up Saturday?”... if he never followed up with a time and place, he’d get scheduled over. 

I stopped texting entirely. If men wanted to date me, they had to call.

**And that is female peers and family members who guilt trip you for not reciprocating sexual interest from a male friend** or staying with an ex THEY liked for you

The truth is, quite often this is coming from women that don't value themselves, have high esteem or many options. In fact I'd go out on a whim and say its usually coming from bitter women that have begrudgingly settled for beta's, most times. (Pssst- getting slightly bitter about men is understandable, however responding by committing to a subpar loser is submission). So they will view you as very uptight, or even superficial, for turning a man down, even if he's a low market square that repels 99% of other women he is attracted to. These type unknowingly think very similar to traditional red pill men in that you're going to 'hit a wall' and run out of options, but that is likely a past/present insecurity they are projecting onto you. They can't get their head around you being able to 'choose' rather than being 'chosen' . These women are still somewhat stuck in a patriarchal mindset, where women's agency feels foreign to them. Perhaps they've been worn down so much, they don't see any other way. 

The message sent out to women is: you have to be glad any man wants to commit to you, because men are playboys. We are taught to scramble for these average or less fuckboys as if they are a prize, and bend over backwards trying to get them to commit OR settle for these overly sensitive low earning man children rejects with no social skills or competent qualities. The thinking is, if you settle for the overweight prematurely balding guys that don't please you in bed and play video games all day , at least he's NOT going to cheat. That is how low some people set the bar for themselves &amp; its sad, because its mainly a matter of confidence but it has such a HUGE impact on the rest of your life. If you refuse to fall at the hurdles, and believe in your boundaries/getting what you want...you will. 

Many women like this forgo any sexual attraction and chemistry just to 'fall in line', but I can bet you a million pounds they are unsatisfied and resentful, and in most cases it leads to a dead bedroom/subsequent tension. These are women   you see shouting down at their selfish, socially inept beta hubbies in the supermarket, because the stingy bastard won't offer to contribute towards the shopping... but he can pay for his video games tho. Settling downwards, does not guarantee happiness, faithfulness or fulfilment. This is how women are tricked to serve subpar men, rather than weeding them out.

And as such when a male friend fancies you, even if superficially, you must submit like a good girl and feel flattered. You are not allowed have standards. I kid you not, some women have gone at me so much about some awkward male friends, its as if they wanted me to give the dude sympathy sex, literally fuck him out of sympathy. *Oh he struggles with women, that must make him nice!* NOT necessarily, women have good intuition. And if you notice, when you friendzone a guy, he's usually getting friendzoned by a lot of other women too. If he's so great, why is that? You don't OWE men sympathy sex on account of them being rejected a lot. Many introverted men can be just as toxic. A lot of these men are lazy social wise, and have no desire to step up and gain competence, instead they rely on garnering sympathy &amp; guilt tripping women out of their league. In fact once you scratch through the surface, you will find most have pretty entitled attitudes to women, and are full of insecure rage. You can't force yourself to be attracted to someone or have chemistry with them in that dept. That's your choice, your agency. 

This is also a particularly potent issue when girls are in their teens trying to impress oneanother and certain girls try to coerce their friend into getting with a guy, and pimp them out to their dudes friend (for the BENEFIT of the men). If you are not careful, you could end up in a very comprising situation being preyed on by a man you have no interest in, usually much older may I add. It is very important, especially if you are a teen, to leave a situation where you feel uncomfortable, especially if there is drink/drugs around..or you are travelling a car. Women who have a problem with your agency are a red flag &amp; not a good quality friend. 

There is nothing wrong with a friend introducing you to a male friend, but you should NOT be being pressured to like, fuck, or date him. Same with an ex, you should NOT be being pressured to keep it going, or get back with him when you know it didn't work out or he is toxic to u behind closed doors or you just don't see potential/feel the same. When one of my ex's cheated as a teen I had numerous mutual girl friends telling me how much he 'adored me' and was heart broken trying to guilt trip me as if I was the bad guy. So fucking what, he cheated and I had a right to leave. You know the nature of this man, your feelings and its your choice what you do about it.

The commenter aggressively declared the woman's problem to be a simple one: She was obviously trying to date men who are **out of her league in appearance.** The purposed solution: **Lower your standards.**

In a way that makes sense. Apps are notoriously two dimensional. Unlike real world dating, it's all about how you look. It's normal to assume that if you are't successful maybe you are aiming too high.

Here's why I have a problem with this advice:

1. We can't know if the woman is only swiping for ""top tier"" men. Nothing in her post indicates this and unless you are literally sitting next to her, you can't know. What looks cute to me might not at all look cute to you.
2. The issue can just as easily lie with the men. The cliché of (below) average men who have impossible physical standards is legendary.
3. The commenter was hateful and aggressive in her delivery. **That's not ok.** We get plenty of hateful comments from misogynists, we don't need that among each other. 
4. Personally, I liked another woman's *much kinder* suggestion for OP to lower her standards in order to practice dating and conversation with men. 
5. Men will *never* tell each other to lower their physical standards (except in the context of dating practice). They understand that you can't force attraction. They also tend to have more self-esteem than women and don't see a problem with aiming above their pay grade. But they will also tell you that if you want more, you got to be willing to be and do more.
6. Last but not least, I didn't like the implication that we have to settle for men we are not attracted to, just because some social construct says that they are within our (completely arbitrary and temporary) league and therefore all we deserve. 

In my life I've seen many....many couples who didn't give a shit about the league concept. But those stories are not mine to tell. Instead

# Here are some famous couples who defied the concept of leagues:

**Huge Jackman** (50) and **Deborra-Lee Furness** (63). Yes, ladies. The Wolverine himself married to an older woman for well over 20 years now.

**Pierce Brosnan** (66) and **Keely Shaye Smith** (56). Former James Bond scandalously married to a ""full-figured"" woman.

**Emmanuel Macron** (41) and **Brigitte Macron** (66). French president married to a much older woman he relentlessly pursued for years.

**Matthew Broderick** (57) and **Sarah Jessica Parker** (54) former ""Sex and the City"" actress also known as ""The Horse"" among hatefully men.

**Clive Owen** (55) and **Sarah-Jane Fenton** (53). They've been together for 25 years now and people are still saying he's out of her league.

**Charles, Prince of Wales** (70) and **Camilla** **Parker** (72). He wasn't allowed to marry her because she was a divorced woman. He married a carefully handpicked beautiful young virgin. The marriage was famously a disaster. After her death he finally married Camilla.

A couple weeks ago, my (20F) boyfriend (20M) and I had a decently rough patch. We had some disagreements and lack of emotional contact, but we tried our best to talk it out and get back on track.

He always ends these arguments with “let’s forget about this and move on.” That was my first red flag, because clearly if we just “moved on” the issue would come back in a new form and we would start back at square one.

A main focus about our arguments have been how I disappear for an hour or two without responding to his messages. Usually it’s because of homework, but he still gets ticked off and he’s mentioned how he wishes we would talk more. It’s understandable to want more communication, and I admit I could pay attention to notifications more, but most of the time I make it clear when I have to do work but he would rather push and ask if I could join him in playing online games instead.

On top of these arguments, I’ve been relatively stressed trying to read his emotions. He makes it clear when he’s not feeling good, but that’s about it. I have no idea why or what to do, and when I ask if he’s okay, he always responds with “I’m fine” while making it painfully obvious that he isn’t.

I don’t think I see him in a love kind of way anymore. To me, we have fun as friends, but when it comes to actually being in the relationship, there are so many bumps and curves that have stressed me more than made me feel happy, and I’ve been considering a break up. Unfortunately, this is my first boyfriend, and would be my first break up. I feel guilty thinking like this because he’s the type to blame himself and himself only, which I don’t want to happen, which is where some of my hesitation is.

I'm a girl with high standards and there are loads of interesting things on here.

So I need a bit of advice. I'm 27 and I have next to zero dating experience. All throughout school, university, several jobs, hobbies, it's just passed me by and I've never met anyone I've been seriously interested in who has also liked me. I have been on a couple of dates through Tinder but they never got past one date. I'm fairly shy but not totally unwilling to make the first move. 

I have been using these apps for about 2 years on and off now and I feel so discouraged. I am picky about my swiping, only swiping on guys I'm genuinely interested in, but even so I get very few matches. Those that I do match with, they very rarely reply to my messages or just stop replying - it always feels like a one way conversation, and it's like I can sense how disinterested they are in me, like I was just one of the 100s of girls they swiped on barely paying attention. It just destroys my motivation trying to even get anywhere with them. 

I'm definitely not the prettiest girl but I dress well, take care of myself, have my own professional job and interests, and I'm well liked by most people I know. I have no issues talking to men irl, I have male friends, it's just when you throw romance into it I fail so badly.

I want a long term relationship with a high quality guy. I'm very independent, so he'd have to be great for me to give this single life up. But I'm so depressed and lonely and I feel like the odd one out with my friends getting married and moving in with long term boyfriends. There's so many guys on the apps, I have choice paralysis. I don't have the energy to date anyone who vaguely interests me because they might be the one. Sometimes I think 'my type of guy' doesn't like using apps, but then I haven't managed to meet one elsewhere in any other way. I need to optimize my methods somehow. 

I've been seeing a therapist and he thinks I need to increase my self-esteem (durr) and have a bit of encouragement/mentorship to push me along and out of my confines. So I guess that's why I'm posting here!

I'm new here but I've been a frequent lurker so I've learned several valuable things to consider from this sub. 

So I've been insanely down on my luck with men but its because my standards have been so low. The last guy I saw wanted to be exclusive but not date, and didn't make this clear until I brought up (for the second time) how I was really starting to like him. He told me he was unstable so I cut him off because I have stability and have dealt with being emotional crutches for men all my life. I just want an equal partner! The last date I went on was an hour late, it was a date in the park in 90 degree weather, and I don't know WHY I waited an entire hour, but he gaslit me the entire time when he got there because he was stuck in traffic. I cut him off immediately because he said I had a ""serious attitude"" for being upset over waiting in the park for an hour with no communication on his part.

I was down on my luck, seriously. This guy I met months prior came back into my life and I made the stupid decision of suggesting we be FWB, just because I felt like I couldn't handle dealing w another guy and his entitlement. Well it turns out this guy is actually really awesome so far:
-He doesn't waste my time ever: He communicates to me if meeting isn't a good time b/c he might be too tired and underperform. If he is busy or has plans he makes it known and doesn't cancel last minute, and because I'm a student and I work, he tries his best to work around my schedule and doesn't make me feel bad when I say ""no"" to him when I have shit going on.
-He is very polite and hasn't said anything with sexist undertones (this is normally where things fall apart with me and men; they think their sexist statements aren't sexist and make me feel like I'm in the wrong for demanding respect)
-I know this may be a low standard, but he doesn't talk over me or try to pick my brain (in a condescending way). He allows me to speak, he listens fully, and asks thought provoking questions about me. 
-Not to mention he is really attractive IMO (I don't think he knows how attractive he is), creative, and we have amazing sensual sex, and he always initiates foreplay and makes sure I cum before he does.
-He also has a nice job and is finishing up school, and has his shit equally together. 

I will say I completely judged him before meeting him because I thought he was going to be a douchebag who fucks around and doesn't know how to treat women w respect. I think I was just expecting the worst because I've been let down so much this year.

One red flag I will point out is that he was showing me this incredible art gallery in our city on his instagram, and received a DM as he was about to close the app that said ""show me ur dick"". just like that. Now I know his instagram is private so it couldn't have been some random person. I genuinely think he is also insecure  about his size and shape, but he works it well so its not a big deal to me, but it just doesn't make sense. I didn't ask because I felt like it wasn't my business. Now I'm kinda feeling like it is my business. He also told me he doesn't mess around with more than one person at a time and we agreed to let one another know in the case that something like that would happen.

To me that red flag speaks volumes, and I honestly am really starting to like him, and I am not in a position to want only a FWB relationship and am realizing that in hindsight. I guess I just would like a second opinion since I don't have friends to talk to about this. I like him, and could very well see this becoming more, but I feel like I screwed it up by suggesting a FWB. 

For a timeline, we met months ago in May, stopped talking because I was seeing a guy, started talking again in August, and have been texting since then.

I guess it'll be awkward since both of us agreed on meeting up next year at a convention. It's been about a good month now since I last contacted him, and I'm still trying to find reason as to why he might've stopped talking to me:

\- He wasn't interested.

\- He was being stalked by a fan, so maybe this is just him being protective. Honestly understandable. 

\- I have a pretty dark sense of humor, and made a anti-furry comment not knowing he was still a furry.

\- He's busy and just not ready for a relationship.

I have been single for about 2 years. My last relationship was toxic - lying, cheating, taking my money, physical and mental abuse, literally ghosted me for a married women in another country... 
I went 14 months without sex, then I had a ONS from a club. Another hook up from tinder, he was lovely and I think we might of worked, but he lives in another town. I started to feel super empowered and thought I was ready for a booty call. I got with a footy player, hot af. Just typical player so that I wouldn’t catch the feels and be the girl who fell when she shouldn’t of. He was nice, but also a bit of a weirdo. Can definitely tell he’s a hot dude who has never had to try (is personality not that bright). 

Anyway I have been sad today because I ended the booty call (only 4 times meet up) without actually thinking - ie there were little things that possibly were hinting at it going further. We really didn’t talk unless it was organising the meet and when we did meet it was late and sex and then some chat. He started to show interest the last time and my commitment issues kicked in. My main problem was me feeling like I was chasing him and unanswered messages - feelings that I felt with my ex. I know that’s normal for booty call and I didn’t expect more, but my past issues cannot deal with these feelings right now. 

But then I wiped my tears and remembered who the fuck I was because I asked a guy out at the gym yesterday! Looking like a drowned fucking rat. 
I go to the gym every morning at 5. Saturday I went later than usual (7:30) and the hottest guy I have ever seen walks in. I was messaging my friends about him because I have struggled to find males attractive since my ex. They were hyping me up to ask him, I chickened out. Sunday comes around, after my booty call boy leaves I go to the gym late again (7:30/8). The hot guy is already there. I figure this is a sign; late both days and he’s there. My friend was hyping me up again. I thought he was leaving the gym so I left, turns out he wasn’t. So I went back in after 5 mins and walked up to him and asked for his number and if he’d like to get coffee sometime. He said yes and put his full name and number in my phone. Turns out the number was wrong. I thought I’d be stitched up. My friends that night convinced me to add him on insta and message him if he accepts the follow because he did put first and last name. Anyway they write the messages because I’m freaking out that I’m full creep right now. He gave me his actual number, one number was wrong. I am thinking of waiting until a bit during the week to ask him for a coffee/ date because I want the fact I’m a weirdo to die down a bit. 

But if this doesn’t work out, and even if the number was wrong, I had the balls to do something I never thought I could do. I cannot even talk to a man drunk in a bar. I cannot even look at a man on the train. And yet I just queened the fuck out of life in a matter of a morning.",14669,I grew some balls and asked a guy at the gym for his number.

I met him on tinder. He expressed to me that he just got out of a 3 month relationship and just wanted to mess around. So essentially I was the rebound, but shortly after we met he said he was interested in getting to “know me.” And I told him that we could be friends. We went through periods of seeing each other basically every weekend or even 3 times a week. Throughout the summer he invited me over to hang out with his friends too at his place before hooking up. He still talks to his ex. He even invited me over one night when he was dog sitting his ex’s dog. Recently I told him that I liked him and his response was that he liked me too but “he needs to focus on his self to get the things he wants.” So I took that as let’s stop talking which really hurt my feelings and we didn’t speak for a couple days which I was totally fine with. Then he called me Saturday night to hang out. And my dumb self went to hang out with him and his friend. He wanted to be cuddly and super touchy feely and I wasn’t too receptive of it. But now I’m confused, he’s working on his self but wants to hang out? That was our first time hanging out without having sex and actually being social so now I’m even more confused.

Thank you so much for all of the tough love and wisdom. It was heartbreaking reading every response, feeling the weight of the truth slowly start to sink in... 

He talked to me in a parking lot for all of 5 minutes. And I explained my position, that downloading an app in an open relationship is not “lying” and that I felt he was wrong in how he was handling it. To everything I said, he called me a liar. I asked him if there was anything after this discussion, to which he said no, that I’ve lied and betrayed him, while pointing in my face. At which point, I said, “you’re wrong, and I’m sorry for that.” Picked up my shit, and left.

I feel overwhelming grief and relief. And overwhelmed facing a huge mountain of recovery ahead... y’all were right, my self-esteem is tanked and my standards are nowhere to be found. I’m a fairly smart, logical, and confident person in literally every area except for men, where apparently I just lose all sense of identity and spine. I’m crushed losing him... because *I* loved him. It’s growing so much clearer that the feeling wasn’t mutual... and I’m devastated.

Things that we enjoy about a relationship which count as stellar examples of ""good treatment""?  So ladies, I'm asking you to please list 3 - 5 (or more) things that your boyfriends, husbands, and exes have done to secure your affections? I'll start with mine: 

&amp;#x200B;

Current Boyfriend: 

1. From date #2:  He wanted to be exclusive and official. Call ourselves BF / GF and update social media to claim each other. He planned nice dates and initially paid for our dates, but is no longer offering to pay after 2 months of dating exclusively. 
   1. I am planning to break up with him next Friday unless he does something significant to reverse this behavior. I have already begun cancelling plans and ghosting, and bracing myself emotionally to re-instate Tinder and meet new men effective 1 hour post-break up, next Friday. I am hoping I can keep him as a ""friend"". Happy to go dutch with ""friends"". 
2. He would plan extravagant trips to the beach and out of state, which were great. He put effort into planning fun things for us to do together, and he paid for these trips and that was amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ex-fiance: This man pursued me without playing games. 

1. From day #1, he asked me to be exclusive, in no uncertain terms, and wanted to spend a lot of time with me. He called me his girlfriend in front of his friends and mine. He'd call and text me first, daily, and would compliment me, call me beautiful, and assimilate me into his life. 
2. He took me on amazing dates, planned nice activities for us to do together, and would pick me up at my place, and pay for everything planned, every time. He'd ask me to sleep over at his place (he was my BF at that point), and we'd cuddle all the time. 
3. He took me on amazing trips out of state at least One weekend a month to visit family &amp; friends and we'd have amazing dates there. Dates he planned and paid for. We'd have at least one vacation each summer, planned and paid for by him, where we did something completely different for a few days and stayed at a hotel. 
4. He'd have flowers and chocolates sent to my office a few times each year, especially on my birthday and valentine's day. He would also pick me up and drop me off at work to help me out, and he'd get me thoughtful gifts and presents just because. He'd frequently take me out to eat at my favorite restaurants, and pay for everything. 
5. He was romantic and warm and easy to talk to. We were best friends and lovers. He'd do very intimate things for me like paint my nails and make dinner. He would help out with house chores like doing the dishes and laundry. He would ALWAYS do the laundry, and I miss this!
6. He was very manly and took charge in the relationship. He had no issues calling and texting first and frequently, and wasn't insecure enough to demand or mind me not calling first. He also took charge in bed and initiated all the time. I would ""initiate"" by presenting myself to him, or walking around the house naked, and he took it from there.

He’s not like the incels or bad guy by any means. In fact he’s very caring and I know he loves me very much. I’m just wondering if anyone has felt they were in a position where they felt like they deserved more? 

He is younger than me and this is his first relationship so I know he’s not experienced with some things. I don’t specifically mean sexually, I just mean a relationship as a whole. So I feel like I’ve been in charge of everything cause I’ve had relationships before. It’s really exhausting. I have asked him to take initiative many times and he’ll say I’ll do better. 

We are in a LDR and I’m visiting him in November. We both live in the US but I’m still spending a good chunk of money bc rental car, hotels, and flight. I told my brother and he was like how come he never comes to see you? I’ve visited him twice and he has never come to see me yet. I gave him the reasons my bf gave me. He doesn’t have the money, he has never traveled alone, he’s still in school, etc. I kinda realized these all seemed like excuses. (I’ve talked to him about this now and he said he’d love to see me but has never planned anything like this so he asked for me help)

The same day he leaves me on read for like 3 hours. We go times without texting if someone has work or goes out but I always ask we tell each other so I’m not sitting at home like did he die? He started a bad habit of going to the gym or taking a nap and not telling me. He doesn’t need my permission, just say hey I’m doing this talk later and I’ll be like k sounds good. 

So he finally texts back and is like oh haha sorry I fell asleep. I’m like ... we literally talked about this the other day? Why can’t you just tell me you’re taking a nap? He says well I thought you’d get mad at me for napping so I took one anyway and didn’t tell you and decided to deal with you being upset later. I was so insulted. I was like that’s how you think of me?? Idgaf if you wanna nap wtf. 

I tell him I’m cancelling my plans to see him bc this is ridiculous! Which might seem mean but I’ve never threatened to cancel any trips before. He thought it was all cause of the nap thing but that kinda was the tipping point. Why am I spending hundreds of dollars and I can’t even be treated how I expect to be? I come up with so many excuses and apologize like haha sorry I’m so nuts sometimes but no I get nuts bc you can’t treat me how I wanna be. I’m doing all this work to make this relationship easier and coming to see you in person and all I do is get left on read. 

I wanna be with him, I really really really do. We have a great connection. Sometimes I feel guilty for nagging him so much cause I know he doesn’t know any better cause of his lack of experience. I just know I deserve way better. Why should I be the one doing all the work? 

This is kinda of a side note. This is kind of how my first 2 serious/long term bfs were too. Now my current bf is kind of the same. So I can’t tell if I’m picking the wrong guys or if I’m the problem and nothing will ever be good enough for me.

TLDR: bf not a bad guy, just lacks experience. I’m exhausting myself being the one running the whole relationship. I feel like nagging him is becoming a mute point.",14372,I feel like I’m doing all the work in my relationship.,0,2019-10-07 17:13:02,,

I've read enough posts from women on those subreddits to think that some men are NEVER monogamous with you. They're being monogamous because they can't find women to cheat with. It takes them months / years to find someone so they'll have a GF or wife while they secretly browse and look for other women.

Of course, my advice is to leave immediately, but sometimes I feel like that's what women should be doing. Like have 1 great dude that you're ""seeing"", and secretly looking for something better, lol. As soon as the ""better"" guy commits, you dump your lesser current BF.

This is going to be long but this is about:

My parents divourced when I was 9. My mother, due to depression, was abusive and brutally kicked me and my siblings (6,5,3) out of our home. We wound out with my father. By then I'd been conditioned by my mother to cook, clean and take care of the kids so as not to get hit or upset my mother. I did the same with my father, who worked late nights. I did it also because I was afraid he would abandon me and my siblings again. So I was left to take care of the kids for YEARS from morning (getting them ready for kinder/school), to putting them to bed, and then spending the night cleaning until late.

This with time was encouraged by my father, and then my siblings who became entitled to my subservity. I developed a co-dependacy mindset, depression, cutting...

However, I want to reinforce that I am strong despite this; I am smart, resourceful, opinionated, and was forced to grow up quickly.

My Dad’s first girlfriend I rejected (when I was 10) and he dumped. I hated that she tried to be like a ""mother"". The second girlfriend, he kept “secret” for AGES pretending she was a family-friend but I was not stupid. I disliked her but was forced to get along with her kids, and take her in. This made me a ""black sheep"" for a long time, and hurt me further. I still maintained a divide between her and my siblings. For some reason, I automatically reject women who approach my siblings and I through my father--probably because of my mother, and my established responsibility to take care of my siblings.

During this with his second girlfriend, he’d spend loads of time either at work or at her place, placing me in a parental role at home. I'd proven by then, that I was capable of managing a household--but at what cost, he'll never know until 9 years later. However, they broke up 2 years ago (when I was 16) on my term. She had insulted my siblings and I. I don't tolerate this. Especially when she was repeatedly toxic, and brought the worst out of my father. I didn't care if my dad would be angry at it--she will never go near my siblings. if my dad pursed a relationship with her, fine, but that will be all.

Since, she has bullied me, but a comment of hers has resonate with me: That I am ""the queen of the house"".

Now at 18, my childhood has caught up with me. I've been crying, cutting, depressed as I reject my co-depdency habits and how they have been re-inforced by my father, and siblings (who've grown used to it, and have been emotionally abusive about it). In rejecting it, I have been very open about my struggle over the years, and yes, very accusing and very blunt (eg. ""I raised them...I did this...I did that..."").

In response, it has often angered my dad who has openly stated that ""I think I'm better than everyone, that I'm always in charge"" for stating opinions, advising him/siblings ect. I've realised I've emasculated him. He has shown sympathy though when I finally showed my cutting scars, and in response he's put pressure for my brothers (M16, M15) to ""step up""-which I saw as ""fair"" at first-I'll get back to it.

My dad has also showed signs of threatening to kick me out, and making me uncomfortable to live at home now that I'm an ""adult"". To the point of my offering to pay rent/or for food because I feel awful living here ""for free"".

I've also realised that I've often forced myself to be quite and ""small"" about thinks I KNOW I'm right about, so as not to over-step him--but COME ON, I'm basically been made a parent now, just without the benefit of the ""title""/and biology. Now, I am extremely respectful to my father, more so than my siblings (remember--emotionally abusive, because unlike me they've been raised to be entitled, and selfish, and ""take, take, take"" because I was always the child that had to be ""perfect"", responsible, ect.)

Now, he’s has another girlfriend with at least 6 kids. At first I was happy for him, but now I’m scared of repeating the past. I don't want to be around her or ""play happy family"". My siblings think the same thing: Happy for him but don't want to be forced into anything. My father, over the past 3ish months has basically moved in with her, coming home to either change his clothes for work, or sleep a little before work--he has even been late with bills, because I think he provides her with money.

And on top of that he has been hostile like always. I thought my stepping down to ""heal"", will allow my siblings to step up to be more responsible--because, you know, older siblings learn the ""important"" skills most of the time. But now I think it's bullshit, the way I see my Dad berating my brother for stupid things like he used to when I was younger. I've realised, it's not my siblings who need to ""step up"" but my DAD. All the time he spends ""dating"" shows he has time to ""parent"".

I must admit too that my dad is good with children. I think he always preferred and loved us better when we were kids. He treats my ""half-siblings"" from his second girlfriend better--but, you know, kids are cute and need to be loved differently than teenagers ect. So I don't hold that against him.

What I do hold against him, is how I've allowed myself to be ""small"" despite, apparently, being a ""Queen"". I still need time to heal and establish food boundaries, and focus on exams for the next month--but I've realised I need to step up again.

You can't teach a dog new tricks, you know. And I want my Dad to be happy. I just don't plan on making him happy by being small anymore. I have always been strong for picking myself up and others on my own-and I am realising this because I've always thought I'm weak, especially this year with all the tears I've shed from having my childhood catch up on me, and realising all the time I've lost being an adult/a parent.

Not only that, because I've been on ""break"" and my Dad is dating, and my brother is fucking young! nobody is raising my siblings well. Their potentials is being wasted away.

They are not as ambitious as I am. I'm a youth leader in my community, I volunteer, had clubs and awards to my name, and have had two jobs thus far. I've noted that my siblings only take on these credentials if I'm pushing it (eg. they are volunteering now because I said so).

I need to raise them again, but this time on my own terms: no feeling guilty, no pleasing my father, but rising them well and still focusing on my dreams/goals.

It's just, I don't want this ""role"" to break me like It has in the past. I don't want my siblings to ""break"" me either with their entitlement and how I just 'give, give, give"" and neglect myself. Last year, I failed getting my grades I want (but still did well) because I was nursing my father back to good health (the break up, our grandmother passing away, and a ""betrayal""), and managing my siblings, a job and then school, and then my mental health which when to abolsute shit--it was...really, really bad, panic attacks and everything.

I just want to do this right, so I need your advise: How can I still continue to balance levelling up/and being a Queen focused her goals while raising my siblings, job ect. I guess it would be easier, to ask this as ""what advise would you give a single mother"" because my dad has chosen his priories (and he thinks making money, putting us through school is all he can and should do).

Thank you to all who read this far, I really just had to get it off my chest! And I am so ready to be ruthless (I'm done with my dad, honestly), and have a strong ""game plan""!

I also know, other subs will tell me to call CPS or ""get out, don't bother"" but I can handle this (especially because my siblings are older now), and because (this may sound bad) but I priories my education and goals above EVERYTHING. Plus, I know this sub will encourage me to take back my power, to get my shit together and upgrade, and that's the advise I want. 

tl;dr: I was grew up raising my siblings like a parent. My father's dating habits further enforced this; this made me very co-dependent, and my attempts to ""heal"" has revealed my habit of being ""small"" to make my father happy is wrong and toxic.

Starting talking to a guy, mid 30s, happy, friendly, attentive (by text), very keen to meet up - or at least keen until it comes to making actual plans and sticking to them. 

We finally had a first date this Monday just gone, he picked me up, paid for lunch, we walked around a park for a while and then he dropped me home, expressed he had a great time and would love to see me again. But getting to that point was so hard! 

It was theee weeks of ‘maybe the weekend, maybe Monday night’, ‘maybe dinner, maybe breakfast’, two late cancellations on the day of a date, trying to get me to come over his house last minute (no) or late at night for a drink (no). 

He wanted to catch up Saturday, then swap to Sunday, then too tired for Sunday... patience waning so I let him sort it out. 

Even when we finally nailed the day (Monday), he couldn’t figure out what time or what do to, up to the point I’m in his car and he’s trying to work out where to go for lunch. 

The date itself was lovely, absolutely gentleman and so easy to talk to and get along with - I had an awesome time - but afterwards the flaky and low effort behaviour has continued unfortunately. 

Trying to get me to see him before he goes to work yesterday, to come down the coast one night where he’s staying for work next week but without saying what night or more information (also definitely a booty call scenario the way he worded it).

I’ve already reinforced several times that if he wants to see me I would really like to set plans in advance - I’m busy with work and general life and this would make me able to set my schedule easily. 

In response he’s now told me he won’t make plans in advance as he ‘needs his freedom’. I need my time valued enough to have plans set up ahead of time as I can’t drop everything - and more importantly I *like* to have things to look ahead to. I’ve expressed this firmly but pleasantly and gotten back a response of ‘ok’. And now I move on!",18852,He won’t set and stick to a plan!,0,2019-10-26 16:30:22,,

I’ve known him for 6 years and we were off and on this whole time but I have talked to him in a year and a half after he did something really shitty to me (not cheating, I am the only woman he was with in maybe 10-15 years). We were more than “on a break” and one night one of his oldest friends came onto me when I was really drunk. We went back to my place and he had the most aggressive sex with me any man has ever given me.  I had to go to a doctor because I was bleeding. The diagnosis was cervical tearing. I am not here to demonize men but I do want to bring awareness to women of their general nature. This was about 3 years ago and I’ve struggled so much with wanting to tell my ex about this and yet wanting to preserve their friendship. The friend told me my ex would lose his shit. Of course he would. I think I need to bury this. What would you do? For starters, my ex loves me as much as he is capable of loving anyone. I have had some of the best times of my life with him. 

Do I just let this sleeping dog lie? His “friend” in my mind has always been intensely jealous of my ex’s success and I felt like the sex was very much revenge/envy sex. This is also why I posted about how men betray each other as they go on how about how bad women are. I wish this had never happened but it really eats away at me and I wonder if I should just keep this a secret and let my ex think this guy is a true friend. I think by letting him know his friend is such a dog, I will lose him from my life forever, the reason that thought bothers me is that he’s been pretty fragile lately. He’s told me he feels like no one would miss him for weeks if he were to die alone in his home. He’s really a messed up guy but is one of the most fun, vibrant people I’ve ever met too. He hurt me so very badly with his actions but he seems to have hit a low point and learned some things and is talking to me again. I ignored him for a year but I started talking to him. 

He’s living with this POS and I’m so conflicted as to what to do. I also wanted to post this for other women to know that this is how some men operate - if they can fuck their friend’s women and get away with it they will. I wish to god I had never done this. A week later he tried it again and I was just so repulsed at the thought. No one has ever known I was physically damaged by him. I think he hates my ex in s way but he uses him. It’s just so awful. I should bury this I think? I don’t want to cause my ex pain, he is already in pain just b/c of how his life turned out, but I hate too that he’s been friends with a guy for most of his life who betrayed him this way.",18648,An ex is talking to me.

And let me tell you, if I had found this sub months ago I would have realized I was making every mistake in the book. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're both 21, he had just come out of a long-term relationship, so I understood his hesitation in not wanting to jump into another one. We're both finishing up college, so we're fairly busy people. The first time we met up was at his house for a hook-up, because I was feeling super horny. The sex was great, and he pushed to keep seeing me. We went on dates, hung out, had great sex, etc for about a month before summer break where I left the state for an internship. I realized that I was starting to catch feelings for this guy, but he was adamant on not being ready (and clearly not over his ex) so I swallowed my feelings and built a wall around them.

 I dated some people during the summer (not using female dating strategy), and so did he. I had a few average experiences, 2 terrible ones, and 1 great one. From the sounds of it, he had mostly bad experiences. We texted every day. He told me he missed me, that I was all he could think about, that he talked about me all the time, etc, etc. His friends teased him for talking about me, and he would often get jealous if I said I was going out with someone else. In retrospect, this is probably the time when I was inadvertently following a lot of the strategies laid out here: keeping my distance, keeping my options open, being emotionally unavailable. And it was working like a charm. He confessed that he had feelings for me too. 

I came back to college. We talked about our situation, he expressed that he still wasn't ready for a relationship. I said that was fine. But my schedule got incredibly packed and the thought of making time for other men when I barely had time for myself was anxiety-inducing, so I didn't bother redownloading any of my apps. We start acting more relationship-y: he picked me up from the airport, helps me move in, says ""I love you"" but only during sex, saying he feels like we're in an open relationship without the label...basically, a lot of shit that only a ""boyfriend"" would do. I start to think that maybe he feels more for me than he's letting on and that he's only forcing himself to date other people because that's what he thinks he's expected to do (he always told me sex with me was better, hanging out with me was better), so I let my guard down and pretty much go full girlfriend mode. I don't mind the thought of him sleeping with other people or going out on random dates because I know that I'm the option he prefers. 

This is where shit went sour. We had a conversation at one point where he expressed how much he missed his ex. The way he talked about her and what happened made me realize that he didn't feel what I thought he felt for me. I was completely shocked and heartbroken, like I'd been dunked in cold water. I told him I need some time to think and set up boundaries again. We have a few discussions and meet-ups over a 2-week period but barely saw each other. I decide I can keep seeing him, but I'll make an effort to see other people, and I ask that he stop treating me like his girlfriend when he doesn't see me that way. 

Things worked for a week, and then shit hit the fan again. I found out he was also dating another girl. Not just hooking up with or going on meaningless dates with, but actually dating. Like the way we were dating. This made me feel sick: to think that he was saying and doing the same things with her that he would do with me. The more I thought about it the less okay with it I was. I'm not okay with being treated like Option #2. I'm not okay with not being a priority in someone's life. 

I explained this to him in our 'break-up' chat and he was understanding. He was sad, but he said he understood, and he apologized for hurting me. He said he was reaching for threads to salvage 'us', but he couldn't think of anything that would truly solve the problem besides getting in a relationship, and he didn't want that. A part of me was/is upset that he didn't fight to keep me, that he didn't try to stop seeing the other girl, that he couldn't even consider a relationship. In a way, that helps give me more closure. If he didn't see it as worth his time to put other things on hold to have me, then I'm sure as hell going to stop putting things on hold to have him.

 I have a date tonight and I'm changing my whole strategy: let HIM pay for everything, WAIT to have sex, let HIM reach out first and ask for dates, and most importantly: STAY IN THE DATING POOL.

I knew some of the components of this prior, but something snapped into focus for me. We were talking about how men seem to resent (even hate) strong women, as if it's an affront to them. They call us unfeminine or try to belittle us if we are strong and intelligent and capable. 

Here's the thing: men have extremely powerful but fragile egos. Their ego tells them they **deserve** the hot supermodel, but their ego is also extremely sensitive to criticism or challenge. So when men are confronted with whip smart, ambitious, career driven, well read women they think ""oh shit. I am lazy, I have no career ambition, I'm a mess and my finances are not in a good place"" so they resent that women because she's succeeding in ""masculine arenas"" where he is floundering. Her corporate job highlights his retail job. Her intelligence highlights his mental laziness. Her activities hobbies highlights his video game and porn addiction. And so on.

So he has three options: 

1. seek out a less quality partner who also doesn't have her shit together, 

2. belittle the strong woman so she seeks his approval, or 

3. become better himself. 

Option 3 is out because that requires effort and effort is hard. Option 2 is the easiest - destabilize her, keep her guessing about the status of the relationship, put her down for trying to make improvements in her life and get her to be complacent. We see this a lot, and FDS is all about not putting up with this fucking BULLSHIT anymore. Or there's Option 1 - date a lower quality partner.

We see a lot of incel or MGTOW guys do this -- seek out a woman who is a mess: financially, mentally, emotionally. She is not working on herself, she is in constant chaos and relies on other people. She's a user, she's irresponsible. She's the prime target for a man who has very little to offer, except maybe a little money or time. 

And that's why so many men complain that women take advantage of them. Because their sense of inadequacy and complacency drives them to women who don't have their lives together, they rescue her out of some White Knight ego-driven complex to save and be a Big Strong Man(TM), and then resent her for it. They grow bitter that they seek out women who don't challenge them, and are shocked when the woman cheats or uses him or does one of many irresponsible behaviors, even though he sought her out for those exact low-quality reasons.

It's unfair to say that all men are ""bad"", and it's equally ridiculous to say that there aren't women out there that take advantage and use men. There are. But in the same way that men seek out dysfunctional women to fuel their egos, we women settle for dysfunctional men because we've been socially conditioned to accept less than what we deserve and we've been taught that our strengths are unfeminine or need to be tempered to not alienate or emasculate weak men.

So what's the solution? Well a lot of men aren't stepping up to the plate to better themselves, but generations of women have positively reinforced this idea that inadequacy, abuse, mistreatment, negging -- all of these things are okay, and that has to stop. Maybe if we take stock of our weaknesses and become even stronger and more attractive, and we stop taking shit, men will slowly improve themselves. They'll go to therapy, they'll seek out higher education and become more empathetic and well-rounded people. Or, maybe not. But that doesn't mean we need to settle. I would rather be single forever with my beautiful, strong friends than be beholden to a man that drags me down and dims my light.

My aunt fell into this trap, proving that men did this back in the '70s, too.

Plus I'd just passed a couple hot guys and remembered this city is full to the brim with hot men, *hehehe.*

Anyway some nerd guy is sat next to me, and my spidey senses were tingling he was *going to try some shit*

He whips his head round and says enthusiastically 'Can I get your opinion on something as a female?'

I go 'sure', cos I'm bored af and got some time to kill waiting for my train. (SEE women aren't mean!!)

He asks me whether he thinks its weird that his friend met this girl from Texas, and has asked her to fly to London and move in with him after meeting her on holiday and speaking to her for via phone for 2months. (LMAO typical moid shit)

I'm like.... 'ummm , *wellllll*' thinking, is this guy for real or just making an excuse to talk lol but anyway I respected this moids creativity/balls, but he sure as hell ain't getting my number still. I continue, cos I can tell I'm going to find this dude amusing.

I go to him 'well I certainly wouldn't be packing up my stuff half way across the country for some guy, even if he was a millionaire, that's a big decision'.........

This guy is looking at me like I'm the most pessimistic person alive, and I'm thinking wow desperate guys are so naive. He says 'Why?? Do you think he's moving a bit too fast? He feels like the girl is saying she will do it but isn't really feeling it deep down' \*facepalm\* erm YEAH no wonder.

Anyway he compliments my loui  bag asking what I do, and I'm thinking mmhmm typical London shit (if they sniff money they suck up to you)

This is when it gets annoying, I now can't get rid of him (my own damn fault) he's chatting my ears off all the way to the station, mixed in with the odd sexual glance \*shiver\*. I have not flirted at all, but you know how it goes if you so much as reply to a male. I'm politely tryna switch off because I'm too tired for this &amp; thinking oh well I'll get rid of him at the station anyway. This dude is the same height as me at 5'2- not a chance a hell.

But it turns out this lil beta dude is balling, he runs his own property business in the Gherkin building in central, so I followed him on Insta, for potential further uses. But he was so gassed, if you saw his instagram, lmao he was definitely one of those overconfident moids (even if you're wealthy, 5'2 is a straight no for most women).

HOWEVER.....it turns out my train is DELAYED, and the dude is still lingering lmao, then he decides to go over to the piano at the station cos he wants me to film him playing happy birthday so he can send it to his brother *\*grrrroan\**

So in the MIDDLE OF A PACKED OUT TRAIN STATION all you can hear is *happy birthday to youuuu* playing on the piano and everybody's looking at him like what the fuck....and then a huge group of rowdy kids walk past joining in singing...and I'm stood there looking like Kim Kardashians mum *'you're doing great sweetie'* thinking ffs I'm too tired FOR THIS I was just tryna kill some time at the cafe I'm about to drop this phone and run.

Finally my train comes and I relaxxxxxxxx. Safe from the moids and fuckboys again.

But yeah that just goes to show guys, don't be *too* friendly to these beta males but if you are make sure you get their contact deets cos they might be useful. Also this behaviour is why guys like this stay losing.

I don't think this is the right approach or mindset for dealing with men, and intercourse should be delayed as long as possible, perhaps even until securing an engagement or longer. That might sound crazy to you now, but it won't when you finish reading this.

Before we get into the main topic, let's talk about modern male sexuality. Men are accustom to an overabundance of sexual stimulation (typically in the form of pornography) and more options for casual sex than ever before in human history. When you factor those in together with the nature of male orgasm, men tend toward expecting and desiring instant gratification. They want to do the bare minimum required to receive sexual gratification as soon as possible. This leaves women in the unfortunate position of being the gatekeepers of sexual activity in a relationship. Because men are sexual opportunists and will rarely turn down sex when offered, it's up to you to set the pace of sexual escalation and determine what happens. I'll get more into this later, but managing this position and using it to secure maximum benefits requires massive self-discipline--however, once you embrace the position and step into your power as gatekeeper, you probably won't want to go back to ""normal"" sexual courting ever again.

The Art of the Tease isn't just about gatekeeping, it's about prioritizing sensual and erotic pleasure over the purely sexual. Sensual pleasure is simply pleasure via your five senses: touch, scent, sight, taste, and touch. The erotic originates from your brain and pertains to your thoughts, your feelings, and your imagination. It's my belief that the brain is the most sexual organ in the human body! Most men are slaves to their hormonal impulses and their genitals when it comes to sex. You want that to shift to their brain and the totality of their body, rather than just what's dangling between their legs. 

A woman who has mastered the Art of the Tease knows how to create and leverage sexual tension so that even the most basic romantic and sexual interactions are imbued with intense pleasure, passion, excitement, and meaning.

So, how might a women accomplish that? Here are some basic principles, tips, and tricks. All of these interrelate with each other so so don't them as a straightforward list of steps; all of these need to be considered and developed to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Escalate physical, romantic, and sexual affection very slowly.
   * As slowly as possible. And take intercourse off the table for a very long time. Sexual tension can't develop if you're getting hot and heavy early on. If you want your first kiss to be electric, wait awhile. Tease and flirt with the possibility but pull away with a girlish laugh and a wicked smile at the last second. Get as close as possible to the line without crossing it until you've made him work for the privilege of kissing you. Men aren't used to being denied or managed in this way, and it will drive him crazy, because other girls give in to sex too early and too often. You want a man to anticipate a kiss or a touch, you want him to start fantasizing about you as soon as you leave. Keep the mystery alive!
* Filter ruthlessly
   * The truth is, not every guy is going to have the patience to be teased, even if it's fun. They're too pornsick, or they're massively selfish, or they're entitled jerks. If you try to tease a guy and he responds with anger, dump him immediately. If he crosses your boundaries, never see him again. Moreover, if he tries to pornographize any aspect of the relationship, stop everything you're doing and walk away. For example, if you're talking to each other in a sexy way, and he says something porny like ""You're my little slut, aren't you?"" you shut it down and leave him immediately. You physically and emotionally disengage at once and say, ""I'm no one's slut"", and ask him to leave (or you leave), then block him. Porn-influenced speech and behavior is a huge red flag. More on that later. But what's nice about this approach is that you have plenty of time to vet a guy and get the measure his character before involving yourself physically.
* Explore a wide range of pleasures together
   * Learn to give and receive pleasure that isn't explicitly sexual. What feels better than sex, or just as good as sex, or close to sex? Do those things together!
* You must be in control 100% of the time, and you have to be the first to end a kiss (or other things)
   * This can be very difficult, because if you're doing everything right and the man you're with is game, it's likely you'll be caught up in a whirlwind of feelings, too. If you give a man an inch, he'll take a mile. When you're making out with a guy and there's passion it's very hard to pull back and tell him you have to go, but the bottom line is, you want to leave a man always craving more. But you want a man to crave you, and letting things go on too long, or letting things happen too often, kills cravings. Always pull back, always make a lighthearted excuse about needing to stop, and always flash your prettiest, most charming smile. Regular meditation and mindfulness practice can go a long way to building self-discipline in general.
* Only engage in romantic and sexual behavior in person
   * In general, a relationship should be deepened in person, not through text, video, or phone calls, with the exception of general pre-screening correspondence before meeting in person for the first time. When it comes to sex and romance, NEVER flirt through texts, NEVER send nudes and videos or accept them from men, NEVER give men sexual material that they can use on their own time. They need to learn that relationships can only grown face-to-face, and that for anything romantic or sexual to happen, they need to spend time with you in person. Keep texts, calls, and other social media correspondence business-like, and use it exclusively for arranging dates.
* Keep it wholesome
   * With the prevalence of pornography use and participation in bdsm, even among women, this might be hard for some of you to wrap your minds around. Porn, bdsm, kinks, and fetishes are all indicators of what I call shame-based sexuality. I won't go into depth about that here (that's for an upcoming post), but you want to avoid shame-based sexuality and behavior, especially if it's being requested by a man. Men who get off to sexualized violence and/or humiliation, even if it's ""asked for"", are to be avoided at all costs. Why would you waste time with a man who can orgasm while hurting a woman? That's a sign of deep-seated misogyny.  Furthermore, men don't actually respect women who participate in shame-based sexual behaviors; they'll always be ""dirty"" in the eyes of men, and all men resent ""dirty"" women, even if these men engage in the exact same behaviors! So, keep it wholesome. So-called vanilla sex gets a bad rap these days but it can be thrilling, wonderful, and exciting.
* One step forward, two steps back
   * When you decide to escalate, never perform the same act the very next time you see them. Maybe pull back the reins and go back to just kissing. Make it clear you're the one in charge and that you call the shots. 
* Learn to say a million things with just one glance, or gesture, or smile, or sound
   * When you get really good at body language, you can heighten sexual tension with just one look. It's thrilling when you can drive a man wild with a gasp only he can hear. If you need to, start practicing in the mirror, and ask some close girlfriends to act as judges and coaches.
* Teach him that making YOU happy will end in good things for him... but only intermittently
   * Don't escalate sexual and romantic behavior ""just because"", wait until he does something particularly nice or generous for you. But don't reward him every time he's exceptionally generous. In psychology, it's been shown that giving intermittent rewards for a desired behavior yields better results than guaranteed rewards. 
* Start building a high-quality lingerie collection
   * Better yet, have *him* build your lingerie collection. Think of it as high-quality gift wrapping for a high-quality woman. When you're courting a man and choosing to take the relationship to the next level, wearing plain ore merely pretty underwear just isn't going to cut it. On your own time, wear whatever you want, but on dates, wear something luxurious.
* Make sure your pleasure comes first, and never fake an orgasm
   * Never give pleasure without first being pleasured. And be 100% truthful about your experience of pleasure; if he's not doing it for you, let him know. You're not here to coddle his ego. Since you've taken it slow, he'll be emotionally invested in you well before you've actually gotten to giving and receiving orgasms, so he'll genuinely want to please you. Be selfish and demand pleasure without reciprocating. For example, if you've gotten to the point where you're giving and receiving oral sex, let him bring you to orgasm and then say you have to leave. Flash a winning smile, give him a kiss on the cheek, and get dressed and out the door. Male orgasms are cheap, so never give him one without getting yours first, but feel free to take without giving.

When you get really good at this, experiencing the tension and build-up is much more fun than the actual sex acts. Most men never experience prolonged sexual tension and it drives them crazy (in a good way if they're decent men), and they'll be hounding you for a date. You want them to think about you constantly, to crave your presence, to wonder what might happen when you see each other next. All of this creates wonderful, dizzying passion. It also tends to engage men's feelings in a deeper way. To them, you become unique and wondrous, or as they say in The Rules, ""a creature unlike any other.""

I've done this with all of my exes and all of them speak glowingly of our time together, all of them consider me the one that got away, the love of their lives. A couple of their wives hate me with a passion, though I've never been inconsiderate or unkind to them. A lot of that feeling is due to maintaining sexual tension over the course of our relationship. It's so much fun. If you've been longing for a passionate relationship, this is a way to get it, assuming you find the right kind of man.",18009,The Art of the Tease: Mastering Sexual Tension,0,2019-10-26 09:54:55,,

We put up with abuse and mistreatment way, way longer than (most) men tend to, especially in the dating world. I think one of the reasons we run into this so often is that we treat men like women. We assume they have empathy, depth of feelings, compassion. We act as if we're communicating with another women, because that's the frame of reference we understand.

But here's the thing: most guys aren't deep, emotionally. They don't have compassion and empathy like we do, and they don't process emotions the same way we do. We engage with men long after we ""want"" to out of a sense of decency, forgetting that that same man would block us or report us on OLD apps if he thought we weren't attractive. 

I'm reminded of this constantly. I'm a relatively unattractive female (though, working on it!) who encouters a lot of with a lot of males in my professional field, and I will spend the entire day smiling, being kind and courteous, helping out and providing support to my coworkers when I can and... nothing. Few of them are courteous back, most ignore me or look away when I try and be polite. I brushed it off at first as ""that's how men communicate"" but after months and years of this trend, it starts to grate on my nerves and I realized: it's a good daily reminder that men are opportunists -- they act in ways that benefit them, and don't feel the need to extend even common courtesy to women they don't want to fuck. 

So ladies, when you see that you're accepting dates with men you're not intersted, entertaining conversations you don't enjoy, or finding yourself negged or manipulated and you're putting up with it out of some sense of politeness, STOP. Almost 0% of men would even respond much less feel obligated to be kind or treat you with any sort humanity if you didn't seek to benefit him in some way (sexually, financially, emotionally, socially). 

Be ruthless. Don't take shit. Don't apologize for your space or your boundaries or your standards. Be ruthless with your time and effort and resources. Find strong female friends to get your emotional needs met. Focus on your hobbies and your health and your legacy.

Also inb4 you pickme bitches say ""but my guy friends don't do that!"" and ""not all men!"" just remember Occam's Razor: The simplest explanation is often the correct one. Yes there are exceptions to the the rule, but operating as if the exception IS the rule is a really good way to keep getting hurt, wasting your time, and putting up with shit that men feel entitled to subject you to after years of existing in a society that allows, or even encourages, this behavior.",17828,Guys are callous opportunists and that requires us to be ruthless,0,2019-10-26 07:23:20,,

Met in a sports group, was always inviting me out every weekend and organising the dates, generally taking the lead and making sure I had a good time. He asked me out and I agreed because he seemed like a nice guy and I enjoyed his company. I wasn't that invested at this point. Timing-wise we had sex two weeks after we became exclusive. Red flag 1 - I told him I wanted to wait a bit because this was my first relationship and I hadn't slept with a man before. I nearly broke up with him because he was pushy, he begged me and said he understood. I rationalised it as miscommunication because we don't speak each other's first languages fluently. He asked again the second week. I said fuck it, this was probably the pace adult relationships moved at and I should just get it over and done with. It wasn't a bad experience, but with hindsight I would have preferred waiting. I was invested at this point. I went on holiday afterwards, came back, we had argument over communicating and he broke up with me saying he didn't see a future with me.

I was scrolling through insta yesterday because he still watches my stories and realised something again - all the western women he follows are either hikers or straight up soft core porn models.

Since I was 19, I would meet men up to 45 yrs old. I would always have fun and interesting things to talk about, I enjoyed their praise for my accomplishments and it also filled the void I had growing up without a father. However, I realized they never fully let me in, except for 1 or 2 rare cases. If they had kids, they were never a huge part of the conversation, and I definitely met a lot who just liked the fact I was young and impressionable.

Well now I’m 24, and I’ve been giving guys my age a chance, and I gotta say I’m disappointed. They (general ofc) are just too caught up on their sexual needs, appearances, have a false sense of being hot shit, aren’t even that good in bed (lack of experience or appreciation for woman’s pleasure), and do not really know what they want or have their lives together. The last 2 points are present throughout all our lives, but they are closer to it when they are older and have lived life. 

Personally, I’ve been taking care of myself since I was 18, anything prestigious I’ve ever done or gotten was a result of hard work or luck. I’ve Gina through a lot of struggle in my short life and because of it I’m always a bit ahead of where people are at my age mentally. This isn’t always good, sometimes I wish I could just be more blissful and ignorant to things. My mom and I are immigrants and i had to learn everything about the world and connections and careers myself, so whenever I meet guys that have been hand held for most of their lives I cannot take them seriously. Or who just think getting me some drinks and showing me a good time is all all they need to do for me to sleep with them. If the sex was mind blowing then maybe as a FWB, but that is never really the case! Don’t get me wrong, I would love to meet a guy my age who was compatible with me, but I have yet to. My interests also align well to older men, the problem is I feel a gap between the men I’m into and younger guys. 

Like i’m in way too much of a different stage in my life to demand a man who has been established for 10+ years but will not feel fulfilled with a typical 25 year old in the states. So my question is, what can I do to start going for people in between? I don’t even know what they look like, I don’t think it’s exclusively about age but characteristics I am failing to look for or recognize. I struggle being attracted to the potential of someone, because I’ve seen it many times it doesn’t mean it will manifest. For ex, my brother, his wife saw potential, she was way overqualified than him in most ways, but after 8 years they opened a business together and are very successful. Like they say, men can be molded, and many times women are their source of inspiration, it’s not to be relied on but it’s overlooked. 

I ask because I met a really cool man this weekend, he’s an ER doctor and we have many things in common. However, several times he said things that he wouldn’t say to me where I 10 years older, and that reminded me of some of the older men I liked but couldn’t see me for more than my age. So what do I do? Do I keep going in dates with guys my age? For the older men, what red flags scream playboy or guys with a young girl fetish? I want to be taken seriously, and I have found that not over sharing has helped a lot already.",17668,"Always into older men, what red flags should I be aware of?",0,2019-10-26 05:30:22,,

He said he'd visit me but he flaked since he got his dream job and was then ""too busy"". We didnt talk for a few weeks (I stopped replying to his slow replies and he didn't message again). Anyways so I was in town again recently and thought I'd message him. We went out and then I suggested we go back to his. Sex is just soooo good lol. I've obviously seen other people dated but no one I got along with or hot enough to even hook up. 

Its so sweet when we do get a chance to hang and he is generous with dates. Like he does cute things and will go out of his way. But its not something serious since LDR and he's not the kind to prioritize romantic relationships anyways.

Men will usually conceal their misogyny in the beginning, but often you can pick up subtle ques in their bio's online to save you some time- these are personally some of my turn offs.

*'I want a down to earth girl'* 

Is it me or is this just redpill men's discreet way of saying they want a pick me who knows her place and acts 'humble' aka doesn't know her worth, and isn't expecting much from him? Basically these sort will expect an attractive girl to act like they don't know they're attractive. Its often code for him not wanting a 'high maintenance' chick, which in men's terms often means, a woman that has standards.

 [**SheRaSeven1**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7YmOvYuw0ubdPEvItrH3oQ) talks about this and how men will often say *'oh baby you don't need that makeup I like you natural etc'* as a way to mate gate women, aka they know if you make an effort with your appearance you will get men swarming over easy no problem &amp; they know they can't stop you from getting that attention when you walk out the door. I think there is a lot of truth to that! Think about it. I meet super stunning well groomed girls all the time, that don't use this to their advantage and feel down on themselves cos of the guy they're with. My advice to women, is *always act like you know it.* Higher value men love confident women, this inflates their esteem (ooo she chose me!!), instead of making them paranoid. Don't be afraid to glance over at a couple of guys looking at you on a date (men do it anyway). You want him to know *you're aware* of the attention in subtle ways, this will activate his 'manly' instincts to chase /protect &amp; make him aware of his competition. 

'*don't want any drama'* 

These type tend to have the 'goldigga fear' imo &amp; it gives me super red flags they've been cheated on, rocky divorce etc so they're going to be paranoid, or over emotional wimps with mommy issues. Could also mean they're a fuckboy and the type to tell you their ex was a 'psycho' on their 2nd date. I'll pass

*'not here for netflix and chill!'*

Yeah, course mate, isn't everybody. Be very wary of these men claiming they're only after something serious in their bio's- this is exactly what women want to hear and so will probably increase his matches by default (he could easily state his intentions in a convo). Does not mean he means it however.

The things I look out for in men's bio's is something original that shows they've thought on their feet to get a girl talking, and I look out for pics of them travelling/in the outdoors doing manly shit. I stay well away from posey men and look for men in suits. No OTT 'cutesy' pics with their pets etc as I can tell they'll be a simp, and I swipe right on any guy that has pics with girls well out of his league as if he's trying to imply this is his 'standard' lmaoo.

Society has lied to you. Society has said to close and intimate with someone you must divulge all of your personal information, your darkest secrets and most embarrassing moments. This is not true. 

IT IS OKAY TO KEEP SOMETHINGS PRIVATE. This strategy is not only to protect yourself in your current relationship, but to protect your reputation (a bad rep can negatively effect any future relationships you have). 

Like many users have said before, letting a man know your high n-count will only end badly for you. No matter how good, trustworthy and genuine you think he is. he will view you negatively. Period. The end. 

The thing is, men’s egos aren’t only attached to their own sexuality but they’re also latched to the sexuality of the woman he’s romantically/sexually involved with. To tell a man you’re had many partners in the past damages his ego. 

THIS IS MY RULE: IF YOU’RE TOO EMBARRASSED TO TELL THE INFORMATION TO YOUR PARENTS, DO NOT TELL IT TO YOUR MAN. 

Would you openly tell your mom or dad that you’ve fucked 25 men and 20 of those men meant absolutely nothing to you? No? Great. Don’t tell your man. 

There is also a 95% chance he runs and tells his friends what you told him to get their input. Then his friends tell their friends. Then you’re know as the slut. That’s how these rumors start. 

You can feel connected with your man without  telling him everything. Don’t be an open book. just show him enough chapters so he’s satisfied.",17565,The Truth About Relationships and Honesty,0,2019-10-26 04:04:05,,

I don’t look like a supermodel by any means and I’m not drop dead gorgeous but I’m fit and blonde so attractive enough for your average male. I had a bit of a bad rep back home because I went through my girls gone wild phase in college so there I understood why guys thought I was just good for sex. I got into a relationship that ultimately didn’t work out but at the beginning he told me it was serious to him so I decided to settle down. I just started dating again and forgot how frustrating it is. Every time a guy does anything for you he expects sex as repayment. Today a guy bought me a cup of coffee which I thought was nice of him but we talked for a while, he invited me to his house which I politely declined, and then before I even pulled out he texted me “why didn’t you hook up with me I took you out and I thought we had a connection”. He doesn’t even have to do anything for you to feel like he deserves it. I get dms all the time on dating apps and other social media along the lines of “you should come over” like I’m gonna drive a half an hour to you, have five minutes of (probably) boring sex, and then you get to orgasm but I don’t? I get that some girls like hook ups and that’s perfectly fine too but I just don’t. It’s boring to me. In my experience the sex is worse and it’s too easy. I like a little challenge to and I, along with almost any girl with a pulse, could get laid almost anytime. Even if you think that’s not true download tinder I guarantee you can find someone within 10 minutes of looking, if that.

Ever since i turned about 11-12 i literally started getting hit on by much older taken (or even married) men. It's always made me uncomfortable, especially when i was younger. On top of everything i didn't have a loving mother who made me understand that it's OK to be naturally ""sexy"" or to have curves. She always made sure to slut-shame me and dressed me in super conservative clothing. ""You're not wearing yoga pants because YOU LOOK LIKE A PROSTITUTE"" and etc.

It really messed me up mentally because my own mother made me feel bad about my body and all the men around me sexualized and objectified me like there was no tomorrow (yes, including family members... my grandfather would discuss how ""big"" my boobs have became at the dinner table around his friends and etc.). Growing up i also got sexually assaulted more times than i can count. I had grown so accustomed to being groped and etc. that at one point i started believing that this was ""normal"", i didn't realize that people touching my boobs/ass/vagina without my consent is NOT okay and i thought that i deserved to be treated like that because my body and face are naturally sexy.

After a while (when i turned about 13-14) i became very severely anorexic. I felt so hopeless and i hated myself so much that i became incredibly self-destructive, suicidal and basically almost starved myself until death so that i could ""erase"" my curves and femininity because i was taught by my ""mother"" that it was a bad thing and because people tried to justify all of the terrible things that i had to endure because my boobs and butt are big for my frame and etc....

Long story short i somehow made it out alive and after i started recovering i immediately started getting all of that excess male attention once again. And unfortunately I've only been attracting taken men or complete fuckboys. Anytime a guy tries to talk to me the conversation either ends with a sentence similar to ""Sooo.. when did you lose your virginity?""/""Do you wanna go to my place?""/""How many guys have you slept with?"" and etc. or said guys are being really nice and sweet to me (without being vulgar) and then i end up finding out that they're actually married/that they have a girlfriend. 

It makes me feel even worse because i guess everyone sees nothing but a ""slut""/""sex toy"" in me although i'm literally a virgin. I don't even wear revealing/""IG baddie"" type of clothing (not that all of this would be justified if i were to dress provocatively). I actually have a very classic, preppy style and when i go clubbing and etc. i wear dresses that don't reveal a lot/anything at all. I don't go to ""cheaper"" neighborhoods/areas either... i get treated a million times worse there.

I've started to completely lose all kinds of hope. I was invited to a birthday party the other day (all of us were the same age) and a really handsome, ""sweet"" guy approached me. He was at the other end of the table (it's a huge table) and he came all the way up to me in order to ask me about my name. I only told him my first name and he said ""you have such a beautiful name!, my name is.... \*insert forename AND surname\*"". He was being extra touchy and put his face super close to mine although the music wasn't even that loud yet (it was the beginning of the night). It was very confusing because it looked like he was trying to hide the fact that he was approaching me... before coming up to me he went up to the guy right next to me and acted like he had to say something to him while looking me in the eyes throughout their whole ""conversation"" and i couldn't understand why. His super closeness made me uncomfortable anyways and i think he sensed it because he quickly got back to his place at the table (once again, these tables are LARGE, you can barely see the ending of it if you're at the other end of it).

Said guy went home really early without saying goodbye and i was confused about why he would explicitly let me know what his full name was AND repeat it so i can hear it well (yes, he did repeat it and i didn't even ask), especially knowing that i only answered to his ""What's your name?"" with my forename and that the party was very casual anyways (no one used their full name when introducing themselves). So searched his name up on IG and followed his account. When he accepted my request and followed me back i saw the 8428742842s of posts on his profile with his GIRLFRIEND. And i also realized that i had seen that girl at the party when i went to the toilet once so on top of everything he was there with her while he was hitting on me.

These situations upset me a lot. 3 days ago another taken guy was sliding in my Instagram DMs talking about what a ""goddess"" i am and etc. Today he uploaded a Snapchat story of him kissing some girl in his bed (his gf i assume). It's ridiculous because since all these guys are taken the only reason why they'd hit on me is because they think they would be able to sleep with me easily, i doubt any of them are seeking some kind of emotional connection knowing that they're taken. And these are not the only 2 guys with whom I've experienced this, it happens all the time but this literally happened in the short span of 2-3 days (i'm exclude the single guys that hit up on me in a very vulgar way these days because they were a lot too, i'm only talking about UNAVAILABLE men who go out of their way to flirt with me and act like ""good guys""). I cannot believe this and it makes me feel like trash. No one wants to take me seriously and i feel ridiculously objectified.",20719,Why do taken guys approach me ALL THE TIME?

I strongly feel they are dishing out some piss poor advice across the board that puts women in danger, particularly on Reddit, and so I wanted to address it in a post. So here it is side by side, so you can see the mind of a self aware strong savvy woman in comparison to that of a weak willed ignorant 'liberal' girl who often finds herself in dangerous/toxic/degrading situations with men.

***'It's not ALL men, there's no reason to be afraid of them' vs 'Assume its all men, take precautions and play it safe'***

Yesterday I got in an argument with a pick me hippy type on a female travel sub about women's safety whilst travelling solo abroad (I have travelled solo quite a few times now). The original OP had booked a mixed sex room, but it ended up being half empty, leaving it to her and some old dirty perverted man that was masturbating when she walked in , which continued despite how inappropriate it was. OP was used to using mixed sex rooms and it *'not being a problem',* but this situation made her realise the realities of being female &amp; that she had just had it lucky up to now (she ended up being moved &amp; reported the guy). I always tell women its better to stay in a private or female only room when travelling in a foreign country on your own - since you are already more vulnerable being a woman in a foreign country you're not used to. If you are staying in a hostel on a budget, you should only be picking a well reviewed one in a safe area- there will still be plenty of common areas &amp; events there where you can meet with guys...but generally a well reviewed Airbnb/hotel is usually the better option (there's a ton of other ways to meet people- bars/public transport/tours etc). I don't recommend mixed sex dorms in budget hostels because naturally they are going to attract homeless men, people on drugs/with criminal records and other nefarious low budget characters that you may never see again, thus there is a higher risk of them being opportunistic in mixed sex dorms (sex assault/theft/harassment) plus you are sleeping next to COMPLETE strangers which leaves you vulnerable at night - just because you are nice doesn't mean they are.  This, according to cool girl liberal logic, is me 'shifting blame' onto these women. ERM no I think i'd call it RISK management, acknowledging that you DO exist in a world littered with sleezy violent criminal men, and you do your best to avoid them &amp; keep yourself safe as possible. Throwing women to the lions is stupid advice, and could put them in serious danger they might not return from. 

***'Don't expect a man to fund you' vs 'Make it expensive to waste your time'***

Pick me logic is wilfully ignorant to the fact that men *deliberately* scam women for sex all the time, but finds great issue with high value (attractive/educated/interesting) women expecting a man to pay for a date they have been asked on. They believe this is allowing the man to think the woman owes/controls her, when in fact its the opposite because the high value woman still has a job and her own money (she is not financially reliant). Back in the real world, the majority of men are going on a date with you, flirting with you, taking you out, saying whatever you want to hear, JUST to get inside a nice warm 'hole' they can brag about, no matter how genuine, low maintenance or forgiving you are. When you consider how much money and time you could waste on dates with false start guys like this, it makes sense for women to be choosy and expect a man to pay on a date, because no matter if he's lying he will soon get bored of paying if he's just after that. It is also symbolic, because if hes happy to pay it signals hes generous, cares for others and demonstrates he can provide (9/10 he will still expect you to fulfil most emotional labour/cleaning/caretaking duties anyway, even if he is broke). If the man is broke &amp; wants easy NSA sex he should be making those intentions clear and seek women who are after the same. The act of men paying has nothing to with a woman's finances, because most men feel entitled to sex from you regardless of whether you pay half or not. Playing equal in a game that is still rigged against women, will just have you out of pocket &amp; make it cheaper for men to play you&amp; other women. Make it expensive to waste your time, so next time he thinks twice about playing a high value woman.

***'Men do it so why can't I?' vs 'Men's behaviour is problematic, why stoop to their level?'***

Just because men creep around cheating on their wives, not honouring their marriages, does not mean women should be helping them by playing the side chick role. Liberal pick me's will claim marriage is a sham (fair point for WOMEN), but that isn't an excuse to project this onto people who think differently and relish in breaking up someones home, which always results in emotional grief for the wife and kids. Sexual empowerment is not about being as sleezy and disgusting as men are, its supposed to be about closing the orgasm gap, challenging the ridiculous expectations that women stay virgins why men mess around, and about improving women's sex lives (demanding more pleasure). Smart girl logic is not inherently against casual sex, but instead advises that you be selective if seeking a FWB situation and make sure it overwhelmingly benefits you and that they are of high quality and very skilled (focused on your pleasure). If he is married and fucking you, it is blatantly clear he isn't trustworthy, doesn't know what he wants in life and is most likely codependent on his wife still (he is comfortable). Most times he will not leave the wife, and he will continue to string along the side piece, because simply that is the level of comfort you have allowed him to indulge in. Encouraging women to mirror men's pornsick rampant negligent behaviour will just result in women as toxic &amp; as untrustworthy as men, increase men's appetite for 'variety' and swell his sense of entitlement with little effort required, with more expense to the side piece because they will be judged more harshly for it than the husband. It will just lead to more abortions, more STI's, more unplanned pregnancies, more love triangle drama &amp; less respect for the woman. As a woman fucking a married/taken man, you are already in a weaker position than him from the minute you find out and continue to indulge him. As pointed out here numerous times, whether you're a 10/10 cool girl pornstar in bed, men still have a huge issue with women that have high N counts &amp; don't see them as investment worthy most times. Bragging about sleeping with 17 men this month, including married men, is not empowering, because *men's attention is cheap to attain*, and men get a pat on the back for this stuff whilst they will shame you for it. Women get hurt when you offer yourself as the sidechick to numerous men and it pumps their already inflated ego's...this behaviour can never be considered 'feminist'..it is just fuelling the problem.",20717,Pick me vs Smart bitch logic,0,2019-10-27 12:32:26,,

I used to be the kind of girl who would get crushes on men and it would turn a bit obsessive. I would fantasize about how good being with them would feel and I did things to make them aware of my existence. I initiated contact, I led our interaction, and I was forward with my seduction. I had a stronger masculine personality back then and I didn't mind taking the lead. I wanted to make them like me. Of course, it didn't work out. It only made the man emotionally unavailable and I think I was attracted to a man's emotional unavailability because I didn't have enough self-worth back then. I just didn't know any better.

Now I see some posts here where basically the OP is asking what moves she should make to catch the attention of her crush. She knows about his existence and admires him, but he doesn't know her. Or... she's friends with her crush and she wants to take it to the next level. I know that pleasure that comes from yearning for someone and the thrill of the unknown. ""Does he or does he not like me? I want him to notice me. I want to make him mine."" It's a drug, chasing after men; it makes you feel more alive. But oh, how our emotions mislead us! Allowing yourself to get carried away will bring nothing but pain.

My advice basically is... do not have a crush on anyone ever. If you ever feel yourself liking a friend, stop feeling that way, because if he's interested in you, he would have asked you out already. If it's a stranger that you like, stop feeling that way, because liking someone who hasn't noticed you is a sure way to put you in pursuit mode and FDS women don't pursue. Sure, you can flirt with your friend or make flirty eye contact with the cute stranger, but stop yourself from feeling intense emotions and infatuation towards them. Only entertain men who pursue you HARD. 

The best course of action is to become your best self and attract men to your life, while at the same time not letting yourself have a silent crush on anyone EVER. You only entertain men who obviously pursue you and you don't yearn for someone who doesn't know your existence or an acquaintance/friend who hasn't asked you out.",20675,"There is ZERO benefit to having a crush.

Although to my défense sometimes I don’t recognise it. Here’s an example: 

It was a tinder date and dude shows up and we go for friend chicken. I don’t have a problem with having fast food on a first date, but he kept saying it’s because he’s broke. Not that I need him to treat me anything or I mentioned anything about it. We later head to a bar and talked more about why we use the app. He’s finding a gf, I just wanted to meet new people, as my university has a 9:1 girl to boy ratio. Anyways, I told him I wasn’t interested in seeing him or anyone really at the point but he kept making advances. Like trying to hug, touch my thigh or kiss me. He ended up forcing my head around and kiss me near my lips and he looked so smug and bragged about at least getting one kiss from me. He also kept suggesting to go the the beach although it was already late at night and more than an hour away although I kept saying no. The list goes on and on.

But at that time I validated his actions by telling myself, he’s a dude and all dudes are like this. Thinking back, I realised how stupid that mindset is and how I should have just stood up and left. This was only one of the instances of bad dates I went on but each time I learn something new and I’m not making the same mistake nowadays. 
I also just prefer to date myself out instead of these meaningless dates. 

Did you girls have any dates like these? And how did you handle the situation? Personally I find it quite hard to just be very direct and tell the dude “no”.",20621,What’s a bad date you went on?,0,2019-10-27 11:32:01,,

By the way, I never ended up sleeping with any of these men, though I continued to date them to see if their actions were consistent with their own facts they revealed about their character. 
&amp;nbsp;

Example 1:
&amp;nbsp;

A few things he told me over months of conversation: 
&amp;nbsp;

- He “used” to want to have sex with a girl from every race.
- He jokingly/ playfully mentioned his history of being “kind of a jerk” and losing interest after sex. 
- He broke up with his girlfriend because they were long distance and he wanted to be with someone he could sleep with.
- He had been with 20-30 women
- He had never had a long term / consistent source of sex (especially from the same woman), and he seemed excited to think this was in his near future
- He’d say things like “no one is going to see us for weeks when we finally have sex” 
- He always assumed that I’d like pain and would bite my lips to the point of swelling
- hed never been with a girl with “pink lips” before (he was Indian).

&amp;nbsp;

As it turns out, he’s incredibly insecure, jealous, manipulative and projects his sexual desires onto you. Mildly to moderately narcissistic. Probably still the most desirable of the 3 I’ll be speaking of today. A lot of him exposing himself and how he treats women was a result of his own attempt at “dread game”.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Example 2:
&amp;nbsp;

- He had slept with over 40 women
- He had never had a relationship longer than a year (early 30s)
- He said he wasn’t attracted to ethnic girls
- When talking about an ex he jokingly told me how she had no will power (not his words) and when ever she’d try and stick up for her self, he’d be like “no you won’t” and she’d eventually comply until one day she just ghosted / blocked him 
- empathized with an old narcissist that was verbally abusive when I worked for him because I said he deserved to be alone for treating people the way he does
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Example 3:
&amp;nbsp;

- he told me he thought it was funny to troll his recently out trans friend about biology ( I’m most gender critical when it comes to trans stuff, but I still thought it’s fucked up to bully/cut ties with someone because their existence personally disgusts you (his words)).
- He never gave me a number, but said he’s had “so many night stands” with women that never wanted to see him again, so he stopped sleeping with them on the first night and they still never wanted to see him again lmao 
- encouraged me to watch Jordan peterson / Kathy Hughes video (which I actually thought JP make good points in the video, but it just shows where his views on women fall)
- when we talked about r/niceguys he had trouble relating to the women’s frustrations and clearly (though not outright) empathized with the nice guys. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

So I want to make it clear that w/o context and tone, it seems so obvious these are red flags, but conversationally, these men heavily downplay what they are saying by making it light hearted and laughing about it. Often, the point of their stories is not even to tell them their character flaws, but to let you know that they have other women that want them (dread). 

&amp;nbsp;

During my time with them, the first two men displayed clear characteristics of narcissism, gaslighting, insecurity/jealousy, desire to control women, sexual obsessions, and potential for emotional and maybe even physical abuse (at least in the 2nd guy).

The 3rd guy wasn’t as bad and mostly just had a bunch of resentment towards women, but still not someone you could be happy dating. 

Oh and they all wanted kids. Like very important to them, but continued to pursue a relationship with me despite my being clear on not wanting kids. A man that does that either does care about a future with you, or they believe they can change you.

If he does Lick pussy! Make sure he licks it properly!!! Yeah! Weed out those loser ass dudes who literally kiss your pussy and expects medals. 

Number 4 
Dump him if he has the Madonna/whore complex. Seriously! If you want a little more than sex and he doesn’t give it to, stop having sex with him altogether. Please don’t think FWBs are a way to relationships. 

Number 5 (most important) 
See to that he respects consent every second! A  lot of things that RPer /shit guys do is to violate her boundaries to “test” her. If u feel a finger up ur ass when you didn’t ask for it! Threaten to call the police if not calling the actual police. Yeah! That shit is actually illegal and can land him at jail if it only wasn’t for our fucked up justice system.

The challenge is simple: make flirty eye contact with 5 men daily. If you do more, that’s awesome, but you still need to do 5 tomorrow. Preferably, you do this with men you actually find attractive and would consider dating, but if you lack the confidence and experience, feel free to do it with men who aren’t as intimidating/attractive, just be sure to transition towards doing it with men who you *do* find attractive. We’re not in the business of making you lower your standards here. 

# The Five Second Flirt Technique

This is from the book, Getting to I Do:

&gt;“My technique is easy. It’s the way you invite him by your own body language to come across the room and ask you out. You don’t do anything more than smile, but if you do this properly, I promise you will have results.  
&gt;  
&gt;The first thing you want to do is to get into his line of sight. When you catch his eye, you must give him the most inviting and receptive look you can manage, for free seconds. Count them. Eye contact, eye contact, eye contact. No quick counts, no matter how nervous you get.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, catching a man’s eye for two or three seconds is quite normal. It’s when you continue to look at him for the fourth and fifth second that you indicate that you’re interested.  
&gt;  
&gt;A second way you attract a manis with your smile! Now you’re being flirtatious. Now he knows that you’re looking at and are interested in him.  
&gt;  
&gt;By now, because you’re flirting with a person you don’t want to be rejected by, you are probably in a panic. But here’s the good part. Even though you’re certain that he’s observing your meltdown, he isn’t, because he is too busy with his own anxiety and fear of rejection. At that moment, his worst nightmare is that he will come over to you and say something stupid, and you will turn away.  
&gt;  
&gt;So if you live through this Five-Second Flirt Technique and you’ve managed to keep your mouth shut, more likely than not this man will walk over to you and start talking. He may say something bright or stupid, suave or naive, but in effect he’ll open the channel of conversation, and now you can begin to respond. 

# Why this challenge?

**Online dating isn’t enough.** You’re not just relying on a dating website for your pool of candidates. Remember: there are plenty of men out there who aren’t on dating apps. You need to take advantage of this untapped market. If you live in a big city, you have plenty of opportunities versus just relying on a dating app, because depending on where you go, you can expose yourself to the type of men that you’re looking for. If you live in a smaller city, you can still go to social events to meet the kind of men you want.

**Subtle Flirting will attract more men into your life.** Before, when I used to go out with friends, I would just have fun with them and would just wait for men to approach me. I wouldn’t even make eye contact with them! In fact, I tried to avoid it so I won’t seem too forward. However, this year, I’ve revamped my approach and I actually have men who I would never think would be interested in me approach me just because I made strong eye contact with them and I smiled. I was a passive agent in the interaction, but now I’m more proactive. Subtle Flirting is what it means to be proactive as a woman, not approaching men. (Note that FDS doesn’t consider coming up to men “Girl Game.” To us, Girl Game in the initial stages involves influencing men to approach you. This means that you need to look approachable to their advances, but not needy for it in anyway.)

**This challenge will integrate Girl Game into your lifestyle.** The more you make this a habit, the easier it will be for you to meet men in person. You’ll gain the confidence to attract men and have good conversation with them. 

# How to Post Your Entries

So post below that you’re doing this challenge. Do the challenge and you can comment on your own post like so:

Day #1  
Target 1: Was feeling pretty anxious about this challenge, but was walking in downtown with lots of people, but why not. Saw a cutie in a suit, probably a finance guy, our eyes met and….  
Conclusion: Overall, I’m still not used to showing men interest, but hopefully I’ll get better soon the more I do it. 

# Make It a Daily Habit

The goal of this challenge to make showing interest in men a habit, so you can much more easily attract men in real life, which widens your options. You no longer have to deal with low quality men on dating apps. Many women these days rely on dating apps and not a lot actually know how to capture a man's interest and get them to approach. Being the type of woman who can do it, then, gives you a distinct advantage, and you're one step closer to finding a high quality man to commit to you. ;)",20439,Advance Your Girl Game: The Five Second Flirt Technique,0,2019-10-27 09:23:40,,

I wanted to make a more dedicated post about it, because I think it’s such an important topic. 

Date multiple men, so you can have more leverage to be able to keep a clear head and a pragmatic perspective of the value that each of those men bring into their dating interactions with you. And use this information to evaluate and decide which man would be the best for you to select for a relationship. 

Now whenever people hear that a woman is dating multiple men, the first thought is to assume that she is sleeping with all of them. And I want to pay particular attention to this point because it is super important for your dating success. 

Do not sleep with the men that you’re casually dating and assessing for potential relationship. I am giving you this advice, not only based on the fact that having sex with them gives them the impression that they do not need to be in a relationship with you in order to have sex with you, but some men use the guise of a potential relationship to get women to sleep with them. They are purposely vague about whether or not they want a relationship with you, often when they know deep down that they have no intention of actually making you their gf. They do this so that you can be fooled into thinking that as long as you’re patient and keep having sex with them, they’ll eventually make you their gf. 

Newsflash ladies: This rarely ever works. 

In fact, I would go as far as saying that it never works. And I’m sorry, but random luck is not enough for you to depend your love life on. 

Date multiple men. Go on multiple dates with them. Flirt with them, tease them in order to show that you are sexually attracted to them and are willing to one day have sex with them, if they act right. Allow them to pay for you if they want to and do things to impress you to show that they’re serious about you. But refrain from having sex with them. I know this goes against the now mainstream advice of having sex with every guy you date in order to keep him, but I’ve found that the opposite is true. 

If you wanted mainstream advice, there are many other subs and forums that would advice you otherwise. You’re free to go there. I’m not pro-casual sex. If you participate in casual sex, I’m not going to judge you. But your lifestyle is not in line with mine and I have found that it just does not work for me or for most women that I know. It also damages a lot of men too, but my focus is going to be more on what concerns and benefits you, ladies. 

My advice is to date them but do not have sex with them until you have concrete evidence of their seriousness towards you. Seriousness as evidenced by the amount of time, money, effort and commitment that they invest in you. Respect your standards. If you find that you’re very horny and can’t stand it, invest in a good vibrator, or while you’re still dating others for a potential relationship, find just one reliable FWB that is more invested in pleasing you than in you pleasing him. That means 90-100% of your sexual encounters should involve you receiving oral. I’ve had sexual encounters where me receiving oral is all that happened, and that should be your main priority. 

People will assume that you’re having sex with all the men you’re dating. What you’re actually doing with these men is none of their business and if people around you don’t believe that you’re not sleeping with them, then their doubts is really none of your concern. 

Can you do all of this and still encounter men that won’t give you the relationship you want? Yes. But you’ll more than likely wean them out most of them and have the ones you want.",20290,Date Multiple Men,0,2019-10-27 08:02:39,,

This is advice for how to get into a relationship with a guy who’s going to treat you like a queen and give you the commitment you want.

Make them wait for sex.  For months.  If you have to, pick one to be your fwb so you won’t be so thirsty, don’t tell any of your dates about him, and find the guy who is willing to date you for literally months with no possibility of sex.  Tell him you want to really get to know each other first before you decide if you want to be more than friends.  On your first date, ask him what he’s looking for, then tell him that you’re looking for something serious and that you want to really get to know someone well before moving further with them.  This is going to get rid of a lot of guys.  That’s what you want.  The guys who you get rid of with this were never really options for you anyway, they were just pretending to be in hopes of getting their dicks wet.  The guy who keeps dating you after this will be one you really connect with conversationally, intellectually, emotionally, etc.  and will actually be into you as a human being and not just a fuck doll.  
So yeah after you weed out all the guys you were never getting anywhere with anyway, the guys who want to keep seeing you are your real options.  Make them wait for months.  Really get to know them.  Don’t put any labels on your relationship other than friends at this point and keep fucking your fwb on the side if you want.  Keep it wholesome with your real prospects- just have fun with them but nothing sexual and honestly I wouldn’t even really kiss them much until you’ve known each other for months and are sure this is the guy you want a relationship and possibly marriage with.  Eventually he will push you for a relationship, at this point you tell him you like him a lot but that you want to make sure you’re on the same page and your goals are- whatever they are.  Marriage, kids, no kids, someone to travel the world with, whatever it is that you specifically are hoping to get out of the relationship.  Then if he’s on the same page with all that, congrats you have a boyfriend.  The only potential downside is if you go through all this and then he turns out to be bad in bed, you have to break up with him and it sucks.  I went through this process with two guys and the first was awful in bed so we broke up but then with the second one everything was great.

The reason for all this is because while sex makes women bond, it actually does the opposite for guys and prevents them from bonding with you or even really seeing you as a human being.  What will make them bond with you is talking to you, you laughing at their jokes, telling them jokes, hugging and cuddling.  You want to do enough of this before you have sex so that’ve built a really strong bond for you already and it can withstand the effects of sex on men, which is mostly just making them want to go fuck other women.

[This article](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-delaying-intimacy-can-benefit-your-relationship/) has some good info about the benefits of waiting for sex and the way that hormones cause women to bond from sex but it has the opposite effect on men.",20289,Make him wait for sex,0,2019-10-27 08:02:37,,

I went on a date with a guy I met online yday...he kinda sprung it on me and I wasn't fully in the mood but I thought fuck it, I haven't met a guy from a dating app in ages so i'll give it a go.

Anyway, so first red flag, I ask him to come to the door of the bar, so I'm not wandering around...he ain't tryna move and says 'I'm at the back' (yes I know I broke the no drinking on first dates rule, a mistake I will return to later LOL)

I eventually find him but I already know this isn't gonna go well.......

So I walk over and he's tall and I find him attractive at least and he has a deep ass voice. We get talking blah blah and he says he's a 'progressive' I'm thinking ok here we go......

He starts telling me hes a feminist (I haven't mentioned my feminist views at all by this point &amp; there is nothing in our past convos that would indicate I am) and says his country is so sexist, and slutshaming women is so hypocritical because men are allowed to sleep around blah blah

I'm thinking ahhh well that's sweet BUT in the back of my mind I'm remembering radical feminists telling me *'never trust a man who says hes feminist'*

He starts showing me all his feminist facebook statuses or whatever as proof to me cos he can tell I'm suspicious, and telling me how he has this female bestfriend he respects so much she is amazing blah blah (I feel like he could just smell I'm a feminist without me even alluding to it)

By this point he's getting a bit touchy saying oh don't mind if I'm touchy thats how we are in my culture let me know if it offends you. We keep chatting but honestly this guy has no sense of humour AT ALL so I'm not really feeling like getting touchy with him, he is making me feel stiff by being such a stiff person. He isn't like being flirty/funny and making me relax enough to do that. It feels like I'm on a date with a creepy professor if you know what I mean. Anytime I make a joke he doesn't get it and gets defensive (he does not read sarcasm). Just droning on about his 'feminism' and trying to get hands on thinking I'm so impressed (other couples were on dates near us and not doing all that anyways). Altho he is quite attractive/manly, I'm just not feeling it at a sexual level, even when I kissed him it felt off.

Anyway so after 2 drinks this motherfucker tries sending me to the bar (YEP THIS IS WHY U DON'T GO ON DRINKING DATES LADIES, IT IS TOO CHEAP FOR THEM!!)...I'm already like oh no he's one of those 'lets be equal' dudes, even tho the game is still heavily rigged against women.

I say I'm not thirsty, and wait for him to get another round. I don't allow myself to get drunk, I'm still pretty with it despite not eating.

He's getting more touchy at this point saying I'm being so stiff and British (nah I'm just not into PDA's on first dates lol bruh I don't even know you that well) and he mentions whether I will actually go to see him in London (he's moving there for a job soon) because 'women often say they will do things like that but don't' (I smell depravity/resentment)

So anyway its getting late and he's tryna convince me to let him go mine because its 'cold'. At this point the 'feminist' mask starts falling off and he's back to his entitled oppressor comforts trying to coerce me into us 'cuddling' at mine....saying he doesn't judge women for that stuff anyway....yeah sure. Anyway I blow him off cos I gotta get up early in the morning and we part ways. He looks VISIBLY disgruntled.

The next day theres a giant essay from him saying he thought I was beautiful and intelligent but I was too cold for him blah blah and how he needs more touching &amp; affection etc because of his 'culture' and basically trying to guilt trip me for not fucking him the first night. He basically said he doesn't want to see me again because of it. I can tell he's tryna bait me into some emotional caretaker response to validate him.

Immediately I'm getting butthurt stalker vibes. I tell him I don't get how he can claim he's a feminist and then get mad because he didn't get what he wanted. He then starts trying to backtrack like ohh no its not that blah blah I really like you are going to see me in London blah blah you not want to see me again? I get  another essay before I block him straight.

Then I get ANOTHER BUTTHURT essay on my dating app (forgot to block him there) calling me a dickhead and sexist and saying its all cos I'm a feminist I'm judging him....WTF BRO!! WE WENT ON ONE DATE!!

THIS IS WHY U DON'T TRUST MEN WHO SAY THEY ARE FEMINISTS! He was clearly using that as a manipulative ploy to make me think he wouldn't judge me if I slept with him straight away. Besides men can never be feminists (only allies) because they are NOT a woman. He clearly didn't have the first clue about feminism, and just expected me to take him home and fuck him even tho I wasn't really feeling it. Why did he feel entitled to come my place anyway? I was not exactly all over him and I was dressed in jeans and a classy blouse.

So yeah, this has kinda put me off online dating again because there's so many depraved dudes that are literal pyschos underneath on there. But besides going to a bar, I think my mistake with this one is I let him spring the date on me fast, we hadn't been talking TOO long and really I should of made an excuse to leave the minute he said he was feminist.

But just a reminder, to never trust dudes that wax lyrical about this stuff because they're probably saying it to coerce you into sex.",20284,ladies stay woke with these 'feminist' men on dates,0,2019-10-27 07:52:42,,

We’ve been together for approximately 3 years. When we first started dating, we would talk about a “five year plan” of dating before engagement and I always told him that either way, after 7 I would just break up with him the day after our 7 year anniversary if there wasn’t a ring on my favor. 

Maybe it’s unfair, but I was like 22 when we started dating and now I’m 25 and definitely ready for more commitment. We’re currently at the tail end of a deployment (he’s navy and been gone since April), and when he gets back he’ll be stationed elsewhere before we move to Austin in the summer.

We talk about buying a house together in Austin and that kind of thing, but I can’t reasonably give this man all the equity that comes with co-owning a home if he can’t commit. 

🤔  I think I’ve got the 6 months of no physical contact on my side, but I don’t want to manipulate him into proposing to me. It just feels like at this point, unless I am extremely forceful about it, he’ll never do it. I love him and I feel like I’m constantly showing him that I’ll care for him - huge care packages and little letters and gifts, taking care of things stateside when he needs them, etc.

Just came across this sub recently and thought this would be a good place to ask for advice, as I really agree with some overall themes I’ve seen here such as setting the right expectations early and allowing the man to chase and win you over.

So I’ve never been in a scenario like this before, would love some input :) I (28F) met him (28M) about a week ago. He was here visiting, lives abroad and his plan is to move to my city eventually (next year or so). We had an incredible date together and have been keeping in touch. I’m certainly not putting all my eggs in this basket since a. he may not ever end up moving here and b. I’m not wanting to enter a relationship having it start as long distance but I definitely would like to keep in touch. We’ve made it clear we are both into each other and would like to stay in contact and he’s talked about coming back here at some point in the next few months too. 

What I’m not sure I’m digging is how the texting has been. We’ve been sending long multi part texts which started at once a day (as opposed to a quick back and forth. More email like) and I was into that but his responses have gotten slower. The last response from him was after two days, I responded the next day and now it’s been 2 days since that and nothing yet. That dynamic feels weird to me and I’m not sure how to handle it or if I am overthinking it. 

Now I know I can’t expect too much as we are not even dating and we don’t even live in the same town, but I don’t want to get myself in a situation where he won’t value me because he sees he can put in less and less and still keep my interest.

According to FDS, I should cut him out if I haven’t heard from him in a day. But not sure if this applies after you have taken down profiles and been intimate.

Sure, we think about it subconsciously, but when’s the last time you stopped what you’re doing and actively made a mental note of this? I believe that this question is so important, and the lack on inquiry about it, is one of the major causes of unnecessary stress and disappointment with regards to our relationships with men. 

At every step of your relationship or marriage, this is a question that you need to be asking yourself. In fact, this question should ideally begin before the relationship even starts. And it’s why I’m a huge advocate for women dating multiple men at the same time. It can be stressful and exhausting, but at the end of the day, it is the only thing that brings on the rewards that you as a woman have been seeking. 

You need to evaluate every guy that you’re dating on these very important qualities: 

- Attractiveness and fitness
- Confidence and ambition
- Sacrifice and generosity
- Goal orientation 
- Kindness and responsibility 

I believe that these 5 things are the ideal traits that every woman should look for in a partner. And men that fall too far off each requirement should be cut off without sex or effort reciprocation. 

A man that does not pay for at least the first few dates and insists you go Dutch, is likely poor quality that does not value you or think its worth it to try and impress you. A man that does not take care of his general appearance and the importance of him being attractive to you, does not care about your preferences. The one that always seems to be in between jobs and talks like he’s still hoping to jump start a rap career at 30, does not have discernible goals and is not someone you should associate with. 

And if he’s a total dick to you, then you need to dig deep into your inner bitch and ruthlessly cut him out of your life. Or worse, if he’s nice to you, but a dick to the waitress/plumber/delivery guy/(insert any service job here), then he’s likely the manipulative, 2-faced kind that will eventually cause you stress down the line. 

Do not let any guy or anyone shame you for dating multiple men at once. Tbh, chances are that so is he and he is likely being hypocritical with regards to judging you for doing precisely what he’s doing. It’s neither his or anyone’s business who and who you’re dating. A lady does not kiss and tell. Tell him that it’s none of his business and that it would benefit you and his’s relationship with each other if he focused solely on the relationship that you two are building together. If he bristles or outs up too much resistance or insecurity about it, communicate good riddance and leave him on read. 

As a woman that knows what value you bring, you need to ensure that the man that is joining you along the ride is on par with you and can keep up. If he’s slacking, he either needs to shape up or fall off.",19753,What value does he bring to the relationship?,0,2019-10-27 02:41:15,,

I'm in my mid-20s, and was listening to my boyfriend's younger cousin talk about her brother and his girlfriend. These are young kids (everyone is under 20) so hearing about their dating lives are interesting. She (let's call her Anne) was saying her brother's girlfriend (Bianca) was too high maintenance because she was expensive to take out, and her brother had to spend lots of money ubering to see her since he didn’t have a car, etc.

To me, I always hear it as “too high maintenance FOR HIM”. Know your worth, and find someone who can act accordingly.

If I dated my boyfriend at Bianca's age, we wouldn’t have the problem of him saying he spends too much money on uber because he had a car to drive since he was 17. He grew up driving Mercedes's because of his family background, which is the type of person who will be able to afford you.

As an only child, I've grown up high maintenance. My parents lavished their time and attention on me, and even though I wasn't given every single thing I wanted, I grew up wealthy so there was never anything I couldn't get - it was just things my parents didn't want to give me because it would spoil me.

As an adult, it's only natural I want this type of lifestyle to continue.

It's not enough to date some random old guy who's made his own money in whatever industry he's been in for the past 30 years. Being high maintenance allows you to find a guy who's still young enough, but with everything an older guy has earned for himself, and more because of his family background. I don't want someone who has spent his life making millions - I want someone who grew up in it, because these people have a very different outlook in life.

I do pity Bianca, because even though her bf and mine are cousins, their family backgrounds are pretty far apart and she's not gonna be driven in a Mercedes by her bf until his parents win the lottery or he earns all that money himself. I was online dating and actively looked for someone like my bf, because I wanted someone who grew up wealthy just like me and could treat me the way I was used to. I lucked out with him, because he grew up even wealthier than me.

I demand degustation dinner dates for my birthday. I want to be driven home after every date - in his parents' Mercedes, not my bf's clunky old Land Rover that's a hobby car. I demand his time and attention on the weekends. I want his best in my life. Don't dumb yourself down to being any guy's Cool Girl when that has zero interest in your own wellbeing.

My ex was in a different SES, where his parents' didn't even own their own home, let alone investment properties. I was given one by my dad at 22, in my name. My boyfriend has one in his name, overseas, in one of the world's most liveable - and expensive - cities. Work on yourself (you can't be high maintenance if you're not dressing well or successful in your own right, in any definition of that word), raise your level, and choose wisely😉",19514,The Case For Being High Maintenance,0,2019-10-27 00:31:57,,

He was super cute and loving, and really good looking, but something just seemed off in a strange, can't quite put my finger on it way. 

There was a whole lot of red flags with this guy. I'll just state some of them.

1) He asked my why I broke up with my boyfriend and I said that it happened due to some core differences. He wouldn't let go and insisted on knowing what differences exactly, which I obviously didn't tell him since it's none of his business. Then, without me even asking, he proceeded to tell me how he broke up with his ex because she always complained about them having too little sex. He told me how sex is not everything and how he loves to just chill, watch movies, cuddle, yadda yadda.

Idk if he is actually a caveman still thinking that women don't enjoy sex or what, but I knew that he was full of shit. Obviously not all women enjoy sex to the same extent, but I am definitely more on the ""I could do this until I faint"" side, so it really didn't work with me at all.

&amp;#x200B;

2) I mentioned that I was stressed and studying, and he said ""I'll come and cuddle you"". I do love cuddling, however, I never showed any signs of being interested cuddling *him.* I took it as a joke and said ""whatever lmaooo"", to which he sends me a picture of him sitting in his care with the caption ""I just need your address"". Idk why this creeped me out so much but I stopped responding to his messages completely.

He texted me three times after that, apologizing if he said anything wrong and asking me to simply respond, which I, being a nice fucking person, do. We start talking again and after two weeks of not showing any red flags, we agree to a date. He would pick me up from uni, take me to a nice restaurant, all that stuff, and it did resonate with my standards and expectations atm, so I was like why not. 

And now my favorite one, red flag number 3.

The evening before we were supposed to meet up it started raining heavily. On my way home from uni he texts me someting in the terms of ""perfect weather for cuddling"", and I respond with ""yeah, if you're cozy at home and not freezing outside"". He hits me with the ""you should've called me, I would've picked you up, blah blah"", piss off honestly, if you wanted to pick me up you would've texted me before I was almost home. Not to mention the fact that I am not giving my address to a random guy from tinder. About an hour later I'm at home studying and he texts me ""man, now I gotta drive to (name of the area I live in). So I'm like ""really? why?"" and he deadass says ""coming to your place"". I take it as a joke cause he cannot be that fucking weird, to which he sends me his location with the question ""Come on, am I nearby?"". 

Ghosted him immediately after that.

Fast forward to yesterday, turns out my sisters boyfriend acutally works with him. His name is first of all not Kara. The whole not having sex story was more made up then the posts on r/AITA, since he is the biggest fuckboy, a new chick every two days - type of guy. And now my favorite part, the mentioned ex girlfriend, whom he broke up with because she complained about not having enough sex, is not an ex at all. She is his current girlfriend who is absolutely clueless about everything, since she has been in a hospital for weeks now after suffering a terrible car crash.

So last night, I was looking for a movie to watch to help me get over my ex (it's now been a week since it happened, so I'm getting there...) and I watched this movie called, ""Ready to Mingle"" on Netflix! All throughout the movie I was thinking, this is totally like FDS, but IRL. I think you ladies will love it. ;) 

Here's the plot:

&gt;After the man she thought she'd marry breaks up with her, Ana joins a class for single women who are in search of a husband.

Here are some golden nuggets from the movie:

So all of you are on a journey to find a man. And what have you done to find him? 

**Student:** Well, I downloaded Tinder and other apps, but no one takes you seriously.   
**Instructor:** Maybe you're the ones who don't take yourselves seriously. How many failed dates have you been on? How many times have you waited for that phone call that never came? We live in hard times. Technology allows us to find a partner with one simply click. And with another, we can get rid of them. Men have more options to choose from nowadays. But so do we. 

Wear solid colors, not prints. Remember that less is more. Memorize this: men only notice looks. They can’t help it. It’s in their DNA. So if you want their attention, you must improve your looks. 

**Student:** Shouldn’t we be with someone who sees beyond appearances?  
**Instructor:** I don’t know. You tell me. How many men have been interested in your big heart? Like it or not, girls, these are the rules of the game. Use them and you’ll be living it up for the rest of your life. 

You must look feminine at all times. Unless you’re not looking for a man, of course.

Men don’t want a wife who looks like a stripper. They want a wife so they can think about a stripper. They’re men. Don’t try to understand their logic. 

You can be whoever you want. 

**Instructor:** Your future husband is out there, and it’s up to you to find him.   
**Student:** There’s nothing for me out there.   
**Instructor:** Maybe you were too busy stalking your ex to find the time to go out.   
**Student:** I’m not stalking him. He blocked me ages ago.

**Instructor:** If you really want to meet someone, you have to leave your comfort zone. Change your routine. No more chaperoned dinners, Netflix nights, or cyber sex. Stop going to Pilates and find a class with more men. Join a gym. Go out! There’s a whole world of possibilities out there.   
**Student:** Isn’t that why we have the internet? So we don’t have to go out.    
**Instructor:** And look how far it got you. I’m not telling you to give up social media. Instead, use every possible resource to maximize your opportunities. 

So basically, what I've learned from the movie is: 

* Do less online dating. Focus on meeting men IRL. My theory lately is that high quality men won't be on dating sites. My type of man is busy working and doesn't want to hook up with women, so odds are, he won't be on dating sites. I have a post coming up on how to flirt with guys IRL + a personal challenge for you ladies to do, so look out for it!
* Stop wearing prints and do wear more solid colors. Always look feminine at all times! 
* I need to get a makeover. This includes getting my hair done (I need to redo my balayage, it has been a while), working out more, and revamping my wardrobe (new clothes, new life!).",19459,"An FDS-Approved Movie on Netflix: ""Ready to Mingle"" (Tips Included!)",0,2019-10-26 23:45:03,,

Smh.    

Recently, things between me and my best friend had taken a turn for the romantic. He initiated it and I went with it quite encouragingly, because he really would be perfect for me imo. However, right in the initial stages, he broke down and said that he realized how much damage he’s carrying from his previous (oh god, disastrous, disastrous!) relationship. He was quite upset and we talked things through, and he apologized profusely. But the sexual tension was already in place, and a few days later, we devolved from a maybe relationship to a sexting situation.     

Now, I take full responsibility for participating equally. Mostly because I’m attracted to him and I do have feelings for him. But from his part, there’s been sexy times and furious backpedaling. And I cannot but help feel as though I’m becoming a sex buddy on call. And, what’s equally painful, I miss my best friend.

Alright let’s get down to it. This sub has grown exponentially in the past few weeks/months and we are so happy that you all joined and we welcome your input/strategy advice, as long as it coincides with the general goal of the sub. 

We’re doing so well, the sub has been picked by multiple RP, MGTOW and incel groups [like here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/dhpr50/femaledatingstrategy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). Apart from the usual weak cope stemming from their bitterness and anger that they use to deceive themselves that our strategies won’t work, one of the things mentioned is that only unattractive women need dating advice and strategies. Let’s take a step back and think about this for a second. Think about your own dating experience. Whether you’re an attractive or an unattractive woman, old or young, experienced or not, what have you noticed about the kind of men you end up having to date when you don’t require much value from the men that come your way? 

Many men will certainly throw themselves at you, but what quality are these men? What efforts do they bring and what value do they offer? What ways can you make sure you get the most and the maximum use of the men that come your way and ensure that you’re always one step ahead with minimal negative effects or damage to you, your physical, mental and emotional health? 

Answers to these questions is what we and this sub offers you. You yourselves know that so many men have such little value and until you project yourself as someone requiring him to have value before you agree to be with him, you’ll always end up with the shorter end of the stick. 

These RP, MGTOW and incel men will and continue to cry hot tears because they know that when women come together and realize their value and have ways to negate men’s manipulative tactics, they stand no chance. The inherent value you have as a female places you at a higher position, but imagine what you can become and what you can get when you’re actually aware of their tactics and you’re armed with strategies to counter them and get the most for yourself? ☺️

Men know this and they’re scared. Appropriately so. Let’s keep it that way. 

Again, y’all are doing awesome. I’m so proud and so grateful to the mods that have been propagating the integrity of this sub and keeping the information relevant and keep us growing everyday. Keep slaying 💯",19401,Do women really need dating strategy advice? 🤔,0,2019-10-26 23:00:18,,

I’m a junior in high school, 17, and I recently met this amazing guy. He’s tall, cute, fit, etc.Over the last month, we’ve really gotten to know each other and he’s like the only friend I’ve met in such a long time. I feel like my life changed after meeting him. I was a loner and had really low confidence when I first met him and now I’m doing much better. I’ve gotten to be friends with some his friends. My life is just much better with him.He’s always there for me and I think he really cares about me. However, I haven’t really gotten him to commit to being in an exclusive relationship. He’s a just go with the flow type of guy and tells me not to worry when I ask him this. He tells me he’s with me literally at the moment and to not think of these things. But it’s literally impossible.

He has so many pretty female friends that he talks to on a constant basis. He could be getting intimate with them and I would have no idea. He’s just a sweet lovable guy. I’m crazy about him. He gives off player vibes honestly but he tells me that he’s not that type of guy. He could be with tons of other girls and I wouldn’t know. It drives me kinda crazy. He tells me he really enjoys our relationship but doesn’t want to be official bf/gf since he’s a senior this year and probably moving out to to college next year. Meanwhile, I’ll still be doing my last year of high school. We’ve gotten really intimate together lately. In the beginning I was trying to hold off since we weren’t official but I just couldn’t help myself. I’ve stayed over at his place overnight and I met his mom. She’s really nice and fucking gorgeous, I have no idea why he’s with me if he can date a girl that’s actually physically attractive.I really just have no idea what to do. He treats me like a friend in front of his friends. No hand holding, hugging, cuddling nada. His friends just think I’m an ugly girl he’s platonic friends with when we’re not.When we’re alone he turns on a switch and is super intimate. He tells me how gorgeous I am and I literally melt. No one has ever shown me that they cared like this guy does

What should I do guys? He’s like my best friend now and I don’t want to lose him. However, I feel like when he goes off to college we’re done and he’ll go off happily to a large school and be with tons of pretty girls. I’m just really confused with our relationship and just want to have commitment at least. He tells me he doesn’t like being intimate in public which might be why we don’t look like a couple to his friends. To his mom, he also introduced me to her as his friend. So I just don’t know if he’s embarrassed of the possibility of us being a couple and just wants to be good fwb. I don’t want to be the girl he’s using for intimacy. I want to be the girl he’s proud of to show off to others and things like that. Help me guys please. I’m just scared of losing him. I’ve opened up to him so much about myself and he accepts me which is something no one has ever done before. Any advice?",19392,Am I getting played?,0,2019-10-26 22:43:51,,

Our ban message simply said ""Underage"" and we got a lot of responses, mostly from people declaring that they are totes adults, namely - middled aged people.

We. Got. So. Many responses from people that are way too old to be posting r/Teenagers that we took a look at their post histories.

We eventually hung out once and just kissed and did some pretty tame petting. He said he was emotionally unavailable. I told him that I was a virgin, but I just wanted experience because I couldn't do a relationship rn (true, because of busy schedule).

He asked me to let him know if I wanted to hang out again. I was unsure of things (especially since he calls himself non-monogamous and broke things off with his long distance ex-gf because she wanted to move to be closer to him wtf), but I was feeling horny one night and texted him to hang out - which was a month after our first hang out. 

He said ""sure, I'll get back to you in a min!"" and then... no response for 2 WEEKS. 

He texts me last Friday and I told him I was sick. He was like ""oh damn"" and then asked if I wanted to learn how to give a blow job. To be fair, I did say I wanted to try oral stuff, but I was taken aback by the question. 

What's horrible is that even though I felt uncomfortable, I played around a bit with him over text and basically said I would do that. 

Now it's been a week and HELL NO I am not giving this guy a blow job. like what was I thinking... He's not reliable and he made my volunteering position hell over the summer. 

So how do I get out of this situation without looking like a loser or somebody who just toyed with him? 

a) ghost him (we kinda still see each other around, so it would be weird)
b) tell him I'm going through a stressful time and just need to focus on school
c) tell him I'm not ready to try any sexual things because my mind is not in the right place

I'm a 23-yo woman, and generally considered quite attractive. (I sometimes model.) Moving to a new city and breaking up with my boyfriend has led me to dating apps — Tinder and Bumble mostly. I've found, as I'm sure many of you have, that on these apps I will ""match"" with virtually any man I swipe-right on. At first I was very selective about by my matches, because I didn't want to waste anyone's time, or lead anyone on. But over the past few months I've found it far more fulfilling to do the following:

\- Purchase the upgrades on Tinder or Bumble for the extra functionality (unlimited swipes, matches don't vanish. etc.) They're well worth the cost.

\- Swipe ANY MAN who I find even slightly attractive.

\- Once we've matched, let him fight for my attention with all of the others. (In the case of Tinder, he texts first. In the case of Bumble, he gets a free ""Hey"" and that's it.)

The downside is I have dozens (or some days literally hundreds) of texts of sift through. But I've gotten very good at eliminating men quickly (Too lazy to punctuate? Fuck off. No clear body pics?

We always check (with love) a fellow queen when she’s entertaining a fuckboy with her replies. We need to do the same with the crying, bitter, fragile manosphere. Or at least the incels for godsake. 

Incels will always be mad no matter what. They can’t even get a low value woman to look their way. The nice ones I have compassion for but it’s not my problem. The ones we repost, well, their opinions mean shit. 

Normie men are mad because their negging, manipulations and marriage to being perpetually low effort will be less likely to work on women if more women uphold FDS values.

High value men (and honestly most men) already knew the name of the game before this sub got popular. True high value men are unbothered because they’ve *been* courting women properly.  Like, it’s legitimately nothing new.

Before Reddit I would sign up to some PUA (pickup artist) email list.  That’s how I learn to date.  Thinking there was something wrong with me , as a guy I naturally try to fix the problem.  A lot of these PUA teach guys how to walk up and talk to women. I’ve always found strong women sexy but many men are intimidated by it. 

PUA preaches using these strategies to find love while getting laid in the process of finding it.  PUA didn’t teach me to lead women on because I’ve been lead on and refuse to do that to anyone.  It did teach me to treat women not like individuals but a generalization.  

As a result I came off with douchebag tendencies mix in with my tendencies to be chivalrous.  I’m sure it was super confusing for anyone  I’ve dated.  Was told things like I needed to become this overly outgoing and expressive guy.   Because women love romance they love communication.  

That’s not a lie but it is a lie if it’s fake romantic gestures and there is such a thing as over communication.   The goal wasn’t to get to know a women but to win her over.   That was a major mistake for me and it has done lots of damage to my relationship. You can’t fully love someone until you take time to get to know them. 

Which leads me to the next thing Respect and respecting boundaries.  Various dating advice i read and learn never spoke about these types of things.  They preach touching a women to gage her comfort,  limiting the number of text and effort I put in order to show her I’m busy and have value.  That I’m a great catch by ignoring her.  Aka people want what they can’t have. 

Let’s talk about “No” because this has been problems for me in the past.  Tho I have manage to purge this by gaining new perspective from her and insight from this Sub. Not only did the last two women I dated were into heavy controlling stuff.  The dating advice I receive told me  a man has to be persistent.  If a women tells you she isn’t interested if you keep trying it can sway her.  Not taking about rape but I’m talking about what is consider harassment. 

Here is my dilemma as a guy.  I was pretending to be someone I’m not. That got me dates however it never got me love. The one thing I wanted.  

What did FDS do for me? It’s only been 2 weeks since I’ve started reading the posts here.   It open up my eyes to the daily struggles a female goes thru.  The problems the women I’m in love with has told me about.  How guys see you as just a hole with a pretty face.  Before this sub I didn’t even know about shit test and power struggles. 

I’m pretty dense at times and thought as a guy you have to prove your worth.  So you pay for dates you show her interest.  This whole I’m entitle to sex just because I got you dinner.  Like it’s shocking to me people think that’s enough. Yet at the same time I know almost every single women on here has exp something like this. 

Let’s get back to the topic of “No” , yesterday I read the Compliance Test post.   How women have been socialize  or thru violent men to give “soft no”.  Then how most men hear “No” and they start to negotiate.  I have done this I was taught this.  I’ve seen this in movies,  I’m not even talking about guys movies but romance movies. 

The Notebook for example and  a lot of romance movies has the guy being persistent and not taking No for an answer.  As a guy who wanted a gf , I saw this and thought that women wanted this.  It’s so romantic it’s so chivalrous but that was ignorant of me. In fact that’s how a person can quickly get a restraining order put on them. 

Then there’s the physical and emotional abuse you may go thru.  To know that you could face verbal and possibly physically harm for rejecting a guy.  That’s scary stuff and it all makes sense why you have to be on your guard.  

The women I’m in love with has dealt with absolutely horrible men.  I’m talking about men I would literally shove in moving traffic horrible.  She’s told me a lot about her past. But then I see what struggles and stories you ladies have been thru.  It helps me truly understand her frustrations and why her heart is so guarded.  She doesn’t even fully trust me as a result.  

Not all men are toxic some have mental health issues but damn there’s sure a lot of them.  I don’t know about the whole alpha and beta stuff but I do know there are strong men and then there weak men.  A strong man isn’t afraid to admit when he is wrong.   He is constantly trying to improve for he does not know everything. He doesn’t look to control a women, he wants a partnership with her.  A relationship is about growth not dragging someone down. 


I’m not a feminist or Pro anything outside of being Pro fairness and not being taken advantage of.   As a man I understand how violent we can be.  If you look at all the crimes happening today it’s generally males.  Rapist are usually men. Mass shootings, serial killers, pedos, kidnappers,  terrorist.  A gay man gets assaulted I’ve never once heard a women did it. 

Women are doing better overall in terms of education and slowly taking over the workforce in higher positions.   Especially with the internet women are rising up and gaining freedom and equality never before seen. 

What am I doing about my relationship?  Seeing things from her perspective,  taking time to understand and listen.  Learning how to communicate,  how to deal with arguments.   Because of her she taught me how to love and what it really means to love. Showing my love by giving her what few men ever have.  Respect, trust, patience and unconditional love.   We aren’t official , she even dates other people and that always breaks my heart.  However she isn’t my property nor have I ever view her as such. It’s up to me to show her I’m worth her risking her heart.   I’ll gladly take on that challenge every day.

For me to have an attractive boyfriend seemed like fantasy. I certainly didn’t think I deserved one anyway...
But I gave tinder a chance. I just turned 18 and never been with a man before. On my Tinder profile I had photos of myself with filters that made my face more beautiful and feminine. 
I felt fake, but I didn’t take Tinder seriously so it didn’t bother me.
On my first date ever, I really tried to look the best. I put on makeup the best way I can, styled my hair and put on the most beautiful clothes I had. Looking in the mirror, I think it was the first time I felt confident about my looks. I was thinking that I am going on my first date with a good looking guy that seems very nice and I “look good”.
Our first date was great, better than I ever expected it to be. 
We met for a second time but this time I wore normal clothes and had makeup on.
On the third date, I had no makeup at all and wore the daily clothes I wear. He didn’t seem like he was disgusted with my looks as I thought he would be. The way he looked at me was the same as he did in the first date. 
And when we became officially a couple, he kept looking at me like I was so gorgeous and good looking until we broke up. He described me as a 8/10...
Looking back on this relationship, im still surprised that I managed to have a man like him as boyfriend. He was at least 7/10 naturally while I was below average...
I think there had been some factors into this.
First, he didn’t have high standards. He said personality matters more.
Secondly, my Tinder pictures were great and I think I looked good on the first date. First impression is so crucial. And he liked my personality of course. Because our first date was so great, he already had a good impression of me. The second date was also great. I’m pretty sure we had already crushed on each other on the third date, which was why he was still attracted to me. I think being in love/crushing makes you think the person is more beautiful than they actually are.
So the key for getting ‘hot guys’ to like you (if you have high standards while youre below average) is to get them to crush on you and trying to look the best as you can until you’re comfortable being around them with no makeup.
At that time, I didn’t even think about all of those things. I just said, whatever happens happens. If he doesn’t like how I look like then fine. That is why i was confident on our dates which he liked.",30965,"How I, below average looking woman, got an above average man",0,2019-10-31 17:21:44,,

I have since grown up and I’m engaged to be married to a wonderful man who treats me like the absolute queen that I am.

Three years ago I matched with this guy George on tinder. We got to chatting and found out we worked in the same hospital. I was a med-surg nurse and he was a pediatric resident so it was unlikely that we would have ever crossed paths naturally because he worked with children and I worked with adults. It was sooo great to meet someone who was handsome, educated, and had a good career.

I played by “The Rules”... I never texted/called first, I never initiated dates, I never paid on said dates, I didn’t talk too much, and I didn’t hang out with him too much so that I could leave him wanting more. It was kind of easy to do because in addition to nursing, I also worked as a bartender on the weekends for extra money, and I hung out with my girlfriends. I was busy. This man wasn’t my whole life. 

An important detail worth mentioning is that we were both from the same country and we had the same values and understood the culture. However, I was a US citizen and George was not. He was in the US on a resident physician visa. 

Anyway, so my family loved George and my father treated him like a son. He would take me out to fancy dinners and clubs and pay for everything. He would take me shopping in NYC and would spoil me with gifts (gifts that I *never* asked for, he would just buy me stuff). But then I got too comfortable and slowly started breaking the rules. He gave me a key to his apartment and on my days off, I would hang out there, clean, cook, and do his laundry and dishes. I felt like it was the least I could do to help because he was working 14hr days and he spoiled me so much. I spent the night there a few times a week. I knew I was breaking the rules, and for a second I thought that I should pull back and stop hanging around too much or else it will bite me in the ass. But then he found out he was chosen for a fellowship in Miami starting in July and he asked me to move there with him. I was ecstatic. Then he asked to take me to our country for Christmas so that I could meet his family. I thought, wow, this is it. This is the man I’m going to marry.

We went and that’s when I realized that George’s father was a really big deal in our country. He was a highly revered military doctor and they lived in a mansion in the nicest neighborhood of the city center. They drove nice cars. His mom was a stay at home wife. We spent a couple nights with his parents, and then we stayed in their second vacation home by ourselves after that. 

But everything changed for the worse while we were there. He was always demanding that we hang out with all his friends, classmates, and cousins, but he never wanted to hang out with my cousins, saying that *he* paid for the trip so we were going to do whatever *he* wanted. I figured we came all this way and we were going to be there for three weeks, we could spare ONE night to have dinner with my cousins so they could meet him. He made me cry multiple times. We fought half the time we were there. I forced him to have dinner with my cousins, and afterwards he told me they were annoying and that he didn’t want to hang out with them again. When we went to stay at a hotel in the mountains, he asked me to pay for it because “he forgot his credit card.” So my dumb ass paid because I didn’t want to be stranded in the cold mountains with no place to go. I should have dumped him when we got back, but I was so blinded by love, I stuck around.

One night, we were talking about previous relationships and I mentioned that I used to date another resident a year prior, but it didn’t work out because he was afraid of commitment and he was a surgeon and always on call and the timing just wasn’t right. Then George said “You used to date another resident? Wow. Are you doctor shopping?” I broke down into tears because he was insinuating that I was a gold-digger. I told him that I met my ex at my bartending job and that he was my customer and that I had no idea he was even a doctor until our first date. It wasn’t like I was fishing for doctors. Even when I matched with George on tinder, I had no idea he was a doctor because he didn’t list that in his bio. I swiped right purely because of looks. I called him an asshole and left. The next day he showed up with expensive jewelry as an apology and admitted that he was an asshole for what he said. So I stayed with him, even though I should have ended it.

Soon after, George told me how stressed out he was because his residency was ending in June and he wasn’t sure how he was going to be able to afford living in Miami. He told me he was having money problems. When I asked him how he was able to afford all the fancy restaurants, clubs, and shopping, he said **his dad gave him an allowance every month.** His dad also paid his rent every month too, and even bought him the Lexus he was driving around. So basically he was broke. Residents don’t make a lot of money. He was making under $40k/year, and he resented me because I was making double that as a nurse, plus an extra $1000 on the weekends I would bartend. He would say degrading things like “I’m a doctor. I should be making more money than you. You’re just a bartender,” basically minimizing all the hard work I do as a nurse, just because my side hustle was bartending. 

At this point, he was also getting on my nerves because he was pressuring me do things that made me uncomfortable sexually. He was always begging me to do anal and sometimes he would try to slip it in “accidentally.” Then when we were working at the hospital on the same days, he would try to get me to fuck him in the on-call resident room on my lunch break, which terrified me because it was just a bunch of twin-sized cots in an open room and the door didn’t lock. Anyone could have walked in and I could have been fired. Sometimes when he was working overnight, he would call me and say “come to the residents room, no one is here right now.” I never did it for fear of being caught, but it was still humiliating. 

Then he started demanding that I pay for everything since I made more money. I was stupid and agreed to it. In addition to all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry I was already doing, I started paying every time we would go out. His friends came from Europe to visit us, so he asked me to leave and stay with my parents during that time so that his friends could sleep in our bedroom and he would sleep on the couch in the living room. I figured, okay, that’s fine. Four people in a one bedroom apartment sharing one bathroom would be really tight. So I was happy to go back to my own room and bathroom at my parents’ house. But then he told me to give my key back to give to his visitors so that they could come and go as they pleased. I reluctantly gave George my key back. 

While his friends were here, we went to NYC so they could do touristy things. George wanted to go to a nightclub, but there was an $80 cover charge to get in. He asked me to pay for it, but I said no. He said “why not? You can afford it.” I said “I know I can, but it’s not my choice to come here. We can go to another club that doesn’t have a cover. It also was not my choice to go to this expensive French restaurant or to stay in a hotel that costs $450/night. That’s on you. You know you’re short on money, so why would you choose to do expensive things?” We fought about that in the middle of the street until his friends offered to pay for his cover charge. I went back to the hotel room without him and cried. I never got the apartment key back, even after his friends went back to Europe. George kept saying “he lost it somewhere in the apartment and couldn’t find it.”Major red flag. 

The whole time my parents were saying to be patient and wait it out, that everything would get better and George wouldn’t be so stressed out when we moved and he was making more money. But I was truly depressed and unhappy. And just as I was going to bring myself to break up with him, George suggested we look for a new apartment in Miami, which lifted my spirits back up again. So we browsed online and George was suggesting all these crazy expensive apartments that are in waterfront high rises in downtown Miami. His favorite one was $4200/month plus extra for parking. I asked him how were we going to afford this? He said “well you can pay for it, can’t you?” I said no, I wouldn’t. If he wanted me to pay, then it would be something that I picked that was less money. I found an amazing fully furnished 2 bed, 2 bath home, close to public transit, it had a private driveway and garage at half the price. But he said he didn’t like it because it didn’t have a pool. I said beggars can’t be choosers. We argued for days about it. Finally we agreed on a studio apartment in a high rise. It was $2400/month and and he would pay for the parking separately.

He said he would go to Miami to tour a few places before signing any contracts. He booked a flight and left without telling me. I was heartbroken because I wanted to go tour them together. The entire time he was gone, he wouldn’t answer my calls or texts. I was 1000 miles away calling realtors in Miami setting up all these appointments for his apartment tours and he flat out ghosted me. He came home two days later than he said he would. 

When I confronted him, he said that he was busy running around with realtors and that he also met his new boss and toured the hospital and didn’t have service. Riiiiiight. A likely story. Then he said “good news though, I found an apartment. But they want first month, last month, and security.” In total, it was $8500. Of course, he didn’t have it. He asked me for it. So I wrote out a check for $8500, but I didn’t give it to him right away.

Y’all... I really do believe in God. Because the day before I was going to give him the check, I found out he had been cheating on me with another nurse and the reason he was dodging my calls while he was in Miami was because he was down there WITH HER touring all the apartments that I had picked out!! Apparently she worked in the newborn nursery overnight, which is how they met and also why I’ve never seen her or heard of her. She was engaged and was cheating on her fiancé with George. And yes, she knew about me, but George lied to her and told her that we had broken up months prior. She even posted a picture on her public Instagram of them together on the beach in Miami saying “I can’t wait to get an apartment with you!!” I confronted her and wrote to her telling her everything, but she left me on read. She didn’t care. 

It all came crashing down and everything finally started making sense. It wasn’t that he didn’t have money... he just couldn’t afford having two girlfriends because his daddy’s allowance wasn’t enough to cover everything. He had been cheating on me for several months. I guess he realized that he wasn’t going to milk me for my money and he found this home-wrecker, who I assume makes about the same money as me since we were both nurses in the same hospital. It wouldn’t surprise me if she was the one who paid the $8500 deposit for the new apartment. My dad was more upset and disgusted than I was. He thought that maybe George was looking for a green card. 

Fast forward a couple months.. I found out that George and the other girl got married. Which confirmed my father’s suspicions because George’s visa was going to expire and he wouldn’t be able to get another J-visa. Even though he was starting a fellowship, he couldn’t get another visa because the fellowship had to be in “an area of need” and Miami is not considered an area of need. So he married this girl right before his visa was due to expire.

So what did I learn from all of this?
1. Never pay FOR ANYTHING. If a guy plans something, he should be the one who pays. If he wants to go to expensive restaurants, clubs, and shows, he pays, not you.
2. Never move in with a man, or uproot your life for a man unless there is a formal commitment (engagement ring).
3. Never tolerate any insults or degrading comments from a man. 
4. Never feel bad that you make more money than your man. As the wise Miranda Hobbes once said, “I want to enjoy my success, not apologize for it.”
5. Never tolerate a man who leaves without telling you and ghosts you. 
6. Never date a man who expects you to do things that make you uncomfortable.",30957,That time a man made a clown out of me: lessons to learn from my personal experience,0,2019-10-31 16:59:39,,

I'm telling you this because I've heard countless stories of women whose men are fully providing for them who end up being totally financially dependent on them. Then when these men start treating them badly and losing respect for them these women have no where to go because they have no savings, no family or friend support and no professional value in the market.

Learn the difference between a man providing for you but being supportive of you having your goals and your own financial independence and financial abuse which yes, is a thing and usually a part or a predecessor to other types of abuse.

More recently I got to know that a girl I know who I thought was living the life with her millionaire boyfriend is actually living a nightmare and can't get out. Her boyfriend (fiance now but not really taking any steps to actually marrying her) made her stop working and fully provided for her but has made her life a living hell. Is abusive, as isolated her from everyone and won't let her get a job without screaming and shutting her down. He belittles her and is downright disgusting and disrespectful towards her. 

His latest was to open a cafe and having her work there to shut her up about him not letting her work... but the best is that he didn't even give her a contract and simply lets her use HIS card for what she wants as payment. Not an actually salary, not paying taxes, not having her own without him controlling her expenses. And the saddest part is that he says the cafe belongs to both of them and that she's the boss there but her name is nowhere in the business nor in anything like house or even the cars he gives her. A full mess and she won't leave because she says ""I won't leave with nothing, I must get something"". Sis, you own nothing at this point, no savings, no nothing, do you think you're really getting something when you leave if nothing is even in your name?

Don't take bums who want to live off you but also don't take men who want to provide for you in a way that they end up having total financial power over you preventing you of getting out if you want.

This is from the blue pill. Apparently RPW made a post about us lmao.

There have also been multiple posts about us on MGTOW, posts about us on in##l tears (which usually makes fun of Inkwells). someone made a sub specifically to shit on us and promoted it on MGTOW, but it got backlash lmao.

IT (inkwell tears) called us transphobes and for some reason thinks we’re all fem cells.

I love going to museums and concerts. Him not so much. So I stopped going to make him comfortable. I don’t like sports games. He dragged me to three baseball games. I looked like boo boo the fool accommodating him when he didn’t me.

I feel like this sub really lacks into this issue or maybe I'm just misinformed. In that case please correct me.

First, I'm certain that a solid 90% of all women are perfect relationship material, while very few men reach up to the same level.

That means that right out of the gate we outnumber high value men by a huge margin.

And these men know it. We might call them idiots but they know very well that being at the top means they can afford to be just as choosy as us.

I truly want to apply FDS advice but nothing works against high value men :(

Make them wait? That's cool, the new intern is already INVITING HERSELF to go listen to some fucking band with him on the weekend. And people in the office call her progressive! Wtf is wrong with society?

Expect them to pay for dates? That's cool, Gloria from accounting is a feminist and totally ok with splitting bills. (This is a real example by the way, fuck you Gloria)

I honestly feel powerless against women that want the very same guys and just go for them, FDS be damned.

""Woke women"" are playing a race to the bottom for men's attention and I feel like I have no choice but join them or else be left with average moids.",30570,I feel like this sub is missing the fact that high value men have lots of options,0,2019-10-31 00:58:49,,

It's like movies with humans have the hero and girl trying to get with each other. They even include animals assuming human characteristics of that man-woman nonsense. I saw Spiderman far from home in theaters. Be careful of what gets brainwashed into your subconscious from this. Watch out for hole guys. The romance angle (romance(tm) is too much a term for this) is handled charmingly/cutesy but all of this is like aw man here we go with this stuff. I know this movie is showing guidance to males how to deal with females. All imagination shown in this movie, creativity is the male ability, while females are replication of humans (aka babies) so both goals are contrasts with each other and know if you stick it in their hole your creativity goes swoosh disintegrates, you fall inline with patriarchy which is uncompromising. Replication is them celebrating the debauchery of humankind while creativity is trying to get closer to God (creating imaginative things.) Any contact with female is the road to babies guys. Even the cutesy way Peter MJ dalliance is portrayed. I cant provide all the know-how on the matter, what I can state here that someone else hasn't figured throughout the thousands of yrs of human knowledge.

This is a follow up post regarding the ""professional feedback"" I have since received from his ""therapist"", and how clearly it correlates with what I read in *Why Does He Do That? by Lundy Bancroft.* 

Around 18 months ago I had a few counseling sessions with this spiritual life coach (recommended to me by a friend) to help me with my life and career direction, which turned into sessions mostly about how to **cOmMuNiCatE** with my abusive husband. After begging him to go to anger management therapy (and even sending him a list of therapists in the local area to choose from), he eventually agreed instead to see this life coach (who falsely advertises herself as a counsellor), as he didn't believe he had an anger management problem. I didn't think it was right for him, but I figured it was better than nothing. 

*18 months later, I couldn't have been more wrong.* 

He did a series of sessions with her, that helped temporarily while he was doing the meditations and stuff she gave him. He was good for about a month or so after the sessions finished. 

Fast-forward a year down the track and his behaviour had escalated to the point where I was forced to go to the police and flee our home. He's obeyed the IVO so I had no contact with him until I heard from his lawyer with a lengthy letter written about in my previous post. Amongst a comprehensive list of all the things he's been doing to try to impress me, it stated that he's been seeing this counsellor ever since I left. They said I could call her to check up on his progress, and I told them she can contact me if she wants to give feedback or address any of MY needs. So instead of her picking up the phone, I get this three page long report from her... and the problem is the contents:

The report goes on to detail how wonderful and diligent my ex-husband is, how his commitment to change is beyond anything she's ever seen in a client - to the point where he has miraculously ""transformed"" a lifetime of abuse, narcassism and misogyny in a matter of months! In fact, he was so *""traumatised""* by *my* leaving *him* that he's become a completely new person! He's actually ""eradicated"" his destructive behaviour completely! She is so CONVINCED of the miracle she has achieved in a few months of coaching him that **she actually recommends I have personal contact with him, and ""be in his presence"" in order to verify the transformation.** The insane irony of which is that *she's never actually met him in person*, only over video call.

What she doesn't realise of course, is that I've read Lundy Bancroft's book (which warns against this exact scenario!), and I've been spending the last 6 months in therapy building myself up with a psychologist who actually works with abusive men (under very strict conditions I might add, which my ex-husband would not meet), joined FDS, and most importantly educated myself on abuse and narcissism to be mentally prepared for anything he throws at me.  

And with a clear mind and new found self-respect, I can see just how unprofessional and outright *dangerous* her advice and assessment of this man is. For full disclosure, she has not:

1. Contacted me to hear my side of the story or verify his.
2. Checked in on me or done any safety planning.

The only contact I've had with her was immediately after I left, in the middle of a pandemic, and desperately needed to see someone urgently to discuss what to do. I was too upset to even go into any detail, and in the end I ignored her fOLLoW yOuR HeArT rubbish ""advice"" and went with my gut.

&amp;#x200B;

So ladies, the moral of the story is this: You cannot trust so called ""professionals"" to actually be professional, or even remotely objective, when it comes to dealing with or treating an abuser, especially a narcissistic one. Focus on yourself, build yourself up and create a wall of support and love between you and your abuser. **Trust no-one on his side.** You have no idea what he's telling them!",101570,Abusive Men and Their (Often Female) Allies,0,,,

I want to share this as a warning. For those reading the sub, in long term, dead end relationships... I want you to ask yourself if you can picture your partner as part of this dialogue..

Me- What would be the benefits if you did change? 
LVM- She wouldn’t leave me.
Me- Can you think of anything else?
LVM- That’s it.
Me- What if she didn’t leave you? What if you got to stay the same, and there was no threat of her leaving, but she was miserable. You know she’s miserable now, that’s not news. Would you be motivated to change, so your partner wasn’t miserable? So she could be happy? Or is it okay for her to stay miserable forever?
LVM- I mean, that’s kind of on her. That’s her choice.
Me- As in, it’s her choice and her responsibility if she decides to stay in this relationship? Her misery is on her?
LVM- Yeah, I guess..
Me- So her options are... Leave me, or be miserable. 
LVM- I guess it sounds bad when it’s put like that.
Me- That’s not really much of a choice. 
LVM- Yeah, it isnt.

—-
I think as women we project our natural empathy onto men. And I think we do ourselves a disservice and scam ourselves when we do.

This conversation floored me, and in all honesty, this particular LVM isn’t outstanding, in any way. He’s not a sociopath, he would barely fit any diagnostic criteria for narcissism- this is just your garden variety LVM. 

But to hear so plainly that men are not motivated by their partner’s wellbeing (or lack thereof), still kind of hit me hard. If any of my exes had said this, at any point in our relationships, I would have walked. But they are rarely so honest with the woman that they are with, this example being no exception.

Please don’t waste your lives hoping that you’ll tug at a heart string hard enough for him to hear you. It doesn’t matter if it’s been 5 years, 10 years, 20 years.

More often than not, the woman looks like nothing like you and you will ALWAYS obsess over it and feel like shit about it. And even if you do fit that, it is still unsettling to be in a relationship with someone who objectifies women that way.

Storytime: on my LDR (more like virtual relationship since we never met up), the dude was obsessed with redheaded women. And when I mean obsessed, I mean he spent his entire adolescence liking Twitter pictures of redheads; followed accounts dedicated to redheads; created an Instagram purely to follow redheads; had over 100 tweets about it; if he saw a redhead on the street he'd post about it like a maniac, etc. This dude didn't have a cold chance in hell of hooking up with them, and had never hooked up with anyone anyway, but he'd still judge women on their looks and if they didn't fit his standards. He had the audacity to save a girl's number as ""0/10"". 

Right after we started texting he started telling me the chatacteristics he likes in women: red hair, light eyes, wears glasses, has bangs. And then he said ""every girl I dated before you had one or more of those things. And if you have any of it thanks for fitting my standard. If not idc and still love you"" HE HAD NEVER DATED ANYONE BEFORE ME. He texted one girl at best who eventually dyed her hair. Then he would obsess over his redhead crushes and tell me whenever he saw a girl with red hair and make me feel like shit. I started hurting myself because I couldn't stand the emotional turmoil of feeling like I'd never be good enough, and I would torture myself picturing how he would feel whenever he saw a girl with red hair. He spent months convincing me he was over it, he realized it was ridiculous to be obsessed with a hair color, that he no longer found it ""the most beautiful"" etc. And I mean MONTHS. 

We broke up and the dude went back to follow redheads LOL

The great thing is, my perception was so skewed when I was dating but now that I don't give a shit I realized how much I prefer blonde and brown hair over red hair and how most men like blondes anyway. Back then I thought I'd never be as beautiful as a redhead???

Anyway, obviously more red flags than a chines parade, but if a guy does any of this, even in small doses, DROP HIM. You will be miserable until you do.

FDS is often accused of misrepresenting men and MiSAnDrIst. Of course, that’s all bullshit. And the funniest thing is, low value men, the men we seek to avoid, often confirm that we are right to want to avoid them. Here are just a few confirmations I’ve had from LVM; 

1. FDS preaches that men feel entitled to women. If you look at all the backlash FDS gets, you can see that’s it’s dripping with entitlement. Low value men feel entitled to women’s time, attention and love which is why they react so badly when they don’t get it, or when they realise that it’s not easily available. I know our detractors like to call us fat, ugly, old, entitled,
bitter hags that nobody would want to date. But if they wouldn’t want to date us and think we’re the bottom of the barrel, why do they care what we think? Why do they make posts and videos crying about our content? It’s because they want us, but they don’t like the fact that we don’t want them. They want all women to be available to them, so when they come across a sub-group of women that want nothing to do with them that challenges their beliefs that they’re entitled to all women. 

2. Low value men don’t want or value pickmes. I’ve had numerous men who I would deem low value describe their ideal woman as being what FDS would deem a HVW. Audacious really, considering how low value they are, but it proves our point that being a PickMe does not win you a man’s respect. These men still slept with Pickmes, but only because they were available. Once they got what they wanted from them, they either discarded them or added them to their harem.

3. Men hate it when you don’t need them. I remember when I went to visit my ex in his country. I met up with another male friend beforehand who was also from that country, and I asked him for directions to my ex’s house because my map was confusing me. When my ex found out, his response was “if you needed help, you should have asked me.” Men hate feeling useless, which is also why this sub gets so much backlash. We are a community of women that are rejecting the idea that a woman needs a man to survive. A woman is much harder to control if she’s independent. 

These are just a few of the ways I’ve seen LVM confirm what FDS says. I’m sure there are hundreds more. The point is, stay the course. FDS works so well, because it acknowledges the true nature of men. Men lie very easily, and there is often a gap between what they say anonymously on the internet and what they actually do. Don’t be put off by the anger this sub generates. Because deep down, even our biggest detractors know that we are right.",101540,The low value men in my life have confirmed that everything FDS says is true,0,,,

Let me preface this by saying I'm from France which is.. no picnic. Strong feminist movements are part of our history but there is a LOT of sexism. Street harassment has been a problem in my life (and most French women's) for twenty years and it's a topic that gets discussed a lot in the French reddit. My mother is American so while I had never lived here I'm not completely clueless on cultural differences and I had spent quite some time in the US and around American people.
After a recent breakup with a man who asked me to commit to him, seemed very serious and then just dumped me out of the blue and told me not to contact him again, I realized that my experience with men until the US just doesn't compare. I've lived in several different countries/capital cities so I've also had relationships with many different nationalities, again.. just no comparison to how awful the American men treated me. And the craziest thing is, so many of the women I meet here are so put together, smart, giving, gorgeous. It's like men and women are raised by different people.


I'll summarize a few things:


* Back home **""Dating""** how it is here, is not a thing: if you kiss or are intimate with someone, it is mostly assumed you are now boyfriend and girlfriend (unless discussed that it's a hookup or something). Why would I be intimate with someone otherwise? Or why is it not the default assumption? The expectation here to just sleep with guys on the first date, having guys try to put the moves on me when we met an hour ago, has been wild. Especially in my thirties; I'm not a student out partying and experimenting anymore. And it seems it's created this culture of men after endless sexual gratification but with little experience of what a relationship entails. This whole ""ok maybe we can be exclusive"" six months in is nuts. And from what I'm hearing it seems when you do have casual sex, these men just treat you horribly and it's borderline clinical. Of the odd hook-up I might have had back in my student days, the guy was sweet, respectful and didn't then ignore my texts. I was treated like a human.

* **Men won't befriend women:** I don't know where all these weird notions of entitlement come from that then create concepts like ""the Friendzone"" leading men to think it's emasculating to be friends with any mildly attractive woman, but they're deeply unhealthy. I'm about to start dating someone I've known for over two years. We progressively built our friendship and realized we both liked each other. The time I've known him, and having seen him help women have visibility in science amongst many things has helped me to see that he is probably HV. Most of the people I've been in relationships started out as friends, how can you possibly know someone's character from meeting them on OLD, texting a bit and then be expected to decide if you want to date them after meeting for an hour? I've had men throw tantrums because I didn't want to immediately go on a date with them and offered friendship. The terrible consequence is that all this directly stifles women's social progress since they're largely excluded from social circles with men who are often in higher positions professionally. Many of my job opportunities back home came from male friends, I wasn't expected to sleep with them to gain access to the normal networking people do. And in fact many of my opportunities here have come from.. my European or foreign friends. And they're chuffed we got to work together and that I provided my skills to their or their friends' project.

* **Low-effort everything:** I have not had a single man here offer an exciting first date or anything of the likes. As you all point out, it's become bare minimum park or ""field"" dates. I was on a date yesterday, I had suggested the restaurant, he suggested we move somewhere nicer and then said he actually had no idea of where to go even though he lived in the area and hadn't thought it through. I have a great career, family and friends, why would I spend time with someone I barely know and have it be completely boring? Even if you don't have those things, netflix, books and hobbies are better than that. Because of this weird transactional nature I discuss below, there seems to be no impetus to even try to woo the person. I have organized surprise birthday parties for boyfriends, had them organize awesome moments, gifts etc. There seems to be no value in making someone happy. No value in the act of dating.

* Then there's **the relationships:** I made a list of all the nice things my boyfriends back home have done for me over the years and I realized that even the worst of them had done better than any guy I've been with here. And I never had to ask, they just did them because we were in a relationship and appreciated all my love and nice things I did in return. Mostly they were invested in my success and me achieving my dreams. Quite a few of them helped me with my career goals. Why wouldn't they? I help some of my own friends with their job applications, websites, whatever..My recent ex accused me of using him for groceries (I don't have a car as I mostly work from home) which to me is really normal life stuff you would do with someone. There seems to be this transactional nature to the things men will do in these relationships ""I helped you with x so now you owe me"". Which leads me to:

* **The ultra capitalist view and expectations placed on women:** I dated this decently successful guy when I first got here for whom I then came to realize I was as a friend described ""an exotic bird he could show off"". These men are obsessed with dating beautiful, accomplished women and it feels like you're an item off a list ""Big house. Fancy car. Hot girlfriend"". There seems to be no value for personality and compatibility. Which of course cannot possibly lead to good relationships. And then they're upset when you have any wants or desires of your own and gaslight you. I feel like women are just manic-pixie-dream-girled to death here. 

* **The emotional repression:** I feel for people not being able to express their emotions or being told it's emasculating, being French we're pretty brutally honest and that can go both ways; it can come off as mean. But it seems to lead to women having to do all the emotional labor. And relationships are emotional labor, sometimes you won't get along and annoy each other. A guy I was with for a year and a half refused to say I love you, his sister then told him she would have dumped his ass by now, so he then said it for a week and then took it back. It seems being loving is emasculating here. And of course, I feel like I have to walk on eggshells here because women are expected to be compliant, docile doormats and just accept whatever. Which leads me to:

* **The breakups:** Because of emotional repression and immaturity, it seems the only way to resolve conflict here is nuclear explosion breakups. Last boyfriend broke up with me out of the blue after I'd given him a bunch of gifts because he had ""doubts"". That is the only explanation I was given, no conversation, no explaining, nothing; a ""don't contact me"" text when I checked up on him since he'd been unwell. He was supposed to come meet my family in France this summer and then over Christmas... A friend told me she once signed a lease with a guy and he didn't show up on their move date and left a note in the place saying ""sorry, I can't do this"". Back when I was a full-on pick-meisha when I moved here (under my mistaken assumption that I had to adapt to the US culture by.. having no standards), I let the first guy I was with here break up with me FOUR times, the last time by the way was a day before I was getting tested for brain tumors... To this day this person has not asked how I am and then proceeded to try to tank my career, spread rumors about me (does every man here call their ex-girlfriend crazy?). This man was 41 and a father. American men seem intent on poisoning everything and destroying you once it's over, even if nothing tragic happened. I can't even look back at the wonderful moments and memories because of how they behaved in the breakups. They are completely emotionally unstable and volatile.
Two of my best exes whom I was with for 2 and 6 years are part of my life. We chat, hang out as friends, none of the men I've ever been with until here have spread malicious rumors, they didn't make our friends ""pick sides"" and one of them is currently helping me build my home studio to further my career. 



I could write more.. and being in Los Angeles, I'd put some of it down to this city, the egos in entertainment, but I read your stories and I can tell it's the same thing everywhere. There are shitty shitty no value men everywhere who treat women like rubbish but honestly, here is definitely the worst I've experienced. People go on about women in parts of the world who have it so much worse, but emotional violence is as terrible and hard to overcome as physical violence.  I really feel for you wonderful gorgeous ladies here because I've dealt with three years of this and I'm ready to throw in the towel. You know deep down these things aren't right. Don't accept them, you are worth so much more:",101485,Moved to the US.. can't believe how men treat women here,0,,,

The average man is actually horribly below average when you think about it. Not physically attractive, not financially generous with whatever they have, not emotionally intelligent. 

They are more likely to know the twitter handle for their favourite adult actress than their kids’ allergies. They don’t be reading. And when they do, it’s Dan Bilzerian’s picture autobiography or Rich Dad Poor Dad. 

 The global average for male height is 5’9” and even that’s awfully skewed upwards by Western countries. Imagine they spent millennia deifying themselves as BIG RELIABLE MANLY MEN when most of them are the height of my tallest aunt. 

They don’t wash in between their cheeks even though they have enough hair down there to make 18” clip ins. 

They can barely change their tires.

Their dicks look like the bananas we were all saving to make banana bread with back in March, because they all have ED.

They don’t even support their male friends, even though their whole lives are homoerotic dumpster fires, built to only suck up to other men. They can share porn in their group chats but they can’t share their feefees. How does that work?

Meanwhile, all the women I know have a stash of vitamins and skincare next to their beds. Not a single one of my friends flinch at the thought of getting a therapist or figuring out their attachment styles. And I don’t know a single girl who isn’t an active, helpful part of an emotional support network, somewhere in her life.

I strength train, do cardio, do yoga, dance, and train martial arts (before COVID). I often have men make comments that I eat a lot or saying I don't really eat as much as I say I do.

My ex-boyfriend would harass me and tell me I was eating too much when I was actually losing weight. Not my problem you are skinny and sedentary while I am muscular and exercise.

But today in my online nursing class, we were going over nutrition and had to use this nutrition calculator. So I shared my results and said that the 2400+ calorie estimate was pretty accurate for me. Then goes Mr. Obese BMI (he says it's from muscle though) who says that that can't be right because HE eats 2400 calories a day and his 4100+ calorie estimate was grossly inaccurate.

Now I've had a healthy lifestyle for years. I have dieted at 2,000 calories and failed because I was starving and had no energy. And I've eaten way more than 2,400 calories a day to put on all my muscle  from when I was untrained. When I was sedentary and lighter, I ate around 1800 calories a day. Surely, 15 more pounds and hours of exercise a day wouldn't increase my caloric needs.

I am so done with men thinking I don't need to eat as much as I do. I feel they think it emasculates them? Like I'm not actually this petite little girl that they could break in half. I guess it shatters their illusions that all women who are at a healthy weight eat like birds. And I think I am the expert in how much I eat, not someone who doesn't know how much I actually eat. There is no way a grown man with an obese BMI is maintaining his weight at 2400 calories unless he's bed bound. Yes women are smaller than men but women aren't half the size of men.

When he first moved in with his family to the neighborhood I would see him once in a while - and was friendly. 

Then suddenly I was seeing this asshole ALL the time. Everyday. Multiple times per day. 

It became really obvious from repeatedly seeing him that He was already cheating on or attempting to cheat on his wife because when I would be out walking my dog I would catch him several blocks away from his house on his phone looking suspicious. He would be out there for hours. This went on for several months.

One time I ran into him on my way back from the gym and he starts asking me all these inappropriate questions about where I work etc. Just out of the blue rapid fire. 

He must have figured out my schedule because I would see him when I left for work or whenever I walked my dog or went for a run. I even started walking my dog down another street and he started parking on the street close to there. I literally could not avoid this dude.

One time when I was pulling off to go to work He was walking across the street, and when he saw me, he doubled back and walked right in front of my car like a GQ model. He had on a fresh cut and suit and all that shit - clearly showing off. 

I finally had enough off his fuckboy shenanigans and realized he was doing this deliberately so I started to purposefully get chummy with his wife and kids. When I would see his wife out I would stop and chat with her, and say hello to his kids. 
I even brought them a few extra things for their dog that I didn’t need anymore. 

FDS, I went from literally seeing this asshole multiple times a day to hardly ever. Like *never*. This dude might as well be a ghost how quickly he disappeared. 

This is not the first time this kind of married man stalk down has happened to me. It’s happened a lot and contributes greatly to my trust issues. 

Fast forward a few months later and his wife and kids are gone and this new woman moved in. She is SUCH a pathetic Pickmeisha. 

She’s always giving me the squinty eyes when I see her outside like I’m plotting on her worthless Scrote of man. She has this energy like she’s always scanning the neighbors defensively looking for a fight. Probably feels like she “won” getting this multiple kid loser. I really have to wonder how pathetic her life is for her to see this man as a prize. 

Men who claim affairs “just happen” are FOS; they TOTALLY know how to keep purposefully putting themselves in a woman’s space trying shit. It’s so obvious and desperate.",102915,THIRSTY-PARCHED-ATTENTION- STARVED MARRIED MEN NEED TO STOP STALKING ME,0,,,

I did it. He wants to support (financially and emotionally) me while I go to school. He thinks it's awesome I want to get my doctorate one day even though it means I will be educated much more than him. It doesn't intimidate him. He stocks his house with la Croix and popsicles bc he knows they're my favorite. He pays for all of our dates and comes up with them. He will drive 1.5 hours every weekend to come see me. He says he will basically do anything my heart desires to have a future w me. He knows my proposal better be obscenely fancy and he thinks that's exactly what I deserve. He's ok without moving in until we are engaged despite knowing each other for 10 years. He wants to improve himself for himself, but also for me. He is the type I know will wake up w a kid at 3 AM if I'm too tired. He is profeminism (not just bc sex), pro BLM, and amazingly smart. 

I'm just excited. I worked on leveling myself up and it just fell into place. Got my own place, moved to a new city, worked on my degree. Put dating to the side. We reconnected and he came to hang out (I really assumed it would just be as friends bc in the past he didn't have his shit together and I'm not into that) and it just... Sorta happened. And even after talking and deciding we wanted to date. Even despite knowing each other for 10 years and having dated many years ago before we had our lives together, he didn't expect any sex from me. Didn't even try. He knows when I'm ready and comfortable to get back on that level, we will. And he is patient enough not to even mention it in the mean time. Also, not once when we dated in the past, did he ever ever cheat on me (we dated like 3 longish times when we were both very young) He is the furthest thing from jealous I can imagine. He would let me bring guy friends over to his house when he wasn't there back in the day bc I lived with my parents back then and wanted somewhere to hang out. Never had a problem. Bc he always trusted me.

We started socializing more with each other during the lockdown through video calls. Sara got married super early, 2 months after her 18th birthday, to her then bf who was 24-25 years old. She's 23 now and he's 29-30. That man is the most disgusting scrote I've ever laid my eyes on. He has cheated on her multiple time, he spends all her money but she does not have access to all his money. I didn't know about this last point until recently.

A few days ago we were talking on a call and Ana (who got married in a court house recently) said her parents transferred a huge amount of money to her which was intended to be her wedding fund, and was looking for ways to invest it. Sara asked if Ana's husband didn't want any, and that she was lucky. Ana said that this was her money and husband had no claim to it and he knows it. Sara laughed and said that's not how marriages work. Ana said that hers will. and that she is not like Sara. Sara asked ""not like me means what exactly?"" To which I replied ""Naïve"". 

That was the wrong answer because Sara teared up and said ""I knew you knew it and you didn't tell me.""  And the NVM exited the call (we didn't even know he was sitting right beside her out of frame.) After a lot of texting and calling, the story is that NVM was cheating on her, I apparently saw him at the supermarket with his partner (I don't remember seeing him, I may not have recognized him, but i do remember meeting the woman he was cheating with and talking to her.) He confessed to Sara that day and when I didn't tell her about that he has been saying that I only tell he things to stir shit up between them, and I did not tell her now because I don't actually want her to be happy, etc. 

This woman has been my friend since school, we've drifted apart sure, but that was largely because of her husband. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I do wish that she leaves the dude, but I'm tired of being being there for her and then being berated for stuff I didn't do. What do I do?

I found it especially terrifying because this is something that could very easily happen in real life, especially when people in general already blame women for pretty much everything. These women would've been blamed and gaslit to hell and back after their deaths, without anyone realizing the awful truth.

While this is just a story, it's just another reminder that FDS is right in that we never, EVER go to a guy's place as one of the first dates, nor should we go to places where it's easy to isolate ourselves with a man.

So far, I've been asked if I'm Spanish, Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian. When professors find out where I'm from, they usually have some cute story about their vacation there or a friend of theirs who comes from there as well. It's generally harmless and a nice way to make conversation.

And then *this* professor comes into scene. He's the kind of man who thinks he's Tyler Durden from *Fight Club* and Neo from *The Matrix*. Mind that he must be in his late fifties, and, according to him, has been married for a good thirty years to the same woman.

He notices my accent and stops me after class to ask me where I'm from, and once I tell him, he goes on this monologue about how his wife comes from the same country as me and has just *taught him soooo much*! Since I'm the only person on campus who speaks my country's language, I try to make conversation with him with it, even simply for the fact that I consider it better sounding and I have the possibility to be more articulate, but he immediately stills and tells me he doesn't speak the language.

Hoping that he's just being shy, I try to coax something out of him, but he just gets stiller and looks at me like I'm crazy.

His explanation? He's been married to this woman whose first language isn't English but, in thirty years of marriage (and who knows how many of relationship), he has never even *thought* of learning it. He used her as a translator even to talk to his in-laws because they didn't speak English.

I couldn't refrain myself from asking if he was joking, and, in all seriousness, he looked at me in the eyes and said ""Well, what can I do? I'm not one for languages and she accepted it"".

Useless to say that I didn't know how to continue this kind of conversation and just told him goodbye and walked away.

You need to keep it on it’s side if stored in bottles, otherwise the corn will dry out and crumble into the wine. You need to make sure you have the right type of wine (Rosé shouldn’t be aged, Chardonnay should). Wine doesn’t age well if you keep moving it around, and starting with a low quality wine will result in a low quality aged wine. The point? *If you don’t take care of wine, it ages poorly, and if you don’t take care of yourself, you will age poorly.*

There are lots of examples on the internet of some people aging gracefully and being attractive at older ages, and some people trying to look 20 forever and looking like embalmed corpses walking around, or not taking care of themselves at all and looking a decade older than they should. In my own life, I know people who have taken care of themselves and look stunning in their 50s, and people who look gross by 25 because they don’t sleep, work out, or drink water, just spend their time completely inside fueling themselves on caffeine and nicotine in the day, cooling down with booze and weed at night. 

A high value person (male or female) takes care of themselves, they have fun, but prioritize their well being. They don’t try to imitate youth, but rather strive to be their best self at every age. They treat their body with love and allow it to change. They age like fine wine, and love themselves at every step of the process, appreciating where they are now and happily anticipating who they will be in the future. Everyone has the capacity to age like fine wine, which just makes it more sad and pitiful when people choose to age like vinegar.  

The mindset shift I want you to take from this is that like most things, this isn’t “men vs women”, it’s “high value vs low value”. LVM talk shit all day long about “the wall” while simultaneously aging like cheap white vinegar, let’s not imitate them. Treat yourself like the fine glass of Chardonnay you are, and refuse to entertain anyone who doesn’t value themselves enough to do the same.

Whether they ever became aware of the enabling or not is still lost to me. 

More often than not it was heavily due to their insecurities or thoughts that no other guy has treated them so well (thanks to their past LV relationships). “No one wants to date a single mom,” “He’s the only one who doesn’t judge who I *really* am” “He cheated but it’s because our relationship hasn’t been going so well lately.” You get the gist.

Thanks to this and having an emotionally absent father, I’ve been afraid to enter relationships. Before I found out about FDS I thought I was just “too quick to pin red flags on people” and “pulling excuses from thin air to pull out of dating someone.” 

But looking back now that I’ve been around this sub, these excuses were *100%* valid. Every single time I had a gut feeling about a guy, I was right.

“He’s too eager to meet right away” usually led to the guy pushing for us to be alone somewhere, regardless of whether we knew each other through mutual friends or online. 

“He never tried to talk to me until I started working out and eating right” usually had the same implications.

“He’s got a certain look in his eyes” you know the look, it’s one that makes you feel dirty and exposed.

“He’s trying to date the *moment* I got out of a relationship” this will never not be a neon red flashing sign. 

“He doesn’t keep his place clean”

“It’s just a vibe”

I can go on for years lol.

I’d, of course, fallen into situationships thanks to ignoring red flags and they never end well.

But thank you FDS for helping me solidify that I’m only looking out for myself by walking away at any sight of a red flag and not settling.",104075,I’m grateful for the pickme traits I was exposed to throughout my life.,0,,,

I met what I thought was an amazing guy last year. He was immediately open with his interest in me, he made a massive effort to talk to me every day, we made future plans, he wasn't afraid to be emotional and earnest and made me feel special. On the surface, all great, no doubts whatsoever.

And then it just all went downhill from there. I won't itemise and agonise over the things he did, because this isn't about him, but over and over again, I always managed to convince myself that if I just kept trying and showing him how much I cared, and making it easier and easier for him to take any positive action, then he would do something about it. He'd fuck up and rather than walk away, I'd explain how he could remedy it...

He never did. I was just there, setting the bar lower and lower and lower for a man who would say all the right words and lament his poor behaviors he knows he had and about not being able to make me happy and about how sad he was that he upset me, but when I told him what he could actually do to fix things, would not lift a finger. Instead, he'd just ask if we could get back to things being nice as if there was some magical reset button in my brain that would let me ignore whatever he'd done and pretend it was all great again. And then he'd get distant or pissed off with me if I didn't immediately bounce back to cheerful and flirty. 

And then this revelation hit me like a ton of bricks.
Because I think we strongly link the idea that someone will take action or change or do something difficult for you to our own worth. Rather than realising that its about the other person's self-worth. When I realise that I have bad habits, or unhealthy behaviours - I work on those for my own good and to better myself.

If someone comes into your life having never worked on themselves - they either don't think those things are a problem (in which case - good luck convincing them otherwise) or they don't think it's worth the effort.

And this guy in particular - like a lot of people I've met in life - absolutely knew those things and behaviors were a problem. He identified them as unhealthy. He knew he was upsetting me. 
I suspect that he'd done the same thing with women before me too. 

And yet at no point in his 30 years of being on the planet had he ever considered actually working on fixing those things so they didn't keep causing issues. And if he'd managed to get that far in life never having thought ""maybe if I work on changing this, I'll be happier"", why would he do so for anyone else?
I offered him all the support I could to get actual help, and he couldn't even be bothered to pick up a book I offered him. 

I think wanting to be ""worth"" changing for is a weirdly seductive thing. The idea that you are in some way important enough or special or have enlightened someone as to their behavior. But realistically, why would you want someone who changes for you rather than for themselves? That just means they were perfectly okay with it, right up until you weren't.

And what usually happens in my experience, is that rather than just taking the hand you're offering, they expect you to step down into the gutter with them so they can complain about how awful it is to be stuck down there.",104070,"If they didn't do it for themselves, they're not going to do it for you.",0,,,

In response we’re going curate acceptable content more stringently. 

Basically, if your meme, screenshot, or video is not getting a lot of traction or user engagement after a certain amount of time or is too far off topic, we’re going to remove it. 

We’ll also be removing any overly political memes regardless of content or trending because it starts too many unproductive political fights in the comment section. 

And as always, we will remove repeat posts and/or obvious karma farming.

We’d like our homepage feed to be mostly quality content that resonates with people and facilitates discussion. 

If your content gets removed, please don’t message us demanding to know why because we won’t answer or at best point you to this post. 

Thanks 

FDS management",104034,FDS will be increasing the amount of low quality memes/videos we remove at our discretion,0,,,

But that's genuinely not the case for most of the ones I've met (or even pickme's).

Modern men will date almost any woman. 

I've had multiple marriage proposals since my divorce, since raising my standards, and since becoming a single mom, even.

I'm not a huge looker, and I'm even pretty chubby, but I keep getting hit with ""you're just not *able* to find a man."" It's just not accurate. 

It happens, that the man I'm interested in isn't reciprocating, but I also don't want to date a guy who is using me for a space to live. It's an unfortunate situation for me, but it's not the same as not being able to find a man. 

Why do they say this? Is it just to try to invoke shame?

My gut reaction actually IS to prOVe thEM WRonG by dating, but that would ruin literally everything I've built!",105215,"Maturely handling accusations of ""not being able to find a man.""",0,,,

But I wanted to hear fds minded opinions on a more specific question which is HOW IMPORTANT SEX ACTUALLY IS because im conflicted and trying to get my thoughts together. 

Confession first: I have broken up with a man that was promising in every other way other than sex. My reasoning was naw I'm not spending the rest of my life with a man with a skinny dick. 

Fast forward to just now i was reading a thread on the front page about a guy with an asexual girlfriend. He said their relationship is good. She shows him love and affection in other ways. And they do still have sex, but she could go without it and that hurts him. (Honestly he sounded like he wanted to break up with her to pursue a porn star gf of his dreams who slaves over his dick and wanted porn addict men on reddit to validate him, but that was maybe just my cynical takeaway, not necessarily the case). The point being many of the comments were different rephrasings of ""i would break up with her, sex is so important""

My reaction after seeing so many people annouce how important sex and kinks are in their relationship and how quickly they'd dump her is ""these people are so immature and dumb. placing such importance on sex is idiotic. Having kinks rule your life is pathetic""

But back up though. I started analyzing myself. And of course realized I called it off with a guy because of sex, technically. In that circumstance i prioritized sex over compatibility (we actually were compatible). I genuinely think i made a mistake with that one. I know many more men will come along and im not exactly going to be wringing my hands over it lol. But yes I do think it was potentially a mistake. 

It got me thinking about how SO MANY long term relationships that fall apart can be traced back to the fact that ""good sex"" and sexual chemistry was prioritized over true compatibility. Men often cheat (or daydream of cheating) after their wife gives birth. Middle aged men cheat at enormously high levels during their wives menopausal years. Seems like for a scary large amount of LTR the second the sex takes a hit the thing fails.

My point is. Im waking up to the fact that sex is a shaky foundation. Right? At the same time I dont want to be disappointed sexually either. 

There was an interesting conversation going on deep in the comments of that thread about this but i lost interest because the pickmeishas totally derailed it by announcing their love of kinks and clarifying they have the highest sex drive in the entire world. The consensus seemed to be ""sex is the most important thing in a partnership"". But i realized I have zero interest in their advice and would much rather hear from r/fds minded women.

How much do you prioritize sexually compatibility for a LTR? If a guy is awful because hes porn sick that is an obvious red flag. If hes awful because hes selfish, also obvious. But what if the sex is bad because hes on the asexual spectrum or has an awful dick? Should i relax my sex standards? What do you do in these situations?",105154,Conflicted about the importance of sex,0,,,

Do not let becoming or being a single mom make you question your worth or feel less than! When I became a single mom a year ago after my LV  Ex- Husband left myself and our three kids, I struggled with the feelings that if he wouldn't stay (even when I looked great, took care of him, and took on most of the responsibilities) how could another man possibly be interested? I bought into the lies reading comments from men on Reddit. Here are some of the things that have commonly been written about why single moms are less than and not appropriate to date/marry:

1. The kids will always come first. 

TRUTH- If you are a HVM and you want to have kids with a woman, whether they are your biological children or not, there will be times when both the mother and father have to put the kids first. If a man cannot understand this, he is inherently low value and would not make a good parent in any situation  (the trash takes itself out). 

2. The woman is single for a reason (No man would leave his kids if she wasn't awful).

TRUTH- Again, women are being blamed for a man's faults here. If a man loved his children and the woman was truly unsafe/inappropriate for the children, then why would he leave his children in an unsafe situation? Also, if there are multiple kids why did he continue to have children with her if she was that bad? 

3. The woman made bad choices.

TRUTH- Women are again being blamed for being the parent that stayed. Women who have young children (and especially multiple young children) are not going to leave a man unless the situation is truly unfathomable/unsafe or bad. A woman who sees that something is unsafe etc, does what she needs to do to protect the kids and is making a GOOD decision. If the man left , why would a woman be responsible for a man being irresponsible/selfish/immature etc? 

All this to say, I am now dating again after 10 months of counseling and moving to my home state. After reading lies on Reddit, it's been an extreme shock to see just how many men from twenties to sixties are all begging for the chance to take me out (in a relationship context not a casual one). These men are educated, have great professions and are solid. They do not care one bit that I have three children and that I am a single mom. They see an educated, attractive, stable, hard working and caring individual. 

I know what I bring to the table and it's nothing less just because I happen to have children. Statistically, in my area the majority of women my age (33) also have children (and most aren't single). If a man in his thirties + wants to date and eventually marry his equal (without going for a much younger woman that hasn't had children yet), the majority of his dating prospects will have children (unless they are child-free and he also doesn't want children). 

Ladies, don't ever question your value, whether you have children or are child-free. Your status does not change your value. My children aren't baggage and HVM don't see them that way.",105150,SINGLE MOMS: You do not have less value because you have children!,0,,,

I really wanted to chew them out but I had to walk across the road right in front of their car and I was afraid that they would legit try and run into me.

But after I was on the other side I was seething with anger so much that I had to say something but I didn't want to start loudly cursing in the middle of the city. So my response to a ""you should suck my dick"" was ""you should learn to speak in a respectful manner"".

Then I flipped them off.

Anyway, this made me realize that I have no clue how to handle a situation like this like a high-value woman. Are we supposed to stay silent or chew them out? Or does it depend on the situation?",105137,How does a HVW deal with catcalling?,0,,,

I’ve turned down multiple dinners in favour of drinks over the years (partly to do with anxiety, my stomach seizes up and I can’t eat) but also because I was worried it was too intense. 

But I’m just back from my second first date over food (from online dating) and I’m a huge convert. I’ve eaten lovely food, drunk so much good wine (he’s Italian so it’s to be expected) and sat outside a beautiful restaurant taking in the atmosphere. 

The man before this took me out to a beautiful restaurant on our first date (and second, and third and cooked for me on 4th. I dumped him on 5th date). 

There’s not a question mark over who pays the bill, I came back from the bathroom today and it was done. And now I’ve skipped home feeling all content and full knowing I’ve had a lovely day regardless whether I see him again or not. He’s asked to see me again tbf but I’m not that fussed. 

A drink date is always at least 1.5 hours long, no different from dinner if you want to make it quick. Because of this sub and a change to my mindset I don’t feel like today was wasted in anyway, I put my make up on, he bought me dinner. I had a fun afternoon in good company and now I’m home cuddling my cat. It’s taken 38 years for me to realise that I’m amazing (and very attractive) company. I’ve spent so many years selling my self short, I didn’t even think I was worth a dinner date. Thanks for showing me the way.",105108,Dinner Date Convert,0,,,

Some women in the review section for this book gave the book one star and found the advice to be outdated and sexist. One such woman posted this on there, which I wanted to share. I have edited it for easier reading.

""If you really, REALLY want to get married, here is my advice. I am giving it out FREE here on Amazon so people don't give John Molloy any more money for his silly books. Are you ready? Here it is:

\- Don't sit at home. Get out and meet people. If you live in a city of any size, there will be groups of people who assemble to participate in activities you would enjoy - everything from stargazing through telescopes to needlepoint. If you don't feel comfortable joining mixed-sex groups, join women's groups. Other women have friends, brothers, sons, etc. who you may like very much. The bottom line is GET OUT THERE. Sitting at home will NOT enable you to meet anyone you'd be interested in.

\- Make a list of the things you want in a partner, and then a list of your deal-breakers. Then go back over the list of your deal-breakers and really examine it. Just because someone is bald, or likes sci-fi, or hates Indian food does not mean they are not a wonderful person who would be a caring partner. When I met my husband, he smoked. I HATE smoking. He also had a few other habits that drove me crazy. But I could see past those to the wonderful, fabulous person he is. I could see he was great husband material (and believe me, you should evaluate people as potential spouses EARLY - don't feel shallow for doing so). I stuck with him, and just a couple of years into the relationship, he quit smoking. He is the most wonderful man I have ever met and I could not ask for a more loyal, faithful, caring, funny and intelligent man to be my husband. I am not talking about ignoring personality traits like ""he beats me"" or ""he's drunk all the time."" I'm talking about trying to look past the ""Seinfeld"" or ""Sex and the City"" criteria for dating. ""I can't keep dating him, he has long nose hairs."" So what? If he's a caring, stable person, he can clip his nose hairs. But a shiftless, abusive guy with good grooming can't change his personality.

\- Here's the most important one. Love yourself. Invest in yourself. Even if you weigh 300 lbs, you should be getting your hair done, buying flattering clothes that fit you, and walking around with your head held high. I have been chunky all my life but I dated plenty in high school and college, because I decided early on that I felt good about myself and I was going to have a personality that attracted people to me, even if my looks didn't. My husband wasn't even the first guy who wanted to marry me, and believe me, I don't meet any of Molloy's ""criteria."" It's not because I am dazzlingly beautiful or I have a compliant personality.

Great, thought provoking article. But in regards to FDS, I wondered how many women would be less inclined to stay -- or start off in -- an abusive, or even just disrespectful relationship if we had these deep, connected bonds? Someone to really say ""no. you deserve better."" Someone who was always there to take support, care and just be there.

I lost my already mostly remote job during covid, on top of the ending of an awful relationship last fall, and the subsequent loss of a few ""friendships"". It's been a lonely year. There are definitely times I've spent with... Not quite LVM, but certainly lower-value-men in search of companionship. I'm blessed with an extended close community, and an incredible tight circle of lady friends. But covid has made these connections more virtual, less frequent and more physically distant as we all keep our bubbles tight.

If our needs for physical affection were met through platonic love, would so many of us be OLD? I've said it myself, yes I miss sex, but I miss being held more than the sex.

If we had more options for housing and child care and support, would we continue to ""choose"" (when your options are so limited, is it really a choice?) to live and procreate with LVM? 

Also. Really got a kick out of the corollary to the fairer sex of ""the grosser sex"".

Food for thought, ladies. Stay strong, and reach out and build your network. Let's get back to -- or create -- a world in which intense, long-lasting platonic same sex friendships are not just accepted, but the norm. That we are surrounded by a community of Queens and less dependent upon LVM for companionship, morale, touch, inspiration, support, care and lifting each other up.

NB. I appreciate that the author pointed out that this was a middle class white woman phenomenon. But I don't see any reason a current iteration of this couldn't apply far more broadly",106187,"What If Friendship, Not Marriage, Was at the Centre of Life?",0,,,

It's so heavily ingrained into women,  from such a young age, that what we should strive for is a husband and kids.  That we should be thrilled with the concept of committing ourselves to a lifetime of servitude, and grateful to any man who lets her ""tie him down"".  For we would have achieved something that we are taught is sure to bring us happiness and fulfillment.  

And this, I believe, is the biggest lie we where ever told.  To believe that other people, an achievement, a husband or even a child is what will bring us contentment.  The persistent ""I will be happy once I achieve x"" rhetoric is a perverted way of thinking, only nourished by the sickness in our current society.

Learning to be happy single was the turning point in my life, after six years of major depression.  While I had good boyfriends and not so good boyfriends,  my happiness always slowly became dependent on them,  the attention they gave,  the comments they made of my appearance, etc. External, fickle factors.  In turn, I too became fickle and superficial. 

It was hard alone and unloved but things slowly got better, one day I felt love again from the taste of a chicken soup,  then i noticed how alive the trees looked,  the world slowly became beautiful.  I opened my piano again,  I started skiing again,  bought a home and landed a job I love.  Life became an infinite abundance of beauty and experiences.    I didn't have sex for two years.  Marriage and kids became potential liabilities to my life, a set of restrictive expectations and obligations. 

Maybe in the future it would be nice to share my life with someone and have babies. But right now I don't have the level of sacrifice inside me, willing to become emotionally at an others mercy,  when I already have everything.   From this obnoxiously long post,  I just want to stress the importance of not relying on external sources for fulfillment and being happy alone.",106163,The scam of believing men will bring you fulfillment,0,,,

recently I have been asked out by a teacher.
this teacher has a more regular schedule.

still, I am having doubts. first, because my ex was a teacher and ender very badly. he always complained about money and going dutch even when I did not work (I was also younger)

second, I feel like teaching sadly, except at university level, does not pay enough for a decent future family-middle class lifestyle compared to tech, engineering, law or banking.

third, I feel like some male teachers chose teaching well, sadly surrounded with younger girls all the time. I had some creepy perv male teachers who flirted heavily with us girls.

A few nights ago, a guy I’ve been talking to said I should come over to his apartment. I was completely fine with that and thought it’d be fun regardless of what direction the night went in. I wasn’t super sure what he had in mind, since our interactions up until that point had been somewhere between friendly and flirty. Would’ve been down to just hang out, would’ve been down for more.  I said sure, just had to pick up a few drunk friends from a party and make sure they got home safe before heading over. 

Told him I was heading over, all seemed fine. He lives pretty close to a lot of bars/the football stadium, and a game was getting out so driving and finding parking was an absolute nightmare, especially with all the drunk people who would just kinda step into the street.

I let him know I was there. No response. I waited. And waited. Embarrassingly enough, I ended up waiting like 30 minutes, sitting in my car while it was raining. I should’ve just left after like 5. I was super hurt and confused, especially since he was the one to invite me over (and this wasn’t the first time, I just hadn’t been available other nights). 

I drove to a friend’s place that was nearby since I was feeling like absolute shit and crashed there. He responded to me a few hours later (at around 2 am) saying he passed out and that he was really sorry. I was skeptical, but my friend convinced me he meant it. Well, sort of. I was still pretty wary of the whole thing, but didn’t cut him off. 

Until a day or so later. I tried to start a conversation with him, and I was getting the DRYEST responses ever. I tried one more time. Same thing. 

Honestly? I probably did too much. I should’ve just left after 5 minutes that night and never talked to him again. I shouldn’t have even tried to start a conversation with him. I shouldn’t have worried about him feeling bad for HIS own actions. I had nothing to do with him “passing out”/ignoring me. But after my two small attempts at talking, I decided it wasn’t worth it, in part because of this sub. 

I’ve already done more than I should have, but at least I wasn’t in that deep. If he was sorry, I’d like to think he wouldn’t have just stopped talking to me... I still don’t really know what happened that night, if he was just trying to fuck with me and play some type of game. This is embarrassing, but there’s a chance I would still be trying with someone who doesn’t give a shit if it wasn’t for the constant empowerment on this sub. I’m definitely worthy of not being ignored and receiving basic attention, and hey! I’m going out with a guy tonight, might be fun :-)",13988,This sub continuously reminds me to take no man’s shit.,0,2019-10-06 17:00:34,,

40 y.o. female here. I am so excited for this thread. I realized I've been listening to the wrong sources (i.e. well-intentioned male friends) about dating and have been fucking it all up. They tell me, ""be aloof,"" ""be yourself,"" ""have fun,"" ""don't show them you like them."" It's crazy making. After all of that BS, I found this. What a blessing.

 My situation is a little complicated. Ii am positive for HSV2. I have the nutsack to be honest about it. But sometimes it is extremely uncomfortable to watch my dating stock value plummet when I am open and honest about it. There's such such a horrifying lack of comprehensive STD education in the US that creates a non-realistic binary world of ""clean/unclean."" 

Here's my story: I wish I had gotten it from fucking a football team or something because at least I would have a story. But, I got it from the third guy I slept with when I was 21. The guy that gave it to me didn't tell me he had it. He almost tried to fuck me without a condom (of course!). Almost. I had to stop and we got condoms.  Things progressed  We had a sex a few more times. He moved to Hawaii. Shortly after, my vagina blew up. I went to the doctor and was swiftly diagnosed with HSV 2. I confronted him. He said ""he forgot."" FML.

After my diagnosis, I \*assumed\* that I would never date again based upon the jokes and society's general bullshit surrounding herpes. So, I didn't date for most of my twenties.  I knew I wasn't going to have kids, so I never had the baby pressure.  Instead, I pursued other things. I took the path of a creative. Did things most people dream of doing.  I had a phenomenal time.

I had low self esteem before herpes, and even lower after.  After many years of not dating, at some point I realized that I had to work on myself and become bulletproof with this bullshit. Which meant dating and taking the blows. So I did. I would date and I would disclose. It wasn't as nightmarish as some other people may have experienced (some women are called whores, etc).  It sucks for sure, but some of the guys who rejected me I became friends with and later discovered would be incompatible because they had severe emotional issues and baggage.  Funny how that works?  

Physically, I don't even notice it.  I've heard more herpes jokes from hack comics than I have had outbreaks. My ultra painful periods from my IUD are far worse than any outbreak has ever been.

Emotionally and intellectually, I wrestle with it every day.  Society, and people (especially on Reddit) scream and demand that I disclose. But do you know who doesn't seem to give that much shit about Herpes? The CDC. And I quote:

*CDC does not recommend herpes testing for people without symptoms. This is because diagnosing genital herpes in someone without symptoms has not shown any change in their sexual behavior (e.g., wearing a condom or not having sex) nor has it stopped the virus from spreading. Also, false positive test results (test results that say you have herpes when you do not actually have the virus) are possible. Even if you do not have symptoms, you should talk openly and honestly about your sexual history with your doctor to find out if you should be tested for any STDs, including herpes*

They also say,

*Most people who have genital herpes have no symptoms, or have very mild symptoms. You may not notice mild symptoms or you may mistake them for another skin condition, such as a pimple or ingrown hair. Because of this, most people who have herpes do not know it.*

A standard STD screening generally doesn't have a herpes test (see above). Yes, that means it is likely that your std screening has never had a herpes test.  Truth is, most people have herpes. The statistics are out there. One out of six has type 2 and more than 60% has type 1. Type 1 is now being linked to genital herpes infections. In layman terms, mouth cold sores are herpes and these cold sores sometimes be transmitted to genitals.

What really bothers me is this. A common suggestion from people I have sought advice from say ""don't disclose."" They have told me people they know that have it know it and don't disclose. I am just not that person. I don't want to be like the chicken shit male who gave it to me. I've disclosed it so many times to grown men and it is SHOCKING how many guys have NEVER had this conversation. It's shocking how I have to conduct a sex education class on the third date.  

So, I am really only fucking myself in the end? I am willing to bet dollars to donuts that the guys that rejected me did not seek a herpes test to verify their status and are not asking every girl they fuck their status (with proof).  I also imagine any  male Redditer that's gonna call me a cum dumpster would not have the courage to go get a herpes test.  They would rather not know so they don't have to bear the responsibility that they are so willing to dole out.  I'm exhausted of this stigma brought on by big pharma, hack comics (thank Judd Apatow!), and ignorance. 

So my question is: How do hold your value to when you're a sexual pariah?",13982,Dating with herpes,0,2019-10-06 16:33:14,,

We had just started talking and I liked him as a friend so far. Not even a week into talking yet and he continuously asks these questions.

At first I thought it was a bit strange, but I answered them to the best of my ability because every person is different when it comes to the dating world. During the first day of me giving him my number (he messaged me on FB), he asked me if I was use to being flirted with. I am to an extent, but I’m only human so stuff might fly over my head. I told him this and we continued talking.

Over just a few days he continues to ask me if I understand that he’s flirting with me. I do, but I don’t have to respond with flirting if I don’t want to, right? I want to get to know him before all of that and if I don’t then it just feels awkward and forced. I am then told that I seem uninterested. 

Long, long, long story short, I felt like he was being needy and pushing towards liking him sooner than I would have naturally. I don’t like the feeling of being forced to think or feel something that isn’t really there. So, I put on my big girl pants and politely told him that I would like to just remain friends.

The dating world hasn’t treated me nicely. Before he messaged me, I was finally accepting the fact that I could be truly happy outside of a relationship. I still stand on my point that I do not want a relationship at any point right now.

This is my first time posting, so I apologize if it’s a bit all over the place.

I hope someone can take something from my experience and learn from it.

Don’t let people make you feel like you need to like them or be with them. Don’t allow yourself to force feelings that aren’t really there. My situation was very minor, but no matter what I told him, he continued to push.

Men claim to be “sex positive” to cover for sexual exploitation

&amp;nbsp;

Men praise “independent women” so they can convince women to pay 50/50.

&amp;nbsp;

They want to marry a woman who “has her own” but still expect her to submit to him or carry him financially. 

&amp;nbsp;

When you point out how much more violence in the world is committed by men they say “men and women are equally good and bad”

They support a “woman’s right to choose” if it means they won’t have to pay child support.

We have a lot in common, he is genuinely kind and honest and we want the same things in the future, we click very well and I feel this can turn into something real. 

**The problem -**

During the first three months I asked him out 4 times and he canceled every time. However, with **legit reasons**. Then I asked him out again at the end of September and he answered roughly with *''It's not the right time, sorry if I'm unclear''*. I said *''I am interested in you so you will have to text me when you want to meet up, but I will not wait for you''*. We haven't had any contact for about three weeks but he has written one day each week that he thinks of me, miss talking to me and likes my insta photos etc… 

Now in October, he says he wants to start talking again. I've started dating others (though only first dates, so far). And he got a little bit offended. I then told him *''I have started dating others. I told you that I will not wait for you and you said you understood it, how do you want it? You don't want to meet me but you also don't want me to meet anyone else? You have to make up your mind.’’* He replied that he wants to meet me, **but** he still hasn't set a day or time. **What should I do?**

If it had happened with another guy, I would have blocked him immediately, but something about this guy feels right. He doesn't give me any red flags except the meeting part. **How do I get him to ask me out?**

Feel free to ask if you need more information. English isn't my first language.

&amp;nbsp;

A repeated question we get on this sub is how long to wait to have sex with a new guy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Our general rule of thumb is 1) after he has made a commitment if you are interested in a relationship or 2) after he has demonstrated value and investment to you for FWBs. 

&amp;nbsp;

The general idea is to validate that a man is respectful of your time, body, and energy, is honest and of good character, and is willing to compensate you for the additional risk you take on as a woman by providing you with extra value - [more on that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d22vzv/given_that_the_risks_of_sex_are_way_higher_and/)

&amp;nbsp;

Here’s My personal Quick &amp; Dirty Rules at the moment:

&amp;nbsp;

Sex should take place 

&amp;nbsp;

1. After he’s agreed to an STD test ( you’re a HVW, who honors her sexual health)

2. After you’ve had a bit of phone sex to outline the rules of the game and of pleasing you. Don’t just let it happen because this is one of those things that can go very badly if you don’t set certain boundaries upfront. Furthermore - if he tried to cross them later you know what kind of a-hole you’re dealing with. 

3. After he’s made an obvious attempt to impress you.  Attempts to impress you could be he takes you somewhere you’ve always wanted to go, pays for an expensive date, etc. It should be an investment slightly larger than just dinner and a movie. Scale it to what you guess is his overall salary. Unfortunately with men - before sex is your time of greatest leverage so if you don’t set the standard now, you won’t be able to raise it later - so milk it for all it’s worth.

4. After you’ve said “no” to something and he’s graciously accepted it. It is very important to gauge his reaction To you setting limits - because if he is a boundary pushing asshole it could end up in your rape or sexual assault. It also weeds out RedPill assholes who try and bully women or fake “alphas”.

&amp;nbsp;

**Optional - but something I’m gonna do:**

&amp;nbsp;

5. Push *his* sexual boundaries a little by telling him you just want oral sex. He’s got to show he’s invested in pleasing you before you are willing to please him, and demonstrate he has sexual self control. 

&amp;nbsp;

Please post your own rules in the comments below! This thread will be beneficial to point to in the future when this question gets asked.",17304,MEGATHREAD: Under What Circumstances Should A Woman Agree To Sex?,0,2019-10-26 01:10:44,,

Logically, I knew he REALLY wasn’t a good choice- severe mental health issues, alcoholism, always a flirt with everyone, and we just had different values besides (I drink casually and have tried weed a couple times, but he relies on it to function). But we both really did love each other and so I figured why not try to make it work.

However, he went off to college and broke up with me. We’ve both said we still have feelings for each other but a relationship wouldn’t be a good idea, but stuff has still been very messy. He’s out living college life but telling me about and we both are reacting very badly to it all (for example, he told me about how he had drunkenly lost his virginity, to which I said it made me feel better I had waited until I met someone who valued it the way had, and he started crying because he had wanted it to be with me and regretted it). He’s open about still having feelings for me, but is also “trying to move on” and seeing other people.

Anyways, he’s back in town for the weekend, so we decided to meet up irl to talk. We both said we still loved each other but a relationship isn’t a good idea, and then hooked up.

Clearly, I’m not acting with my own best interests at heart and at this point am just looking to move on. Obviously I intend to stop my side of the nonsense with him, but how do I move on?

Agreed to go out for lunch at 12.15. it was 10am when we spoke about this. He went out to meet his friends to play pool until I was ready.

I messaged him at 12 to say I'm ready now but it's okay, il see you in 15/20 minutes, he replied saying ""okay""

It gets to 12.35 and he still hasn't come home, I call and he says he is leaving in 5 minutes.

It's then gets to 1pm and still no sign of him..
Call him again, he says leaving in 5 minutes..

He gets home at 1.15pm One hour after the agreed time.

So I waited a hour for him. 

I have lost count of the number of times he has done this, the worst was 3 hours.

I feel like is so disrespectful.

I'm kind of bored of being single, I rarely meet a guy i'm physically attracted to let alone on a mental level/have stuff in common with...and quite frankly I'm missing regular sex with some1 I have a connection with. *THAT* part. The last 3 years I've said to myself i'm not getting in a relationship for the sake of it (last 1 was intense), but none I've chatted to have tempted me beyond a few months...eventually I see too many turn offs/fuckboy red flags and block them. I'm sure you get the frustration of this false start cycle.

However...

An ex of mine has been dipping his toes in with me for a while now, every few months he tries to spark convo somehow, complimenting a pic/story...and then a few months ago we got talking and he starts sending me old pics of us at uni, which sparked so many memories lol (we'd both just moved south to the capital city so we kinda experienced it together both coming from the north). We've never been on bad vibes really, I actually have quite a bit of respect for him which is pretty rare for me and ex's, he's a very chilled out black guy, he looks like he would crush you but is actually a friendly giant &amp; we have the EXACT same taste in music. I really feel this one is still not over me lmfao cos he STILL has this ancient pic of me in a bath robe, that should not be still in his possession otherwise. That shit is OLD son!!!

There was never any hatred between us, I think we just met at a bad /immature time. We both met in our first year of uni (NOT a good idea) when I was tryna get over this asshole back home I was still in contact with ( I was SOOO upset over that one for MONTHS it ruined my first semester). I guess I was wanting the attention to just get over my asshole ex, but we were quite cute together. I remember one time he got a taxi 3hrs away just to visit me at home.

I think the reason I dumped him was because  there was this pretty dancer chick, that he was flirting with just b4 me (I think he had trouble choosing at first, bc he was till fresh to uni &amp; exploring his options), and some pick me trifling \*\*\*\* said she saw him sat on him in the library....so I naturally went mad and dumped him. I also remember at the time, he was a little immature, and his b.o was bad in the summer cos of him being in the gym 24/7. Basically I wasn't enthralled enough to take the risk.

But in retrospect, knowing what I know about the *pick me* girl now, I don't believe it because this girl was mad jealous of me and ending up spiting me in an unrelated incident (long story but she got in my face on a night out and was meddling with another close female friendship of mine). Obv I didn't believe his denial at the time bc you know how men are...but in retrospect now, he might of been telling the truth... because I remember the pick me saying ' I MIGHT of seen him, come to think of it'...after it all blew up. She backpeddled once I went crazy &amp; dumped him... so that's the only reason I questioned her intentions about it.

I think it only bothered me, cos this dancer girl had her eyes on him when I did but he ended up rocking with me. I remember when he first fully clocked me, I was on the underground and he was glancing at me, when he got off he went to his friends 'that girl is FIRE' &amp; he was like a typical giddy ass teenage boy lol. Anyway he tried getting me back at this boat party and I was having none of it. I was such a nonchalant bitch, I deliberately wore the tightest dress in my wardrobe and made sure everyone noticed lmaooo

HOWEVER...he has now glowed up like FUCK. He's always been mad tall and athletic (he gyms a lot&amp; is quite bulky), but now hes in suits, working some high paid finance job, has a nice car and has bought 2 properties hes renovating (he's had the updates on his insta story). Basically, he's become a man, and he has a lot going for him, pretty much the full package goin on. When I speak to him now he always says hes snowed under at work. So a lot has changed in those years. I think he had a pretty mixed chick on the go a while back but they broke up.

The only issue is his dick is massive. Its like 8/9inch...and at the time, I don't think he knew how to work with it to not hurt me, he was always paranoid. It was actually a bit problematic logistically.. but theres worse problems lmao

But yeah, basically, he keeps sniffing around me...and Its tempting, bc I've never really hated him, I just think we met at the wrong time, with me getting over an ex and him being immature in his first year of uni. But yeah I'm getting tempted cos we do have really good chemistry.

I've been a lurker of this sub for a while now and I've been reading the posts here almost every night.

I would just like to rant for a little bit if that's okay. 

I work in the hospitality industry as a receptionist. I like my job and my job duties but lately, I'm getting tired dealing with male customers. 

I will just list down a few things that happened to me recently;

A middle aged South Asian man befriended me and then proceeded to ask me personal questions about religion. (He's a Christian minister) I tried to dodge his questions and then he asked me out for dinner one night, in which I rejected. Things became really awkward after that. He tried to talk me but I will give him short answers and will only answer questions in relation to my job. 

I started wearing sleeveless tops to my workplace recently because I started to feel confident about my body. Cleaner No. 1 who rarely talks to me, started talking to me and calls me, ""Sexy girl"" and asks me questions like, ""Why do you dress so sexy?"".

Cleaner No. 2 was fine at first but now he has begun to flirt with me and he kept asking me questions again and again until I lose my calm, I don't know if he genuinely doesn't know his own job or if he's just trying to get a reaction out of me because he thinks it's funny.

Befriended an Irish man who was in his fifties and even introduced him to my friends because he's friendly and seemed like a wise man. Around two weeks later, he messaged me out of the blue saying that he's horny and he's thinking of having sex with me. Proceeded to send me a picture of his penis. And that was the last time that I talked to him. 

There were also some guys who hit on me and naive me will think that they genuinely like me for me, only to find out that they just want a quick fuck before they leave the country. I got myself burnt several times because of this. I honestly don't think that I'm giving off the signals that I'm the casual kind of girl. 

I love my job and meeting people from all over the world but I'm sick and tired of dealing with men and their toxic behaviours in general. The hardest thing is that if I wasn't working, I could be like Fuck Off to these men but these men are smart and know that I couldn't do that. So I continuously have to deal with them (and not just deal, be friendly with them too) for as long as I see them at work. 

I'm supposed to work three days these week but I already cancelled my shift tomorrow. And thank you for reading my post! I just wanted to share my experience dealing with male customers on here.",19083,I work in customer service and I'm tired from dealing with men.,0,2019-10-26 18:54:06,,

“Dear Abby,

I don’t understand why I am still single.   I am a fun, cute girl who is always up for a good time.   I don’t need to be taken on fancy dates, I am fine just chilling with a guy at his place, I am totally sexually fun and open, I don’t have any desperate need for babies and I am not in a hurry to get to the altar.   I don’t make a lot of demands on men, I am totally low maintenance and I don’t get possessive.   I have a cool city fun job and I do yoga, I am totally modern, cool, chill and don’t ask much, so why am I still single?  Why can’t I get a man to commit? 

Sincerely,

Confused Cool Girl.”

Whenever I have seen such a letter, I want to grab this woman and say:  This.  You just listed the reasons.  That’s it that’s the explanation.

Everything you said is why you are single.


Confused Cool Girl is probably not aware she is cool girling or trying hard.   She probably genuinely thinks she’s super chill and not in a rush to get to the altar, but if that were true she wouldn’t be sad about not getting commitment.

Here’s a tip:  if you are acting like you’re in no rush for your needs to be met, why would a man rush them for you?

The most important takeaway from this post is that **men *say* they want a woman who appeals to their male imperative, but they do not *respect* a women who does that at the expense of her own needs; they marry women who are not afraid to honor their own imperative**

I am not saying a woman who genuinely feels all those things and isn’t sure she wants marriage won’t be respected.   But in spite of what men say over and over, if you genuinely want marriage with a quality man,  playing it down to seem cool and because low value men have screeched about how marriage is something to run away from is just shooting yourself in the foot.

Some men do want a woman who appeals fully to his desire to get laid and stay single, and you can do that too, if you want to be a plate.

If you want marriage and family, or even if your goal is just a FWB where you get treated like a queen, **he should know this by the first date or at most after say, three meetings.**

No you shouldn’t make it personal early on like you must marry him specifically, but he should know it is your goal.

The high value men who choose marriage respect that you respect yourself, they will not if you pretend.   No matter how often men say they love a passive 100% submissive docile obedient maid and sex doll who does not need commitment.   That is not who they marry.

Insist upon your standards immediately.   If this drives a man away, congratulations, you just saved yourself months or even years of your valuable time.",19073,"If you want commitment, marriage, children, to be taken out, treated like you’re special, then you must insist upon it, and make it clear right away.

Of course, they value the connection that they have and her personality, but if you want to attract a man's attention and maintain it throughout your whole relationship, you need to put effort into looking good. When you're more conventionally attractive, you can attract men who are better-looking, richer, and nicer overall. You have more options. 

The key thing IMO is looking feminine. Here are some general tips: 

* **Dress in a feminine manner: wear skirts/dresses and heels.** The majority of men vastly prefer a woman who dresses like a woman. Dressing like this is a rarity these days, so you stand out and you make them feel more like a man. 
* **Wear makeup to enhance your looks.** Fake lashes/eyelash extensions, good eye makeup, blush, bronzer, foundation, lipstick = the whole shebang. Learn by watching Youtube tutorials. Be patient. It takes time and effort to perfect a look that works for you! 
* **This is an unpopular opinion, but lose weight and aim to look more slender.** Being slim is one of the biggest improvements you can make to increase your SMV. That's just the truth from my experience. I don't advocate disordered eating, but you can take steps to look more slim and fit. 
* **If you want to get plastic surgery (boobjob + BBL + fillers + rhino+ etc), go for it.** I've gotten some things done and they did make a difference in how I'm perceived by potential mates. Do the first 3 things though before considering surgery, unless you want to get surgery just to improve yourself. You don't need surgery to find a partner since you can date within or below your current league. But if you want to get men who have a higher SMV in terms of looks and wealth, yours needs to match or exceed theirs for them to consider you as potential relationship material. Otherwise, they're just going to use you for sex, but they won't commit. 

So ladies, do you agree that looks are the #1 thing that men look at? To what extent? What are you personal tips on how to look good?",28544,Look Hotter If You Want To Get a Boyfriend,0,2019-10-29 11:08:59,,

I don’t want his commitment yet, since he’s probably not ready for that, and therefore couldn’t invest fully in a relationship with me.

Like sure, be as manipulative as you want to have the short term fun. Free meals, sure. You can even return that coach purse or those sexy Valentino's he bought you to Nordstrom's for **cash**. The monetary value of all that BS is laughable though. I make more in two months now all grown up, than what I ""scored"" back then in my fun r/stupidslutsclub days (I'm embarrassed to say I kept a log.)

Or like sure, be as calculating as you want to find a guy that makes double/triple/quadruple what your guy next door makes. Meet a match though selective search, but don't bang him, make friends with him and his social connections (you don't want the guy that had to pay 10k+ to land a woman).  Check employee numbers, see if the guy is pre IPO or not.  Take a peek at his Mint stuff if he leaves his account open (maybe he wants you to see?)

But the kind of guy you want to land, do you want him to be dumb enough to fall for ""tips and tricks for playing men""?  The guys that you want are smart and tough enough to see through BS.  Successful men either want playthings or partners (think Melania vs Michelle, and more power to either one of those lovely ladies) what are you trying to build?

This is like, old school social climbing stuff. Maybe it's not what you're looking for, but the emphasis on generosity was low key gold digging and if that's what you're going for you're doing it wrong. Really **you don't have to lie and cheat**. Just have high standards and always come proper.

Men absolutely do commit heinous, manipulative acts against women- this is a sad truth. However, the way in which people in this sub- manipulating men to spend money on them and then leaving- serves only to stoke the flames of sexism. 

Many people on this sub appear to see the world in an entirely black and white lense, believing that all men are egotistical animals and thus women deserve to manipulate them out of their money. 

This is an extremely damaging, stunted way of viewing the world. I assume this comes from being hurt by a male sometime in the past, and is a way for women to cope. Even so, I hope everyone in this sub can eventually see that decent men do exist, and that love is not dead.

The argument that the people on here are female incels is not that this sub is full of women who can’t have sex, but that this sub is full of women who are just as emotionally inept and shallow as a male incel. This sub is in essence a vain attempt to fight fire with fire, effectively prolonging the abusive actions that come from both sides- man or woman.

As most of the new subscribers, I found this reddit when it was getting mocked. I've been a reddit lurker for years with no account but I decided to make one because I need your guy's help. No, I'm not a man pretending to be a woman as some post suggested lol and no I'm not trying to inflame. I agree with this sub 10000000% which is why I'm coming here for help.

The situation:

My friend (promise I'm asking for a friend, I'm married so all good) has been with her boyfriend for over 5 years and they live together. While I like him a lot, I think my friend can do a looooot better. They don't have combined finances and split things like household expenses, take turns paying for dinner but I've heard him nickel and dime her a few times. This is where I find the imbalance: the amount of emotional labor she gets put through compared to the financial support he provides. Hell, I'll say lack of financial support! She cooks, has to nag him to clean and do chores. She has to tell him HOW to do the chores once she's nagged enough and he decides to do them.

At the beginning of the relationship, they slept together pretty quickly. She's mentioned in passing how he's not generous in the bedroom therefore she's not too generous back. There's no engagement in the horizon....although they both talk about getting married. She doesn't have a job at the moment due to unfortunate circumstances yet she is expected to still contribute as if she still had her job AND contribute even more with house work!

I know other people's relationships are none of my business and I'm not planning on stirring shit. That's why I need help on how to advice her. What would you tell a friend that was in this situation? Telling her ""you're dating a manchild"" is out of the question.

I'm 27f and new to this subreddit, but I'm really enjoying reading through it and I think this is definitely the philosophy to dating I've been trying to adopt. When I chase a guy, despite what others encourage me to do, it NEVER ends well and I really am working on adopting the philosophy that if a guy is interested, he will pursue me.  I've been taking a dating hiatus for a while to find my own activities and work on my self esteem since I realize I've like rude, shitty men hurt me and really damage my self-esteem when I was the one who was in the right and they were just selfish assholes who were too shallow to appreciate me.  

There's this guy I've developed interest in - I'm in my last year of med school, and he's in his first year of internship (training after med school). We met during my 4 week rotation in the hospital where he works. We were on different services but had a lot of free time so he'd often come sit by me, talk to me, hang out, offer to help me with something I was learning, etc, and treated me like a colleague. He's a friendly, nice person but this was different than how he treated the other students. He then was on a different, very busy service the next two weeks I was there but he'd still stop by to chat with me, and on my last day we were in a room around a group of people but he came over and told me he'd miss me.

We didn't have each other's contact info or anything, so I figured I'd just add him on facebook a few days after I left to see if anything happened. i did that on Tuesday night. He accepted and was initiating messaging and conversation with me right away, sending me cute pictures, bringing up questions to keep the conversation going, etc. We kept talking intermittently - him initiating - through about Thursday evening, then we were just sending gifs back and forth so I stopped answering. Then he messaged me another pic on Saturday morning and we talked a little after that then I sent the last message - not requiring a reply - that was the end to that convo on Saturday morning.

I'm just getting anxious which I hate that I'm doing, so I'm going to have to get back into my usual hobbies and routine; I'll be traveling for interviews this upcoming week which will help.  But I'm just feeling kind of ehhhh since I was super hopeful when he was messaging me so much, and now I haven't really heard from him all weekend. I thought he would ask me out, but now I'm wondering if he just thinks we're friends or is nervous or lost interest or something and I have to admit I feel disappointed.  I'm planning on letting him initiate anything if he's going to, but I'm not feeling great about this. Does anyone have any advice for this situation in line with FDS philosophy? Any idea of if he's interested? Thank you!",27688,New to FDS - question about guy I'm interested in?,0,2019-10-29 01:43:17,,

I’m seeking advice on how to dismiss a guy who I had a flirtationship with. He pursued me at first but I wasn’t interested. Then once I was he’d always give mixed signals, he would normally pay more attention to me once I started ignoring him or paying more attention to other people we work with.    
  
I’ve come to realize that I do not want a relationship with him nor to pursue him anymore but I do not want him to keep thinking I want him nor think I’m just acting out because he wasn’t treating me right.

I just want to tell you the success story of my parents who have just celebrated their 33rd wedding anniversary, after being together since 16. My father worships the ground she walks on.

My mother has preached to me FDS tactics my entire life. Never have sex without commitment, never pay for shit, stay busy, etc. Me being the dumbass I was ignored her in favor of the 2019 sexual empowerment bullshit and got hurt again and again and again.

Sisters, I need help. I can't have healthy dating relationships. My sister tells me I need to work on myself more. 

I'm 27, I feel like all I do is work on myself. I have some depression/anxiety/self- esteem issues. I joined a studio (yoga/Pilates/spin), I changed my diet (not fully comfortable with my weight yet), I started journaling, I got two pets I love dearly, I practice mindfulness meditation sometimes...literally every advice out there…I'm trying to take. I went back to school (currently in grad school) to build some confidence and self-worth as I felt like I was failing professionally (although my sister thinks I never was, I’m a financial analyst at an investment firm). 

As soon as I start dating, I realize that my efforts have been futile; I get attached extremely fast and when it ends, it is pretty much a devastating situation. 

(Long story, short: I met 32M on Hinge, he “love-bombed” me at first, like couldn’t believe his luck type love-bombing, every compliment in the book, mentally and physically. However, he was recently divorced with two kids and I knew he might have issues. It was a dirty divorce and he has primary custody of 12y adopted and 1-year old biological child. 

I was aware of the baggage, I was. First date, I was still myself I didn’t care much even though I did like him. We got intimate way too fast (third date, I have a problem giving in because I want it) and then his efforts tapered off. He stopped texting much, definitely stopped calling or calling back, we got in weird ego fights and got back together often. I wanted him to communicate with me more and I told him, he just acted super busy. Finally, he stopped making an effort to see me. That was the end for me. Seeing each other was all I had because we never fought in person, everything was always perfect. He stopped making an effort to see me on the weekends, only 2 hours during a weeknight when I came over after his children were asleep. I felt like a booty call and felt like I wasn’t worth any effort or time anymore. So, when he canceled plans last Friday, I expressed my feelings that I’m upset and blocked him (He blocked me before and broke up with me over really dumb fights). idk what he ever said or responded or if he even tried to contact me... this all in a span of 2-3 months. AND I AM ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED. I unblocked him 2 days later but didn't text him although I want to text him so bad and its eating me alive that he doesn't try to contact me.)

How long do I need to consistently work on myself before it is implanted inside me that I’m worth way more than the way he's treating me? 

My sister’s advice:

""You work on yourself with the hopes of finding the perfect man. you need to work on yourself not giving a fuck about that or marriage"" This, I find impossible. It indoctrinated inside of me that I need to get married and being 27 and single feels unacceptable. (I'm from an old-fashioned religion/community/family).",27538,When are you done working on yourself and you are ready for healthy relationships? (Self-esteem issues),0,2019-10-29 01:21:20,,

Did I help my partner with cleaning his place? Did I cook, or help with some other chore? Did I sacrifice doing something I wanted to do in order to do something for or with him? Then I think about what I've gotten in return. Has he cooked for me or helped me with my cleaning? Has he done an activity with me that I wanted to do? More often than not, I've found myself putting in more than I've received. 

This is why I don't really date anymore. As a single person, all my time and energy is for me - not for an ungrateful partner. In the last three years, I've traveled to six countries by myself, learned some Japanese, formed some amazing new friendships that include activities at least once a week, learned to cook many new dishes for myself, been diagnosed with and started treating two chronic conditions, made strides at work, and learned a lot about computer science/programming. I don't think much of this would've been possible with a relationship to distract me. 

Ladies, I urge you to start checking in about what you're getting back from a man, if you're not already. Otherwise you risk years and decades of your life going down the drain as you prioritize him over yourself. Also, have your own goals for yourself and set aside some time each week to work on them without giving a thought to your partner. I guarantee that's what he's doing.",27530,Always ask what you're getting in return for your investment,0,2019-10-29 01:17:03,,

We’re both involved in a fairly niche sport and it’s a smallish community. Everyone pretty much knows everyone or at least knows *of* everyone. A few of our mutual friends had been commenting on how physically similar we were, and were shocked we hadn’t met yet. Eventually one of our friends threw a party and invited us both so we could meet. 

“Be careful hanging out with her,” said a guy (Scott) I was dating at the time, “she’s completely nuts.”

When I met her, it really was like looking in a mirror. We could have passed for fraternal twins. Despite that, we most definitely did not hit it off right away. My first thought when getting to know her was “I am *nothing* like this girl!” And I wasn’t. Being honest, I was a total pick-me-ass-bitch. I saw the way Ali treated the men she was seeing and was a bit horrified. “Won’t someone think of the poor men?!” wondered a younger, dumber me. What I didn’t realize was that she was just unapologetic in putting herself first. She refused to shrink herself or seem demure. She made her own plans first and if her date happened fit into them, so be it. When a fuckboy was acting up, she called them on it - loudly and in front of as many people as possible. Weak men absolutely *hate* all that shit. 

Those men who couldn’t handle her often confided in me after: “Your friend is psycho. You’re so chill. I don’t know why you hang out with her.” While I still thought those men were garbage, I’m ashamed to admit at the time I took that sort of comment as a compliment. I want to slap the girl that I was. Dear god - why did I care what trash men thought of me?

Despite what some guys said about her, she never had any difficulty finding men falling all over themselves to date her. That “crazy” girl was getting taken on exotic vacations, wined and dined, and bought Hermès and Cartier jewelry left, right, and center. 

Meanwhile, I was getting jack shit. I got just as much male *attention* as she did, but none of the guys who approached me actually seemed to want to treat me like a person. Ali, meanwhile, was getting flat out spoiled. I was happy for her, but it definitely stung. I was so confused as to what made men want to value her while they treated me horribly. I put every ounce of myself into dating. I was open, honest, and upfront always. Men told me how “different” I was from other women (lol) and how lucky they were to have me, how “easy” it was to be with me. I never complained when boyfriends blew off plans with me without so much as a heads up text. I never got angry when I was up late waiting. I didn’t bitch about being excluded multiple times every week so they could hang out with “the boys.” It was the same pattern with almost every single man I dated. Yet, after a few months I would always find myself buying the majority dinners, cooking everything, and cleaning up afterwards as well without so much as a thank you or even a fucking orgasm. 

One night, Ali and I went out to a club and ran into Scott, who was parked on a couch and sucking face with the clearly underaged girl on his lap. He never even saw me. Ali grabbed me by the hand, pulled me aside where no one would see me cry, and said “You know, Scott’s younger brother admitted that he’s really into you.” So the next week I fucked Scott’s more attractive, more successful, extremely well-endowed brother. 

More importantly, I promised myself I’d never be that pick-me, doormat girl ever again. Ali and I have been inseparable ever since. I owe it all to my “crazy bitch.”",27428,"A Love Letter to the ""Crazy"" Women",0,2019-10-29 01:01:51,,

Let me tell you where putting this into practice costs MORE than the actual date! 

Hair extensions: $300 + for the hair alone 
Installation costs $120 

For synthetic one time hair is about $30 but can rack up if done consistently. 

GOOD quality makeup and brushes cost $50 for foundation, liner and everything else can easily slip into $100, lets not even mention the cost PER BRUSH

These are all quarterly expenses so lets say the initial payment is $600 to be safe. 

Now, look at your wardrobe... do you want to be sexy or go in work clothes? 
Each outfit including accessories can cost $100+

Nails cost $60 for mani/ pedi, a coffin set costs $65 depending on acrylic or SNS. 

Eyelashes!!! $16 per strip, or $80 per individual installation! 


This is all cosmetic. If you want the date to go well you will need to be fully decompressed and that could mean having smoke or wine to calm you down or a meditation/ yoga class... this can cost about $40+ 


Now BEFORE the date you have spent about $X00.00 to sit in front of a man in a tee shirt. 

Do you think I'm being over the top? I've dated all star athletes and this is the bare minimum, with them. 
 




How to Never EVER Pay on a Date

Hi ladies.

This sub is in unanimous agreement that as women, we should never EVER have to pay on a date, and we should let the man take on that role. I've been dating for 4-5 years now pretty consistently, and I've had plenty of free meals and drinks since then.

# Choose the Right Target

I'm a Becky (6-7) in my early-20s and I can get guys my age (25-28) who are my looksmatch to buy me free drinks and meals pretty consistently on dates at mid-high-end places. If I want to experience fine dining (a bill that costs like $200+), I date older men (30+) because they can afford it. I can pretty much get free meals every day if I wanted to and if I schedule correctly.

You need to choose men who have a good white collar jobs or they have their own business. I typically date men in the tech or finance field. They have the income to spend money on a date compared to a man who doesn't make much.

# Be High Value

A key part to making this work is to look as good as you can. I wear a dress to all of my dates, heels, and I put on makeup. I rarely wear pants unless we do a physical activity. You need to emphasize the difference between you and your date: that you are a woman and he is a man. Wear earrings and put on a sexy perfume!

Be a good listener and a good conversationalist. Be interested in them as a person, ask questions, speak softly and in a girly voice, laugh softly, and don't interrupt them. You need to be fun to be around with so that they think that they won't ever think of making you pay the bill because they had a bad time. Even if you feel like the connection isn't there, still be nice to them and treat them well.",27214,"A huge hole in the ""never pay for a date"" theory",0,2019-10-29 00:25:03,,

I just want to get this out in the open right away, so I can prove a point. To add to this, we are now engaged! Here's some advice:

1. Don't make then man pay for everything. That's the b**** hoe mindset. My ex's (whom I really liked for about a year or so) went broke and couldn't afford to even go on walks in the park with me anymore because *surprise* he spent all his money. A great way to go is to go 50/50 on everything. And for you that didn't even pass high school and cannot divide, pay for every other date. Hell, if you pay and plan every other you might pay less. Just don't cheap out and me a little hoe who's only about money. The key is a great EXPERIENCE every time, got great AMOUNT OF MONEY spent. Wake up. You're in the 21st century.

2. Sex is great. But operate on your own beliefs. We're both Christian's, so we haven't yet. That's all the advice I have. Oh, and don't be submissive to guys at bars. Unless you want some I guess 🤷

3. Share and develop interests. My now fiancee (♥️) STILL plays video games. As of now, that habit has grown on me too. Video games are great ladies. Give them a go. He and I currently enjoy playing Destiny 2 the most. Little does he know what I got him for his birthday... Girls check this one out! --&gt; r/stadia

4. I guys the last piece of advice is more of a concept to grasp. Know that your worth isn't just monetary value, time spent is also a very valuable currency. I remember one date we just ordered a pizza and watched movies all day on the couch. It's still one of my favorites.

Take my advice under consideration. Here is my life progression. Please forgive me for the rant.

I was the female equvilant of a purple piller. Thinking that life would reward being kind and being empathetic to others experiences, especially my choosen dude would pay off.

I counseled a friend away from MGTOW and redpilling after his divorce, but I'll participate here.

I am 29. I have had corporate careers. I have moved far from home, for work, to earn a good salary. I graduated with an engineering degree from a top ten engineering school. I started on a master's degree in electrical engineering at yet another high end school, which got fucked by my ex.

So real meat. My issues first, because I have no problems being transparent. Honesty is strength.

Background: My father was a physician in a small town. So we were upper middle class to wealthy for the area. My mom, who I could write a novel about, gave up on life, got fat as fuck, and gave up her career prospects to raise his three kids after intense in vitro. She was the primary parent. He cheated on her relentlessly their entire marriage, including taking his mistress on trips when he couldn't come to our events as children such as soccer games or band concerts, and when finally she confronted him about his affair and we, those she raised or actually supported her, told her get a lawyer and leave. She tried. She hired a private investigator to track the major affair, and my dad stole her files from the investigator and the lawyer. After he threatend to kill her, she used me as an excuse to stay with him and now, she won't leave. Traditional roles, traditional values, which is really financial dependency. She was ""stealing what he earned."" Despite her stepping in to manage his failures of investments for years and trying to basically be a handy man to keep his shitty ""empire"" afloat.

Seeing that dynamic: I have never wanted to be financially dependent on a dude or a bad partner. Both of which were things she did. Realistically, both of my parents failed. Also, I heard all my life how I should be stronger than basic people, from my dad, my mom, and others. So guess my self esteem was too high... I have been fairly tough, engineering school, lower salaries than dudes at my same level, doing my own activities, until fuck boy.

Communication breakdown was a problem in their marriage, but when my dad was out partying in Vegas on ""business trips,"" for years, I think my mom deserves a degree of happiness after dealing with kids for 20+ years. She won't ever cheat. He still has a girlfriend and tells me often how much he dislikes my mom, but won't divorce her. (Half is he'd have to pay, half is both of their ""well we both had broken homes"") So MGTOW, Redpill. Vote me down. Wanna hear about how many alcholics tried to kill my grandma? I made a choice to not compromise my values, for a long time, here is what happened when I did.

My end: I went into dating, cautiously, due to context above, and open mindedly, because every girl believes in some aspect of love. I wanted a partner. I worked on myself. I was biking and running constantly. I have a 401k. A good job -- then and now. An HSA. Paid off my loans. An established friend basis which I built since I left home. I didn't date seriously until I was established financially and emotionally. I solo hike and camp alone in national parks. I had (yup, gone because of him) a job in an F500. 

A cute guy who was seemingly stable and together messaged me, in all the trash of OLD.

Smart. Good job. Cool projects. Similar interests. Similar background. Grad school instuctor, at my grad school (fuck). Getting a clearance. VP dad at my former company (fuck).

Here is what my ex actually was. 

Sign up for red flags to ignore. 

At 29, he was dating a 16 year old who was hanging around. After 5 years of dating, she grew up and left him for his friend. I heard all about it. Why? Because instead of going to therapy, my ex uses women to deal with his emotions. Also, he has never taken a processing period to reflect on a relationship. Also only a 16 year old or my retarded ass, would put up with this shit. That's okay. Learn from my mistakes.

There has been more than one after me. Run away from this behavior. If they can't be alone, fuck them. Gave him the benefit of the doubt, after all, men in engineering are awkward. (LOL)

His house was a chronic disaster despite being in his 30s. Literally had no kitchen. Fine. I thought he didnt want kids and would be a good partner -- for sex and travel. He broke up with me saying that he wanted to ""work on his house"" and because ""he wanted kids."" Okay. Call me when your kid dies in your construction zone. It's been two years. Ladies, guess the state of that house. I had no dog in the fight. I wasn't about to sign-up to me mean mommy. Also, a 30 year old should be able to figure out that he needs to change his sheets weekly.

When he gave me an STD, I should have walked. But my friend said, ""at least he told you."" No, he should have managed his sexual health, like I do as an adult.

Shit got real when I asked to meet his friends, after six months of dating, when he had met most of my social crew, ""you have too many expectations.""

Come to find, he was banging married women on his lunch break while dating me. But its okay, ""he just doesn't like talking on the phone."" He had secret accounts for this.

I prioritized him. I put him first thinking that maybe listening and loving was what he needed. He certainly fucked me like he needed me initially, then once his needs were met, he was back to staring at my roomates and never texting me. Critisizing me for not orgasming relentlessly. ""I can't date someone who doesn't cum every time."" No amount of reassurances, fixed this ego problem, yet he couldn't have sex without his shirt on due to body confidence issues. Grow up. Late 20s/30s sex isn't always glamorous.

During the six months we were dating, I underwent a job change. I took on two high level grad school classes, and I continued to live with 3 roommates in a house undergoing renovations. Far from home, far from friends, far from any ""given"" support structure.  Yet he had friends and family, in this state that he was from, that he saw weekly. I never had a study space, despite him owning his own house -- libraries, conference rooms, etc. Everything he offered was out of reluclance and not love, but I always put him first. 

When his cat died, or he wanted to go on a date or he needed to get over his ex, where was I? Yup, offering love, time, understanding and affection. Classical female traits. Undervalued. At the expense of myself.

I drove down to see him constantly. He learned he didn't have to work for my attention. Fuck that.

Asking to meet his friends was apparently too much. Despite the stability and love I offerred, in my realm of instability, it was too much apparently.

Prioritizing him cost me: my grad school, my job, my fitness, my sanity and my car at the end of the day.  So guess what he lost, and guess how fast he had another chick in bed.

Two years of personal progression, out of years of depression in my 20s, were destroyed by someone who sent messages like ""wow it's really healthy that you don't text me all the time."" I was busy and wanted someone activity driven and happy on dates. 

Because his ex was ""too clingy."" Yeah, she was 16. Never, be the cool chick, because he was using me 100% of the time. And his ex was ""crazy."" How fun it was to watch him literally run away from me when I told him I knew he was banging a married girl.

When I stood up against him and told his ex to get STD tested, I was the bad guy, for telling her and damaging his manipulative factor. (He was seeing her behind my back after a certain point too). Honesty ruins fuck boys. Talking to her (because he deliberatively hid me from his social circle) was hilarious to watch. Apparently, I shouldn't tell another girl, hey our mutal ex gave me Chlamydia, and you should get tested. I'm stalking him for having independent conversations. When he couldn't control what I did, he followed me around our grad school to intimate me. Enjoy your ethics compliant. (Though I still haven't been comfortable going back).

Learn from my mistakes. 1.5 years later I am still recovering from a fuck boy who looked good on paper and started out sweet. He did the occasional present. He gave alright head. He earned equal money. This is the bare minimum that a 30 something fuck boy learns. 

But he fucked my life in ways that will take years to recover. Think that when he couldnt send a basic text to tell me his weekend plans with his friends, would he chill with his progeny.

Don't ignore flags. Don't forget your worth. Put yourself and your finances first. I fucked up when I went back and didn't stick out leaving like I should have when I realized it wasn't mutual. 6 months with an asshole ruined my life for years. Dick is abundant. Get your paper and personal development first.

Writing from my recovery zone. In my own rental. In a new awesome job. In a good city sadly not 15 states away.

Then i met this guy through a dating app. He talked a bit too much about himself is what I firstly noticed, then how he was quick to rush the intimacy and us kissing and doing all these gestures when we first met and talked a bit. He did say before meeting that he is not looking for anything serious in the new few years and I went with it thinking if it's meant to be it will be.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been going crazy over him for months. Gave him space, tried not to message him too much, he was always busy etc. Would take hours to respond to a message, then it got to days. He would usually message me cute good night messages or good morning ones, wishing me a good day and so on. Would occasionally call me like once a week while he was doing grocery shopping. I would call him to my place once every two weeks because he was the type to treat 'the people he sees' as he was 'their boyfriend' and I quickly got addicted to the feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

I would go through phases of tried not to care. Then when I finally felt free I would see a message or he would call me, like he could sense when I stopped thinking about him. Then I would go back to crushing on him and feeling so let down when he would take long to respond. He would be even less active on the days after we've seen each other.

Our meetings involved passionate stuff, also all of the things a couple would do, hand holding, kissing for a long time, spending the night, breakfast together, hand holding while walking outside.

I finally confessed after two months, he said he doesn't believe in relationships and I should not wait for him, and that he likes me and really cares about me. But I can see from everything he does that he doesn't care enough, not like me. I can see it in the way he looks at me, not lovingly, neutral. Or just the way he doesn't laugh sometimes when I joke. How he never said he misses me, or never called me on a date. I asked him once if he wanted to go take a walk and he said he was busy. I sent him two risky messages in the past two weeks and each time he hurried to see each other and talk about the issue.

The one time we went on a 'date' was to discuss my risky message that was mentioning how I want this vague thing to end..

I told him  my ex came back and regrets leaving me, and that I will give him a chance. But the one I want is him.

He has told me He think we have high compatibility for something more in a future, but he thinks he can still find someone better for him, so he still wants to date. Confirmed he is seeing other people.

It hurts I have to accept he doesn't really care because he never asks me about my day (only on rare occasions), or about myself, never calls just to say hi, likes talking about himself.

Now, I don't want to block him. I want to stay friends at least, because I felt like we had a connection and would be ok as friends once my infatuation fades out. But I will never be able to get over this if I don't stop seeing him (I don't want it to stop..) I know I am being foolish and he probably doesn't care. I haven't been that focused on my life recently because of constantly being sad, I feel it got toxic for me. I know I was stupid, still am, but I fell in love and I am patient and it backfired, now I just want to stop feeling like this for him so I can get on with my own life.

You should look at these men with scepticism. Sure, sometimes they might be telling the truth, but more often this isn't the case.

Genuine men won't attempt to hide their opinions. Honestly, it should be a massive red flag if a potential partner has never disagreed with you on anything political. It's normal for people, even of similar opinions, to disagree sometimes. Dating isn't an exception. I think men will automatically hide their opinions because they want to present themselves as perfect. Their opinions are the easiest thing to hide.

Sure, if their opinions include shit like ""women belong in the kitchen"", or anything else that would obviously make them incompatible, then you should stay the fuck away. But if you disagree on trans issues or something, for example, and you aren't getting in fights about it, then you know he's not scared to reveal details about himself that you might not like.

I have several amazing, beautiful, funny, intelligent friends who are settling for, and I mean this sincerely, hot trash garbage men. They're non-committal, time wasting, useless, boring, unattractive scumbags, and I'm SO FUCKING SICK OF IT. 

Take my one friend T., for example. She's amazing. She's been with this guy for two years, and he has never, not for one fucking day, taken her or their relationship seriously. She's early 30's, he's mid 40's. He has an extremely demanding career that takes him out of the country, but when he IS in town he's putting his family, his sports, his hobbies, literally ANYTHING ahead of her. He cancels plans last minute, leaves her hanging for social events that she plans months in advance, like I'm truly baffled at why this successful and strong woman is dealing with this trifling trash. But she also makes a million and a half excuses for him. ""he's going through a lot right now"" (he has been since day 1!), ""he needs to put his career first"" (you're not even 5th in his list of priorities!), ""he will take our relationship more seriously when thing settle down"" (they will NEVER settle down). She is wasting her pretty years on someone who will never care, and she refuses to hear it. 

Ladies, STOP MAKING FUCKING EXCUSES FOR THESE MEN! Fucking LISTEN:

* It doesn't MATTER if he's been ""hurt before"", HE needs to take responsibility for his hurts and traumas, just like we do. WE don't go around blaming every man for our hurts/rapes/abuses/generational abuse. If he's not going to improve for himself, he won't do it for you. DON'T MAKE EXCUSES FOR HIS TRAUMAS. 
* If he's not putting your relationship as a priority, he doesn't want to be with you. Period. Full stop. Men work for what they don't want to lose, and if you make yourself incredibly available, he won't give a fuck how you feel because he knows he can breadcrumb you and keep you on the line. DON'T MAKE EXCUSES FOR HIS LACK OF EFFORT.
* If he cannot seem to get his shit together, he's lazy or stupid or both. I don't give a fuck what you think his potential is, or how great he could be if he applied himself. Potential without action is fucking nothing. If he wastes his money on video games and weed, lives with his parents, or does hood rat shit with his friends instead of securing a good future for himself, FUCKING DROP HIM. HE IS NOT AN ADULT WORTH PURSUING.
* If he doesn't maintain regular communication with you, fucking drop him. Don't wait around for him to be communicative because if he liked you, he wouldn't be able to get enough of you. Don't try and convince him to be more attentive, don't tell him you ""need more"". He knows, he just doesn't fucking care. 
* Stop condescending these fucking hoe men and acting as if they just need a little of your TLC to become better. No, they need to work harder. They need to stop being fucking babies and take responsibility for their lives. You are not his mommy, you are not his therapist. Don't take on his emotional labor just because you think he's a poor widdle ickle sweetie boy. Fucking drop him. Find a man who is working on himself. You will never change someone who isn't willing to do the work for themselves.

I worked so damn hard for a whole year to improve my fitness, appearance, personality, career. I honestly had so much going for me and I was at the top of my game / world.  I was so happy and nothing in the world could destroy me.  If some inconveniences happened, I'd know to forgive and let go.  I was a really really happy person. 

\--- 

Long story short, I met this guy, and tbh I many levels above him.  The only reason I agreed to go out with him is because we had a few mutual friends and I just wanted to make a friend since it seemed like we had common interests.  I really didn't see him as a potential at all - he was completely **not** my type. 

Looking back, he had used EVERY. SINGLE. NEGGING. TACTIC. in the book to bring me down, destroy myself esteem, make me feel like I had to win HIS affection.  He'd find every single opportunity when we'd speak to absolutely belittle me and my accomplishments. I think his toxic philosophies spread like a disease because I now realized that the other males in ""our circle"" would do similar things to me. 

\---

Overtime, I started to feel really disturbed hanging out in a group with them - and honestly I didn't even know why! All I knew was that I started to withdraw from them after a while.  I now realize that every time we hung out, they'd knock down the self-esteem I worked so hard to build little by little, and constantly made me feel inadequate.

It's so fucking asinine yet 99.57% of us YEARN for men in our lives to play the bEsT fRiEnD role, as if any one of us can't count the amount of emotionally intelligent men we've **ever** met on one hand. 

I can buy that some of the men in our lives can give great objective advice, and are decent at problem solving, but what in God's dying universe drives so many of us to word vomit our deepest darkest secrets to them?

I'm thinking some of us who are the most guilty of this haven't talked to enough guys to know most of them don't even know their own best friend's birthday or mom's name. Men barely connect to **each other** on levels that aren't superficial. Please stop deluding yourselves with the fumes of hopeless romanticism and believing that ""love"" with men means ""knowing every little detail about one another"". 

My argument is exhaustive of almost all information that caused you trauma, or simply, does not add any value to your profile as an eligible bachelorette. If you're not comfortable with blatant lying, then cool whatever, ride your moral horse all the way to heaven. But *volunteering* unsavory sensitive information about yourself is some of the dumbest fucking shit I see women do all of the time, and even on this thread, it's validated by other women with responses like ""if he didn;t love you more after finding out you were trained by the football team at 16, he doesn't deserve you!""

Also, hard pill coming at you: there's a reason why you and every woman you know rarely picks up on just *how much* a guy sucks until wayyyyy later in the game...men don't get off on telling women everything about themselves!!

Anywho, here's a quick starter on things to shut up about starting yesterday:

* Stop telling them about your sexual pasts:
   * They will judge you. All of them.
   * No seriously...No man asks about this to make casual dinner conversation. They are asking about this information *precisely* to make a sweeping moral judgement about you...and assuming you have a body count north of 3, that judgment will **always** be negative.
* Save for brothers and dads, stop telling them about your dating woes: 
   * People are pack animals. As such, Men subconsciously value the opinion and perspective of men, which means the other side is that they subconsciously devalue or undervalue the perspective of women. That is to say: telling men that you've been mistreated by other men almost always makes *you* look bad. Naive or not, men believe the best of the female race are worshiped by other men...so please believe they've almost immediately decided you're less valuable once they hear you ""let"" an ex cheat on you a bunch of times. 
* Stop spilling your life's secrets and childhood traumas to complete fucking strangers on first and second dates. 
   * I mean...duh?
   * But also, ask yourself why the entire fuck you even do this? What tells you that when a guy hears you shuffled between foster homes as a kid, his first thought is ""mmmm yes, attractive. wife material. love her so much more now...""? What are you looking for, understanding? A quick therapy session?

The painful truth is that vulnerability on your end does next to nothing to foster a man's attachment to you...but it does tend to speed up how fast you get attached to men, which is one of the chief reasons to **stop** it, immediately. 

Don't forget: women are the social glue of almost all societies. Been to a great party lately? A woman probably planned it. Received a thoughtful birthday card from a couple (aunt/uncle, mom/dad, family friends) in your life? The woman arranged it and wrote the note. **Stop projecting your social nature onto men.** They can love you and care for you and respect you just fine while knowing only the most pertinent (and most impressive) information about you. This reality is completely amoral; Men aren't terrible for being about the worst possible choice of someone to spill your heart to. But, they are, and always will be, men.",29179,Why do we tell men way too much information about ourselves?

Thank you for this Sub. I was so bothered to read this stuff on here at first. I never understood the revulsion women had to TRP and now I do. And now this sub doesn't bother me. 

I was the guy you complain about. The one who manipulated and gaslighted and did whatever it took to keep you around. It made me feel safe; like you wouldn't leave me. Like you would be who I wanted you to be. 

I didn't even know I was doing it until one day my world broke due to my dickery and douchbaggary. She became herself again. She left to return home to her family across state lines. And I lost the love of a very lovely, loving person. I didn't deserve her love. She didn't deserve the way I treated her.

The red flags you talk about are real. The manipulative behaviors by whatever guys like me are are real. The mechanisms by which they work are real.

I am working on purging that shit from my soul. I hope it works, because fear of abandonment, narcissistic solipsism, and anxiety manifested in anger and control seeking are not a way of having a fulfilling relationship. And they certainly are not your burden to deal with.

I hope you find what you are looking for. I hope you don't ever meet a guy like me again, and if you do, I hope you run as soon as you see those redflags.",29036,Thank you for your wisdom. I am sorry.,0,2019-10-29 18:17:12,,

Today is the start of Domestic Violence Awareness month, by the way. very apt.

**the  most dangerous time for a woman is when you're breaking up with a man  (or just broke up w/ one). do not get in a car with someone you are  dumping. DO NOT.** speaking from personal experience.  My ex tried to pull a vanilla sky and drive off a MFing bridge with me in the car.

(for those of you too young to remember the movie Vanilla Sky.  this is for reference. just imagine that the gender roles are reversed and its some dude talking about how you owe him sex/a relationship.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xohWvO9i4c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xohWvO9i4c) )

**DO  NOT GET IN A CAR WITH A MAN YOU DO NOT TRUST. PERIOD. EVER!!!!!!!! call  an uber. call a friend, or just freaking walk. take  a bus.**

**edit:if  he has ever given  you the slightest reason not to trust him, or your  instincts are telling you no. GO WITH YOUR INSTINCT&gt; ALWAYS**

better  yet, **DO NOT BREAK UP WITH HIM IN PERSON**.  breaking up in text is JUST  FUCKING FINE ignore anyone who says otherwise. (its men who say this)  you should first get away from said man.

its better to break up with someone in text than be in a coffin.

you don't owe this man sh\*t. you don't owe anyone closure or an explanation.

ohhh. and guess what my ex used to do before he got abusive. he would take my phone so i couldn't call for help.  if a man ever takes your phone that is one of the biggest red flags.

have  you ever watched any episode of 'forensic files'   SPOILER: its almost  always the husband/boyfriend/exboyfriendwhatever.  anyone with anger  issues should never be trusted. men see us as objects or 'their  property' they don't see us as humans.

abusive  men fly under the radar all the time. they can hide for years. on every  damned true crime show the neighbors are always like ""ohhhh he seemed  so normal. we never would have guessed he could do something like this""

watch the movie ""american murder: the family next door"" on netflix for a hard lesson in how these type of people can hide.

# Do not let a man you barely know pick you up for a date.  beware of one who pressures you to let him pick you up.

he is not doing this to be 'cute and old fashioned' he is doing this for two reasons. a.) so he can Know where you live, and b.) so you are basically a captive audience and can't leave until he drives you home. (or you call an uber)

always have uber money. always arrive separately when you are first meeting a man, and if you're going to talk to many men while vetting/dating/getting to know them,  I would suggest using a VOIP number instead of your real number.  men can get your address easily even if you don't give it to them, with just your phone number or even your full name.

BE AWARE OF YOUR PERSONAL SAFETY. don't assume positive intentions. and always tell a friend where you are going. and when you are leaving to go home.

when I was  younger and single and meeting someone I didn't know very well, I would have a close friend on standby who knew the details of who i was meeting, where i was going, and what time I was supposed to leave. I would text them a picture of the person and their phone number for safe keeping.

if you are in a place where you can't call the police because a man will hear you. you can TEXT 911

I also highly recommend getting a personal panic button (and I am in no way affiliated with this company, i just think the product is a great idea and women need this.)

there is one called an invisawear smart jewelry, which looks like a cute necklace/bracelet , or a fitness bracelet or even a scrunchie and if you push it it sends your GPS location to 5 people that you have chosen. [https://www.invisawear.com/](https://www.invisawear.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

I highly suggest reading the book ""The Gift of Fear"" at the very minimum.

also ""why does he do that"" by Lundy Bancroft.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention.. when you get in a car with a man as a driver. you are literally putting your life in this mans hands. doubly so for a motorbike. i would never ride on a motorcycle trusting some dude with my life.  most men are extremely shitty and aggressive drivers, and they've probably been in more car accidents than you.  ASK THEM how many accidents/speeding tickets they've had. (lol this is actually public information and you can look it up without asking.)

its a good indicator of how 'safe' they are as a person. a litmus test for how much of a shitty risk taker they are.

actually my litmus test for keeping a man used to be whether or not their driving scared me. If i felt unsafe, i would delete their number.",101457,Do not get in a car with a man you are fighting with/breaking up with. PSA,0,,,

They are cleaning up after him, booking moving trucks for him, buying him very expensive gifts that they wouldn't even buy for themselves, ditching family and friends for him, not travelling without him (pre-covid), not temporarily living abroad for him, not pursuing a degree elsewhere for him, moving in with him, getting a pet with him, having a baby with him... And then he leaves and she's left feeling like a fool, like he played her and sold her a promise that he never kept.

Stop giving wifey benefits when he's just a boyfriend. Stop saying that marriage is just a piece of paper. These men know it isn't, even when they say things like how, ""oh we're basically married anyway"", or ""marriage is just a piece of paper"". If marriage is just a piece of paper, why have we fought so hard to give gay people the right to marriage? If marriage is just a piece of paper, why are there different laws (obviously this depends on where you live) for married couples? If marriage is just a piece of paper, why won't he just get married then? Since it's just a piece of paper, might as well get married and get the real, tangible, legal benefits that come with it. People are talking about acting super progressive by playing house, when in reality, you're doing exactly what married couples do except you don't have the legal protection that comes with marriage. And on top of that, a lot of women will go 50/50 with their ""partner"", but if they break up, there are no laws ensuring a fair divide of assets (whereas in marriage, there is).

I have this friend who has been ""engaged"" for years to a man with whom she has two kids and a mortgage with. She keeps wanting to get married, but he's been putting if off for years. There were financial reasons not to, and now that there's COVID, it's the perfect time to have a super low-key, intimate, very cheap wedding, but he still doesn't want to get married. My friend's dad made a comment about being an in-law to her fiancé, and the fiancé said: nope you're not my dad yet, we're not married yet remember... My friend did not look happy with that comment.

And people also recognize the huge difference between being married and just being bf/gf. A married couple's relationship is taken more seriously because this couple made a public, legal declaration of their forever commitment to each other. When you're dating, you haven't made this public declaration.   And yes, marriage feels different then just dating. I've asked my friends who were dating for 7,8 years and they said that their relationship feels really different because marriage means that it's final, that it's forever. I moved in with my boyfriend a few weeks before he proposed (my situation was a little different, as I just came back from abroad and had nowhere to live. My now-husband had asked for my parents' blessing to propose before I went abroad, with the intention of proposing once I returned -- which he did!). When we got married, our relationship definitely feels different too. I know what my friends mean now, because him and I made a public promise in front of our friends, family and the law that we will love each over forever. And it sounds a lot more serious saying my ""husband"" rather than my ""boyfriend"" (remember the John Mulaney special lol).

Ladies, don't treat your boyfriend like he's your husband. It's not that serious yet. That's why people are so heartbroken when they break up. They give everything to their bf/gf, and really get nothing to show for it once the relationship ends. I will never forget my aunt's words to me when I was ranting to her about my boyfriend when I was 19. She said: you're only 19 and you're not even married! What are you two fighting about? If there's no ring, don't treat him like he's your husband.

Words and promises don't mean anything. My ex told me that I was the woman of his dreams, that he was going to marry me some day, have kids, and all that jazz. Where is he now? He's my ex. I dated another guy who I met abroad. He told me he would move to my country for me after he graduated university. Where is he now? He cheated on me and he's my ex. Women are giving away so much to their boyfriends, and saying that he promises that he'll buy the ring when he graduates, that he'll propose once he has this job, that they'll get married once they buy a house... These promises mean nothing ladies. They are just words and nothing else.

If he wanted to, he would have. My husband and I are recent graduates, still paying off student debt, so obviously we don't have a lot of money. So many men use money as an excuse not to marry... My husband and I had a low-key backyard wedding with immediate family only, Chinese takeout, ice cream cake, and grocery store flowers. There are literally no excuses for him not to marry, except that he simply does not want to.",101454,"Ladies, don't treat your boyfriend like he's your husband",1,,,

If you were to marry a HVM, and you had previously been a hardcore career woman/workhorse, if the man wanted to be a provider and offered that you wouldn't have to work (and that you wouldn't have to be a maidslave, i.e. he would pay someone to come in and clean, would do takeout a lot and rotate on cooking/laundry), what would you do?

I believe I would personally like to still be a career woman, although it is tempting to let him just provide, but I feel like I would feel helpless if I only had an exit strategy alone with no career. How would you navigate being a career woman, while also tapping into the feminine receiver energy, ensuring you start off marriage on a good foot?

Thank you for the discussion! I sometimes feel like this sub is split between believers of being feminine receivers, and those that are career woman and have been used and abused from their former 50/50 relationships and want the men to step up more.

There is something very odd about the prostitution debate. While the absolute majority of sex buyers are male, an overwhelming majority of intellectuals defending prostitution are women. It’s a strange phenomenon that most definitely needs its own analysis.

The john should, in theory, have every reason to worry right now. He is, for the first time, at the center of discussion. Legislators are increasingly targeting the sex buyer, or “demand” as NGOs call it. The Nordic model has been praised by the EU parliament as the most efficient legislation to curb trafficking, and the survivors’ movement is growing all around the world. Women are speaking out, as in the recently published book, Prostitution Narratives: Stories of Survival in the Sex Trade, about what johns really do to them. It is the first time in history that so many women are collectively revealing what goes on in the world of prostitution — a world where a man, up until now, could do almost anything with a woman and no one would find out. Those times are over — the sex buyer is becoming visible. Tension is mounting. Have we reached the point in history where a man actually has to be liked by a woman in order to get inside her pants?

Despite all this, the john remains, for the most part, silent. He does not need to speak. As always, when a man is threatened, a woman comes along to help him out. At the forefront of international “sex work” discourse, we generally do not find a sex buyer, but a female academic. In any magazine, at any conference, at any event where the john is to be even remotely criticized — a pro-prostitution female academic is there to defend him.

Who is she? Well, she calls herself “subversive,” “revolutionary,” even “feminist.” That is exactly why the john needs her as his ambassador. A defence of prostitution coming from this woman makes prostitution look queer, LGBT-friendly, modern, fair trade, socialist — the very epitome of female liberation. But most importantly, when she speaks, we forget that the sex buyer exists.

The tacit agreement between the john and the pro-prostitution female academic is that she will do anything to defend his acts, while ensuring that he stays in the shadows. She will speak incessantly about prostitution, but never mention him. Her task is to make sure prostitution seems like an all-female affair. The queer academic will use the prostituted woman as a shield, blocking the john from the limelight. She will use the prostituted woman any way she can — analyzing her, re- and deconstructing her, holding her up as a role model, and using her as a microphone (i.e. a career booster), thereby positioning her as “good” vs. the “evil” feminist.",101442,The modern John got himself a queer nanny,0,,,

He ignored her randomly (he once went three days without texting her), gaslights her about it and repeats the cycle. She’s confided in my and a mutual male friend about the situation, and after we’ve told her what we think (dump him!) she always ends with “I don’t know what to do”. The thing is, she absolutely does know what to do. She just doesn’t want to do it.

We have been conditioned somewhat to believe that every choice we make will feel good. This mentality is partly what keeps women in bad relationships. We know that the relationship is bad, but we rationalise staying because the thought of leaving seems worse. End a relationship and severing a connection rarely feels good, even if it was with a LVM. Our brain starts to bond and release feel-good hormones when we are round them. However, just because we feel bad making a particular decision that does not mean it was the wrong decision. And even more poignant is the fact that just because we don’t like a particular choice, or a choice would be hard to follow through with, that does not mean we don’t have a choice. There is sometimes comfort in the discomfort. We have to be strong enough to withstand short term pain for long term gain.",101412,"Just because a decision doesn’t feel good, that doesn’t mean it’s not the right one.

I’ve always felt I was pretty, smart etc. But recently life threw  some things at me that really made me question if I was loving myself as much as I *could* and being as absolutely confident as I could. I came to the realization I really had *not* come into self-love and self-respect fully yet. Here’s what I learned about the two: 

 

It’s a matter of priorities and it starts with valuing what you think, what you feel, your hobbies, your viewpoints. Sure you feel like you love yourself. But do your priorities reflect that? Let’s look at a few areas and think where you place yourself in the list of priorities on each: 

 

PART I 

1.What You Think/ Your Viewpoints/ Your Opinions 

As a reserved person I would often think of things to say and then determine- Nah, that really doesn’t need to come out. I thought doing that was just my personality, a reflection of my tendency toward quietness. But now I realize I hadn’t been valuing what I have to say as highly as I should. There were situations where I chose not to correct men who were wrong in convo, just because I didn’t feel it was absolutely necessary. This allowed them to dominate the convo even on topics they didn’t know and really amounted to my tacitly placing/ or allowing their opinions to be placed over my own as if they were of greater value. They often came out of those exchanges feeling it was a tacit admission that their opinions were better than mine or meant more than mine. And that I valued them (men) over me and had low self-esteem. 

Do you think a person who loves themselves thinks what they think- their opinions, their viewpoints etc. matter enough to be heard? People who *truly* love themselves speak up and make their viewpoints heard because they consider what they have to say a priority and that’s a reflection of their general high feelings about and the high value they place on themselves. I had unwittingly and discreetly been placing/ valuing my opinions and viewpoints under others especially men. 

Real self-love and self-respect also involves that you disengage from anyone who tries to invalidate your viewpoints, opinions, choices etc. I would never put up with anyone abusive but realize I did sometimes put up with male acquaintances who played devil’s advocate with my viewpoints or tried to get me to see they “weren’t important”. Those convos should’ve been shut down with “This is who I am. This is what I believe and I’m not gonna argue with anyone about it. It’s not up for discussion. You’re entitled to think what you think but you’re not going to change my opinion”. Do you put up with people who talk over you, conceding and cosigning through actions that you agree what you had to say wasn’t that important anyway OR do you speak up even harder?

2.Your Hobbies/ Day to Day Things 

If a male or female friends calls you, invites you out, do you automatically drop what you’re doing. Sure you’d planned to study, shop, wash dishes but it’s not that important. It’s whatever. You can talk! This reflects a generally low view of YOUR things. You’re immediately assuming what that friend waltzes up to you with is more important than your stuff instead of valuing and respecting your things and placing them on high. I don’t care if all you were doing is making the bed. It’s YOUR things and you should hold to and respect it. Count it as meaningful and important. 

 

3.Your Feelings

Do you try to tough out situations that feel bad for you. This reflects low respect/ value on your own feelings. Most woman do not value their own feelings enough to put them first even in situations that make them feel like shit. We submit to feeling bad because at the bottom of it all we think we should. We don’t think how we feel is worth enough to act on or overturn a situation for, if it’s in opposition to others’ feelings. We put it on the bottom under everyone else’s comfort and feelings. If you stay in situations that make you feel subtly bad. You don’t value how you feel enough. 

 

PART II 

So true self-love means holding your thoughts, your feelings, your hobbies sacrosanct. But let’s look at another point. How do you protect yourself? How do you defend your time, your space, your dignity, self-confidence and self-esteem. What does your grade of defense reveal about how much you truly value yourself? 

1.Time. I would sometimes allow out of niceness people to take up too much of my time talking on the job. Oh, she’s old. Let me not stop her. I’m not a pushover but subtly I wasn’t loving myself enough to protect my time. Instead I was minimizing the work I had to do as not that important and my time as not important enough to set boundaries in situations with people who tried to claim too much of it unintentionally or otherwise. Do you stay in dead-end relationships or dead-end jobs that waste your time. That betrays a lack of faith both in the value of your time and your love of self. You don’t love yourself enough to believe in your ability to acquire better and that you deserve it. And you don’t think your time is worth enough to protect by bouncing. 

2.Space/ Health. If a man is right up under you as he speaks to you, do you protect yourself by telling him he’s in your personal space and you don’t care to have someone standing so close? If someone is approaching at a gas station in a way is threatening do you tell them to take a step back and stay over there or do you silently manage down your discomfort even at possible physical risk to self. Do you love yourself so much you’re not taking any chances of harm to self. If you’re with someone who doesn’t want to wear a Corona mask or a condom, do you proudly tell them to strap up or you’re out. Or do you sit through the discomfort because you don’t value yourself and your feelings enough to speak up and ace out and you privately value/put protecting them from social discomfort OVER protecting your own health and body from physical harm.  

3.Self-Confidence, Self-Esteem, Self-Respect, Dignity. Do you sometimes allow people to get away with taking little jabs meant to diminish your belief in self in conversation. Could be as subtle as someone suggesting you can’t do something you plan to do. That you’re not as pretty or smart as you think or pointing out a “flaw”. Part of self love is learning to identify when something is attacking or diminishing your self worth, confidence, esteem in self and holding those things sacrosanct, moving in a way that actively protects and upholds the value you place on them. Doesn’t matter whether the person *meant* to hurt you or has trauma/ stuff to work out themselves. If something diminishes your respect for/ confidence in yourself even *one* iota, you cut it out or correct that person. Because you love yourself so much you’re not dealing with anyone or anything that diminishes even slightly your self-respect, confidence or self-esteem. You don’t put up with people sowing seeds of doubt in you. And you would never value the social game of not hurting their feelings over protecting how you feel about and see yourself. 

Do you protect your dignity by shutting down people who make slurs about your weight, mental health, intelligence, looks. Do you make clear you do not accept foul language, name calling, a raised voice, swear words, dismissive body language (hand wave, rolled eyes, turned back) directed at you. Or do you downgrade/ diminish your own dignity and communicate you don’t value yourself that much by staying silent when met with those things. 

 

CONCLUSION 

I hope this has been helpful. A good question to constantly ask is- What would I do if I truly loved myself. How would I act if I were moving from a place of perfect self-love. It helps you to see what actions are actually a betrayal of self even when they’re masquerading “just your personality” or “just going along to get-along”/ doing what you have to do to keep the peace or be socially polite. This is important because one of the first things men test in dating you is your confidence in self. Can they push you to do something you don’t want? How to do respond to subtle negs or criticisms about how you look. They all try to see how easy you are to manipulate based on your responses to those things. When that test comes, you want that Self-Esteem to be rock hard. 

If you’re having trouble leveling up your actions to truly reflect your level of self-respect and self-love know that just like anything else in life it is a muscle that can be trained. Just like a weak person can grow strong in a gym, through constant exercise of self-respect you can grow strong in it. Start small. Send back that entrée that isn’t exactly what you ordered. Tell that person who cuts you in the supermarket line you were standing there. 

Self-love is mastery, self-respect is power.

To me it seems men end relationships or end things with a woman they are dating for vastly different reasons than women. 

When hearing/reading about women's reasons it's almost always something to do with their partners/dates not being able to communicate, going silent, being abusive/putting them down. Other reasons can be a partner's lack of ambition, lives not moving in the same direction etc. And the worst one of all, when he cheats on them.

When reading about reasons men end things, it's often to do with themselves and not the woman they are seeing. They leave because they think they can do better, because she hurt his ego in some way, he decides he still wants to date other people, he thinks a relationship will just hold him back (the old ball and chain crap).

So I'm starting to get the idea that women often end relationships for reasons that have to do with their partners not being able to give them what they need, while men end things because of more selfish/egotistical reasons.

I’m 24 years old and there is this older rich man I was introduced to, and I’m soooo turned on by his manliness and demeanour to another level. It’s like my brain goes to mush. He’s basically the forever bachelor type, only want to have sex type but I can’t help being so drawn to him. He commands so much power, and it’s not like I’m on this whole liberation hype. I have only ever kissed/made out with one other guy who I was in a relationship with. So I went on a date with him a few days ago and he dropped me home. And we ended up kissing and making out. I didn’t let him see or touch my intimate areas, but he kept trying to move my hand to his crotch outside his clothes. I told him I was a virgin but he kept saying how much he wanted me, etc etc. He also called me a tease for not ‘releasing’ him as I didn’t touch his dick. 

Urgh but I have to see him a lot as he’s family friends with my best friend and attends a lot of family events that she does. Like I will have to see him for around 5 times in the next year probably. I’m quite embarrassed I behaved like that, like I kept going in for kisses, I think I was really turned on by him and horny I’ll be honest 😭😭. How to I redeem myself, there’s no way I can block him etc as my best friend would be livid as he is helping her/her family with important business. And it’s not like he did anything wrong it was completely consensual and he didn’t force me to do anything. Also a part of me keeps replaying the make out session in my head, it felt so much better than it ever did with my boyfriend. What do I do, part of me knows if I see him again things will escalate. Also I know he won’t tell my friend what happened between us but I want to get my value back. I’m planning to just not speak to him and limit contact.

He has body shamed me and said the most horrible hurtful things when we argue. He broke up with me multiple times and then comes back claiming he didn't say or do all the things that he said and did.  He tried to isolate me from my friends and always tell me things like ""no guy will ever spend this much money on you   All other men are bad. You'll never find anyone like me.  No man will ever love you as much as I do."" It's been ripping my confidence to shreds. But I refuse to believe that I'm unlovable. I refuse to believe that every man is horrible and will treat me terribly. I realise that I  need a year or two alone to heal from this trauma, but I know I'm worthy of love and that there are HVM who would treat me wonderfully. 

I 've been putting it off breaking up up him because he's threatened to find out information about one of my good male friends and have people follow him, etc because of jealousy issues. This male friend is like a brother to me. I've called my friend and told him about the situation. This guy does have the wealth and contacts to do all the things that he's threatened to do. This is only one of the many things he's threated to do to the people I love an care about. 

I'm terrified. For my love ones more than myself. But I'm sticking to my decision to break things off with him.  In the past when I block him or don't answer his calls after he's brokem up with me, he uses different numbers to call me constantly and blow up my phone and waits outside my workplace  or apartmentfor for  hours and hours untill install to him. I always get terrified when I see him sitting outside by my car at work. I don't know if calling the cops is an option as his lawyer bribed the cops to get him out of a DUI. He has the wealth to get away with a lot. 

I've been putting off the breakup up for my friend's safety and multiple other reasons. I know he would never physically harm me, but the emotional and psychological abuse and trauma is overwhelming. He always plays the victim after saying the worst things to me. I've been struggling at work because of this trauma. I wouldn't be surprised if I got fired. I'm going over the handbook again and it's helping. It's not easy to leave a nutjob. But at this point, I'm doing it despite the possible negative consequences. This man has been dragging my mind down a path of intellectual and psychological decay. I'll lose my sanity if I spend another moment with him. Please forgive the long rant.

For some reason this thought literally did not occur to me in the context of relationships, until I found FDS.

Both of my parents are narcissists, and they raised me to basically have zero boundaries.

I remember when I finally started dating in my teens and early 20s, and having this profound feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach anytime a boyfriend wanted to do something sexual and I didn't want to. I was terrified of saying the word ""no"" or asserting a boundary because I had received a lifetime of conditioning in which even the tiniest act of self assertion was brutally punished.

Guys would drive me home after dates and my heart would be beating a mile a minute and my body was screaming AAHHHHHH!!!!! 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 ""HE WANTS SEX BUT I'M NOT READY!!! if I say no he might get disappointed and lose interest in me at best, or he may become angry and violent at worst. This is NOT OPTIONAL, ALERT! ALERT! 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨

So basically I was a narc magnet, because I had been trained since birth to seek love and approval from others by putting their selfish wants before my own comfort, as of I had no choice in the matter.

Not anymore.

When I found FDS in December 2020 I had been in a relationship with an emotionally abusive narcissist for a year. It was like suddenly the fog had cleared and I could finally think clearly:

""I don't have to put up with this""

I don't have to put up with gaslighting, low effort, negging, controlling, fucking BULLSHIT anymore. 

FUCK this shit. I'm not tolerating this any longer, so I dumped his ass.

When I started dating again it was like the pendulum had swung in the opposite direction. 

The moment a guy said or did something that made me uncomfortable, I left. Literally just grab my purse and walk. Doesn't matter if I just ordered food. Doesn't matter if I only ate 2 mouthfuls of food. The first sign of disrespect, I walk.

I don't argue with men anymore. I don't let them lie to me. I don't let them try to sweet talk or manipulate me. I don't listen to their excuses or rationalizations.

Why? Because I don't have to put up with it!

Couple days ago I was texting a cute guy who, out of the blue, said something super negging and misogynistic. I looked at his message, jaw dropped, thinking of a million witty comebacks but I didn't bother, I just blocked him and deleted his number. 

I even treat my own parents with the same ruthlessness. My narc mom called me yesterday after months of trash talking me to our entire extended social network. When I told her to stop talking shit, she tried her usual gaslighting and DARVO routine and I JUST HUNG UP ON HER MID SENTENCE. LMAO.

LADIES: 👏 YOU 👏 DON'T 👏 HAVE 👏 TO 👏 PUT 👏 UP 👏 WITH 👏 SHIT 👏

These people do not have any power over you! The moment you start putting yourself first and stop caring about what everyone else wants and expects from you, you will feel so free!

If you've seen some of my old post you'll see that I still have beef with my dad lol. But every once in a while he'll drop a gem of knowledge.

Yesterday we talked on the phone and he was basically telling me not to settle down so quickly for one guy. He told me ""just date *multiple* guys and see who fits best for you"". Such simplistic advice but It was the right time for me hear it.

Everytime I crush on a guy i start committing even there's been no mention of being official. It's silly and honestly risky. That was a very much needed reminder that men are replaceable and I don't need to commit to just one in the early stages of dating (and I can leave anytime I want to on the later stages) .

We take about this all the time but you (and they) have to be honest and open for any relationship to work.


 I wish I had invested the same level of energy in *myself* as I did in that relationship.


I've been reading *all about love* by bell hooks and she talks about all kinds of love and how often we think of it as a feeling; it's not. **Love is a verb. A verb that you do and you have to do it everyday.** 


bell writes
&gt;""[Love is] the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth...love is as love does. Love is an act of will, namely, **love is both an intention and an action**. Will also implies choice. We do not have to love. We choose to love...to truly love we must learn to mix various ingredients: care, affection, recognition, respect, commitment, and trust, as well as honest and open communication.""


She continues that 

&gt;**""When we understand love as the will to nurture our own and another's spiritual growth, it becomes clear that we cannot claim to love of we are hurtful and abusive. Love and abuse cannot coexist.**


Abuse comes in all shapes and sizes and I'm only speaking from my experience. I was subjected to emotional and mental abuse with the constant lying, gaslighting, blameshifting, projecting and performative emotions. Some people need others to be on their knees to feel tall. I digress.


**I had to realise that I deserved more. I deserved real love, not just the intention.** In Economics, there's [the Sunk Cost Fallacy](https://www.npr.org/2015/02/13/385948508/how-sunk-cost-fallacy-applies-to-love). I held onto that fallacy for dear life in that relationship. I had to realise that, yes, 4 years was a long time and yes, I uprooted my entire life, sacrificing everything for this man, for *his* growth, out of love. No, I'm not an old maid and if I love myself, like I love others, I'll be just fine. Never again 

Anywho, that was my journey. I hope I said something that resonated with you. Good luck and love yourself.",102823,What my last relationship and bell hooks taught me.,0,,,

It's been on my to-read list for a while. Then I saw someone saying it was available in audiobook form. I found it for free and I've been listening to it on and off over the last 2 days.

At first I was like, YES!! This book is great!! But then... around hour 5 of the 8 hour audiobook... the author started to drop these little hints of misogyny. Nothing overt. Just little things that made me take note. 

Then I started noticing some other things... A bit of a persecution complex when describing how the conclusions of his research were not included in the DSM. Constant self aggrandizing.. something wasn't adding up.

Eventually he mentioned people sending money to the Trauma Center in support after yet another failed attempt to get his findings included in the DSM in the form of a diagnosis. Since by this point my spidey sense was tingling, I decided to look up the Trauma Center.

I tracked it down to the Trauma Center at JRI, and Google was reporting that it was Permanently Closed as of June of this year.

Wow, I thought, I can't believe that there's so much resistance to recognizing the mental effects of interpersonal trauma that the Trauma Center had to close down.

I started looking for news stories about why it had shut down, and, while I didn't find the answer exactly, I did find [this article from 2018](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/03/07/allegations-employee-mistreatment-roil-renowned-trauma-center/sWW13agQDY9B9A1rt9eqnK/story.html) indicating that the author of the book was not quite the nice man he made himself out to be. 

Basically, he'd been fired at the same time as another employee at the Trauma Center at JRI. The other employee had been let go due to something #metoo related, and the book author claims that he was let go because he went to a meeting he wasn't supposed to. Someone who was still at the Trauma Center before it closed down this year said he was basically bullying other employees.

At the time of the article, there was a lawsuit pending between the book author and the Trauma Center.

So. In conclusion. I'm not 100% sure what's going on with this guy, but it smells fishy af. 

I think we should err on the side of not recommending this book any more. If anyone can dig up more info about what went down, including if the lawsuit ruled in the book author's favor, please educate me in the comments.

Based on books I've read written in that eras, show and movies set in that era, etc, there was no such thing as boyfriend-girlfriend.

If you were a woman, you were single and courted until one of your suitors proposed and you accepted, at which point you were engaged, and then you were married.

If you were a man, you were single and courted a lady (or ladies, I suppose) of your choice until you proposed to her and she accepted at which point you were engaged, and then you were married.

A woman was courted by several men at once until she accepted a marriage proposal. She wasn't having sex with any of these men, but they were still excepted to treat her well, respect her, and generally show her that they were worthy of her affections, trust, love, and the rest of her life.

This dynamic was quite beneficial to women. Women didn't end up wasting years in ""boyfriend-girlfriend"" relationships that ended up going nowhere. They didn't end up getting attached to men who were not serious about them, or putting in time, money, energy, emotional labor, sexual labor, manual labor, etc into men who weren't serious about them.

Today, even when you've vetted a man and determined him to be a HVM, you never have 100% guarantee that he will marry you. A guy might be a decent man, but for whatever reason doesn't want to get married. Even if you have the ""where is this relationship going"" talk 6 months into a relationship, you've still wasted 6 months and worse, have grown attached and put in the work.

FDS strategy of dating several men at once until you get commitment is as close as we can get to this old fashioned courtship. But it's not perfect because we define ""commitment"" as ""exclusive, committed long-term relationship"" and only THEN we expect (read: hope) that the man proposes within 1-2 years.",102670,FDS Strategy today vs courting before,0,,,

I don't want to share my partner. The idea makes me feel sick for whatever reason, and I'm done with feeling abnormal for it. People act like the guide to become free of ""insecurity"" (impossible) is to tolerate your partner sleeping with and pursuing relationships with other people. They act like love is enough.  They say, ""just because he loves this other person doesn't mean he doesn't love you"". And usually, the one saying it is the one with a lot of options at hand.

If him loving you was enough, then you could justify so many other things. Imagine someone cheats on you. He says that he still ""loves you"". Would you just be like ""ok cool I'm okay with it now"" and go with it? 

I'm not an extremely jealous partner. I don't feel the need to ask where he is at, or who he is with, and I expect him to have a life outside of me. I have a life too. But I have a requirement for my attachment: monogamy. And for some reason, I feel like it's too much to ask. 

I can't really explain why I won't tolerate otherwise, but I don't. I think it's normal to be with one person. I can. I don't need variety. So I'm confident I can find someone who won't bullshit me about it. I am attracted to many people so I can have options (imagine that one abusive ass being the only one you're attracted to, not good), but I will eventually choose *one*. The attraction is not love. If banging everything that strikes your fancy was normal, STDs wouldn't exist. This is how I look at it, in order to make things simpler for myself. 

This makes me mad because I was raised in a religion that permits a man to marry more than one wife at the same time, with or without consent. Men use it to carry on affairs without telling their wives. The people defending this think that him loving all of them makes it okay. Nevermind the girl's feelings. He loves them so its fair.

Men love to tell us they are the emotionless logical ones who ‘don’t get attached’ and ‘don’t catch feelings’ but the minute a woman is on the same page with that they get uncomfortable.

I was casually seeing a guy not too long ago and he said “watch you don’t catch feelings for me”, I said “don’t worry lol I won’t” and you could see the surprise on his face. He then remarked that our casual dating “could end in tears” and I replied; “your tears not mine” 🤣. He looked as if the cogs were really turning in his head. A few days later he wanted things to be more serious which was different to the steady dating that I thought we had agreed to. I don’t know whether they genuinely think all women want is serious and fast-paced relationships or if their ego just can’t take the idea that we aren’t all pining after them and looking at our phones 24/7 waiting for them to call. I wonder if they are just used to dealing with pickmeishas?

I see women on twitter sharing similar experiences where they feel like men have this intense curiosity and annoyance over why the woman doesn’t want to be their “wifey” or doesn’t feel the need to prove themselves in that way.

I was immediately turned off and stopped taking him seriously. 

It’s obvious when a guy says ‘you come to me’ that he doesn’t give a shit about you. You can tell by the way they say it, they don’t care whether you go or not. When a guy does any of the above, it feels bad as a woman, because it’s a sign that the guy doesn’t respect you. I have always felt it very strongly in my body when a guy has done this, and its never a pleasant sensation - it has made me leave dates before (the guy in question turned out to be a diagnosed narcissist) and it has made me just instantly uninterested in other cases. We know deep down when we are being disrespected.

The thing is, guys know it as well. I went on a first date once with a guy who really messed me up later on. It was a low effort, semi-planned coffee date. I had already decided prior to the date that I would always doll up for dates, no matter what kind, because thats what makes me feel good on a date, and I love the anticipation of getting dolled up before I leave. He showed up looking like he was going for groceries but looked at me with an almost cartoonish level of attraction. In the middle of the date, I was wishing I could leave because I was bored as fuck, and he asked me what I was thinking. I told him I was wondering where else we could go. (Obviously, drinking coffee in some boring and dead bar was not my idea of having fun). Immediately, he sprang into action and whisked me off to an exclusive part of the city to a really fancy place. THEY KNOW!! To be honest, I wasnt that bothered about going somewhere fancy, really I just wanted to be having a good time. He apologised profusely at the time for not planning the date properly and not taking me somewhere nice, promising to do it all properly for the next date. Guess where he took me for the next date? A chain restaurant he felt like going to (no consideration of what I might have enjoyed). Just as we know the expectations men have of us in terms of our appearance and manner, they know our expectations of them, and anything less than admitting that is gaslighting. 

The thing is, no matter how much men want to make things ‘equal’ in dating, they still do the asking and they are the ones that set the tone for the date. Going for a cheap coffee or a walk says ‘You are one of many and I don’t care about showing you a good time, I only care about what you have to offer me. I’m dating any random woman I have a chance with and if I like her, then I’ll put some effort in’. That is the mindset. This is not a secret. It doesn’t take psychoanalysis. They admit it plainly when discussing the matter. The point is, we should listen to what that mindset says about them as a person.

And it doesn’t matter if they change it up after, because their mindset is still the same. They just realise that they want what you have to offer (fear of losing it makes them spring into action) and that it will just take a little more work than they had anticipated. But showing you a nice time because ‘that’s what it will take to get you into bed’ is not the same as showing you a nice time because they respect you and women as a whole and they genuinely want to show you a good time out of their generosity of spirit.

Generosity of spirit (good character for the sake of having a good character, for the joy it brings the man himself and others in his life) is what will make a marriage to a man great and worthwhile in my opinion. This is why we shouldnt accept low effort dates, even if they change it up after initially lowballing. This guy was fine doing the bare minimum until he saw me/actually took me out. So what happens if I have a bad day and my personality is not quite as sparkly, or what if I get sick and can’t doll up in the same way for a while? Or what happens when he decides that actually, he’s not really looking for those superficial traits, or he feels guilty about being low value/only wanting me for certain things? While you are busy investing in the relationship, he is questioning whether he really saw value in you in the first place (because at first, he didnt) and whether he really wants to be with you and then boom, because he is ‘low effort’ and has poor character (selfish, entitled, only after his own interests and not respecting you as a human being) he begins pulling L/NVM shit and hurts you. This is what happened in this scenario.

I know some women say they have had success in relationships with men who changed it up, and that’s great for them. But I think its the exception rather than the rule. I think its better to find a man whose first instinct is to show respect and generosity of spirit, because I believe that these character traits are enduring. How we treat people reflects on us not on the person we are behaving towards. Men can try and justify their poor treatment of us by imagining that we don’t deserve good treatment for whatever reasons they can come up with, but if so, then they are forgetting that the greatest show of character is how you treat people who have nothing to offer you.

I don’t know about you ladies, but I don’t want to be with a man who treats those who he has nothing to gain from with anything less than the same respect he would show anyone else. This is what incels don’t understand. We see their bad character from miles away. Who would want a misogynistic husband? What woman would want to be with a man who says, to refer to a recent example on this sub, that all women who resist abuse and mistreatment are ugly?? No one wants to be with someone who inherently hates them. No one is going to be attracted to such a person naturally. Which is why it is so important for us to pay attention to our natural bodily responses to men who lowball. If I am really truthful, I never paid attention to myself regarding going on the dates I went on with the guy in this post. I didnt want to go, but I went because he ‘seemed’ like everything I was looking for. I felt that my not wanting to go was ‘something wrong with me’ because I had been gaslit to all hell by family as a child, by society and authorities when escaping my narcissistic ex, by guys I had dated before, by pickmes... However, my body turned out to be right.

Sometimes life hits us hard, and I want a man who will love me even more when that happens, not a man who will love me less. There is no worse feeling than being kicked when you’re down, being abandoned when you’re in need, and being attacked instead of supported for difficulties you may be facing. Yet this is what happens with the misogynistic man who got with you because of what you could offer him rather than because he genuinely values you.

We all behave in characteristic ways. We can observe this in ourselves as well as others. If we dress up for dates out of self respect and respect for the other person, if we choose nice experiences for ourselves and others in our lives simply to multiply the amount of love and joy we feel, then this is what we do. We don’t do that and then one day decide to start lowballing people. We give upfront and if we can’t multiply joy with that person, we walk away. We don’t hold back until we see what the other person will give us. That’s the mindset of a taker. It’s the mindset of someone who may have very little to give or who may give very stingily out of selfishness, fear, scarcity mindset, unreadiness to be in a love relationship or some other reason. I don’t think its too much to ask to want the man I’m seeing to also be someone who gives upfront, because that is how relationships survive and thrive, especially during hard times in life. I want my life to be full of wonderful experiences both given and received and I want to be able to share the burden of responsibilities so that we both have time and energy to enjoy life. This is not going to happen with a man who gives you the experience of feeling disrespected on a date, which is basically an advertisement of what it will be like to be in a relationship with him. Disrespect on a date = disrespect in the relationship. Even better, disrespect on a dating app = disrespect in the relationship, which is why block and delete is the best strategy.

Ultimately, whatever reasons (justifications/excuses/rationalisations) a man has for making you feel disrespected are his business. It is his journey to find peace in those and to find fulfilment in his life. Our business is to listen to ourselves and to know that our feelings are valid and that we can take action based on them without fear, guilt or obligation. When we start to believe that we deserve to feel respected and act accordingly is when we break the cycle of bad relationships.",102564,Respect - A view on men who change it up after you reject a lowball offer/date,0,,,

I thought it didn’t really matter if the guys doing work around my house were LV. Sis, save yourself the headache. LVM/NVMs will cost you more money in the long run. They will do a mediocre job and try to charge you top of the line prices. They will hide their mistakes. They will be rude to you. They will refuse to clean up after themselves making more work for you.

LVM/NVMs aren’t even fit to do manual labor. Don’t let them build your house, renovate your bathroom, anything. It will cost you $$$$$ They aren’t even fit to mow your lawn or plow your driveway. Do you want your landscaping ruined? Vet early and vet often. Don’t feel bad about firing them. Don’t worry if you have to run through every contractor, carpenter, handyman, etc. in your city/town and all the surrounding towns until you find a decent one. There are so many LV and NV guys in these jobs, it can feel like they’re all worthless. The ones who actually have a good work ethic might have a waiting list. It’s worth the wait. They might charge a little more. It’s still going to cost less than having it done twice. (Just be careful because some of the con artist types will charge a little more than average and talk a big game about how and why they’re worth the extra money - don’t take their word for it. Check references, try to rely on recommendations from friends, family or neighbors if you can.)",103438,Don’t hire LVM/NVMs,0,,,

I have read the handbook but I am feeling slightly confused about a current situation of mine. I have been seeing what I (19F) thought was a HVM (23M) for about 1.5-2 months now. He was lightly pursuing me for a while but I just was not interested initially. He pays for everything, plans all dates, took me on a trip, is great with my family, he is healthy, fit, attractive, talented, and pursuing a career in biotech. He is very good to his friends and family also. He spoils me to his best ability (we work the same job lol and we are both college students). We have similar tastes in everything and he treats me very well. Recently, he asked me to be his girlfriend and I declined because I wanted him to ask me in a more formal setting (we were camping haha), and so he did. He took me out to a nice dinner the following day and I said yes. I feel like everything with us has been perfect. He gives me my space, but still makes me feel wanted and important. No love-bombing, no pressure, he is consistent and always follows through on his promises, and we are literally just super compatible.

 But here is where the trouble starts in my head....Yesterday, he took me on a window shopping date (of course he bought me stuff), and then took me to a cat cafe! It was a great day. We were going to grab a bite to eat and out of nowhere he brings up that going forward he hopes we can be more of a 50/50 couple, but that he still wants to spoil me and treat me. This was incredibly aggravating to me as  I not only told him I expect to be pursued and for my partner to go above and beyond for me before I even agreed to go on our first date, but have also has subsequent conversations about it. I put him in his place real quick about that and told him that is not my standard and that if he is going to be like that this will not work out. He quickly fixed what he said and we came to an agreement about it. The agreement was that I'm getting my way lol. I was still upset on the way home and we talked about it more. He claims that after hearing my perspective that he actually agrees with me and would prefer to do things this way. He said he didn't really know why he even brought it up.

I know he is going to do things my way. That isn't a question. He knows I will get the fuck if I'm not being treated properly. But the whole situation just rubbed me the wrong way. I asked him point blank if he was shit testing me or what, cuz that is sort of how I feel. I just want some insight on this situation and some guidance on how I should proceed. Is this a big red flag?",103403,"FDS Babes, I need some guidance here!",0,,,

People treat you in the way you’ve always let them treat you. Give everyone who takes you for granted silence, leave them on read, don’t argue for decency, don’t chase them for the respect and basic humanity, fuck their approval too. 

Since giving them distance they’ve been calling, texting and trying to chase me up. They know they’ve done wrong. I feel so powerful, am I happy about everything they’ve done? No but silence is helping me be centred and more confident with very little effort and with my dignity intact.

After a horrible breakup with an LVM psycho, I was in a dark place until I found FDS. I’m now demanding what I deserve and I’m no longer putting up with scraps. While I’m still vetting the guy I’m currently dating, he is proving himself to me everyday. I cut off quite a few guys before I met him, and things are good so far. Before FDS I’d put up with much more, wasted my time with the wrong men and wanted them to change. With the current situation I’m in, I’m so much happier and more confident when it comes to my dating life and the fact that I’m putting myself and my happiness over a man. Dating used to be a massive cause of my insecurities but what it really comes down to is sticking to your values, focusing on yourself while dating, knowing what you want and not accepting otherwise.

We are all here to help each other level up and support one another on our journeys to become self-fulfilled Queens, right?

This may seem in some ways like the typical love bomber, but it doesn’t always come in the initial love bombing stage and it can be WAY more insidious. Especially if it is within a long term relationship and you start to get comfortable.

Men for the most part are emotionally stunted. I have no doubt that in the moment when they say those things, SOME really think they mean them. They don’t.  They will say this to you, and I don’t want any fellow sisters to be blindsided or heartbroken when they realize it was a lie. If you are sick, out of commission, broken, etc. and someone else catches their eye and pays them any attention, that’s it. It doesn’t matter how “beautiful” you think your connection was or how awesome you are. The majority of men will without an internal thought or shred of emotion, move to the next.

I am a very sweet person by default unfortunately and a romantic, and it has taken me several times of what I thought were really heartfelt, intimate connections to realize that men saying this means nothing. It isn’t like when a woman says it. For men, love is utility.

Ahmed Ibrahim is an Egyptian immigrant known as the ""Cupid Cabbie"" of New York City. From the driver's seat of his yellow taxicab, he has collected the names and phone numbers of over 2,000 New Yorkers and organized over 100 dates, over 30 of which have led to long-lasting romances. Ibrahim's service, which is free of charge, has been covered in The Wall Street Journal, the Fox News Channel and NBC's Today Show.

To stave off boredom and ennui, Ibrahim developed a feng shui approach to driving his cab. He sprays Jordache ""Romance for Women"" perfume in the air of his Ford Crown Victoria. At Christmas he spends hundreds of dollars to cover the interior with cotton snow, string lights from the ceiling, and install intricate Christmas scenes in the back window. On Valentine’s Day he hands out roses to female passengers.

After driving his yellow cab for 16 years, Ibrahim’s match-making started by accident in 2004, when a woman began crying in the back seat of his cab. She had just broken up with her boyfriend and Ibrahim told her not to worry, that he would find her an even better boyfriend. Three days later, a man got into Ibrahim’s cab and bemoaned his bad luck in finding a woman. Ibrahim put him in touch with the crying woman and, a few weeks later, she called Ibrahim to tell him that they’d gone on a date and were getting along great. This inspired Ibrahim to match other passengers.

After his initial success Ibrahim created a match-making system, based largely on intuition and common sense. He listens to his customers’ conversations, throws out a couple of exploratory questions and, if their answers meet his standards, he jots down their contact information.

The requirements are simple but sound: **the men must have a job and cannot be ""players.""** Men in their early 20s are usually ruled out as being ""too young and wild."" Older men who are ""looking for Britney Spears"" are dismissed for being creepy. Women who are ""just looking for a sugar daddy"" are crossed off the list.

Two key lessons which Ibrahim imparts, particularly to the men, are to be realistic in their expectations and to stop being superficial. He often tells them: ""When I was in high school I was looking for Miss Universe. In college I wanted Miss America. Now, Miss Brooklyn would do.""

Ibrahim communicates with his clients by phone and e-mail, working out of his tiny Borough Park, Brooklyn apartment on a battered Dell computer he found on the street over a decade ago. Although his service is free, The Wall Street Journal noted that it ""may be New York City’s most exclusive dating service. The only way to get in? You have to ride in Mr. Ibrahim’s cab.""",103723,Have you heard of the Cupid Cabbie matchmaker?,0,,,

No. And that will never be the case. 

Keep your dumbass comments in your drafts and go do something better with your time. I promise you there are more important things in life besides trying to harass women (on Reddit bro?? really???)  
that are taking the time to not only learn and level themselves up, but to build a female-centered community focused on becoming better women in all aspects of our lives, not succumbing to the ways of misogyny and pick-me culture, and understanding the intersectionality of this all in being women from a multitude of backgrounds and histories.

Whether that is being kidnapped, robbed, attacked, groped/sexually assaulted, roofied, raped, beaten, or even murdered from being outside at night, a lot of women live with that fear and know another woman who has experienced it. I don’t even have a wide circle of friends but SEVERAL of my friends have been groped, one has been raped, several have been sexually coerced, several have been lied to so they could be used for sex, several have been emotionally and psychologically abused by men, one became a single mom after the father walked out once she became pregnant, one of my friends had to get a restraining order against a dude who was harassing in freaking *high school*... none of us walk freely at night. All of us are constantly thinking of ways to protect ourselves and each other when we’re out. 

How does society respond?
- “she was asking for it.”
- “she was stupid for trusting/doing/being out”
- “what was she wearing?”
- “she was teasing him.”
- “why didn’t she come forward?”
- “she’s lying.”
- “she’s been hysterical.”
- “she’s a slut” 
- “she failed as a wife”
- “she shouldn’t have...”
- “she just regrets it”
- “she’s crazy”
- “she’s just looking for attention”
- “she’s got daddy issues”
And insert countless other ways in which women are constantly blamed, constantly doubted, constantly made to feel like they’re in the wrong whenever they try to voice their concerns about ANYTHING that doesn’t sit right. Gaslighting and blaming women for their misfortune is so deeply ingrained in society that everyone (men and women) do it! 

Reading some relationship posts, men describe their bad relationships in terms of everything the woman is doing wrong. They paint you a picture where she has no redeeming qualities and everyone asks “why are you still with that crazy person??” Meanwhile the women’s posts is her claiming how much she loves her partner and how great he is, and how she doesn’t want to leave him, besides the major shitty things that he does on a constant basis everyday. Everyone tells the man to leave the crazy b**, sometimes half people tell the woman she is misunderstanding her man and she needs to try harder and accept him as he is. 

If society spent half as much time scrutinizing men (who commit over 90% of murders and 70% of violent crimes worldwide mind you) as they do women, imagine how much better society would be overall for everyone?",103691,Gaslighting women is society’s standard practice,0,,,

I have so many thoughts about this one from an FDS perspective, but my main thought is WHY DO WOMEN SIGN UP? 

The risks for a woman being abused emotionally, used and dumped and humiliated are so high. After watching the 9th season, then watching the first few episodes of Season 10, I am completely flabbergasted by the continued viability of this show. You don’t even have to be a High Value Woman to observe that most of the relationships involve behaviours that no woman should tolerate. There have been like 11 seasons now, so all the evidence is there. 

So I don’t get it. Especially as many of the women seem normal, educated, hard working, from good families. Then they sign up for THIS shitshow? Help me understand 😫",103678,Married At First Sight,0,,,

This goes for any man you don't like romantically or sexually. Whether this is a professional acquaintance, a ""friend,"" or rejected suitor, the only effective way to shut down their advances is to stop giving them the time of day.

It's a common redpill/PUA strategy to continue pursuing women after a ""no,"" with the assumption that she's being coy or playing ""hard to get."" A lot of pickup tactics revolve around subtly coercing a woman to agree to something she previously said no to out of politeness. They have it in their heads that if you're not walking away from them, you can still be convinced.

I ran into this on online dating once when I was much more naive. A guy came on to me with an overly sexual remark and blatantly ignoring my stated preferences - I was looking for a woman, not a man. I told him to fuck off several different ways and he continued to respond with new flirting attempts. Even gave me his number at some point. Eventually I snapped and asked why he kept persisting knowing full well I wasn't interested.

His response: Well you're still responding, so either you secretly do want me or I get a rise out of you. Either way, I win.

The only way to shut him up was to let him get the last word in and stop responding. 

This is another reason why block and delete is an important strategy. I know it's tempting to tell off a horndog for having the nerve to message you with his limp dick in his hand, but it only encourages them to keep going. They're getting attention from a real live woman and they aren't about to let go of it. If they stop, all their efforts are for nothing. But if they persist, there's a minuscule chance you'll relent and they'll get what they want. That does happen, but it's like the lottery. And you can't win if you don't play. They're gambling the remains of their self-respect on the possibility of you being enough of a pickme to give them a chance.",103654,Stop Talking To Men Who Flirt With You,0,,,

Baked into this statement is the implicit assumption that a man would treat a woman well if he sees a future with her, which we all know is not true. It’s not only nice, kind-hearted people who get married/have long-term relationships. Being in a relationship says absolutely nothing about the character of the people in it. The worst men in society have managed to find partners and sustain long relationships, usually because these men hop from woman to woman until they find one who accepts their BS. 

What irks me the most about the statement, though, is that it places the blame on being treated poorly on the woman. It fails to mention that the ability to treat someone badly is a testament to the man’s character and not his situation. A man not seeing a future with a woman is not an excuse to treat her badly, string her along or just be low value towards her in general. 

It’s also dangerous to peddle the myth that the “right woman” can change a man, because it can encourage women to overlook a man’s history of poor behaviour because he’s treating her well for now. Old habits die hard. If a man can be low value to anyone, he can also be low value to you. A man will only change when he wants to change. Unfortunately, because society is such that low value men are rewarded in multiple ways, the number of men who truly seek out change and commit to it are small. 

Women are not responsible for the poor behaviour of men. If a man doesn’t treat a woman well, it’s because he didn’t want to treat her well. And that is squarely on him.",104604,Saying a man will act right for the “right woman” is deeply misogynist and a huge lie.,0,,,

Braveness in exchange for praise.
Braveness too attract another that is not you.
Braveness to convince themselves that they are brave.

But they are cowards.

Brave because they're selfless and care? Would literally risk their lives for the greater good, for a stranger, for their wife or family?

Brave men who honor other brave men for their kindness and giving nature. Brave men don't have many witnesses because they don't boast their braveries. It was an experience in their life, and then another and another.  The braveries pile on and the man is no longer brave in his own eyes if he ever even viewed it that way.

Is this commonplace?   This is very concerning.  I have removed the connection  with both men and emailed LinkedIn support.   I just wanted to see if other women are experiencing the same thing.  This is very out of place and inappropriate behavior for a professional networking site.",104593,Men using LinkedIn to pick up,0,,,

I was tolerating his incel/mgtow ideologies for way too long just because he is family and I could maybe bring him back on the right path by continuously advising. But no, nothing would affect him, he was so blind, he was already open to the idea of using women for sex and then discarding them, along with other stuffs like going 50/50, first date sex, boasting highly about exploiting innocent girls who are younger to him and minors, you see the typical LVM/NVM.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when he said false rape cases are more than actual number of women getting raped when he clearly knows how I have been assaulted twice in my past. That's when I snapped and cut off all ties with him, blocked him everywhere possible. Like a rejected manchild he kept sending me messages on a group in which we were mutual and all he had to say was I was a ""feminist bitch"" lol. I left soon after and now I am at peace. I should have done it before I know but that familial attachment remains somewhat and sometimes I feel bad because of that. Hope I'll get over it soon. I don't regret my decision though, best decision I've ever taken. A man who doesn't respect women is not wanted in my life.

Ladies, Tuesday evening I was waiting for my sister in a take out. While deliberating over a taco, a man called out for my attention

MAN:""Excuse me they're calling you"".

 I didn't order anything yet. I approached him. 

MAN: Did you order anything?

ME: ""No?""

MAN: ""Nah, I just wanted to talk to you"".

I was confused then flustered. I can't believe he tricked me to walking over there? 

Be aware, unless he looks like he's dying don't walk over to a man. 

PART 2 - What's your time policy? A discussion 

Still new to FDS, I made a mistake, he caught me off guard and actually had a nice chat I let him take my phone number at the end. I knew I was making a mistake and was typing slowly but it's going to change in a matter of weeks, I wasn't concerned. I thought I'd let him know it was a mistake when he reached out.

He gave me a missed call to save number too. The time was 5:36pm. So personally, my rule is that's too late to initiate your first conversation. I think gentleman and even pretend gentleman, will wait till day time the next day. He did not initiate contact the next day day time. At 4pm I blocked him and will block a good man who didn't reach out in 24hrs, in an appropriate time.

So firstly be aware, they can trick you for you to approach them and then not initiate contact to further make you be the one to make the move. I knew this, and NOT HAPPENING. If you want me, YOU COME TO ME.

Secondly, I would like to know your standards ladies? What is your personal time policy? When you share your contact with a man, how long does he have to initiate?",104583,PSA Their new tricks (to get us to chase them) + Discussion (time policy),0,,,

I'm going to tell you how this changed my life.

For years, I've had a male doctor and suffered. I've had complaints of chest pain, dizziness, weight loss, heart palpitations, fainting, etc. This is from a former figure skater who went to nationals in 2016 and won first in the group division. My doctor told me it was all in my head. I suffered for months until my mom took me to a female doctor who admitted that she was out of her depth and referred me to a specialist. 

Male specialist diagnoses me with hyperthyroidism and refuses to treat me. For a year. I suffered. I became underweight, I was constantly cold, lost my 4.0 GPA, and became hostile and withdrawn. It strained my family relationships and I started to become suicidal and thought I was going to be stuck like that forever. Eventually, my thyroid starts to regulate itself but by then I've had the life sucked out of me for so long I don't have the energy to argue that I still had symptoms. It took me years to recover and I was still dealing with a lot of medical issues. My prolonged thyroid issues also affected my brain chemistry and gave me an irreversible mental illness that untreated thyroid problems is known to cause. I still deal with that today. I should sue that man. 

This year I decided to resolve my medical issues and I got a female primary care doctor. She immediately sends me to a cardiologist, and when my cardiologist is at a loss, she send me to the Mayo Clinic. Dr. at Mayo Clinic diagnoses me with a rare genetic heart condition within the week and I am free from something that crippled me for years. I was so grateful when he gave me my diagnosis I started to cry and I could have kissed him. It's incurable but treatable and I can live a normal life again.

My female doctor was by no means more knowledgeable than my male doctor because they both had no clue what the fuck was going on but my male doctor pretended he did and gaslight me. Prevented me from getting treatment, gaslit me and told me it was all in my head, convinced me that I was being dramatic, and advised me against getting a second opinion. I suffered so much from him. For years I was so embarrassed by my ""dramatics"" I refused to mention my heart issues anymore, except when it sent me to THE EMERGENCY ROOM. And the icing is that I recently found out he has a reputation as a pervert and he somehow still has a job and was allowed to treat minors?!?!   

My female didn't have any clue either but she wouldn't give up on me and she never told me it was in my head. She got me into the Mayo Clinic after sending me to one specialist. She never told me I was just imagining it or I that I should just live with it.    

I am lucky that I am still young but my male doctor effectively stole years of my life. His incompetence gave me an incurable mental illness and cost me years of my figure skating career. I didn't even have the strength to play soccer with my little brother anymore. He convinced me I was crazy and I stopped being able to trust myself. I was completely humiliated. I am so angry his ego cost me so much. What would it have cost him to tell me he didn't know? Nothing. But it cost me everything.

 I am so grateful to my female doctor, and that she convinced me to keep trying. I am so grateful I'm not going to waste the rest of my life living with an unnecessary medical condition because of her. Her compassion and humility gave me back something I never thought I would have. I am also extremely grateful to my (male) Mayo Clinic doctor because he is also amazing and helped me so much, but my female doctor took this journey with me and held my hand until I crossed the finish line.",104542,Men Will Always Make You Pay For Their Shortcomings,0,,,

The Wikipedia page goes into detail but suffice to say I’m not comfortable writing all the details here, as they involve setting fireworks off inside her and burning her to the point of her body rotting while she was still alive.

Anyway, it wasn’t just the 4 teenage boys that kidnapped her who were responsible. They invited other men to join the fun. Over 100 men raped her and participated in the torture of this already mutilated girl. Not one man stood up and said “hey this is pretty messed up we should stop.” Not one. 

The best part?? The 4 boys were all under 18 so they were given lenient sentences when the crime was discovered. Just a few years. They are all free now (except for one who’s in jail again for an unrelated murder....of a man). I genuinely think crimes like this are worse than murder.  I mean think about it, an adult who just straight-up kills someone else gets way more time than these boys who *tortured* a girl for over a month. Maybe it’s just me but I feel like the things they did to her are way more indicative of psychopathy/general evil than a simple murder. 

Example: if you’re an adult abused wife and finally lose it and kill your husband in a fit of rage, guess what, you’re probably going to jail for the rest of your life. But if you’re a 16 year old male psychopath and hold a girl captive, rape her and burn her skin off for weeks???? Just a few years in jail. Because you’re a “child.” Then you’ll be sufficiently punished and set free to rejoin society and have a normal life.

I don’t care how old you are, for crimes like this you should be tried as an adult. 

The most terrifying things about this are all the men who participated (over a HUNDRED) and perpetuated it, and the fact that these guys are walking free today and probably in marriages and leading completely normal lives. 

And it makes me wonder how many of the men I know would have participated in the rape of this girl and not said anything. My teachers, my bosses, my boyfriends, my male relatives ..... who knows? Do we ever truly know someone? I bet many of these men came home from raping a burned mutilated girl and hugged their wives and played with their children.",104507,"The torture, rape and murder of Junko Furuta.

Trust that you have a partner, someone on your team, someone whom you can rely on in difficult times. Trust in his capabilities to do things.

I went on a work trip for a week long conference last year before the covid pandemic hit. My husband and I have two young children who went to school/daycare, and the week went without any problems. People asked me if I was worried, if I needed to check in on them, and I just shrugged and said it's fine. I knew it would be fine. He knows everything about the children that I do, and he parents as much as I do.

When the pandemic hit and things started shutting down, he has been the one always going out to get groceries and take care of logistics. He picked up materials from the kids' school for online classes. He drove us to visit the new private school we were thinking of taking the kids to, and he asked a bunch of vetting questions. He drops them off in the mornings and tries to picks them up whenever he doesn't have work meetings to attend. He plays with the kids, disciplines them, and teaches them academic and life skills.

He also takes all the initiative on big house projects. For example, we had windows and fences that needed replacing. He did all the research, called around for the contractors, took care of all the talking, approvals and payment. When the contractors came, he made sure they always had masks on inside the house, and he handled all of the on-phone and in-person interactions.

Of course, he trusts me the same way. He knows I am just as capable as him in all major ways, and he trusts me to handle our banking, finances, and bills. He believes in my abilities and compliments me on my intelligent and well-researched decisions. The rare times that I forget something or drop the ball, he doesn't dwell on the mistake. We may specialize in certain tasks, but each of us is capable of doing things individually if need be.

A life partner should be that, a partner in life. A good marriage is not 50/50. Someone who insists on 50/50 is keeping a mental balance sheet and always has one foot out the door. Marry someone who puts 100% into the relationship, who thinks of marriage as a team effort. When both partners put 100% in, each will get 100% back.",104449,Do you trust him to take care of things?,0,,,

Even though there were moments few and far between where my life resembled a scene in a Lifetime movie. Even though my husband had punched a hole in a wall and thrown things toward me and even pushed me and choked me a couple of times. At one point I put my browser on private and googled  signs of an abusive relationship and took a personal inventory.

 Of course everything lined up and pointed to abuse except one thing. It said that abusers were typically fantastic double agents. Acting like saints in public so that no one would ever believe they were abusive. My husband was not like that. He was abrasive and hot tempered, had a hard time getting along with neighbors and coworkers. So what did that mean to me? It meant that I wasnt being personally targeted as his partner. That he had mental health issues sure, but he didnt fit the profile for a domestic abuser. I needed to continue to be there for him and wait for the right time to persuade him to seek therapy.

The other thing that gave me pause was the insistence that abusers do not truly love their victims. I couldn't and still can't fully get behind that but I don't really want to debate that point. I just want anyone struggling with it to know that they aren't alone.

Not feeling alone in doubt is the point of my post. Seeking validation of abuse from the internet is extremely common among victims of domestic abuse. but even with many educational resources available many will not feel convinced. Maybe they find the source too idealistic about how relationships should be and not grounded in the real world. Maybe their experience or abuser deviates from the text book example too much.

I realized it's mostly feelings, not facts that keep victims from accurately assessing their situation. And even that many who do will still stay for feelings, but I thought it still might be helpful to share some of the things that made us doubt if we were in an abusive relationship so that other women might benefit. 

So if you have something even slightly relevant please share. 💛💜💛💜💛💜",104429,What made you question or doubt if your abuse was abuse?,0,,,

I myself have mixed opinions towards this topic, but tend to go with the more value he puts into it, the more he is willing to put in the relationship.

However, I personally wouldn’t vet a man solely because of the ring (unless it was something absolutely abhorrent).

I’m from Europe therefore the whole tradition about the ring costing at least 3 times the man salary doesn’t apply. 

I also know a few women with forever bf who finally decided to tie the knot and have chosen before hand the ring, and then the fiancé will go and pick it up. Low romanticism, high pragmatism.

It also applies to big versus private ceremonies. I’m an introvert therefore privacy seems the way to go. However, I am not an easy going sort of women and tend to love luxury. Im very torn towards all of it, specially when it comes to men. How to ver them? Does buying a costly ring and a huge wedding means anything to them? Specially if he is financially secure.

I'm not letting society gaslight me into pretending that we can just brush off all the damage society does to women with a sassy meme or two.

* I feel sorrow that I may never be truly loved and understood 
* I feel sorrow that I will always be alone 
* I feel sorrow that other women seem to find men who adore them and deep down it makes me question my whole self worth and feel hopeless and broken (even though it 'shouldn't') 
* I feel sorrow that so many men despise relationships rather than seeing the immense gift that a woman's presence is 
* I feel sorrow that no matter how 'good' and 'beautiful' and 'accomplished' I may be, it is more likely to make me look like a 'conquest' and 'target' rather than someone to care for in return 
* I feel sorrow that society has become so atomised and liberal that duty and responsibility are stripped further and further away, leaving me feeling like I won't be able to trust and depend on anyone 
* I feel sorrow that our sisters are exploited and trafficked and that feminism, which is supposed to protect women, has been hijacked to promote and glamourise women's destruction 
* I feel sorrow that porn/LibFem/capitalism/secularism has further stripped society and men of the capacity for love of another human rather than objectification and commodification of another human 
* I feel sorrow that husbands can be so unloving to their wives, treating them like servants, maids, whores, a nuisance, a 'chain' 
* I feel sorrow that I have to be so guarded against the world because I can't trust men to treat my heart with gentleness and empathy in dating 
* I feel sorrow that society does not teach men to be better and gives them a free pass
* I feel sorrow that society doesn't protect our young and innocent girls and instead feeds them to the wolves to rip their hearts out, 'teaching them a lesson' in only the most brutal of ways 
* I feel sorrow that the supposedly most intimate and sacred act in the world is instead used as a tool of manipulation, exploitation and degradation. There is truly nothing sacred
* I feel sorrow that society trains our sweet sons to be sociopaths
* I feel sorrow that our love for a man can be used against us as our greatest weakness 
* I feel sorrow that male lurkers will see this post as something to laugh at

She asked me: why everyone is so rude to him? I told her that he sexually harassed my mom when she was 14 (he grabbed her boob when she walked the street), and this ""friend"" said: Well, but did she protect herself? Did she hit him? I said, I don't know, why would you ask that? Why is it important?

I said, that she was probably scared that he might kill her, if she hit him back, and she was just a child. She repeated: This, I will never understand, this kind of women, who won't hit back, and then they want people to feel sorry for them.

Then our other friend supported me and said, that not everyone is like her, and that women can be in a state of shock when something like that happens. She started to argue, so I told her that she is being misogynistic and always siding with men (she has her history), and I told her to never talk to me again (this isn't the first argument, we are arguing about FDS themes for months now). I stormed off and she followed me and tried to stop me from leaving, and I told her leave me alone you stupid bitch. I've never spoke to her like this. I myself was shocked.

She then called me multiple times and wanted to confirm if I'm serious about not being friends anymore. I said yes.

And the ways a narcissist will gaslight their partner about their boundary.

In the comments it really warmed my heart to see so many women admitting they don’t like it, and getting the validation they always needed. No surprise though that there’s men defending the use of porn (like really, she even states in the video that it’s not moralistic as long as the Porn is consensual, and that she is specifically talking about the context of a relationship).

Most recently it was the other way around. 

A man I have known and respected for many years said he was surprised that the woman he was seeing for the last few months ended their relationship abruptly. She had apparently confided to him that she had a couple of sexual encounters or relationships with women when she was in her 20s and he took this as a green light to hit her up for a threesome. They are both in their late 30s now. This had the effect of her going ice-cold on him. He couldn’t work out what he did wrong. I couldn’t believe he was so stupid. A man of science so lacking in empathy towards women he could not treat her a an actual person, but instead as a ‘register of sexual attributes’. 

Male lurkers, being bi doesn’t make a woman interested in a threesome, ‘ENM’ or any other lazy-assed excuse for sanctioned cheating. She’s not the subject of your creepy fetish either. 

If I’m straight, does that mean you’d be ok with me asking for a three-way with you and one of the two hot barmen I met out with my friends last week? No? Really? Don’t like being pegged? What about I just go have a three-way with the barmen and leave you out of it entirely if you’re not comfortable having sex with me and another man? I mean, there must be something wrong with you if you can’t accommodate my needs for two men at once, right?

I was friends with my HVM partner for 4 years prior to dating him, and we have exclusive for 2 years now, so I am confident in classing him as HVM, but I am still vetting and am willing to leave if things change.

* When we were friends, he never once referenced my physical appearence, and always complimented my skills, intellect and acheivements. This shows that he respects me as a person.
* Before we moved in, he would travel 1.5h out of his way on a work night, to see me for 20 minutes if I had a rough day. The 20 minutes he would spend with me were spent doing emotional labour with me, lifting me up, and helping me forget my day. They were not spent on any of his needs. This is only on example of how he respects my emotional needs and what he does
* I have never ONCE seen him participate in 'bro-culture' that was denigrating to women, and he has never said anything that I would consider to be anti-feminist. Neither have I seen his friends act in a 'bro-culture' manner.
* I am a strong radical feminist, and will often speak out about the patriarchy. He supports this and has never once made me feel like I was being 'extreme', 'crazy', or 'out of touch'. He respects my lived experiences, and actively listens to me.
* He has never gaslighted me. Not once. 
* He would speak highly of me to his friends/colleagues before he started dating.
* He speaks highly of me to his friends/colleagues/family know that we are together. 
* He has been seeing a therapist to help him level-up on some behaviours that hold him back. He started doing this of his own accord around the time we were friends, and not at a suggestion/request I made. 
* He does an equal division of chores in our home, without being asked, and will even do extra if I am working more hours that week. 
* He specifically does the chores that I do not like to do, and has never complained about it, or used it as leverage in an arguement.
* When we have a disagreement on a topic, and one of us is becoming emotional (only happened twice), we acknowledge that this is obviously a touchy subject for the person becoming emotional, and respect that there are lived experiences here that impact their ability to emotionally step away from this. This has not been used as a way to discredit the others opinion/view, and instead we have respected each others opinions here, and if we talk about these topics, always stop when the other person is being negatively affected by the topic. 
* We have discussed and agreed on major life and lifestyle decisions (marriage and timelines, children and timelines, religion, short term and long term finances, etc)
* He doesn't care about mistakes I've made in my past, is not interested in my 'n' count, and never holds things from my past that he knows about against me. 
* Greets me enthusiastically and warmly every morning, every time he returns from work.
* Sets himself goals, and works on personal improvement everyday. 

I'm sure I could come up with many other things that he does that are so nice, and so wonderful to have in a partner. Most of the points above boil down to respect, trust, and aligned values, but I hope these specific examples of green flag behaviours help you on your own vetting journey. I promise that there are HVM out there, and I wish you ladies all the best luck on finding yours!",104866,HVM actions,0,,,

So if I'm being assertive and telling him I want an LTR, how do I suss out that he really doesn't want a relationship but will waste my time until I sleep with him? How long can LVM fake being interested in a woman?

Another answer: Or if I'm vetting him, do I tell him something along the lines of 'Lets see where it goes...' and if I realize any LVM behaviours I can dump him and if I see any HVM signs, how do I now change direction?",105497,Answers to: What are you looking for?,0,,,

I've learned to tune him out and I try not to talk to him and it's an all-day type of thing. 

""Uh huh. Yes. No. I don't know."" Repeated hundreds of times a day, with a lot of silence unless I'm directly asked something. I do that so that I can work in peace, which is not happening no matter what I do. 

And the problem is pretty obvious when I go home. I tune everyone else out. I can't get out of the ""gray rock"" once I'm at home. It's so reflexive now because I'm bombarded with talk for 9 hours straight that when I'm at home or with friends I just tune everyone out. 

What can I do to stop...that? And has anyone ever dealt with a man who will not shut up? What should I do? He's a supervisor, FYI.

She and her now husband met about 5 years ago. Really sweet kids, I actually went to school with him for years. He plays music, used to bring his unicycle to school, and once I remember he almost cried when a teacher harshly fussed at me in class, said it hurt his heart. 

When he walked in he was already crying. His vows were unrelenting. We were all in tears. Here’s an excerpt:

“Everyday I will earn my keep at the place by your side. Every breath for the rest of my days is taken in devotion to you. You are a blessing on my life and I know I am unworthy. 

Every morning I will break my fast with the sight of your beautiful face. It will sustain me through my day in my labor. I will toil the earth each day all to honor you. Each bead of sweat paid in tribute. 

At night I will make love to you, my body an offering to your temple. May the god I like to believe in have mercy on me, for I have made you my idol.”",105463,My cousins wedding,0,,,

Here I will be outlining the cycle of abuse as it is ordinarily observed by the victim and by outsiders, and compare it to what's going on inside the mind of the abuser.

1. Tension Building: Tensions increase, victim feels need to placate the abuser.

*What the victim feels is rising tension, but what the abuser feels is a loss of control. Perhaps the victim did something that the abuser doesn't like because it doesn't fit within their [narcissistic love script](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/understanding-narcissism/201704/the-narcissistic-love-script). Perhaps the abuser had a bad day at work and was disciplined by his boss, making him feel small and lacking control. Sometimes, there is no specific trigger, and the sense of a loss of control is entirely within the abusers head.*

2. Incident: verbal, emotional, physical abuse, anger, blaming, arguing, threats, intimidation.

*In order to regain a sense of control, the abuser lashes out at their victim. Abusers are bullies. Ultimately, they want the victim to feel small and break down their self esteem, and to make themselves feel big and powerful.*
 
3. Reconciliation: abuser apologizes, makes excuses, blames the victim, denies that the abuse occurred, or gaslights the victim into believing the abuse wasn't as bad as they remember.

*Depending on how the victim responds, and how new the relationship is (and therefore how many cycles of abuse they've been through), the abuser may respond in one of a few different ways.*

*If the victim does not tolerate the abuse and tries to leave (especially if the relationship is relatively new) and the abuser realizes they acted too crazy too fast, pushing the victim into ""hey wait a fucking minute"" territory, the abuser will often go for a pity play in a last ditch effort to regain control. He will put on some crocodile tears, profuse apologies, begging, telling stories about being hurt in the past, etc. to persuade the victim into forgiving them and giving the relationship another chance.*

*If the victim puts up with the abuse, or if they fight back but the abuser is confident enough that the victim has been sufficiently dependent on them or mentally broken down (either by themselves or by past partners) and will not seriously attempt to leave the relationship, the abuser will usually deny, gaslight, and use other manipulative tactics to further break down the psyche of their victim.*

4. Calm: Incident is ""forgotten"" and no abuse is actively taking place. The ""honeymoon"" phase. Often the abuser love bombs the victim to ""make up"" to them.

*The abuser feels in control, at least for now. The love bombing is not genuine, it is just a means to an end, and that end is controlling the victim. Over time, the ""calm""/love bombing phase becomes shorter and shorter until it ceases to exist whatsoever, at which point it will just be constant tension/abuse.*",105780,Understanding the cycle of abuse from the perspective of the abuser 🚩🚩🚩🚨🚨🚨,0,,,

Why is money so important to you? I mean don't you value respect, love, giving you freedom, understanding and mental growth more than financial advantages?

Like wouldn't you prefer a poor man that really loves you as you are, supports you in anything you do, is there when you need him and totally loyal to you over a rich man who sees you as a pretty trophy? Don't you have any sense for self-worth? 

I know I'm generalizing now, but most men who earn a lot of money or who were born rich are way more self-centered and have a negative attutude towards women and live the patriachal lifestyle. So why is it so important that the man can add something to your finacial Situation? Don't you realize you're supporting the partiachal view by living up to these standards ?

To me it seems very ironical, that you value your feminine strengt and independency, but then change your personality and you're behaviour just to make men like you, even if you don't like themy, just to get them to pay for your meal (referring to the other post about getting a man into playing for the date every time). Don't you see that you are bowing to men by acting this way ? Seems like a double moral and very confusing to me.

Thank you for the community. 
I am about 1 year out of a long, loveless dead bedroom marriage. About 8 months ago, i got involved with a friend of a friend who turned out to be a fuckboy. Our chemistry was amazing and the sex with him really helped me get over my marriage. Of course, you all the know the story....eventually became addicted to the highs/lows, the oxytocin/dopamine, sex was always on his schedule, etc etc. I don’t regret the situation because i really needed/wanted the physical connection with someone after all those years and for a while, it felt good. Plus i learned a lot about men and modern dating during this time (the sad truths). 
But now I’m ready to move on from the fuckery to hopefully find someone i have chemistry with who also has some degree of emotional maturity/relationship potential. 
During the last 6 months or so, i have also done some online dating off and on. Casually dated another guy for about 2 months and went on about 7 first dates with guys i didn’t want to see again. 
I’m familiar with the concept of mantourage dating although where i live, it is hard to find even one decent guy to go on a date with at a time but i will certainly try. 
I welcome any general advice and specifically any tips on delaying sex. 
Do you have something you say when makeouts start to get steamy to let them know you won’t be having sex with them for a little while? (I’m not sure about 3 months or other specific time period but would like to try delaying longer than i have with the 3 guys i slept with post-divorce - was not looking for a relationship with any of them.)",26704,General advice and tips on delaying sex,0,2019-10-28 23:13:01,,

I was hoping to posit a few things for discussion. I hope it isn't too disjointed.

\--I have found the dating pool is even more limited for successful, career-driven women. I am going to law school next fall, and I have noticed any discussion of this or my current job, which is also white-collar if not terribly prestigious, tends to put men off. I am careful not to go on at length and only mention it briefly when asked. I am hopeful a new city for school will open up a new dating pool.... I would never tell the average person that I wouldn't even consider dating someone who makes less than I do, but it isn't really to do with the money. Men are so insecure when it comes to this, even studies show that women who out earn their partners are cheated on more often (*and* still do most of the household chores), and I don't want to deal with it. Big thanks to this sub for helping me be secure with that choice. 

\--Sometimes I feel as though the moment I try to get what I want-emotional support,  physical/emotional intimacy, etc-it puts men off, leading to a cycle of disappointment. It is incredibly discouraging to think that the very act of meeting my needs is a turn-off to men, and it really had me down when I first discovered this sub and actually thought about it what a terrible catch 22 that is...

\--I am in a transitional state with my career, so I don't want marriage. A lot of this sub seems to be geared that way, so I would love if others who do not have this as their end goal right now would share their experience. I am not sure how to set boundaries in this context. 

Background-A loser who was 7 years older snapped me up when I was 18. He actually pushed me into marrying him. He was attracted to my elevated social status (he knew my family growing up) as well as my youth. He was a terrible addict, and ended up overdosing.  He was manipulative and weak-he made me feel guilty for his abusive childhood and often said he would kill himself if I left. I remember thinking I couldn't live with that on my conscience, so I stayed.  He negged me when I would exercise or eat healthy, because it made him feel threatened. He was emasculated because I was so far out of his league. 

I have come back strong with school, exercise, and my career. I am very independent, but the actual trauma of his death ( No grief-I don't miss him) has left me damaged. With men, I try to walk a line between oversharing (turning men off) and expressing some calculated vulnerability (which can be a turn on, while also getting something for myself emotionally). I am curious if others do this or something similar. Circling back to a point above, is there a way to get support for life's difficulties without turning men off? I am careful not to overshare and am an extremely private person, though I tactically use it to maintain an air of mystery sometimes... I hope that makes sense. Also, I manage just fine by myself and I am not desperate for help. I don't think a man will fix my issues, it would just be nice to have support and I wonder how possible that is. 

Again, so sorry if this is disjointed-no offense taken if it is removed. I am just hoping for a stimulating, open-ended discussion on this rainy Sunday morning :)",26701,"Fairly new here.

And no this isnt about guys being against ""Strong women"", its about being against manipulative narcisists and sociopaths who are 0% unaware of themselves.



Being female only isnt about creating a safespace, its about being able to continuously ignore your flaws and creating a circlejerk like no other.



You are no better than r/incels r/mgtow etc. 
You have become what you hate most.



You're not looking for self-growth.

You're not looking to become a better person.

All that youre doing is creating one big circle jerk, ignoring or even worse- reinforcing your flaws, acting like everyone else was wrong but you.



If you're only being nice in order to get something for that, youre not nice.
You're a manipulative POS.
Relationships are about understanding, encouraging and loving each other.
Not about being a ""queen"" or some shit.



I hope even one person sees this and might changes their mind.



Because men arent your enemies. 

Assholes are.

It’s pathetic to be honest. They all think they are so witty, yet all they do is regurgitate the same one liners. They must think their insults are original. “YOU ARE AN UGLY FAT BITCH! NO MAN WILL EVER WANT YOU. JUST WAIT UNTIL YOURE 30! YOURE A GOLDDIGGER! WHAT ABOUT MENS RIGHTS?” 

They all send the same messages calling you out of your name, further proving the point that most men are trash who do not deserve to interact with women at all. They claim we are the more emotional gender but they throw a tantrum when a space that they cannot be included in dares to exist.

In real life, I very rarely meet a woman in her 30’s that is immediately distinguishable for one in her mid-late twenties. Men are even more useless at guessing than other women are. The notion that we immediately explode into a pile of gray hairs and wrinkly skin our their 30th birthday should be laughable to any boy over the age of 13, yet, this concept of “The Wall” gets parroted by bitter Reddit losers as gospel.

A few years ago, I dated this guy. His cousin was literally a supermodel. Like, a shot/walked for Victoria’s Secret, you’ve-probably-heard-of-her supermodel. Being the intelligent, enterprising woman she is, she wanted to test the waters for a new business idea. Her idea just happened to be in the same industry I work in, so she hired me to do some consulting work.

The three of us were on a phone call one night and she told us to Google her to find a particular campaign she had worked on. Her information popped up on the right column of search results and my boyfriend immediately stopped.

“Wait. I'm five years younger than you! Why does this say you were born three years after me??” She’s *almost a decade older* than her Wikipedia page states, and no one has a fucking clue.

She laughed and said it was super common for models and actors to have completely fake names and ages. I don’t mean fake names like “Chanel Iman Robinson Shepard” decided to go by “Chanel Iman.” I mean like an unbelievably good looking woman was born with a super unfortunate name and had it legally changed to something completely made up so she could be more marketable. Some of them even have completely fabricated backgrounds. That “exotic” South African beauty? There’s a chance she might be from Ohio.

Celebrity tricks have totally destroyed men’s concept of what a woman in her thirties/forties looks like. “The Wall” is not coming for you, ladies. Rub it in their faces.",28780,"Your WCW Doesn't Even Exist - ""The Wall"" and Other Lies",0,2019-10-29 13:34:25,,

Soon after my appointment is up, I would (hope) to transition to graduate school. Pretty introverted, open minded and would say easy to talk to (once I get a feel for who you are and have control of my social anxiety).

The social anxiety (as well as other crazy illnesses) are due to me being constantly bullied through my looks in middle school and being “not pretty/attractive” in high school. There were other traumatic events I’ve been through too, but the appearance is one of the main themes. (Yes, I am currently seeing a therapist about it).

Anyway...in terms of online dating (Tinder, Bumble, etc) I have had matches and guys compliment me. Surprising, but it has happened every time I match with someone and get on there. Unfortunately, most (if not all) want sex of some kind and aren’t serious. So, I’m guessing I glowed up or am more attractive currently? Who knows lol.

Honestly, my experience with that makes me wary of online dating, so I am trying to see what tips I can master to approach (and be approachable to) guys in person.  I’ve been told that I can give off this “I’m not interested” or “fuck off” vibe (which, I find surprising as well because I would be “in the zone” and just focused on things, as opposed to wanting people to leave me alone (unless they’re legit creepy). So that may be a factor?

Also, uhm, the only men I seem to attract in person are men twice my age and not put together. At least, most of the time. My friends said that other guys (around my age and are put together) would give me signals, but I don’t want to misread them or think of it too much.

I just want to look (and be) the best I can to men so that I can be interesting inside and out. 

And before you say that “looks don’t matter, etc”, please be honest on how you try to present that line. Yes, personality matters too but many men tend to approach you based on looks alone then they decide if they want to get to know you (hence the posts on here saying that men would pursue women for sex and only sex). At least a consensus can focus on that.

Any genuine advice and insight on how to improve or present issues are much appreciated!",28722,Want to pursue a relationship and approach someone I like in the future?,0,2019-10-29 13:05:12,,

**FDS women are similar to incels because of our extreme ideology of hating men.** *The truth?* We hate *shitty men* and we *will* use this subreddit as a platform for calling out their bad behavior so other women know what to avoid. However, we also make space in our lives for: 1) good male friends who respect women and appreciate our friendship, and 2) a loving boyfriend/husband who is serious about us and cares about us a lot.  We don't think that men are only good for their money. We look for great partners who are caring, sweet, intelligent, honest, loyal, and loving! These qualities are very important. However, another quality that we also look for is a man who is generous towards us and it's non-negotiable. Just because we care about a man's generosity and see it as one of the many measures one can have in determining a man's seriousness about you, doesn't mean that it's the only thing we care about. 

**FDS women must be ugly because only ugly women need dating strategies; all you need to do is to look hot.** The truth? Although women do receive a lot of attention from men, the majority of them are from those who only want us for sex, so our main objective is filtering out men who aren't looking for a relationship with us. Additionally, while looks do matter, in order to get a man to commit to you, you need to act like a high value woman so that he will cherish you. The tips we share here on how to act like a high value woman work; the overarching principles will get a man to treat you like you are the love of his life. 

**FDS women are mentally deranged.** The truth? How we appear online is vastly different from how we are in person. We don't talk as bluntly as we do online. Online, we have less filter and our thoughts are expressed in a way where we simply do not give a fuck. Our thoughts are crystal clear and we don't have to worry about using several social filters like we do in real life to seem more diplomatic and socially acceptable. 

Many try to paint /r/FemaleDatingStrategy as some sort of ""crazy"" new group of man-haters who seek to manipulate men, but the majority of our members aren't like that at all (a few of us are a bit more roguish than the rest though, including yours truly 😉).

All your misconceptions about us will be dissolved if you just take the time to keep an open mind and understand our perspective.",28603,"The Truth About FDS Women: We aren’t similar to incels, nor are we ""ugly"" or mentally deranged.

How ordinary men can turn to soliciting sex from minors when they hit the wall, &amp; obviously is very scary to think about considering children. 

Way back when Dateline NBC's *To Catch a Predator* hosted by Chris Hansen was on the air - was a show about sting operations where men are caught trying to solicit sex from minors online. What's disturbing is how many men actually fell for these sting &amp; travel often, HOURS and across state lines to go to a home where they expect a 12, 13, 14, 15 year old girl to be home alone. 

Mind you, these are very ordinary men - mechanics, middle school teachers, etc. And are often not previously on any sex offender registry. These men are often fathers, Rabbis, Or teachers that teach children the same age as the decoy they go to have sex with - I remember watching one where the guy was **newly married.** 

TRP seemed to explain away men being attracted to younger women - but are grossly offended and are quick to dismiss these men as being deranged and out of the ordinary. 

Could you imagine the outcry if women were seeking 13 year old boys online in such alarming numbers?

It's hard to respect someone that doesn't respect you, and if you are someone with very low self worth, you need to be able to answer ""yes"" to the question of, ""would I ever talk to or treat someone the way that he treats me?"". Even if a part of you is blind to yourself being mistreated, or you rationalize/justify yourself being mistreated, surely you can still recognize whether or not you would treat someone else the same way you are being treated under the same circumstances.

As an example, if a man you are with is talking about how hot other girls are in front of you and bragging about how they are checking him out, you might want to rationalize and make excuses for him, but if you consider that you wouldn't be okay seeing someone do that to your friend, nor would you ever try to say similar things to your man knowing that it could make him insecure, you can deduce from his actions that he is not being respectful, and therefore is not someone you can respect as your man.

I see women switching from partner to partner feeling unsatisfied and directionless, or bear unhappy relationships. emale dating strategy itsn't only to land the perfect man for you, but to be **happy** and to be in a good relationship,with yourself first.


You don't HAVE to date. Is having a partner with lots of means *absolutely* necessary? Riches aren't gonna make you happy, but stability sure helps... It might take time to be stable by yourself, but you're gonna feel so proud of yourself no?

I, personally, have the dream to have a small home, either a apartment in a city or a cottage deep into the woods. To be discontented, to have no stress whatsoever, surrounded by cats there and there in a eccentric decor suited to my taste, all that is my hope. 

Some might ask ""But you won't be able to pay that for yourself?"" I'm conscious of that, but I'll bulid that slowly, over the years, decades if necessary. All my own work, my own money  put into this thing called home to me. 


Having someone to depend on sounds like a nightmare, thinking that some day I might lose everything because of this one person. Instead, I would prefer someone that would add to my self-made happiness instead of being a fundamental part of it. 

Meanwhile I'll stay alone, since I know I'm unstable, in a economic sense, but I don't give up on my hope. And this is my DATING strategy.

I can't find myself able to give men the time of day. It's very hard to date, especially on apps which seem to be where everyone meets now and it's so easy to lie. I'm terrified of being lied to, of committing myself to a man who's deceiving me in some way, such as cheating on me or just not that into me and stringing me along. With that in mind, I find it hard to give anyone a chance.

But I DO miss dating, and I would like to try having a relationship again. My question is, how in the world do you stay sane? What do you tell yourself to make yourself keep trying?

I've recently become the victim of a man who employed redpill strategies on me, at a very vulnerable time in my life (post divorce). He posed as a very warm and caring friend, concerned about my well being during the whole time of separation through divorce. I was very confused when later on he treated me very badly (only wanting to hang out, making sure I knew he was seeing other people). I only saw him a couple of times but it was enough to see that he had no respect for me and just wanted a situation where he could use me. 

The ex was my first and only relationship that lasted 14 years. I still have so much to unpack from that one but I basically lived the life of a pick me penelope to a very low value man.

I'm looking at all the posts and comments and my eyes have been opened. Thank you ladies. I've been seriously at a loss as to why men treated me badly when I gave so much of my self. This all explains it. They don't respect you if you don't start respecting yourself. Nobody ever really arms women with this knowledge. I come from a very traditional asian culture, a very male dominated ""please the man"" culture, women are viewed as a second class citizen. 

Needless to say it's been a process.

But one of the things I am going through right now is going through mistakes. Having these regrets. 'I should've' or 'I never should've' 'I can't believe I was so stupid to do that.' And I find myself lying awake thinking of these past situations. I'm trying to pull myself out of it but all I can do is beat myself up and feel anger at these shitty men.

The amount of men that have done verbal gymnastics to try and get me to have sex when I either haven't wanted to, wasn't in the mood, or wasn't in the mood *for them* is fucking mindblowing. Back before I had a backbone, I was occasionally convinced and always, always, always regretted it.

Please, for the love of god, if you are not 100% fully on board, don't have sex with him.

Don't have sex to keep him interested.

Don't have sex to be polite. 

Don't have sex to get attention.

Don't have sex out of pity or guilt.

Don't have sex because you feel like you should.

Don't have sex because he says he loves you or sees a future with you if he hasn't actually proven this with actions.

Most men would never debase themselves to have sex with someone they weren't attracted to out of some misguided effort to be polite or help some woman's ego, and neither should you. And sex is almost always completely for the man's benefit, as most are selfish and don't care if you get off if they don't care about you. And if he's pressuring you sis, he doesn't give a fuck about you and will be a bad lay regardless.

Learn from my mistake: I once hooked up with a guy because I felt bad for him. We matched on OLD, he seemed nice enough but gave me some sob story about how he's lonely and just wanted to ""cuddle"". I let him come over and he immediately started pressuring me for more. I didn't have tough skin at the time and have always been a people pleaser, so I went farther than I wanted to. Afterword, he blocked me on the OLD and text. It was humiliating and hurtful, and I was angry at him but I was more angry at myself because I didn't respect myself enough to stick up for me and stand by my own boundaries and advocate for my own comfort. This isn't my proudest moment and I'm embarrassed to share it, but honestly I have other personal stories of coercion and actual rape from men who didn't care about my boundaries, comfort or safety as I'm sure most of us do.

""No."" is a complete sentence. Don't have sex until you want to, and not until he's proven himself worthy.

As we go through the vetting process, thought it'd be an interesting exercise to look at the choice of partners made by highly successful HVW; I specifically chose women who are successful in different fields who seem to have a stable partnership (no cheating rumors etc.). If you have any suggestions, add them in the comments!

**1) Keira Knightley:** successful, feminist and proud, I found it very interesting that in an environment full of tall, handsome, successful fellow actors/directors/producers, Keira chose James Righton, a musician, and they're still going strong with a kiddo. Given the astronomical rates of cheating/ divorce in celebrity circles, I presume she actively decided against the typical Hollywood leading man, and instead went for someone who met her values. I don't know much about her partner, but I thought it was an interesting choice.

**2) Angela Merkel:** We have a highly successful woman (doctorate in quantum chemistry and one of the few current female heads of state). Truly incredible achievements. She divorced her first husband, a fellow physics student, and then married her Joachim Sauer, a renowned quantum chemist and professor. It is also the second marriage for him; I applaud their union , as the level of scrutiny they are subjected to must be stressful, but they have seemed to support each other fondly over the years. 

**3) Michelle Obama:** With an Ivy-league studded resume (Princeton, Harvard Law School) and a seat on several charity boards, Michelle Obama is an American icon in her own right- not to mention, her husband sort of was the President of the United States at one point (back when the presidency was a little more respected :p ). 

It would be interesting to break down why these women chose their partners (because all of them appeared more successful than their husbands at the time that the chose them). I'm sure these women must have come across a lot of successful LVM masquerading as HVM (profession, physique etc) but I commend them for being able to tell the difference. One of the lessons I take from this is that a respectable degree and competitive career are not enough to make a HVM; I've actually met many men like this who ended up being self-centered, narcissistic and incredibly low-value. 

Interested to hear your thoughts!",102081,Analyzing who HVW chose to be their husband,0,,,

we fed the cutest birds ever in a zoo like thing, but for birds and parrots only. then went on a hike to take photos of nature and eventually ended up slow dancing in the rain.

he kissed me goodbye, after politely asking if it's okay.

my gut and heart scream yes, but i am a little scared of taking the leap. however, i can't pinpoint why. maybe because everyone always says to never get back together with an ex?

Cheating, self hatred, those are character flaws. They don't away just because you're ""better"". How a man, how ANYONE in general treats people is a reflection of who they are on the inside. If they have low vibrational traits they are going to leak those on to you.

So all in all. Is it me??? I don't think I overestimate my looks bc again most of my 20s I thought I was uglier that  actually I am. Yet the feedback from men makes me think I am ugly as hell. And I just know I am not. 

I honestly feel like my chubbiness limits my options. And that's fucking awful bc again I'm not as ugly as my options would suggest. I'm not a hot model but holy shit neither the guys who pass me up.

LVM will always try to delve deep into their past trauma and personality issues to justify their low value behavior and shitty actions. Do *not* feel flattered when a man unloads all of his emotional baggage onto you. 

I've been in countless situations where the man I'm engaging with opens up about his ""traumatic childhood"" and his ""lack of trust towards people."" No, they're not trying to make me feel sorry for them. In fact, they're trying to use it as a shitty excuse for their negative actions.

***Engages in BDSM:*** ""Wah wah, this is because of my traumatic childhood!11 I was bullied all through high school!!111 I need to take my angst out on others, hope you understand bb xx.""

***Consistently breadcrumbs you:*** ""I have *such* a hard time trusting people babe. It's all because of Joel and the fact he stole my liberty blue crayon in 2002!""

***Diagnosed Narcissistic*** ***personality disorder:*** ""I fail to feel empathy in various situations because of my diagnoses! I am sooo sorry you were offended by my lack of care for your mother's passing.""

***Diagnosed borderline personality disorder:*** ""So what I cheated on you with 4 different girls on my week long trip to Cuba?? BABE you know I have BPD! Hypersexuality is part of the package! Don't you love me and support me?

***Talks about his parents divorce:*** ""I know I have absolutely no direction in my life and I'm pushing 35. I don't know how to cook, make my bed, and wipe my ass. You know this is all because of my parents divorcing when I was 6, this is all THEIR fault!""

If someone is generally aware of their negative behavior or personality issues and using them as an excuse for their behavior, I have absolutely zero fucking sympathy. Please be mindful of the men who like to disclose all this information to you early on in the vetting process. This is their way of seeing how much they can get away with, and use their traumatic experiences as a guise.",102448,Explicitly stating past trauma/personality is not an excuse for engaging in said behavior,0,,,

Why you felt so betrayed and violated when he cheated, lied, misrepresented himself, or ghosted? It's because he didn't have your consent: 

Consent should be informed

The person you have sex with should be able to give informed consent. This means that they are not too drunk, too high, too drugged, unconscious or asleep when sex begins. They should also furthermore, consent to have sex with you and not be deceived into consenting to sex with one person and end up having sex with someone else.

Although it doesn’t say it explicitly, manipulating someone into sex deprives them of their ability to give informed consent, as I mention here.

Informed consent. You can't consent to something when you don't have all the information. This applies not just in sex, but in relationships, in business, in all areas of life. So when you're starting to engage in sexual activity with them and you have information that you're specifically with-holding because you think they would change their mind if they knew, you're not giving them the opportunity to give informed consent. If you have an STI and you don't tell your partner, they're not giving informed consent. If you cheated and you don't tell your partner, they're not giving informed consent. Informed consent is important because if they're not consenting with all the information, they're not consenting at all.

If you manipulate someone into having sex with you (ie. if they would not have consented to sex if they knew something you are explicitly hiding, such as your true identity or that you have an STI or that you cheated) then they cannot have given informed consent. Sex without consent is rape.

So after some chir chat, I realized he does not exercise and when I asked for bis height he said “maybe 5’9.” He asked if he “passed.” I just responded that I’m taller and he asked “so you can’t date a man that is shorter than you?”

I hate that question because men have their standards- if I looked different, then there is a huge possibility he would not be interested in me. So why is it wrong for me to want to date a man who is at least at eye level to me? Honestly my cut off is merely 5’10. Am I shallow?

They even make jokes about Raping children and will literally make it seem like it is something innocent and when women call them out on it they just say ""women don't have humor"". Men's whole humor is ""hah rape funny, haha so funny women slut, women aren't humans haha, women dumb and ect.""
I have never in my life laughed at men making jokes it is just not funny. But the think is all the rape jokes men are making aren't jokes, cause men all around the world are Raping women and children and majority of the men if they ever got the chance to would rape women and children. For long people have been saying ""it is what you wear"" that is not true, it is the situation, if you end up in a situation where men can rape you and most likely would get away with it, he would do it. It doesn't matter what you are wearing it doesn't matter if you are 6 years old or 40 years old, majority of the men would grab their chance. This is why we should teach young girl to never trust men, it doesn't matter how good you know him, men may call this ""misAndrY"" but they only say that because a lot of them ARE rapist or rapist to be who don't want to lose their chance to be able to rape women or just men who care more about their reputation than the feelings and safety of women, men don't have empty for women. But we women should start protecting young girls and each other, cause men won't ever do it, HELL MEN ARE THE Danger. 
Even when a men claims to protect, ask him ""what are you protecting me from?"" And watch him say men. Men aren't women's protectors but women's aggresors. No one kills women as much as men, no one kills men as much as men, Men are humanity's natural enemy. We women ARE women's protectors no one cares about women more then other women.

I would put more salad and potatoes on his plate to make it look like he was getting a better deal and chuckle inside with glee that I had the biggest piece of meat and he thought he had more! 😂

Then a few years after I divorced him I read a kind of analogy a woman had written about the selfishness of men compared to the selflessness of women. It went something like this, The wife cooks pork chop dinner and she gives her husband the biggest pork chop, their child the medium pork chop and she gives herself the smallest pork chop. But when the husband makes dinner he gives always himself the biggest pork chop! 

In future always take what you want and put yourself first, if you slaved away cooking that meal and you want that biggest steak or pork chop then you take it, take what you want like a man, be as selfish as a man! And never under any circumstances do you give wifey benefits and pork chop dinners to a man who isn't your husband!

I also recently read something about a woman who used to be a chef and her boyfriend or husband of several years only just found out she was an amazing cook during lockdown because she purposely kept it from him so he would cook and not expect her to cook all the time!

This was in my pickme days. 

He will say ""you got this"" and act like he will cheer you. I was in school. He said we could study for tests together and help each other review. At first it'll seem sweet and encouraging, and go well. Next time, he will start to get lazy and before you know it he's goofing off on his phone as you're trying to work. Next thing is that he will start pesting you, over silly stuff, despite knowing you're working. Whether it's calls at work, pesting you when he knows you're in a Zoom meeting, trying to study, etc. 

I also made the mistake of telling my dates my ambitions for the future. I was going to outshine them, when many were lost and didn't know what they wanted to do or just lacked the ambition. I applied for internships in undergrad but these guys would say things like ""well don't worry about it, dont bother calling them, you don't even need it just work for your family"". I initially believed them. I ended up starting my own business and finishing some classes to actually finish my degree. In the meantime I had taken some time off to figure myself out and because I needed the money. My lv ex would always tell me ""yes get your degree finish school! Its worth it you got it"". I didn't have the money. So I took time to make the money then I heard criticism saying that the other jobs out there dont pay enough just build your small biz instead. I heard ""well you need that degree that's why no decent paying job wants you"". So I got the degree finished, finally. Then I heard negging ""well you always say I'm not advancing but you're the looser that's been in school for way too many years!"" Then others I tried talking to would say well an undergrad isn't enough you NEED a masters! I had too much debt. Some of these guys even told me to apply at fast food or Amazon warehouse instead of even trying to get hired in my field. The thing was they all had looser jobs and no education and wanted to keep me held down rather than grow. I had access to a ready hire job in my field that paid decent and whenever I'd talk about applying there theyd all tell me ""oh you'll hate it. Just stay self employed"". When i talked about doing part time americorps which pays a little just for the experience they all said ""thats a waste of time"".

No matter what I did to better myself they just shut me down and brainwashed me that I was too good for it, or it wasn't worth it, or it wouldn't matter. Nothing ever pleased them. They were low value and tried to drag me down to low value too. Plus none of these guys ever tried bettering themselves. 

LVs are dangerous. They not only want a bangmaid, can spread disease, but they can also negg you and try every trick to hold you back. These men don't want to see you succeed. They are jealous and want a bangmaid they can be better than. These men are deadweight. 

When dating, don't tell men what your plans or ambitions are. Don't tell them if you're in the application process to schools or jobs. You don't need the discouragement and you don't need to give them ammo. If you're vetting ask them the questions and be general about what you do.",102363,LVs will fake support you and when you start succeeding theyll try lowering you down. Drop the deadweight.,0,,,

- Cooking is not a ""wife privilege,"" it is a basic function of adult life that one or both parties in a marriage will need to contribute to depending on circumstances.

- Cleaning of a mutually owned space (see above)

- Doing his laundry or cleaning his crusty ass sheets/apartment when he *does not* is certainly not a wife privilege; that is an unhealthy behavioral pattern that is setting a precedent for power imbalance in **any** relationship. 

- Degrading sexual acts are not a wife privilege

- Helping him get along in his education or career at any expense of your own time, investment, education, or employment opportunity is not a wife priviledge

This is why I'm an advocate for FDS before and after marriage. If you have the inherent assumption that engaging in normal household maintenance will be an assumption in your role as wife then by all means do so, but treat yourself as the exception rather than the rule. Labeling the mental and emotional burden that women have been saddled with for centuries in order to maintain a societal inbalance power as ""women's work"" or ""wife privileges"" is setting us behind.",102360,"Can We Talk About FDS Use of ""Wife Privileges""?",0,,,

And the amount of likes and awards these posts get are just upsetting and pathetic.

But when a woman makes a post about how it upsets her and damages her mental health, she gets hated on, even gets death threats, and is called sensitive. But men are never called sensitive.

And the whole thing about how no one cares about men’s mental health is a big fat lie. I see more men actually get sympathy and support whereas women get called emotional, Karen’s, attention seeking, etc. 

Especially since people care more about men than women. Women are expected to be more mature but also have no problems. We’re expected to be feminine and cute. We can’t be realistic.

Men can’t cry? Absolute bs. Women are the real ones who can’t cry.

Everyone expects us to do free emotional labor and do everything for everyone and if we don’t, we’re somehow entitled and selfish.

- less and less interest in sex with you, he’d rather jerk off

- wants you to wear conservative clothing (mate-guarding) 

- you’ve been together for a while (making the transition from W to M in his mind)

Signs you may be a “whore” for him

- he pressures you to do degrading sexual acts and if you don’t he’s disappointed at your lack of “chill” 

- he hits you up at 9 pm for last minute “dates” 

- he talks about hot girls in front of you like you’re one of the guys

Oh yeah I'm sure those poor aristocrats are under soooo much pressure to maintain and expand their power, I mean it must be so much WORK! /s

Both patriarchy and feudalism are systems in which the dominant class controls all the land and property, and benefits from the unpaid or underpaid labor of the subordinate class. Any perceived ""downsides"" of being in the position of power are overwhelmingly outweighed by the privileges.

Now, some of our lurkers might be thinking ""oh but that's so old fashioned! Maybe it was like that 100 years ago when women couldn't own property but women are equal nowadays therefore men shouldn't have to provide!""

Wrong. Even though women can legally own property, the reality of our world is that [men still own 80% of the world's agricultural land](http://www.fao.org/gender-landrights-database/data-map/statistics/en/), [men still control the overwhelming majority of the world's wealth](https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender), and over [75% of the world's political leadership are men.](https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/leadership-and-political-participation/facts-and-figures)

Meanwhile, [women still perform 2.5 times more unpaid domestic labor than men](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/csw61/redistribute-unpaid-work), which obviously benefits men.

This is why we at FDS we don't do ""50/50"" relationships, because THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD is nowhere near 50/50. Until the time comes where women and men enjoy true social, political, and economic equity, the least a man can do is pay $20 for his date's dinner. When a man spends money on a woman, it is a form of wealth redistribution. Call it the ""patriarchy tax"" 😉",103101,"""It's wrong to expect men to provide for you!

{*I read this on Quora once so if I can find the link I’ll add it!*}

Okay so here goes. OP talked about a couple that had just started dating. Things were going great and they were really into each other. For some reason the BF couldn’t commit to his GF before testing her to see if she was actually faithful or not. So he comes up with this brilliant idea, because what could go wrong right? He would have his best friend hit on her and if she didn’t fall for it then she would pass the test and get the honor of dating him. 

Well the day comes, and if I remember correctly the bf “had to leave for something” so he left the two of them by themselves. As planned the best friend immediately starts hitting on her, she felt uncomfortable and told him to stop, which he didn’t. After trying it for a few more times the best friend realized she wouldn’t budge so he left her alone. Soon the BF returns and the day goes on as usual. Before going home he checks in with his best mate and was relieved when he found out nothing happened.

Well the next day his GF comes up to him and tells him what happened. He reassures her and tells her she must’ve misunderstood his intentions. GF stands her ground and tells him she doesn’t want him to be friends with someone that disrespected her like that. At this point BF is freaking out, he doesn’t want to lose either so he ends up coming clean. He probably thought that would fix everything but GF ended up leaving him for feeling the need to “test her”.

**In an attempt to test her loyalty he ended up losing her trust.**",103096,One of my favorite stories,0,,,

HOW?? How did men turn it upside down like that? 

Also, when men use the term ""gold digger"", they say the woman is using them for their money. That's just ONE thing in the man's life being used, compared to the 15 different things men will use women for. THE AUDACITY. 

And even if a woman truly was a gold digger, and the man leaves her, he has lost a bit of money, THAT'S ALL. If he is not broke/has a good job, it won't affect him much. Whereas if a man has used a woman to get some kids, and he leaves, she's stuck with the burden of those children for life. Not to mention that as women we have less privileges, sexism in the workplace and everyday life, make less than men...so when a man uses a woman, she loses so fucking MUCH. She truly takes a hit which sets her back due to her sex. 

MEN have been using women's wombs and labour since the beginning of time without their consent...and somehow WOMEN are the ""snakes"" (seriously I see so many men use the word ""snakes"" in place of the word ""women"") and ""gold diggers"" in society....WHAT???

I'll try to keep this short, but he is so very very detrimental to her mental health, and while I have tried to gently guide her while still being supportive, I just breaks my heart to see her this broken and sad, while still making excuses for the man, and still not recognizing that he might very well be the core reason she isnt well. 

Through these years he has:
- Called her fat to her face, and told her the reason he wont move together is becausw she is fat.
- Downloaded tinder twice (first time I almost caught him, having swiped too fast to make sure it was him, I told he wjat I thought I saw, and he of course lied to her face).
- His reason for downloading tinder: She was too sad to have sex with him after a family member passed away.
- He does drugs (cocaine) when he goes out with friends.
- In addition to insulting her straight to her face, he negs. A lot.
- I met him once when we were out for drinks. When I went to the bathroom, he proceeded to tell her I am ""not THAT hot, not a 10"". I don't give a shit what he thinks of me, I'm just appaled by the fact that he thinks it appropriate to rate a woman - and even her best friend! After I returned he proceeded to whip out a nude of her without her consent, in public, for me to see (I have no idea why).


Many of us have been in abusive relationships. I myself have as well, so I know how difficult it can be to see when you're in it, and she keeps blaming her mental state on other different issues in her life. And how difficult it can be to break the trauma bond, and dependence these men create. I'm not sure I would have listened to anyone telling me to leave my narcissistic ex, had anyone tried when I was were she is now.

It was the anxiety that LVMs caused me.

It was not respecting my love languages and boundaries. It was not treating me right. It was tearing me down to build them up. It was gas-lighting. It was constantly fearing being ‘ghosted’ because of lack of communication. It was not realizing ‘if they wanted to, they would.’ It was all talk, no action.

It was having their friend comment to me on his Instagram post so nobody would realize we were a thing. It was getting back together with his ex as soon as he ended things with me when he said I had nothing to worry about. It was him constantly drinking and not hearing from him. It was him ignoring me while he was on social media.

It was trying to force my hips down to sit on his dick when I told him no. It was him telling me I had no clue what I liked because I’m a virgin. It was him rolling his eyes and chastising me for wanting him to wear a condom. It was him thinking he was gods-given creation and I was nothing more than a fuck toy.

For the first time in my life, I know what it’s like to feel...at peace with a guy. That’s the only way I can describe it. Peace. There’s no pettiness, only communication. There’s no overreacting, only understanding one another. There’s no jealously, only respect.

She had just graduated from college and was married to her high school sweetheart. I told her that they were still living with her parents and she asked me why they didn’t have their own house/apartment or why they weren’t living with his parents. She had gotten a business degree this year, so she has the potential for a well paying job. I shrugged and mentioned that he was barber who just finished hair school last year. 

She looked at me dumbfounded.

Her: “Does he own the shop?”

Me: “No he’s working for someone else.”

Her: “Did he go to college?”

Me: “No he just went to barber school”

She did that disappointed African mom sound and said: “You’ve got to have standards. (My name) if you ever come home with a man who’s a barber (or low wage worker) I’m kicking you out of this house. You can only come back once you have sense in you.”

I died laughing but I understood her dismay and anger. She raised me and my sisters to be hard workers with the potential to earn our own money by going to college and taking every opportunity we could. She expects us to have the same standards for any man we date/plan to marry. She doesn’t believe in charity and “giving men a chance.” 

As a woman who is married to a doctor and had her own degree and career before marriage, I could understand her confusion with my ex schoolmate. This ex schoolmate was the daughter of a wealthy father as well. This is what confused my mom the most because her family’s connections meant she was most likely going to follow in her father’s foot steps and become a top earner. 

Regardless, too many women think that men are charity cases that they are obligated to take care of. I’m glad my mother enforced these standards on me growing up because I could’ve easily turned out like her. It’s also a plus that most African cultures shames the type of men American culture has groomed us to believe is okay. Either way, at the end of the day, you’ve got to have standards.",103594,“You got to have standards”,0,,,

That's great for me since I don't want to travel out of my city right now. And I've set some clear rules due to covid and the curfew so:

- not going in or near his car (cannot trust strangers) 
- we will meet in a public place
- we will finish up before 9pm
- I will be going separately home on the tube

Now the question is, how should this date be? He made some suggestions about going to the cinema and then going to eat but I turned it down as I think going to the cinema is inappropriate for a first date. I said we should go for dinner and then a walk around Central London. However, I realised, I don't want to be the one to plan the date again (as I have done in the past) and the dates that men have planned for me have been most enjoyable. When I plan it, I feel that *I*  am making the effort and I don't want to feel that way anymore. 

But, he's the one who is driving down and I do not know if he knows the city well. Does the responsibility now fall back onto me to plan everything ?

TL;DR: we got into a huge fight over some funny pics I took with my girl best friend at the time. He got super angry and jealous calling us “lesbian lovers”. 

So my ex narc and I were in a relationship for 8 years. I was very naive it was my first relationship, we started dating at 16 years old but from what I know he’s definitely a narcissist. Incredibly selfish behavior, projection, gaslighting, triangulation, cheating is what lead us to breaking up when I found  out he got his side chick pregnant. They are now married :) 

I’m 2 years out of the relationship and im finally beginning to see how badly this relationship ruined my college and high school years.

The demon and I had a huge fight in public at a concert I bought tickets for. It was on a Monday night so he had to come from work so we could go to the concert. At that time he didn’t have a car so he took the train to come see me and I met him at the train station to go to the concert together. When I met him there he seemed really annoyed and tired, and I knew he was tired from work. He just wasn’t in the best mood. I tried to make small talk but it didn’t work. Things were fine up until we got to the theater and were sitting down, started getting weird when I was playing on my phone and he asked to see my phone as I was looking at my pics..... 

I don’t mind if he looked through my phone but I don’t know why out of the blue he just asked. He swiped and he saw pics of me with my GIRL best friend. We were having fun on campus in the coffe shop taking pics. And he always gets SUPER SUPER jealous over her. Because her and I have a lot of fun together whenever were together. He starts asking me “soo why do you have so many pics with her??? Are y’all lesbian lovers or something???” Clearly this man is jealous over a woman, that’s my best friend. I can understand a man. But a fucking woman. I don’t remember what I said back because literally I was shocked ? He gave me back my phone. 

Idk what happened next. I think I was already a little annoyed and we started joking around but then I was like talking about my birthday and this man goes “wait when’s your birthday?” It was like really close like Atleast a week away. At this point I was getting pissed ... idk if he was joking or not but I was visibly getting upset. I was getting mad at myself for getting tickets to this but honestly was still really perturbed by the fact he went through my phone and got really jealous over my best friend.... 

I got really quiet and I was like I don’t know how you would forget. That’s it. He got super quiet super standoffish and just wouldn’t talk to me. I tried to calm things down but he was already so far gone in his “anger” stupid me really tried to get him to talk to me. But he wouldn’t. So I tried to move seats, and he wouldn’t do anything. I started leaving the damn place and finally he followed me and we just kept fighting to my dorm (crying by the time we got to my dorm, it got so bad somehow he was threatening to call the police) Really one of the worst nights of my life. Like I bought tickets for this , and I spent money I don’t have. For this. 

I don’t get the jealousy thing over my best friend. To this day I think it’s a control tactic. But also he’d always fight with me thinking I’m cheating. I know that’s projection.

But this was beyond my scope of comprehension and it still is. I’m not ever dealing with this again because I have close friends that I never want to let go of over a fucking loser of a  man. Also I was a broke college student and I bought those tickets for us. Usually he would be the one to buy everything so the fact he didn’t should’ve probably told me he wasn’t interested in going. But anyways. 

This just really bothers me I have no clue why he was so jealous of me and my best friend and now her and I still don’t talk, years after him and I broke up. If you think this is bad and a stupid way to fight, he did this all the time. He just loved drama and he always seemed to do it at big events or on my birthday... this was supposed to be a fun night. It was a night of hell though. I’ve learned now he’s an LVM all the way around, still yet to find a HVM but this was a big learning lesson for me. Just... so eye opening the type of behavior he exhibited and I CHOSE to ignore the red flags and keep going. WHY , I ask myself everyday WHY did I do this to myself.",103571,Im never letting a man dictate who my best friends are. I regret losing my best friend over who I thought was the LOML. Warning pickmeisha stuff here. This was way before I found this reddit. Still trying to wrap my head around why he was jealous of my FEMALE BFF.,0,,,

Like when someone says”he’s stalking my account” or “Ugh, he always messages me”.

I was having this conversation with my older sister and we both acknowledged that less attractive/uglier men seem to harass and stalk us more than classical attractive men. I mean don’t get me wrong, I’ll get attractive men who message me or like my photos, etc. but I tend to notice men who I deem as less classically attractive tend to be the ones I have to block, that constantly message me, lack boundaries, etc. Where as the hot guys in my case will pull the reigns and have more boundaries/come off less creepy online.

Does this seem to happen to anyone else? Not saying I’ve never blocked or got annoyed by a guy who was hot, it just seems to happen less frequently with men I find hot. They’ll play it cool, won’t bother me and will only text or message me strategically. The uglier men will message me all the time, can’t take no for an answer, comment on my statuses on social media, and act overall immature. I’ve definitely had to block a lot more uglier men than hot men if I based it purely on verbal harassment and irritation. 

Is it that uglier men know they won’t win anyway, so might as well try to gain my attention because it’s a lose-lose situation regardless if they don’t? That was my sisters theory.",103542,Does anyone notice this happens to them a lot?,0,,,

It’s well-known that this sub advises against house dates, bevause they’re low-effort and men will see it as an express way to Sexville. However, what’s not spoken about as much is  the physical risk that comes with being in a private space with a man you barely know. 

Most men are stronger than the average woman. It wouldn’t take a lot for a man to overpower, rape, and even kill you. You also need to consider things such as:

1. Untreated mental illness. I’m not saying every person who has a mental illness is violent, but men with an untreated illness can be very dangerous and unpredictable. There’s no way of knowing, early on, if this is the case with a man you’ve just met. He might tell you, but he also might not. 

I know someone, let’s call her Tanya, who used to do home visits as part of her job for a bodybuilder who had schizophrenia. This bodybuilder’s schizophrenia could be managed if he was on medication, but if he wasn’t taking his meds, he could be seriously violent and he knew this. Tanya suffered from narcolepsy, so when she was at this man’s house she would fall asleep. The bodybuilder called Tanya’s workplace, panicking, because he had not taken his medication and was feeling the urge to do something violent. Thankfully, Tanya was safe. But she came very close to being a fatality.  

2. Not every person who commits a crime is apprehended. Background checks can provide further insight into a person’s character and past behaviour, but if they’ve never been arrested, nothing will show up. Monsters don’t hide under the bed - they live, work and socialise amongst us. There are prolific rapists and murderers out there who are looking for their next victim. My supervisor found herself locked in the house of a man who killed his girlfriend. She found herself on her own with him and he locked the door and said “now you’re alone with a murderer”. 

The examples I’ve given above happened in the context of a working environment, where there are robust risk assessments put into place. In the dating world, there are no policies to protect you so it’s up to you to protect yourself. Do not entertain the idea of being alone with a man you’re dating until you’ve properly vetted him. If you live alone, do not disclose this. Say you live with family. When you do go to his house for the first time (after sufficient vetting), tell a friend his full name and address and arrange for your friend to conduct a welfare call during your visit. 

Please be safe out there, ladies.",104411,Why you should never be alone with a man until you’ve vetted,0,,,

I'm still a newbie so I don't entirely understand the complex intricacies of FDS in all variations of life but I do have some questions in regards to religion. Now the religion I'm talking about Is Islam and the culture is Pakistani. I can't speak on other religions as I do not know them or their associated culture. I'm aware that Christianity has some messed up stuff but Judaism, Hinduism etc I'm not versed in at all. I'd like advice from women who are well versed in FDS (however everyone feel free to comment).

So Islam is extremely barbaric in regards to women. The Quran specifically states how women are valued less, weak, not equal, you can beat your wife, you have to have sex whenever etc. The culture around Islam is again very misogynistic, cruel, abusive etc. This isn't a rare occurrence this ia quite common. So in regards to that is FDS against religion? Since if we look at it religion is a means to control all and it heavily comes down on women. The fact that the prophet married a 6yr old. I just can't. In that aspect do we reject this entirely. Also does FDS support the headscarf when worn due to religion since that is a sign of oppression.

People often say that (mostly radical libs) that Islam is feminism it's not. They portray it the same way they portray porn as positive, empowering etc.

I wanna clarify that I didn’t meant that a girl that gives head on the first date is a slut, it was just an exaggeration. I’ll be more literal in the future but forgive me, didn’t knew autists were part of this group too


Also, I know that the male “ideal” version of a woman doesn’t exist, which is okay... that’s why I’m staying single, slaying plates. I just wanted to know why it’s hard for women to understand that we don’t want to date a slut.

That 50/50 means 90/10 for instance. Feminists don't really grasp the issue here, sometimes they can quote statistics on how much of a workload married women take on, but I guess what's missing is a more exact criticism of do nothing men and what Women can do about it. I suppose they are too busy encouraging women to find empowerment by sleeping around than holding standards to men to avoid those situations. 

Men buy milk ONE TIME, and not because they're out of milk but because they were instructed to by their life manager (wife or gf) and think theyre single handedly keeping the relationship together by doing so much. They have no idea what food their kids have at home, but the mental work of looking, remembering, and managing them doesn't qualify as work to them. It's invisible to them, and they think buying milk on their way home is 50% of the work, %60 if they have to try buying a specific kind. Never mind the work pf selecting the best option was done for them. 

My ex loved pointing out that he did sooooo much for me, and complained that I didn't reciprocate. When I asked...what are these things? Because it certainly wasn't that he respected me, it wasn't that he listened, it wasn't even that he gave me things I wanted, or took me places I wanted to go. He didn't even go through the motions of ""doing so much"" and bitched and complained whenever I did anything I wanted.  His response was....he went to work and bought a house. When I didn't want that house, im suppose to clean the fucking house ( pick his socks up off the couch every day) and I'm working too?! and the thing is , I didn't want the arrangement he made with his friend which was a shared mortgage. 💀 he would be working and have a house if i didn't even exist, and he did it for his fucking friend anyway. 

Point is, as you know, they expect your 90 for their 10. Fact is I gave him the same energy back and he felt ""neglected"" bc I didn't praise him for having a dick and being a functioning employee",104361,Finally people who get it,0,,,

The words “female” &amp; “friends” make it seem so harmless and perhaps a positive thing since it maybe signals that he has a supportive nurturing network of friends that happen to be mostly female. Or maybe it even means that he’s supportive and nurturing himself that women like his company enough to stay friends with him. This naive self-projection from us (because we ARE supportive and nurturing) is the cause of the confusion. It is, however, very FAR FROM THE TRUTH. If I could go back in time, I would run at this revelation. 

\-- -- -- 

Speaking from my experience of a  7+years marriage with a LVM who has mostly female friends, what the sentence “Most or All of my friends are females” actually translates into is:

**“Most or All of my friends are PICKMEISHAS”** that:

—Listen to my problems that I don’t trust the males in my network enough to talk to because I’m directly competing with them. My female friends just listen when I talk, like, really listen. 🙄 

—Take care of me, cook for me sometimes, even pick up some groceries for me because they were always going there anyway.

—Accept and laugh at misogynistic jokes because I am cool and my female friends are also cool and know how to have fun. 🙄

—I can exploit emotionally and materialistically in other ways as long as they’re weak enough to pander to my need for validation 🤗

—I even have occasional free sex with, if they’re pretty and desperate enough!

&amp;#x200B;

(The list goes on, please feel free to add)

&amp;#x200B;

Having mostly female friends means he’s just PREDATORIAL. When he's in relationship with you, he’ll just continue to exploit these women (including you) via these so called friendships and at the same time dances with these women around the border of what’s considered appropriate for opposite sex friendship. If you were confused when he said that, it will be 1000x worse now that you're emotionally invested in him.

I used to be a straight A student from K-G to high school and ruined it all in college because of a guy and ended up dropping out to move in with partner thousands of miles away from home. 

I had a business that was a huge success in the beginning but was undermined by a gaslighting, discouraging, piece of sh!#. I gave up on that to go looking for another guy. 

DON'T BE ME. I'm trying to turn things around now that I'm self-aware. It's liberating and nothing is more empowering than not needing anyone permission or opinion to build your own empire.

I need some sobering up and a good shake.

I have been chatting to this dude I met on tinder. We both went away for work and so we haven't met. I wasn't interested at first but he was persistent and told me that he was really interested. Oh boy were the compliments and affection laid on thick over the last month or so. We started chatting more, exchanging all kinds of pictures - pictures of what he was doing and pictures of each other. We spoke on the phone for hours at a time. Three hours, four hours, five hours. We never wanted to get off the phone. It was like we had the world in common.

We have had issues surrounding sex. I stated I didn't want to talk about it until that intimacy was further developed. He made it seem like we had to talk about it. So I caved. He talked about BDSM, his exes (oh my GOD would he not shut up about his exes!), the things he would do to them in the bedroom. It disgusted me and turned my stomach inside out. I thought ""maybe I can just meet him half way"". No.

This week I opened up about my abuse and the next day this man wakes up and tells me he was concerned for his female friend because he had a dream she was in my situation. I snapped - it was my situation? And why no empathy for me? Why no ""I'm so sorry you went through that and I am so hurt for you. Thank you for sharing that""? It would have been the bare minimum. The next night he asks if I ever fantasised about my abuse. We get into a huge fight. Finally, we speak and it's all amended. But now it's flat and dead. I said I didn't want to talk about sex and now he is not at all interested in keeping a conversation going with me.

I am so mad I allowed this to happen. So mad I slipped back into being a damn pick me. I need to cut this dude off. Now.

Please gas me up, I keep finding reasons to just ""wait and see"" and it's just wasting my time.",104677,Gas me up to drop this man,0,,,

Very hard to meet people face to face nowadays. I am new to FDS and realize that my view on gender roles is probably very skewed and I’m here to learn. In no way do I want to be disrespectful!

On tinder it’s so easy to get a date with a guy. However, when I match with a woman, even if they message first, I say “Hey! What’s up?” and they never text back. 

I’ve had only 2 girls involved with me in high school so I have very little experience flirting with other women. 

My usual strategy for both sexes irl is:
“Hey, I think you’re cute. Do you like me/Wanna get together sometime?” *bats eyes + smile + put my hand on top of theirs*

I’ve only ever used that strategy on 2 girls and it worked both times. It always works on guys. Men are incredibly simple creatures and it doesn’t take much for them.

However, I figure now that I’m an adult, I should know how to get the romantic attention of another woman. I just have no idea how to approach them. I didn’t have very many female friends in high school and grew up hanging out with guys. They can’t even tell me how they got their own girlfriends because they themselves don’t know how they did it. But I don’t think I’d want to get advice on flirting from a guy tbh. I want to be respectful because these are other grown women who deserve it. I just have no idea how to ago about that and I’m totally out of my element here.",104676,How do I respectfully flirt with other women?,0,,,

Because they do not want to umderstand.

We waste our time trying to be informative but truth of the matter is, they know. They do. Men are not guilible children who genuinely believe that there is nothing wrong in the way women are treated in this society. And if they do think that they're self-centered and devoid of any empathy so you are NOT changing that either.

I have a huge issue with being polite and kind to everyone. I feel bad if I make someone uncomfortable, I even feel bad winning arguments! And of course that is extended to how I talk to men. But it DOESN'T MATTER how many times you throw statistics on their face because they will keep shouting WHAT ABOUT PATERNITY RIGHTS AHHH FALSE RAPE ACCUSATIONS AHHH etc etc.

I don't give a shit about statistics even though they're right there if you want them. If you wanna know what you have to, look around. Look at who raised you. Pay attention to who does all the housework. Ask yourself if you feel threatened by women. Open your eyes and look at the world you live in. Men are not oppressed and never have been, and if they wanna make themselves out to be, don't waste your time. Just move on. NEVER entertain a relationship with a man like that as well.",104641,Discussing feminism with men who don't want to understand is a total waste of time,0,,,

I know this sub hates BDSM so I didn't want to make a post that sounds too repetitive and just echoes what everyone else says, but since I'm 18 I feel like the input would be maybe a little interesting, considering how much young girls get pressured into the BDSM bullcrap.

Libfems looove to act like BDSM is a ""choice"" and that women should have the fReEdOm to CHOOSE how they want to have sex. Well duh, yeah, unless you're in a situation of sexual abuse it's up to you to consider what you wanna do in bedroom. What they fail to consider, however, is how everything around us shape the choices we make and therefore it's important to criticize *that* as well.

The choices most women make and that libfems call ""empowering"" are ALWAYS things that are already expected of us anyway. It's always wearing makeup. Shaving. Being feminine. Like... **wow**. Groundbreaking. Sorry to burst your bubble but you're not doing anything to help women as a class when you cave in to patriarchal expectations so you feel better about yourself. And I will NEVER make a woman feel bad about doing that because I know how society can be tough and cruel to those of us who actually actively choose to go against the grain, but the moment you start feeling like you are being soooo ~ feminist ~ by doing those things, to me it is time to take a step back and learn what feminism means. Sometimes it comes purely from naive ignorance, which is like, whatever. But sometimes it comes from dishonesty and that's infuriating because libfems purposely set women back in order to bend backwards to appeal to men &amp; still feel like they're doing something. 

And this is where BDSM comes into play. It's a hateful act. It's misogynistic. It's not enjoyable in the least. I'm not gonna police what you do in the bedroom, but for women to come out and act like it's ~ empowering ~ is so blatantly dumb that it makes it hard to even argue against. If a man handcuffed you and choked you and slapped you on any occasion he would be arrested. You take your clothes off and add in penetration and suddenly it's acceptable? It's not freeing. It's not freeing. It's an act of violence disguised as something sexy because your lame boyfriend thinks it's sexy to beat up women. That's what it is. Trust me when I say this: your boyfriend does not give a FUCK about feminism when he's beating the shit out of you and calling you a whore. He doesn't give a fuck about what you feel. He doesn't give a fuck about your rights and freedom and empowerment. His goal is to degrade you as much as he can to get off.

Now ask yourself why. Why is it that he feels like he needs to treat women like lesser beings in order to be turned on? It's sick. And it's the perfect emulation of what has been happening in society since the dawn of time. Men - in general - have ALWAYS learned to enjoy treating women like shit. There's nothing new. You're just taking something straight out of the 15th century and into your bedroom while out of it you claim to be a feminist because society changes and evolves... and it does because people question things, their rights, their treatment. If you don't do the same you'll be stuck in a lifetime of not doing anything at all while reaping the benefits of what women who actually CARE fought for. You. are. useless. You're fighting against yourself to stand for the right of a man to abuse you. You're dumb.

Girls, think about this. Plus your Dominant boyfriend is not some hot, tall, wealthy and strong and alpha male is he? Soooooo. Stop catering to your misogynistic sleazy BF's wishes because he wants to feel better about himself. He probs couldn't dominate a fish if he had fish food on his hands.",105286,"BDSM grosses me out so much. To any women reading this, don't allow anyone to pressure you into doing that.

Just wanted to point out that the movie Mean Girls is a great way to teach younger women about the importance of lifting each other up, rather than putting each other down in the name of being picked by dusty men. 

Fighting over boys and hurting other women only makes things worse for women, and I feel like this movie shows that perfectly!

Only when every young woman started to be honest with each other, communicate, have their own hobbies, and treat each other with respect, were they happy and content.

Excellent, but so disturbing. The most disturbing part was I noticed a pattern I experienced in my last two long-term relationships: the love bomb.

Love bombing is the first step of the idealize/devalue/discard cycle which is typical of narcissists and LVM in general. It's when you first start dating and he loves EVERYTHING about you. It's like he can't do enough for you. Flowers at work. Trips. Non-stop compliments to the point you feel like you can't do anything wrong. Queens - this is not natural or high value because it is insincere! Please be wary of men who are ""too good to be true"" and rapidly accelerate the relationship timeline. Many of these men will be particularly interested in you following a traumatic personal event such as divorce, illness, death in the family, job loss, etc. They are sharks; your vulnerability is blood in the water. 

After the idealization phase, you'll experience the devaluing phase. This is where you can't do anything right, and you are made to feel as though some real or imagined transgression on your end (or boundary setting) has pushed him away and somehow ""tainted"" the relationship. There will likely be less physical affection, attention, security, etc. as you constantly try to win back the LVM's approval to get the relationship ""back on track"" to the love bomb stage. Spoiler alert: It will NEVER go back to the love bomb stage. But him keeping you off-balance and causing you to question what you did to deserve or how you can fix his poor/uncaring treatment is a stealth form of control. Now, he has the upper hand. Other forms of control during this period include gaslighting or the LVM blaming you for their own issues (projection.)  

The final stage is the discard stage. This is when the LVM is no longer is getting what they need from the relationship after draining your energy, self-confidence, and joy. It's when you find yourself tired, depressed, possibly overweight or having financial issues, and have nothing left to give. You are no longer the perfect person to fluff their feathers or be the envy-inspiring candy on their arm.  Your luster is tarnished and they will casually, coldly, or cruelly discard you out of the blue; leaving you to wonder what the hell happened. It's a bewildering and upsetting feeling that has absolutely NOTHING to do with you and EVERYTHING to do with them. 

Unfortunately in the Netflix film this person was also a sociopath and the outcome was tragic. But even without physical abuse the emotional and mental scars this leaves behind can run deep. So please be aware of this toxic behavior (which has been published in peer-reviewed psychiatric journals as almost solely being exhibited by men.)  Knowledge is power! Arm yourself to avoid these therapy-couch-needing scrotes.",101785,Watch Out For Love Bombing!!! (Idealize/Devalue/Discard cycle),0,,,

Two were long term relationships. Of those men, FOUR had trouble staying hard - none were long term boyfriends. Only one made me cum with little instruction from me - he also didn’t watch porn and was very patient. My second serious boyfriend didn’t have trouble staying hard but was a massive porn addict, and was proud of his sexual prowess but actually could never make me cum and made super anxious about my anatomy. He would say I was complex and didn’t give enough instruction, but when I did try and give instructions he would get annoyed. He would even get annoyed if I placed his hand to show him where to touch me. In the end we only ever had sex with a vibrator. The last man I was with was for a short time, he also didn’t watch porn and was really wonderful in a lot of ways but I was def not ready for anything and didn’t prioritize my own pleasure due to my sexual experiences with my ex. So all in all, no man has ever managed to give me an orgasm without serious effort on my part. I’ve noticed how so often on tv women will have these sexual escapades where she would have two orgasms in one night from some complete stranger and I just have never heard that happening to anyone I know? It feels like another lie of lib feminism trying to make out like there is just as much to be gained for women from casual sex as there is for men. What are your experiences? Part of me worries maybe there really is something “difficult” about me anatomically, even though I can give myself an orgasm in minutes and I know logically these men were just lazy and entitled.",102334,How many men have actually given you orgasms?,0,,,

I’ve realized all the guys who ignored me, started to message me, why’d you delete social media? 

This is why, I’m tired of comparing myself to people, I’m tired of using filters to make myself look like someone I’m not constantly, it literally had to change the shape of my chin to feel good when I was taking a photo. I’m tired of talking to people and not ever seeing them in real life.
I’m tired of guys online who stay online. 

I’m tired of guys ogling my photos so they can see where I stand in their eyes based on how they perceive my life is doing on social media.

I’m tired of people who don’t want to give effort and only want to text instead of ever calling and being personable. 

I am working on myself, I recently got a second job serving lunches at my kids school, I am anti social trying to break free from my silence. 
It is hard.

It’s hard ignoring my ex, it’s hard ignoring all the lvm who message me and I don’t respond to.  It’s like trying to  fill  in the void of feeling social, yet I know these men are just playing games. 

The on and off messages, the gets super close then pushes me away, the lets meet up sometime but I’m SUPER BUSY”, the ex just is a case of jeckyll and Hyde severe hot cold. 


The hardest thing to do is block them for me, it’s the only bit of social connection I seem to get. I read it even if I don’t respond. 

It’s hard not to let go of the hurt from my ex. I wish I had a close friend who had similar interests and also liked FDS. 

Yes I’ve tried bumble for friends, I’ve tried patook, I have random people come up to talk to me in public saying they like my hair ( I do bright colors). Yet still I am just struggling to meet friends and keep relationships. So I am having a hard time doing the right thing and blocking, it’s hard to not have any notifications on your phone at all(text and msger because all media is gone)  

I go for walks with my daughter, I like to draw, I work out, I like to dance and sing to karaoke( even though I haven’t in years, more at home alone recently :P ). I try getting out of the house, I don’t know what else to do other than continue working both jobs, and keep trying to be strong.

It sucks knowing I might get alot of dislike for writing this. For not following the rule, and continuing to read the messages but it’s the only little parts of social connection I seem to have right now.",102330,Having a hard time with the blocking of certain lvm due to lack of social connection with friends.,0,,,

I understood why in theory, but as someone who tends to let her emotions run away with her I knew this  would be my uphill battle. Here’s my journey to realising why, in case anyone can learn something from this, or needs a reminder about why FDS is the way to avoid wasting your time or emotions on a dead-end situation. 

I had a crush on a coworker. Successful, charming, powerful, seemingly interested. He initiated contact, brought me chocolate and candy, initiated many coffees in the office, told me jokes to make me laugh, complimented my outfits, my lipstick, flirted respectfully, teased me softly, showed some mate guarding behaviours around other single male colleagues, shared personal information, publicly indicated interest in me in the office, ticked ALL the body language boxes that indicate attraction. I could go on. 

But today I finally realised it’s going no-where and I need to redirect resources PRONTO. What made this crystal clear? 

1. I suggested coffee over a month ago (I know, forgive me I’m learning), and while he said he’d ‘love to’ he never chased it up. However, all aforementioned “false positive” behaviours continued.

2. He has not asked me on a date, despite daily interactions and ample opportunities. We’re friendly, we joke and chat often, he’s confident. There is no excuse. 

3. Except for casually suggesting coffee I have mostly matched his energy and investment. He pulls back and acts cool? So do I. He’s too busy to talk? So am I. He stops smiling and greeting me? Neither do I. However, I recognised a pattern whereby he would respond to me pulling back by a grand gesture, seeking me out, re-engaging. I took this as interest...but the key here is inconsistency. I’ll elaborate later. 

4. He acts differently if certain people are around, or makes an attempt to show he’s friendly with other women or colleagues when I’m nearby. This is a type of situational gaslighting. He’s not flirting with me, he’s like this with everyone, see? 

5. Despite MANY conversations he rarely asked me specific questions about myself. However, he talked about himself quite often. I took this as an opportunity to listen and observe, and initially thought it might be a good indication he was trying to impress me. It’s not.

6. Sometimes interactions felt like a dance, a competition of sorts, like he was dancing around an invisible threshold of propriety or how much he wanted to reveal. I thought he was nervous or not sure if I was interested, I made sure to indicate interest by my responses to his actions...but this continued.

7. Then something magic happened. Because I’ve been investing in myself, my confidence, my self esteem, my fitness, my work, and largely keeping this flirtation on the periphery (after an initial period of obsessing over him), more men are noticing me, and approaching me at work. Girls, he noticed, and did his usual re-engage schtick...

BUT today I introduced myself to a new man in the office who started a few weeks ago. Ladies, let me TELL YOU. He was nervous...he looked at my lips and also checked my ring finger WITHIN SECONDS of us talking. He asked me about myself, his body language was engaging and he wasn’t paying attention to anything else while we spoke. Something about his demeanour made me feel like the DAMN PRIZE! In 5 minutes he more clearly indicated interest than the guy I’ve been crushing on. He’s younger, in a more junior role, and less of a social hustler than Mr Crush...but that’s all it took for me to realise that a man can tick boxes and it means nothing if he can’t make you feel how he values you, not just how he’s attracted to you. 

So what’s Mr Crush’s deal? Here’s my break down:

1. He finds me attractive, hence all the positive body language.

2. He enjoys the attention he gets from me. It makes him feel good to have the attention of a beautiful and intelligent woman, he enjoys that other men see this too. That’s why he mate guards despite not being my mate...he’s gently indicating ownership to other men without giving me ANY of the benefits of a partnership, nor meeting any of the responsibilities. 

3. He appears to be dancing close to an invisible threshold because he is...the limit to which he can go without me calling his bullshit and asking what’s up. So he’s always just shy of overt consistent interest, why he hasn’t asked me on a date or chased up the coffee I foolishly suggested, why his behaviour fluctuates. 

4. He likes the sense of control this situation gives him...which is why he increases engagement and reaches out when I match low effort...because he fears loosing control, and loosing my attention. 

5. He enjoys the validation he gets from talking about himself, but isn’t genuinely interested in my as a person beyond what I can provide to make HIM feel good. That’s why he rarely asks me specifics on myself. 

6. He’s smart, so he ensures he “social gaslights”, so if I confront him he can claim ignorance, and say he’s just friendly and that’s how he is. It also allows HIM to appear available to other women despite dissuading men from approaching me. 

Phew....so I’ve just unpacked this all today. It’s a lot. 

What am I going to do? Not a single thing in regards to him. This crush is dust, and I’m not going to let him waste another minute of my very expensive time. I’m staying open to opportunities, and will not be talking to him around other men or allowing him to passive aggressively mate guard. My options are open, hell, maybe this new cutie will develop into something? Maybe not. But either way I’m good. 

Don’t let men monopolise your time. 

Don’t let men limit your options by mate guarding while providing nothing.

Don’t build up his ego when he hasn’t built you ANYTHING. 

When he finds you attractive and likes the attention and social prestige you bring he can appear to tick a lot of boxes, over a long period of time and sometimes quite consistently. 

When he’s interested in you and values you you’ll feel it strong, and early, and it will make you feel like the prize, from the first conversation. 

Dating isn’t charity. Don’t donate to a liability that limits your options, look for a man who invests in you fully.",102999,"FDS, crushes, and redirecting your resources",0,,,

But just recently, I was on the phone with my best friend heartbroken and upset as hell that the guy who I thought we had a good thing going on ended it out of nowhere and left me entirely blindsided.

While my best friend was compassionate and empathetic as per usual, her boyfriend was being a soulless piece of shit. He told her that the dude was most likely just playing me out of boredom and that the explanation he gave me for ending things was almost like the blueprint for men when they want to play the good guy card. If he had just stopped there, I would have taken this as a harsh realization but he went further and added, “I used to do that to other girls. You don’t know what it’s like to lead them on and then just leave them. The high is so good.” 

My best friend almost felt proud that she was the chosen one. I made her put me on speaker so I could tell him, “I wouldn’t know what that feels like because I’m not a piece of shit.” 

We’ve all made mistakes and hurt other people one way or another. We can’t change the past but the least we can do is admit that we were shitty and that the people we hurt did not deserve our shittiness at all. Then we make amends and hold ourselves accountable. We don’t shrug it off. 

If my future boyfriend were to admit this without remorse, I would break up with his ass. If you respect women, you respect ALL of them. Not just the one you’re dating.",102994,Possible red flag: if he justifies his past shitty actions with other women instead of taking accountability.,0,,,

This one guy who is 21 was shocked to learn in a group conversation that I'm 23 years old because I look like a teen (I'm 5'0) anyways, we exchanged names and made funny small talk. 

I mentioned that I grew up in the same town he currently lives in and I jokingly said ""yeah I left because I'm too good for that neighborhood."" (My family moved because it's the ghetto) and he pretended to be offended by that and acted like I was high maintenance (well, duh)

By the end of the day he asked me to repeat my name again for him and he asked me if I remember his and I did and he was surprised. He seemed like a decent guy to chat with until: 

The next day on the job he forgot my name again and asked me for it and this time I mentally rolled my eyes and said ""well, I already said it twice, I'm not repeating it again, you can meditate on it if you want to figure it out. Good luck."" 

This has happened many times before with other peers in my lifetime and I stopped bothering to repeat myself to get people to care. 

Honestly I don't have a common name but if a guy is interested in me- its decent respect to remember that stuff. He kept making excuses like ""I just have horrible memory"" and ""omg I SUCK so hard at meditating. My mind cant just stay still you know???"" And I basically silently lol'd because his immaturity was showing and he really thought he was hitting it off with me. 

He thought me not repeating my name was a challenge and kept trying to flirt with me and said ""alright, for now I'll call you *likkle brown ting*"" (hood slang for: little brown girl) and kept bringing up the fact that hes surprised about my age, and then when I asked why he was that surprised he just gestured with his hand that I'm tiny and small (as if adults can't be short??) 

Every time this guy had to walk past me, he would playfully hit me by poking me, tapping my head, lightly punching my shoulder etc and I would just ignore it because it honestly seems like 10 year old behaviour. I would mainly talk to other like minded workers in the group and joke around with them and he would keep coming in when I would say something or do something that he liked and say ""OKAY...OKAY I SEE YOU. OKAY LOOK AT YOU GO. OKAAAAAAAAAY."" 

Me: *stares into the camera like the office* 

Anywho, he would keep pestering about my name and by the end of yesterday, the convo went like this-

""Alright now you must tell me your name! Cmon this was fun and all but you can't just leave me like this."" 

Me packing up my stuff: nah. 

""Woooow okay. So you are gonna give me your IG so I can figure it out?""

Me: I don't have Ig

""Okaaaay, *claps hands* let's just get this over with- so that number tho?""

Me: *looks up with a fake smile* I don't give my number to people who don't know my name. 

""Ahhhh DAMNNN so it's like thaaaat???""

Me: ye. 

He tried guessing it a couple times. Got it wrong and was like ""aight, imma take this L"" 

The end. Lmao hope you enjoyed the audacity. 

Today it got me thinking about that weird *playful* hitting behaviour and how childish it is to get a strangers attention like that. Younger guys are usually respectful towards me  *in comparision* to older guys because they seem to respect people they think knows more than them in both knowledge and experience. 

I'm trying to understand the psychology of the touching and the whole acting hood thing to impress a girl and demeaning her height thing. Normally older guys in my experience have been the ones who pick on looks and try to make you feel small, but the fact that this younger dude 1. Thought he had a chance and 2. Used my height as a way to bring me down to his level to make himself feel more masculine. I just can't help but laugh that they think its a turn on or something.",103512,Why tf do guys playfully hit women they are interested in? Signs of immature flirting and hood mentality.,0,,,

I hate the narrative that you're supposed to ""snag"" a man. No woman *needs* a man to be happy. You're independent, self-suficient and amazing, and anyone who comes into your life shouldn't be filling a hole. You are whole on your own. Marriage often sucks for women. I know it's said a lot on this sub, but it's true. Women always end up doing all the work around the house, the emotional labor AND having a job outside of that. And raising the kids! 50/50 is bullcrap. For straight marriages it's more like: man goes to work, women does all the rest AND goes to work. 

So ladies, put yourself first. I know it's easier said than done and this is just words, and of course it's not because you read something that you will all of a sudden leave a bad place or stop wanting a relationship. But this is a reminder that women are wonderful and we can do SO MUCH for ourselves on our own. You are beautiful. So put yourself first. 💙",103498,Reminder: you do not need anyone but yourself.,0,,,
