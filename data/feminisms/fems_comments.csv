 ""More females attempt suicide than males.
(3 female attempts for each male attempt.) "" 

The data is from the US, and considering that women don't outnumber men 3:1, I would conclude that a higher percentage of women attempt suicide.  I was trying to make a point, and I understand your objection, but it isn't factually incorrect.  

As for not being interesting, being common knowledge, obscuring details and being sensationalist (in fact, I believe that the simultaneous accusations of being uninteresting and sensationalist point to a logical flaw), I have to say that I disagree.  Part of the conversation here and on other areas of reddit are the statistical breakdown of suicide attempts by gender.  The purpose of this fact-sheet posting was to call attention to the fact that it's not so simple as one often-repeated number that is commonly used as some sort of marker of oppression.  I'm obviously talking about the 80% of suicides being male in the US as a signifier of male oppression in Men's Rights communities.  I assume from your assumption that women's attempts of suicide being common knowledge that you work in or have a personal interest in a field related to the science of behavior.  Suicide is not a simple nor clear marker of societal oppression.

Feuilly,,,"I agree with you about some of the fact sheet. My issue was mainly that choice that you used for the headline.

When I say it's not interesting, I mean because it conveys mostly common knowledge and obscures the details while also being sensationalist.

It doesn't concern itself with the number of women versus the number of men that attempt suicide, but instead the number of times. And also since it reduces it to a comparison, so it doesn't even cover the actual number of times that suicide is attempted. The way the information is presented in the section on students is much more useful as a basis for comparison, but unfortunately it's only focused on a particular age group.

&gt; I do think that the fact that women attempt suicide more than once, after having been intervened on previously is interesting to clinicians in the treatment of depression, bi-polar and other illnesses that commonly lead to suicidal behaviors.

The thing with this is that while you and I both know that women often attempt suicide more than once based on our superior (to the fact sheet) knowledge about this subject, the fact sheet doesn't specifically indicate any such thing. It could quite possibly be a case where 2-3x (or more) women are simply attempting suicide once, and that's why the rate is 2-3x that of men. So while that is sort of interesting but also common knowledge, it's not something that is actually even supported by this fact sheet.

Oh shoot. And I just noticed that they are referencing that WHO study that the other person cited and the reason I didn't see it that way before was that I was misreading the fact sheet. So the wording on the CDC fact sheet isn't even accurate as to what the WHO report says, since the WHO report was specifically talking about suicide attempts that doesn't result in death.

http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/03/11/faq-what-is-male-privilege/

It's very difficult to see one's own privilege. This is exactly why those with privilege must learn about it through the experiences of people without it. We learn about the damage white privilege does by listening to the experiences of people of color- if we didn't listen to them and accept what they're telling us as the truth, life would continue business as usual, including the damage done every day. 

People with privilege don't *mean* to have it, and don't *mean* to use it- it's the water they swim in as fish. It's so omnipresent and so colors their world that they can't see it. That's why we need birds outside the water to point at the fish and say, ""You're swimming in water."" Of course the fish won't believe the birds right away, and the only way for the fish to really see the water is for it to listen to the birds and try to imagine life as a bird.

Also, while I absolutely loathe when people use, ""people won't care about STI prevention as much with pregnancy as a lower risk,"" as an argument for not providing other forms of contraception, it is naive to completely discount these worries. There are a significant amount of heterosexual people who have pregnancy as the primary concern, with concern over STI's as only incidental to this. We should always move towards increasing reproductive freedom and choice, but we also have the responsibility to exercise due diligence in public health awareness, which sometimes seems to be forgotten, or ignored when gainsaying those who would withhold Plan B and similar contraception on this fetid justification.

That's not at all what I'm saying. I'm simply saying that you don't make an argument that is clearly wrong and has racist analogues. You can still be careful around men, just as I will often feel uncomfortable (often for illegitimate reasons) when walking by a group of young people of color. The difference, however, is that I don't try to justify it by saying that people of color are Schrodinger's mugger, because I recognize that's a shitty argument that makes someone's identity the problem.

The fact that you are more likely to be raped by a man than anyone else is irrelevant to this being a terrible argument. If it were the case that you are more likely to be mugged by a person of color, that wouldn't justify saying all people of color are Schrodinger's mugger. Even more telling is that people can and HAVE made that argument, because it is pretty easy to cite prison population racial statistics to support nonsense like that.

So I'll say it again: I'm not saying rape isn't an important issue for feminism. I'm not saying that women can't be wary or careful about sexual abuse. What I'm saying is that they should not use this ONE argument because it's an irrational argument, because there are PLENTY of good arguments for why women should be concerned about rape that don't invoke this awful argument.",0,1327292963,,0,c3jnwju,t3_onnem,11.0,t1_c3jjyk8,23220,1428222906,1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,,,,0

I think it comes down to types of responsibilities. We are obviously obligated not to rape another person. We probably are not obligated to shuffle our feet in dark alleys or wear longer skirts in bars; however, we should do those things, in the former because it decreases social tension and in the latter because it decreases rape targeting.

But, and this is an important but, the responsibilities are different in kind.

syrinkitty,,,"&gt;Pinkie Pie's song

In context of the show, we're talking about scary monsters, not rapists - her song was about how you shouldn't let fear stop you from doing what you need to do. I can't talk about sexual abuse as it is (fortunately) not within my life experience. I can talk about emotional abuse, and the hardest part over the years was overcoming the fear, and being able to say the words, ""You don't scare me."" In that context, Pinkie's song made perfect sense to me.

&gt;was he oblivious to the extent to which Applejack was depleting herself?

She probably sugar-coated her exhaustion to him as much as she did to the rest of the friends. (""No, I can handle it! I don't need any help!"") In the end, she learns that asking for help is a good idea if you find yourself burning out due to over-working yourself - don't get hurt over mis-placed pride. That ends up being the lesson of the story.

&gt;But, she doesn't seem to voice her objections, and her exasperation suggests that she thinks it's hopeless. ... Did Spike in his crush learn anything about Rarity other than her name?

No, but finding someone physically attractive is a common way people get to know each other. I don't see it as such a big deal. Spike and Rarity also develop a healthy relationship over time.

What I did find funny was the episode *Diamond Dogs* where Spike has fantasies of rescuing Rarity, completely buff and god-moding his way through a horde of enemy minions like a hero rescuing a princess, only to find that Rarity rescued herself in the meantime. (You could make the argument that Rarity's 'lesson' glorified sociopathic behaviour by turning it into a survival technique against her captors, though. I'll give you that.)

I also didn't find Twilight's reaction all that amiss. She was clearly frustrated by them, and didn't condone their behaviour. They were essentially just being groupies wanting to get in on some of their leader's fame. I don't really see that as lustful behaviour.

&gt;I just worry about how media packages femininity.

I completely understand, but honestly... this is as good as it gets. A lot of your complaints are nitpicks, although I will concede the fact that the show doesn't really give any time to the male characters. But then again, it's supposed be a show about girls, because there are already oodles of shows that focus on boys and relegate the females to eye-candy. But the characters are diverse, and they are accepted for who they are, without being forced to be someone else at their own expense. 

Moreover, in the MLP universe, women having the ability to be capable and independent (without being the hostile-to-men-butch-stereotype) is taken as a *matter of fact.* Women running small businesses and being intellectual, athletic or entrepreneurs are considered *normal,* even if they're married to someone (Mr. and Ms. Cake work together to run the business at Sugar Cube Corner).

Walking_Punchline,,,"&gt; I'm still somewhat disturbed with the notion of dealing with assailants by being positive: Pinkie Pie's reactions to the assailants seem to be pleasant disarmament, and I really doubt whether that's actually an effective tactic.

Because that's not really the point.  The message is about irrational fears of the dark and that kind of thing; it's a message for children, with childish fears, not for adults.

With Pinkie Pie's song, your suggestion that the tears might indicate joy is a good one. (Honestly, the possibility didn't really cross my mind.) I'm still somewhat disturbed with the notion of dealing with assailants by being positive: Pinkie Pie's reactions to the assailants seem to be pleasant disarmament, and I really doubt whether that's actually an effective tactic. I mean, I dunno. I'm a dude, and sexual violence is pretty much the shittiest thing ever, so I'm eager for more information.

And as for Applejack's brother: It's pretty alarming that we don't ever see him complain even once about how hard Applejack is working herself. The beginning of the episode involved the brother challenging Applejack's ability to work. Applejack obviously takes this as a challenge, and her brother does nothing.

Yes, it's clear that there are deserving women who should be in seats in parliament, and are not due to societal reasons, but with any societal change, the main movement has to be from the bottom up, not the top down.

syrinkitty,,,"&gt;I'm worried about what's going on especially around 1:00. ""Laugh at your assailant, ha ha ha!"" Pinkie pie even gets tears in her fucking eyes.

She's crying in laughter. Look at the context again. Her lesson is that you're better than your assailant, and that you don't have to let your fear of them control your actions. How is that a bad message?

&gt;Also, there's that episode where Applejack's brother coldly cajoles her into working herself beyond the point of injury, and his behavior is never called out as abusive. (The episode ""Applebuck Season"")

It's actually Applejack that convinces Big Mac to take some time off so he doesn't get even more hurt than he is originally, much to his dismay. The moral story of the episode is how you should ask your friends for help when you're in over your head. How is that pressuring her?

&gt;And then, there are those two ""dumb boys"" who summon the giant bear into the town in ""Boast Busters"": I guess you have to be stupid to fall for a conniving bitch. 

&gt;And then there's the time in the first episode, where Spike basically eye-humps Rarity, and Twilight basically says ""boys will be boys."" 

What? It's been proven time and time again throughout the series that Spike's love for Rarity is an innocent boyish crush, and that people can get very silly when in love. Nowhere does Twilight say ""boys will be boys"" - if you can provide a citation from the show, I'd like to see it. 

&gt;There's probably something similar going on with how Rainbow Dash relates to that ""punk"" griffon, since she seems to be the more traditionally masculine; but I feel less comfortable making that direct association.

The point of that episode was that you shouldn't let one friend abuse and invalidate your other friends. How is that a bad message?

&gt;I guess what bothers me the most is, it's a princess-wins story made around an explicitly gendered toy franchise.

How? The ones who ""win"" are the main six characters, who use their special abilities to overcome adversity. Twilight Sparkle uses intellect, Rainbow Dash uses her athletic ability, Applejack uses her common-sense know-how, and so on. How does that translate to a ""princess-wins"" story?

And that article you linked is the most contrived thing I've read in a long time as well. If we go by ""fur colour = skin colour"" racism logic, then does that mean Fluttershy is representative of asians due to being yellow? Or how about Big Mac and Native Americans, due to being red? What does that make Twilight Sparkle, being violet? 

&gt;P.S. There's some HUGE class issues in the show as well.

Yes, primarily that being a high-socialite comes with its price, and that people in the ""upper crust"" of society can be fair-weather, judgemental and cruel. Have you not seen ANY of the episodes surrounding Rarity? This is practically the basis of her character development - having to deal with judgemental socialites who attempt to discredit or snipe at her self-confidence while still being true to herself. 

If you want to use the two princess's as examples, for one, Princess Celestia tries to be as hands-off as possible and let Twilight Sparkle figure it out for herself, and Princess Luna is so borderline-crazy that people are terrified of her presence. The entire society of MLP is based on neo-paganism with living immortal goddesses. They don't so much ""win"" as they do ""exist.""

It feels like you're taking little snippets from the show completely out of context, and basing your entire idea of the show on them. 

EDIT: here's a retort from the creator of the show herself.

crosscanyon,,,"&gt;This riveting brochure explains that “women move differently than men.” This differentude, implies the brochure, is because of a deformity afflicting the entire sex class: “wider hips and a lower center of gravity.” Or, in clinical terms, “cooties.”

Just wow. Didn't the writer knowingly buy shoes from a company that separates women's styles from men's styles? She bought a pair of WOMEN'S hiking boots and then was outraged when it came with a pitter-patter pamphlet explaining why the specific style caters to women.

Until the last twenty years or so, biomechanical research focused on the male foot and gait. Now the kinesiologists that work with shoe companies are trying to develop designs outside of the old male-centric paradigms. It's going to take women's footwear a few years to catch up and normalize, and until then, the onus lies with differentiating women's shoes from men.

What is the author trying to say? That the product is fine but the ""layman's explanation"" marketing materials are not? That female physiology isn't different enough from male physiology to require different footwear? That all shoes should be unisex? (I wouldn't want that, my heels don't fit in men's shoes. They chafe too much. Who do I blame? Damn my sexist heels and/or the sexist designers of shoe heels!)

[deleted],,,"&gt;Now of course, one could reasonably argue that these are just anonymous comments on the internet however, it is this very anonymity that allows people to say their truth.  Granted, this truth is a hateful truth, but it is extremely reflective of society's attitude towards single mother's and women's sexuality. The truth of the matter is that not all children are welcome in this world.  Poor women who have children are often considered to be reckless whores, even though the western world has fallen behind replacement rates.  This is about controlling women's bodies and forcing conformity.

thismachine,,,"I only skim read this, but I agree - this cis man shouldn't be pushing for his child to use the word ""cunt"". Not that there's a problem with people who *do* have cunts using the word themselves, because they're reclaiming it, but it's touchier when someone who doesn't have one, and especially a cis man, to decide to use it and push it on others.

Personally, I think that using the word ""cunt"" in a context of reclaiming and all is awesome. I use it sometimes. It does, however, depend on the context - I wouldn't use it with a doctor, and I wouldn't use it in front of, say, elderly relatives. Not just because of the word ""cunt"" in a misogynistic context, but actually because it *is* slang that carries impolite connotation. I wouldn't use words like ""cock"", ""arse"", or ""shit"" with people who might feel uncomfortable with them or where it might be out of place.

I'm personally in favour of simply using terms like ""vulva"", ""penis"", ""clitoris"", ""testicles"", ""vagina"", ""labia"". Those are terms used if they see a doctor or if they crack open an encyclopedia. They're usually appropriate in most contexts. It also sounds much less subjective to me. In a discussion about sexuality, I'd use these. I find that even slang words can be similar to euphemisms, in that they're not as precise, and ultimately, they're less ""scientific"". In explaining sex to my kids, or discussing sex with fellow adults, these are words I'd use. ""Cunt"", like about half a ton of euphemisms, can refer to any part of the vulva. Using the actual words is more precise and sounds less like we're making sex a huge deal, if this makes sense. It also makes it easier to answer kids' questions, and for them to be able to compare a textbook diagram with their own parts and have a name for everything. It makes up for a better understanding of our own anatomy without any particular connotation. 

I'm all for that little girl choosing that word for herself eventually. But for now, really, teaching her words like ""vulva"" would be much more logical and similar to the reason why her brothers were taught to say penis. 

I apologise if I'm rambling, I haven't had any coffee today yet so my wording of this might be a little terrible. My point is that using more scientific terminology is more precise (and that can be helpful when explaining things, reading on their own, etc) and it's far more neutral. I'd want my kids to think of sex as something that is neither good nor bad - if they like it and they're partners are consenting and safe, etc then it's fine, but it's also ok if they don't like it and they shouldn't feel pressured to. Of course, the fact that in several contexts the connotations of sex do change is something I'd discuss with them in their own time, and I'd obviously explain ""cunt"" and reclaiming, and all that, but whether they wanted to use ""cunt"" or some random euphemism is something that would be up to them.

Finally, I wanted to point out that I take some issue with the title. I understand if it's got to do exclusively with the little girl mentioned in the article (though I'm not sure how much of it is her own identification and how much is her father identifying her as a woman/girl/whatever) but in general I'd hardly assume that a child with a vulva is a ""her"". There's plenty of people with vulvas who prefer other pronouns and have other gender identities. Again, if I had a child who was old enough to speak I'd simply use the pronouns according to what they preferred, even if their choices changed according to their understanding of what it all means.

Suggesting I'm too dim to understand subtlety is a totally condescending move, and I'm not going to let get away with that. Thanks for posting that so that I know to make this my final comment. Final word is yours if you want it. I don't care, you've completely turned me off of this debate. Mission Accomplished.

The tone of your comments over all is that you are *concerned* that in some way, shape or form the model, because of her age, is being exploited for financial gain by adults, right? And the vehicle of the (supposed, assumed, made up) exploitation is child sexualization which further commodifies the child and female form. Am I close? I'm going to assume so. Moving on:

&gt;Nobody is saying that she's being molested on-set or sold into slavery. 

You're totally right. No one has explicitly said that, however you've mentioned time and time again that she is being sexualized and exploited. When I hear that I think of cases where young girls *are* sexually abused and exploited. I then compare the two examples and see that they are not similar. In one, the model is doing this on her own free will (I won't assume that she's forced into this because an assumption based on zero evidence doesn't hold any water) the other is not doing on their own free will which is a huge problem. Okay? Cool. 

My point is this: the logical escalation of worry is that we assume that because there are girls who are, or have been, sexually exploited this one will be too, hence my references to pedophiles. Everyone is concerned that this type of sexualization of a child will only ""endanger,"" or make her a target, to perverts and pedophiles. In this **particular** case, I disagree that this is happening here. I don't believe her controversial picture is inherently sexualized, I don't believe that she is being coerced.

I made some parallels that you ignored, but one that I just thought of is Tavi of Style Rookie. She began taking pictures of herself for her blog at 12. Now, I don't believe her shots to be sexualized, and she does have full creative control of the content is produces but she was a child posting pictures of herself onto the internet. Was she too young to know what she was doing? Was she just old enough that she thought she knew what she was doing? Were her parents encouraging her or exploiting her in the hopes that she'd make it big?

Where do we draw the line? Should models be 18+ like porn actresses? Then what would that say about the fashion industry as a whole? You suggest that the fashion industry is built on, and is driven by sex, but the model also posed in children's fashion magazines. Are children's fashion magazines exempt from scrutiny? 

Fashion and fashion photography drive commerce. But they are inherently works of art. At what point do we begin to censor art work? The nude-portrait of the Australian girl was in protest of that. That's my biggest problem with this whole situation. This is where I exit the conversation. If you choose to reply I'll read it but I've invested a bit too much time on this and I have some errands I have to do. Wish I could say it was a pleasure.

Literally nobody said that. You're going buck-wild with hyperbole and exaggeration, ain't ya?

**Finally, I think you kind of missed the point entirely.** The point isn't that A. This model is being held at gunpoint or B. These photographs will instantaneously transform model citizens into pedophiles. I see that subtlety isn't exactly your strong suit here, but try to follow along.

It's problematic that adults are demanding, adults are paying for, adults are arranging situations in which this child is shown in a sexualized way. It's problematic that this is a general trend in the fashion industry. It's problematic that people are using ""But! Art! Artistic intent! Saying it's art makes it infallible!"" as an excuse, because it's doesn't--real people are involved, people who are **too young to know what they're doing, but just old enough that they *think* they know what they're doing**. Nobody is saying that she's being molested on-set or sold into slavery.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the odds of getting jumped at the bar I like to go to. 

True. I venture only to coffee bars, I do not imbibe alcohol, and I cannot afford legal fees associated with violent confrontation. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about “vote fraud” theater showing up at my poll station. 

A single vote makes no difference from an economic perspective, and I do not vote. Were I to vote, I would expect to respect the independently verified and verifiable paper-trail left by all other voters. Electronic voting machines do not afford this test. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about turning on the news to see people planning to burn my holy book.

True. I am an atheist. However, when I was a libertarian I was appalled by the dismissal of the United States Constitution by those who swore to uphold it.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about others demanding I apologize for hateful people who have nothing to do with me. 

That really depends on the what happens following this post. I am a male.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about my child being seen as a detriment to my career. 

I do not have children, nor a career.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the irony of people thinking I’m lucky because I can park close to the door. 

I am honestly aghast that any would consider legally handicapped (I presume) people as ""lucky"" for their conditions.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about memories of being bullied in high school. 

That is correct, and I choose not to think about such things.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about being told to relax, it was just a joke.

Today, I am less militant in my response to those who proclaim (presumably) teasing to be, ""just a joke."" I do, however, calmly talk to these people to discover why they said what they did, and help them understand it as well. This creates many awkward moments, but *occasionally* someone will gain perspective, for their own benefit, as to why they felt it was advantageous to tease another person.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether someone thinks I’m in this country illegally. 

True, nor do I think that of others since those who permit people beyond an imaginary line on the ground have nothing to do with me.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about those who believe that freedom of religion ends with mine. 

I am concerned of such things, though mildly.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how a half-starved 23-year-old being a cultural ideal affects my life. 

And I wish that I never allowed it to impede my life, but I still think about it.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how much my life is circumscribed by my body. 

Yet, I do. Even though it is a choice I make every day, I do this.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about people wanting me cured of loving who I love.

But I do think of them, for they are perpetuating evil in the world and a crime on humanity.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about those who view me an unfit parent because of who I love. 

I am not a parent, nor do I expect to be within the next decade.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about being told my kind don’t assimilate.
 
I do not understand what that means. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about people blind to the intolerance of their belief lecturing me about my own. 

And I never should have. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about my body as a political football. 

I take it this ""political football"" is that of a woman's right to choose to abort an organism gestating inside of her. I don't have to worry about that. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how much my own needs wear on those I love.

Why would I not think about how my needs affect the ones I love? If I love them, then of course I am going to think about their welfare. If I not concerned about their welfare, I don't think it can be say that I actually love them.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about explaining to others “what happened to me.” 

This is always a choice. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about politicians saying bigoted things about me to win votes. 

This is true, and it is one of the reasons I stepped away from investing personal time and money in politics. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about those worried that one day people like me will be the majority. 

That statement says a great deal. I cannot change the minds of everyone, and I can barely affect the minds of a few. It is very sad, but many people repeat rhetoric rather than think. I have not found conversation in that type of instance productive.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about someone using the name of my religion as a slur. 

That is true. I do not have to think about it. Doing so is a choice.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about so many of the words for me controlling my own life being negatives.

I am at a loss, here. I do not know what these words are other than ""slut."" 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about still not being equal. 

That is true. I do not have to think about it, but I sometimes allow myself to think about whether or not equal opportunity employment laws affect my ability to achieve employment.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about what it takes to keep going. 

I do think about this.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how much I still have to hide. 

I do think about this, often to my own detriment. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how much prejudice keeps hold. 

Prejudice is not limited to any single ethnic or social group, as pointed out above. I do try to not let i affect me.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how I’m meant to be grateful that people tolerate my kind.

And I do not think about that. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about all the things I don’t have to think about. 

Yet I have taken some time to think about them be addressing each in this post.

&gt;But today I will.

-

And I ask, do you see the points mentioned herein as addressing privilege? If so, I ask for who the supposed privileges apply, and how they do. I do not see how each matter is exclusive to any gender, or ethnicity, or socio-economic group.

I take it the point of [this entry](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/10/18/things-i-dont-have-to-think-about-today/) is to point out that those who do not think about these topics do so because of the ""privilege"" indicated in OP's image of the Omaha Beach (Normandy, France 6 June 1944) landing. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about those who hear “terrorist” when I speak my faith.

Correct. I am an atheist. This does not mean that others do not ostracize me for speaking openly and honestly about atheist or philosophy, or that I am not concerned about what other people think.
 &gt;Today I don’t have to think about men who don’t believe no means no.

That depends on what part of what town I am traveling through. A request for spare change can easily turn into a mugging. 
 &gt;Today I don’t have to think about how the world is made for people who move differently than I do.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the phrase, ""move differently,"" refers to either one's gait or inability to walk. As such, I refute this claim. I am concerned about such matters.
 &gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether I’m married, depending on what state I’m in. 
Not to claim I am immune to marriage, or the consideration thereof, but I would be concerned with such things were I to enter into the legal contract of marriage.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how I’m going to hail a cab past midnight.

Reasonable precautions must always be taken - by all involved parties - when criminal activity is more statistically likely.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether store security is tailing me. 
No one is above suspicion. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the look on the face of the person about to sit next to me on a plane.

Please tell me what, ""the look on the face of the person…"" is supposed to mean. A person can have uncomfortable feelings but conduct themselves rationally. Lawyers frequently do this when interacting potential clients, and when running court cases. 
 &gt;Today I don’t have to think about eyes going to my chest first. 
Body-consciousness is not gender specific.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about what people might think if they knew the medicines I took. 
True. Some medications bear a social stigma. Thankfully much legislation and business practices exist to ensure the confidentiality of clients' and patient's medical records. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about getting kicked out of a mall when I kiss my beloved hello.

I am unfamiliar with this occurrence. However, malls are private property. If business owners feel that such displays drive more customers and revenue away from their businesses than the revenue the ""offenders"" provide, they are free to ask the affectionate parties to vacate their property. The community may choose to support or boycott those businesses as consequence. Baselessly bigoted business will undergo revenue-loss and be displaced by the market. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about [whether it is] safe to hold my beloved’s hand. 
Thankfully I live in an area of the world where this is not an issue. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether I’m being pulled over for anything other than speeding. 
This depends on the community I am traveling through, but is correct since I neither drive nor smoke.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about being classified as one of “those people.” 
Every - I repeat - every stratified community or society will categorize an obviously different group. ""Oh, her bag was *so* 2009.""

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about making less than someone else for the same job at the same place. 
No, I actually do think about this. The economy is in a downturn. Women in my profession, in my geographic location make an average of 8% more than men of my profession in my geography location, and it is easier for women to receive federal assistance if their bills fall behind.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the people who stare, or the people who pretend I don’t exist.

Why would I concern myself with people who pretend I do not exist? I am genuinely honest and curious on this matter. The majority of the planet's population is not concerned with my welfare or existence, just as I am not concerned with those aspect of most individuals on this planet.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about managing pain that never goes away. 
That is not so. I have concerns that I must face every day that I actually want to *do* something. Depression, physiological, and psychological concerns are not exclusive to any group. Everyone has their own concerns. I say this not to dismiss the author's pain, but to shed light that everyone, *everyone,* has pain.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether a stranger’s opinion of me would change if I showed them a picture of who I love. 
Then the problem is not with the author, but with those who the author surrounds him or herself with.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the chance a store salesmen will ignore me to help someone else. 
True. No one has to think about this. However, thinking about it may help some of us think about personal hygiene. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the people who’d consider torching my house of prayer a patriotic act. 
True. I am an atheist. This does not make me free of persecution by those willing to commit violent acts.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about a pharmacist telling me his conscience keeps him from filling my prescription.

True. However, I would locate an alternate pharmacist were I so concerned. Not all are so privileged to live near such a robust market. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about being asked if I’m bleeding when I’m just having a bad day. 
That, I must say, is true. I am a male. I find that language rather grating.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether the one drug that lets me live my life will be taken off the market. 
When I get old, I will likely have this concern. The current pharmacological research, development, testing, and distribution methods are antiquated, restrictive, and cost lives every year by preventing life saving drugs from getting onto the market.

No, I should have been more careful with my word choice. I meant the types of discrimination fell into the same category, not that they are experienced equally or that they are identical in form.

limeade17,,,"It's shortsighted to view unpaid work simply as a relationship between the two partners of a household. Unpaid work (done primarily by women) goes ignored in economic analysis and thus the power of the work and the worker is ignored, even though it adds value to the economy (getting fed is nice, as is not catching diseases because you are clean, or being raised from birth). You, of course, are a shining example of the how the system ignores the contributions made by unpaid work to the family and to society. Amartya Sen pointed out that women’s contribution to the family livelihood is perceived to be smaller 
than it actually is, due to stereotypes of men as the chief or sole breadwinner. This gap between real and perceived contribution perpetuates inequality between women and men, because it fundamentally weakens women’s bargaining power in marriage and the family.

If you read about it in the scholarly literature you get lots of paragraphs like this:

&gt;All this has huge implications for international development policy, as well as women’s rights. During 
the ‘lost decade’ of the 1980s, feminist economists argued that the blindness of conventional 
economists to women’s unpaid work was very convenient. It enabled the international institutions 
that imposed structural adjustment policies on developing countries to ignore the true suffering of 
women, men and families due to cutbacks in state provision of essential services. Backs to the wall, 
women struggled – and just about succeeded – in replacing these services and keeping families afloat.

The devaluation of women's home work also allows for systematic devaluation of women's labor economy work- the result of which is lower wages in the workforce. To say that unpaid work is ""never relevant to the topic"" requires an extraordinary level of cognitive dissonance.

I don't even really understand what argument you are trying to make with your last couple paragraphs- you are honestly trying to say that Congress is not an institution run by men? When we literally just had a week where an all male panel testified about birth control? If any argument is bullshit it is surely your argument that all women vote in their own interest and thus congress cannot be sexist. Many women are happy for a pat on the head from the existing power structure, and who can blame them, and thus obviously not all of them will vote for what would truly be in their best interest. When you exist under an already functioning institution of power like patriarchy you are not free to exercise in your self-interest the way you would in a vacuum free of power.

No one is trying to say that women are claiming to have a patent on systematic discrimination. The new waves of feminism have given structure and voice to many many forms of oppression (race, gender, class, able bodied, etc.). If you want to honestly critique a basic idea like unpaid work you should spend two seconds reading one of the many many scholarly resources on the subject, instead of setting up a straw man and watching it burn and giving yourself a pat on the back.",0,1330367232,,0,c3vjrzc,t3_q89lk,2.0,t1_c3vjb8g,2454,1435737475,8,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1289316546.0,t2_4i8nx,,,0

The rapper talks with dream hampton about his now-infamous XXL video and what he has learned from the backlash 
http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/too-short-interview

&gt;Too $hort: ...when I taped the XXL video, my goal was that this was some kind of comedy piece. So I am sitting there and the thing that I am saying is actually reminiscent of when we as little boys were being bad and (what) we were doing something or learning or practicing. But know I'm understanding that it's actually it’s a form of sexual assault. And it's crazy that I'm just now understanding this.

&gt;I’m not going to lie to you…my eyes are opening just from reading the comments, the stuff that is coming from people. They say stuff like, “Does he get it?” I’m reading it and I am starting to get it. I am looking at this and I am looking at all the stuff that they put out, completely from the entertainment industry, from the movies I watched when I was a kid. A rape scene in a movie was pretty normal. They don’t really do it that much anymore, (but) back then a guy would take it and the girl would enjoy it. They put those images out there over and over again and it’s like so much society is ok with the images of aggressive male and female sexuality. I’m just reading this and I’m reading that, and I’m like I am so much a part of that whole “man” thing.

&gt;…in my mind, I’m not a rude guy who just goes around calling women “b*tch” but at this point, this is not just a wake up call to let go and do something good. I have been doing good, I have a track record. I have been doing good in the community with the kids around the Bay Area. Just being involved with the programs around here. The message that is missing (for me) is about this whole aggressive sexual thing. It is entertainment to me. I have been saying that for a long time. I have been making money off of it. I could have spoke about what I really believed in, I could have been a Tribe Called Quest or KRS-One type artist, but I knew if I just write these little curses, people would want to hear that. My mind was saying “do what they like.”  At the same time I was battling with myself on doing what I thought and knew was right.",0,1330205848,,0,c3uyy6i,t3_q4jx1,2.0,t1_c3uvilx,23953,1428419816,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1220919695.0,t2_38lau,,,0

While the legal stuff definitely should be addressed, I couldn't get passed the extraordinary amount of hate that tainted almost every thread I dared read. Even a man who seemed well spoken and reasonable in other respects suggested that r/mensrights should stop attacking r/feminisms because they were ""the enemy"" and therefore a lost cause. 

Not because it was wrong, not because it further enforced the notion that they are a hate group, but because WE (women or feminists to be exact) were the enemy somehow. 

Both I and my husband are shocked. I read him some of the things I read on r/mensrights to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding the point of the men who spoke. He was possibly more outrage then I was, but then again, he's never been through a divorce or custody battle, so he has no reason to hate women. 

I do not understand how men, in this day and age, when in some countries women are actually forced to wear head-to-toe coverings and are forbidden to drive under penalty of DEATH, can actually view women as a force that is somehow oppressing them.  My mind is boggled. 

As for the leader of this men's movement, I wonder if he even thought about how setting himself on fire would effect his 4 year old daughter.

I just have a few concerns:

&gt; and to have your reports of everything from that to sexual assaults questioned in a manner that reports of other crimes would not be...

I'm not exactly sure of the process here, but what would one have to do to prove sexual assault that they wouldn't have to do to prove verbal assault or physical assault (that didn't leave a wound, or left a wound that already healed)?

&gt; If you can imagine what it would feel like to be seen as a sexual object rather than a subject ...

Yeah, this mainly is the problem here.  Because of our socialization, women are taught from almost every angle that they are objects and men are taught from almost every angle that they are subjects.  This causes problems when subjective people don't try and empathize with the objective crowd, and the other way around.  It leads to too-simple 'solutions' like ""Well don't wear attractive clothing"" and ""Well don't hit on a drunk person"" that are hardly helpful.

It raises even more issues when you realize that while that may be the majority, there are objective males and subjective females, and they do go together.  At the same time, there are male-male relationships, and female-female relationships where the stereotypes either become more defined or just can't keep up.  When you bring in transgender, genderqueer, and other complications, it all becomes a bit much.

While some people think that these fringe groups don't matter because they are too hard to help, I know that this is where the worst damage is being done.  These people simply have nowhere to turn for protection, advice, or if they are aggressing, punishment and correction.

JohnAdamZiolkowski,,,"&gt; When we imagine a rape accusation on a campus or in a workplace setting, we generally imagine a woman accusing a man.

This could accurately represent the state of affairs, but the numbers are at least a little bit affected by the sexist definitions of rape and sexual harassment, the sexist handling practices when males come forward, and most importantly society's notion that only females do get raped.  Who is more likely to be a victim is not absolutely important.  The protections should be gender-neutral and serve everyone.

While I can't imagine the torture it must be to prove that you didn't want to be raped to the judge, the jury, and everyone paying attention, saying that they shouldn't have to deal with that is a recipe for disaster.  In any sort of crime, you have to be proven guilty.  You can not be put away for something that you didn't do.  If power is given to those to change the entire judicial system to ""guilty until proven innocent"", then that gives a free pass to inflict great amount of societal harm to anyone who would be willing to use it.

In the context of our ""only women can be victims"" and ""only men can be perps"" society, *that* is going to result in absolute sexism.  The difference between your claim and my claim is that the innocent don't get punished in my idealistic world, and the guilty are adequately punished.  In yours, the innocent can be put away for nothing, the accusers are encouraged to do so by law, and the actual victims of rape are bunched together with the liars and discredited as a whole.",0,1331750885,,0,c410h1v,t3_qvh2g,8.0,t1_c410b01,814,1428525393,0,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,,,,0

When we imagine a rape accusation on a campus or in a workplace setting, we generally imagine a woman accusing a man.

I am a big advocate for being honest when the data supports a similar picture for both genders. For example, I get shit from some feminists I know because I stick to my guns that non-sexual domestic abuse is almost as common for men as it is for women. That's what the data says. But the data also says that women are victims of sexual crimes in far greater numbers than men. (my source is the British Crime Survey, the Scottish Crime Survey (over several years) and the recent American CDC study)

I don't think we can just ignore that context. Nor the context that rapes are rarely reported, and that those who report rape have to go through a horrendous process of being questioned and disbelieved. It is from the perspective of seeing that process and how it can tear a person up that adding the possibility of legal action if the cops decide they can ""prove"" you were lying seems simply horrific, unthinkable.

This is a perspective that women, being more often the victims of sexual crimes, are more likely to develop than men, just as men are more likely to have a fear of false accusation and develop a perspective from there.

Keep in mind most of the ones who support the claim make the distinction between guilty and not guilty.  It isn't one-or-the-other.  If the court can't prove either is guilty, then neither are punished.

* False rape claims hurt the accused, who go to jail, lose their jobs, get placed on a registry list, and way too often kill themselves.

So I'm asking what evidence or turns of phrase folks find helpful for getting someone to think beyond the derails I cited. For instance, if someone said ""I don't see why women deserve special treatment"", what has worked for you in the past on convincing that person that that mindset is flawed?

What evidence is there that people should stop being selfish when being selfish works perfectly fine *for them*, and the ""because you're being a jerk"" angle doesn't appeal to them(because ""people are jerks to everyone""/""get a thicker skin""/etc)?

rooktakesqueen,,,"I guess the best generalized advice I can give you is this, speaking from my experience as a middle-class white cis male computing professional:

Most of these guys *probably* understand that discrimination happens, but they think it isn't a big deal.  They think that non-privileged people have to deal with it very infrequently, and when they do have to deal with it, there are mechanisms in place for them to do so.  They think racism, classism, sexism, ableism, ageism, and all the other -isms, are mostly a solved problem already.  They do *not* understand the idea of privilege, or if they've been exposed to it, they probably reject it.

So, you're going to have to establish that it's not a solved problem.  That non-privileged people deal with the consequences of their lack of privilege in many ways, on many levels, all the time.  That there usually *aren't* any mechanisms to deal with it.

I think you'll want both statistics and case studies.  Descriptions of people being forced to deal with their lack of privilege, detailed accounts of how it influences them, how it crops up in their everyday life.  Combine with statistical evidence of institutional -isms.  Showing one and not the other won't work.  Show just the case studies, they'll assume you're cherry-picking.  Show them just the statistics, they'll assume it's caused by factors other than privilege and discrimination.  They need to have the stats *and* be able to link them to a concrete example of how inequality could be the causal factor.

A lot of them probably worked very hard to get where they were.  They don't feel like they got any special treatment because they were white or male or middle class.  So it might be helpful to emphasize that privilege isn't *all* that's needed to get ahead.  Good outcomes still take hard work, even for people in privileged groups.  Privilege is just about where you *start* on the playing field.

Expect to hear arguments about how it's not *fair* to penalize this group of people for privilege they never asked for, and would reject if they could.  The only good response I can think of for this is that it isn't about fairness.  If the world were fair, there would be no privilege.  Fundamentally, inclusiveness and accessibility is about being utilitarian: it's about asking one group of people to make a very *small* sacrifice in order that another group of people can reap a very *large* reward.  You take five minutes out of your day to check your website's color scheme, and you can avoid shutting out dozens, hundreds, thousands of colorblind people from the content you're providing.  You take a day to implement button re-mapping, and suddenly disabled players can enjoy your game just like able-bodied players can.  You take a moment just to consider the impact of your words on someone else, and you save your female or minority or LGBT coworkers immeasurable amounts of anxiety and heartbreak.

Lastly: you're not going to win most of them over.  At the end of your talk, I wager at least nine in ten will still be hostile and will dismiss everything you've said as bullshit.

If we are to assume that male/female differences are based on biological/ hormonal factors, when wouldn't this information mean that our behavior over our individual life would be more different than our relationship to the opposite sex?

So many behaviors we have are socially learned. I have a hard time listening to male vs. female stereotypes that are built on this as yet unfounded idea of huge difference in hormone levels.

Another interesting fact is that differences between some individuals of opposite genders can actually be more similar than between another person of the same gender. As humans we have variety of hormonal levels, yet we don't measure each person and then say ""you have _ level of estrogen, so you can be expected to be responsible for only this level of behavior.""

Second, it is *not* inevitable that victims who don't have a ""good reputation"" should be treated like dirt. Interpretations don't vary.

Jess_than_three,,,"&gt; How often do you ask someone to drop trou before you decide which pronoun to use for them?

Never. You never ask someone to drop trou before you decide which pronoun to use.

&gt; How often do you ask to see a karyotype test so you know which sex chromosomes they've got?

Never. You never demand to know what someone's sex chromosomes are before you decide which pronoun to use.

&gt; How often do you consider what gametes they produce?

Never. You never think about what gametes someone produces before you decide which pronoun to use.

So. What's the implication here?

When you talk about any other person in your life, you do not base your pronoun usage for them on

* Their genitals (which you have not seen, in almost all cases)

* Their sex chromosomes (which you do not know)

* Their gamete production (which is a mystery to you)

Ergo, you must base your pronoun use for other people on something else. What might that be? Let me posit a hypothesis: It's gender. It's their gender. It's always gender, and not biological sex. It's not something that's ""the case only in the trans community"": it's true everywhere. It's just that people don't *think* about that except in the context of the trans community, because the trans community is primarily where you find people where one or more of the above-mentioned criteria don't match their gender.

But again, the point is that even for people you presume to be cis, you're not calling a guy ""he"" because you know that he has a penis; you're not calling a woman ""she"" because you know she has two X chromosomes; you're not calling a dude ""him"" because you know he produces sperm. You're not calling a person by a specific set of pronouns because of anything to do with their physiological sex: you're calling them by a specific set of pronouns because of their gender.

Similarly, if I was talking about this conversation I'm having with you to someone else, I would refer to you as ""he"", because you have identified yourself as male. I do not know if you have a penis; I have not seen it. I do not know if you have XY sex chromosomes, or if you produce sperm, because for all I know your daughter is adopted - you haven't specified - and had you been talking about a sibling, and not mentioned you had children, I would still refer to you as ""he"".

Never. You never ask someone to drop trou before you decide which pronoun to use.

&gt; How often do you ask to see a karyotype test so you know which sex chromosomes they've got?

Never. You never demand to know what someone's sex chromosomes are before you decide which pronoun to use.

&gt; How often do you consider what gametes they produce?

Never. You never think about what gametes someone produces before you decide which pronoun to use.

So.

What's the implication here?

When you talk about any other person in your life, you do not base your pronoun usage for them on

* Their genitals (which you have not seen, in almost all cases)

* Their sex chromosomes (which you do not know)

* Their gamete production (which is a mystery to you)

Ergo, you must base your pronoun use for other people on something else. What might that be? Let me posit a hypothesis: It's gender. It's their gender. It's always gender, and not biological sex. It's not something that's ""the case only in the trans community"": it's true everywhere. It's just that people don't *think* about that except in the context of the trans community, because the trans community is primarily where you find people where one or more of the above-mentioned criteria don't match their gender.

But again, the point is that even for people you presume to be cis, you're not calling a guy ""he"" because you know that he has a penis; you're not calling a woman ""she"" because you know she has two X chromosomes; you're not calling a dude ""him"" because you know he produces sperm. You're not calling a person by a specific set of pronouns because of anything to do with their physiological sex: you're calling them by a specific set of pronouns because of their gender.

Similarly, if I was talking about this conversation I'm having with you to someone else, I would refer to you as ""he"", because you have identified yourself as male. I do not know if you have a penis; I have not seen it. I do not know if you have XY sex chromosomes, or if you produce sperm, because for all I know your daughter is adopted - you haven't specified - and had you been talking about a sibling, and not mentioned you had children, I would still refer to you as ""he"". Because you have identified yourself as male - i.e., you have claimed a male gender, which has nothing to do with biological sex.",0,1335045661,,0,c4f0v1n,t3_sjqqe,18.0,t1_c4ewwgy,23588,1428769156,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1330636713.0,t2_72abz,,,1

Willravel,,,"My understanding is 'creep' has different meanings in different situations all rooted in the same basic concept. What we're talking about here is creepy being used to talk about people in potentially romantic, sexual, or otherwise possibly sex-related situations behaving in a way which is not considered to be normal or healthy, thus triggering concerns about the person's thought process and/or intent, yes? 

This seems like a bit of a minefield. On the one hand, I absolutely (and I mean *abso-fucking-lutely*) believe people should have the right to their personal space, their privacy, their freedom to say 'no', and the right not to be put in a potentially dangerous situation. Let there be no question of that. On the other hand, though, we're in unique time from a sociological and behavioral perspective. The concept of 'forever alone' is not a new one, but considering the rates of things like online dating, it's possible we're seeing a fundamental shift in romantic meeting tendencies. Add to that increasing diagnosis of people who are socially handicapped, and we're in uncharted waters. Personally, I like meeting people in person through friends, school, work, or other traditional social settings., I tried online dating and found it more than a little problematic. The thing is, people like me are more and more rare. A recent study found that approximately 1 in 6 marriages were the result of meeting (or 'meeting') online. This is bound to result in the society-wide degradation of social skills pertaining to meeting people romantically. 

My point is this: be careful in using any label, including 'creep'. Or 'stalker'. Or any iterations of shaming attempts at social behavior by people who may have nothing but the best intentions.

nofelix,,,"I see where you're coming from, and understand you want internal consistency in your thoughts. I think people are being a little unkind here, I think because they're mistaking your methodicalness for stubboness. So maybe the following points will help you out:

1. 99% of the time the medical sex of a person is irrelevant in your life as an engineer. So don't worry about it. In the rare situations where it is important, you can just say 'female to male transsexual'; you're never going to be restricted to just male or female.

2. The fact that *some people* use 'male' pronouns to refer to cismen only, ignoring the existence of people born outside the gender binary, doesn't stop those people existing. Isn't it simpler to accept that 'male' has a broard definition, rather than a strict one necessitating whole load of complex terms for people who fall outside it? Medical professionals can deal with the complex definitions, while socially we can use the simple ones. The same way I'm sure there are words lay people use about engineering which make sense in lay conversation but are ambiguous in a professional one.

3. Does someone's gender matter to anyone else? If I want my gender to be 'tomato' or 'rooster' what difference does it make? It's just part of identity, and allowing people to self-identify as pretty much whatever they like is common sense. If someone argued that you weren't a 'rock and roll fan' because of some definition of 'rock and roll fan' they had, you'd think they were an idiot, however reasonable their definition was. Should gender be any different? (I think you already agree with this, it just leads to my next point)

4. And by the same token, shouldn't we allow people to define pretty much anything about themselves how they like? They can call themsevles slim even if we think they're fat. Even if, like in your example, they want to be called 7' when they're only 5'2"", why can't we allow this notion with the understanding that their 7' height is a different kind of height? Their moral height, skateboarding height, or whatever. They're not asking you to agree that their real measured height is anything but 5'2"". They're asking ""when we talk about my height generally, without specifing measured or skateboard, can we use skateboard?"". It might seem slightly absurd or pointless, but you can grant there's no harm in it, because in cases where it *does* matter you're still free to specify 'measured height'.

5. It would mean a lot to him if you called him by the correct pronoun. *A lot*. As the father of his girlfriend, you're in a position of responsibility. Also as a adult. You have the chance to make someone who respects you feel good about a difficult part of their lives. Why waste that over a technicality? Is the lesson that 'logic triumphs over all' (or something similar) really worth more to you? He must notice that you're not using male pronouns, and probably knows that you call him 'her' when he's out of earshot.

&gt; It's not as much of a controversy to her as it is to me and my desire to respect her desires while being able to convince someone else in my state.

I know that feel bro. But it can be self-defeating. Sometimes you need to take the first step and trust that the arguments you're hearing are correct. Yes it's against our nature as logical people, but part of being rational is knowing that not everything can be known in advance. See what it's like believing the other side, and calling him 'him'. If you don't like it you can always go back. But as an engineer, hopefully you can appreciate the value of experimental data to test a hypothesis, right? Even if your mental models predict the hypothesis to be wrong you can still test it.",0,1335032424,,0,c4eylh8,t3_sjqqe,14.0,t1_c4eqyp0,65154,1428768026,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1254443726.0,t2_3nnc7,,1.0,1

itsasocialconstruct,,,"I actually agree, 'creep' is an extremely useful term, but it is also frequently used inappropriately as in your example. Saying that it is creepy for a male in business dress to 'flirt' (a nebulous term that instantly relies on characterizations and assumptions about an individual's actions) with a gothic-ly dressed woman is a misuse of the label. The situation relies on stereotyping both individuals and their desires.

I will try to construct an example of creepy behavior that doesn't rely on gender or on tropes. The first that comes to mind is a story that my sister told me about her work. She is a woman, but I think that this could happen to a person of either gender:

My sister is a counselor/supervisor at a half-way house for people with combined substance abuse problems and psychological disorders. She works late at night and if a client articulates suicidal intentions, she has to have a line of sight with them all night (or something like that, I'm not so clear on the regulations of the ward). Sometimes clients will say something like, ""oh, I really feel like slitting my wrists. By the way you look really pretty tonight."" I'm exaggerating, but there's the essential bit. The clients are abusing the fact that my sister cannot 'escape', she is under duress where she cannot avoid their advances or remove herself from the situation because she has an obligation. I would argue this as an appropriate instance to use 'creep.'

 My sister has some sort of punitive power over her clients as a supervisor, yet the clients are able to reverse this and use her responsibilities against her. I point this out because I think it's interesting. Often, I think of creeping as a person abusing the fact that they have power over another individual in order to make advances while that individual is under duress, but here that isn't the case (which is notable).

A cliche example of a creep is the teacher who makes advances at a student. The student is under duress, it is not a 'fair' flirtation for obvious reasons. However, one could also make an argument that if a student makes advances towards a professor (at a university now), then the professor also experiences some sort of duress and that that flirtation is also unfair. It is easy to see how in both cases the individual making the advances could be construed as harasser.",0,1334994710,,0,c4euoh2,t3_skrl3,2.0,t1_c4eu15b,6732,1428766176,14,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1328860039.0,t2_6vy8u,,1.0,1

I don't consider myself racist - I am annoyed by everyone equally. :p But living in rural Minnesota, I haven't had the pleasure of befriending people of every different race or ethnicity, and that reflects in the books I write. 
I can manage to write from the point of view of a Native American - I've been educated on their culture for a long time. It's a beautiful culture, and I enjoyed taking classes on it. But to write from the point of view of a black person realistically? That would be hard for me. Even with extensive research, I feel like any effort I made would be laughable, seeing as I've never even gotten to know a black person. 
I've nonetheless attempted to create characters of different races, but I don't think they would be very relatable to people of the same race. Since, like the creator of this show said, every character has a piece of me in them, they're not always submerged in the culture for which they are known.

Rather than being involved with hip-hop or any other stereotypes, she was a quiet, intelligent, independent, and somewhat aloof woman who functioned as the leader of the group of main characters. Raised in a private Catholic school, she learned to depend solely on herself for survival, and it became difficult for her to open up to anyone.

SpanishAys,,,"Leah Dunham addressed this on yesterday's episode of Fresh Air with Terry Gross on NPR. She said: 
&gt; ""I take that criticism very seriously. ... This show isn't supposed to feel exclusionary. It's supposed to feel honest, and it's supposed to feel true to many aspects of my experience. But for me to ignore that criticism and not to take it in would really go against my beliefs and my education in so many things. And I think the liberal-arts student in me really wants to engage in a dialogue about it, but as I learn about engaging with the media, I realize it's not the same as sitting in a seminar talking things through at Oberlin. Every quote is sort of used and misused and placed and misplaced, and I really wanted to make sure I spoke sensitively to this issue. ...

&gt; ""I wrote the first season primarily by myself, and I co-wrote a few episodes. But I am a half-Jew, half-WASP, and I wrote two Jews and two WASPs. Something I wanted to avoid was tokenism in casting. If I had one of the four girls, if, for example, she was African-American, I feel like — not that the experience of an African-American girl and a white girl are drastically different, but there has to be specificity to that experience [that] I wasn't able to speak to. I really wrote the show from a gut-level place, and each character was a piece of me or based on someone close to me. And only later did I realize that it was four white girls. As much as I can say it was an accident, it was only later as the criticism came out, I thought, 'I hear this and I want to respond to it.' And this is a hard issue to speak to because all I want to do is sound sensitive and not say anything that will horrify anyone or make them feel more isolated, but I did write something that was super-specific to my experience, and I always want to avoid rendering an experience I can't speak to accurately.""


So, to summarize:

* she wrote the first season mostly on her own and wrote characters based on her experiences. 

* After the show began, she listened closely to criticism about the lack of racial diversity and felt that it was very important to introduce more diversity in the next season. 

* She also wanted to address the specific experiences that minority women have, which as a Manhattan Jewish/WASP woman she couldn't really. She said the next season would introduce more diverse characters (I assume because the writing team is expanding beyond herself??)

My opinions: This show isn't exactly autobiographical or anything, but isn't it entirely possible that she actually doesn't have any Black, Asian, or Latina friends, and therefore the show is representative of her experiences? I haven't seen the show yet (really want to), but I've heard so much coverage about it already! It sounds like it addresses the concerns of many early-20s women of this generation, and what's so wrong with that? As a writer, she's taken the criticism and will address it in season 2.

MissInterpretation,,,"I actually like the ""cage"" concept - I think it illustrates objectification better than trying to explain how it makes people feel.  The word ""woman"" is a noun, and most of us interpret that as the 'person' portion of a noun; using the symbolism of the cage or shell illustrates how, through objectifying ""woman"", the word now means ""thing"".  

The best example I've ever experienced of objectification was when a neighbor boy 2 years older than I orchestrated a way to get me alone and then tried to feel me up.  When I tried to fight him off, he exclaimed (in a rather offended tone) ""Hey, I just wanna feel your tits!"".  Hindsight leads me to think he was more than a little surprised to experience such resistance; maybe he seemed to be of the opinion that they were public property?  or that his wishes/desires somehow trumped my own?  What that sentence said to me was that in his mind, it wasn't that my feelings were irrelevant, it was more of a perception on his part that I didn't or shouldn't have any feelings about it at all.  And that was what made me feel objectified - he was just seeing the ""woman"" cage, or shell; not the person.

Mr_Stay_Puft,,,"Hm.

I don't know if I'd call it a right, exactly, because that's one of the most-abused buzzwords in the English language. If we wanted to talk in terms of rights, we'd need a definition for the term that fits the specific instance of going topless. In my jurisdiction, at least, there is legal equality on the issue, so we aren't talking strictly about formal permission to do something. More, we're talking about a duty of others to remain respectful and not react as they currently do when they see a woman topless.

I have a *right* to freedom of speech, but others have a right to react negatively when I say something provocative, as well.

We've got a social convention going that imposes all sorts of meanings on female secondary sexual characteristics. To ignore those meanings would be to pretend to live in a completely different society than the one we have now. You could even think of it as speaking a different language. In the semiotics of clothing as they exist now, female upper nudity has very strong connotations, and the only real way to avoid connoting those things when you pick an outfit is to avoid being female and topless.

Is there a gender dichotomy implicit in all this? Of course there is! Is there a double-standard? Yeah, I think so. Are there large ramifications for people's lives? On balance, probably not. If your goal is to totally deconstruct and eradicate the gender binary, then this is certainly a fair target (albeit as a minor part of a much larger campaign), but if you have more modest aims (at least in the short-term) it seems fair to mostly ignore this one.

Which still doesn't address the purely academic question of whether this is a case of disempowerment, privilege, or some combination of the two. I would reply that I'm not sure a semiotic difference is necessarily hierarchical. While there is obviously no denying that male privilege exists, I have very distinct memories of classmates from my childhood (both male and female) absolutely tearing into a (male) kid because he wore shorts that ended substantially above the knee. Girls in the class, while obviously facing a whole other set of issues, could wear shorter shorts without fear. This may seem trivial, but it meant that we all wore incredibly stupid, long, way-too-heavy shorts even on really hot days.

Now, the semiotics there were relatively specific to a particular part of the broader culture, and I'm in no way seeking to legitimize homophobia, (which was exactly what was going on), but it seems clear to me that that was not an instance of female oppression of males, and they were under no obligation to refrain from wearing comfortable clothing simply because guys couldn't wear it.

tl;dr: I'mma still take my shirt off when it's hot and sticky out.",0,1338109128,,0,c4sveoi,t3_u5yk4,5.0,t1_c4suzzz,4838,1429009166,1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1304832000.0,t2_57feg,,,1

Sure, racism and sexism and homophobia are different... and these examples have **very** different ramifications. But the common thread here is that a member of a majority group refuses something traditionally given to members of that group because ze knows that other people will be denied this privilege for arbitrary and systematically discriminatory reasons.

Mr_Stay_Puft,,,"I'm a guy who works outdoors all summer and is utterly unmuscular in the torso department. I'm not wildly enthusiastic about showing off my shirtless body, but fuck if it isn't a hell of a lot more comfortable when the heat really goes crazy. So let me put a question to you: do you think that I'm contributing to female disempowerment? Am I abusing privilege?

I humbly submit that when it's stupidly hot, keeping unneeded layers on is pure fashion victimhood.

Obviously, it would be nice if people could get over the whole female shirtlessness thing, but maybe that's more an expression of society taking away from women, rather than giving to men? That makes it different from the way that, for example, whiteness allows one to commit actual crimes and then talk one's way out of arrest, where a black person would get booked merely on suspicion.

Hayleyk,,,"I've been thinking a lot lately about how we objectify women by systematizing them. When a man on TV screws up, they often say they just weren't thinking, but women rarely get to use this explanation.

And if a woman's actions cannot be explained, then she's broken (read: crazy).  Women are denied the flexibility of mind that we associate with free agency and choice.  

Objectification is a convenient slight of hand because it allows people to dismiss any external causes of women's feelings an actions (such as someone treating her with disrespect).

Objectification is when you remove personality from the equation. Human beings are sentient, self-aware, opinionated, creative things, so in order to objectify, one needs to discount or ignore all the things that make us individuals and simply think of the physical and the functional. An example of objectification is thinking of someone purely as a way to fulfill sexual needs, thinking of another human being as the equivalent of a vibrator or fleshlight. At its core, objectification is about a person's inability to recognize that other people are just as important and worthy of respect and understanding as they are. They can't handle the idea that other people have thoughts and dreams and feelings, too, so they choose to ignore all of the parts of other people that challenge their narrow, fearful view of the world.

Honestly, I really see no disernable advantage that could come from being trans (I wont try to speak for intersex people). Here are some common arguments and my response

* *Trans people benefit from a better bone structure*: I can see this, but with the decrease in muscle from hormone therapy, having the bone structure i have can actually be a disadvantage. My body developed to function with a certain amount of muscular support, after taking hormones for an extended period of time I can actually have to little muscle to perform as well as my structure could. 

* *Trans women are statistically more likley to be taller*: Height is a big issue in sports, I swam competativly for 10 years and height definitely plays a role in people's abilities. But honestly, any olympic athelete, or hell any good athlete is more likley to be in the upper percentiles of height for their demographic even if they are cis (of course there are exceptions such as gymnastics). Are we going to institute maximum height requirements so that cis women who are statistically taller cant compete?

* *I benefit from muscle memory, experience, etc*: Honestly trans women's bodies change so much during hormone therapy, you have to relearn how to exert your body to it limits.

Okay, that makes sense.

No. Capitalism does not benefit any but the very rich.  Unlike a sandwich, which is directly made by your friend, capitalism is not the direct cause of any benefits. It didn't even create the climate controlled environment you enjoy.

That's because I wanted to know what *you* meant by it. Your original comment did not seem at all relevant to my comment that you were replying to, so I was curious as to why you wrote it.

&gt;Having a job that pays you well does not mean that you would not have these benefits if you did not live under a capitalist society.

Whether or not you would have these benefits under another system is irrelevant. The fact remains that you receive benefits from capitalism. If you lived in a socialist society, you might receive similar benefits from socialism.

If my friend Peter makes me a sandwich, I am benefiting from Peter's generosity. It doesn't change that fact if Sheila would be just as happy to make me a sandwich. I'm still benefiting from *Peter's* generosity, because he is the one making me the sandwich.

Unless you want to deny that any forms of benevolent sexism (I misspoke in my earlier comment and called it ""benign sexism"") exist in our society, it's difficult to see how you can claim that we do not benefit at all, ever, from patriarchy.

From you asking me what I meant by ""benefit"" when I said that men benefit from the patriarchy.

&gt;Maybe what you mean to say is that men, on average, receive more benefits than do women under the patriarchy? Or that the tradeoff between benefit and oppression is less onerous for men than women?

Nope.

&gt;If someone receives benefits, they can be said to ""benefit"" from a thing.

No.  I live in a patriarchy.  I benefit from living near the beach, feminism, and having people and cats in my life who I love.  None of these things are a result of a patriarchy, and I have none of these benefits because of patriarchy, or because of capitalism. Having a job that pays you well does not mean that you would not have these benefits if you did not live under a capitalist society.  

&gt;I just think the picture is a lot more complex than you do.

To me, the kind of equivocation of ""well, it's so complex, we can't really make a judgment on it"" serves only to obfuscate the issue.

Gettingbetter,,,"Since we're sharing our conversion stories, I'll also share mine, although maybe less eloquently.

I was and am a progressively minded person, but like many liberal males, thought of feminism as the militant 2nd wave feminists that are blamed *ad nauseum* (for what?). Martin Luther King, Jr. bemoaned the moderate white male, and I was (and am still probably) pretty typical for that category. I was sympathetic to the idea that women aren't getting paid as well, vaguely aware that women are over-objectified in the media, but I resisted the idea that I was also a sexist because I didn't call girls who had sex ""whores"". All the women in my family are very strong people, and I used them to shore up my case that I wasn't a sexist.

Well I was a sexist after all. I made fun of girly things. I preferred women who acted more like ""one of the guys"". I was hard on teens who liked boy bands and doing their hair and make up. I never insulted them to their face, but I always considered myself above them. I was hard on women who liked romantic comedies, and didn't like guys who acted ""too gay"" or effeminate. 

Much like the OP, it was a friend of mine who pointed out what it meant when I said that a movie was ""for girls"". At first I teased her about it quite a bit, but after a while of thought (days? a week or two? Longer? It's been several years), I realized that I was teasing her to make her feel invalidated by it. That it was a defensive front to both change the course of the conversation where I was not being blamed and where she could feel as self-conscious as I was. Pretty lousy of me, but it got me thinking.

I still don't actively read feminist writings, but I make an effort to not assume things about people. Maybe this girl really knows computers. Or maybe she really knows make-up. One girl I know is getting a fully-funded PhD at Duke University, but she is first in line to see whatever romantic comedy is out. One does not negate the other.

I think the hardest part is actually pulling back the veil and seeing how women are treated by people who I used to stand up for.

The manufacturers aren't going to sell a loss-making product, they'll either put the price up, thus forcing the UK government to either to swallow the loss themselves or get the blame for the price going up enormously, or they'll stop selling in the UK market. 

Ultimately, the cost will come from one of three places:

* users of the pill, politically difficult but it allows people to opt out and discincentivises using hormonal contraception over non-polluting types.
* mains water users, by putting the cost on the sewage companies. This would also be unpopular, since it would increase everyone's water rates.
* general revenue. In a time of cost-cutting, again politically difficult.

It certainly does.  It is a sentence of clearly defined words. Saying that you don't understand what I mean by ""benefit"" sounds like trying to draw me into an argument at a 101 level.

mayfly42,,,"I think it's great that you want to learn. Here are some books and websites I've personally really enjoyed learning from. 

[Feminism is for Everybody by bell hooks](http://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Is-Everybody-Passionate-Politics/dp/0896086283/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339556225&amp;sr=8-1) - this is a great text to get your started on basic beliefs and history. She generally can be a little difficult to read at times if you don't have the background, but that's not the case with this book. She intended this book to be something most people could read and understand. 

[Womanist Musings](http://www.womanist-musings.com/) - one of my favorite blogs. Womanism tends to center around African American women's experiences, and the writers of this blog don't pull any punches when critiquing a racist, classist or sexist aspect of society. An example of this is a [really great post](http://www.womanist-musings.com/2011/09/open-letter-from-black-women-to.html) about how black women see ""Slut Walks"" which many young white feminists embrace. 

[Feministe](http://www.feministe.us/blog/) - one of the more well known feminist blogs. Super accessible.

[Feministing](http://feministing.com/) - another really popular feminist blog. 

[Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood](http://www.amazon.com/Handmaids-Tale-Everymans-Library/dp/0307264602/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339557129&amp;sr=1-1) - dystopian sci-fi novel which really shows why feminism is important. It shows a world where women basically have no rights at all. 

[More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing by Amartya Sen](http://ucatlas.ucsc.edu/gender/Sen100M.html) - really great essay about how girls all over the world are not treated as well as boys are and what this means for the future. My summary is really basic, and the ideas are pretty complex. The writer is a very influential economist, but he's done a lot of work regarding the elimination of poverty and inequality. 

[The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough](http://frank.mtsu.edu/~phollowa/5sexes.html) and [The Five Sexes, Revisited](http://www.neiu.edu/~lsfuller/5sexesrevisited.htm) by Anne Fausto-Sterling - this person's work is really rooted in undermining the idea of dichotomies in terms gender, sex, and sexuality. Fausto-Sterling is actually a prominent academic in the fields of biology and women's studies, so this work is from a very unique perspective.

*Are you kidding?* I would think to myself. *I would much rather be a girl at this point. Look at how easy it is for them! I've been denied by girls my entire life.* And I would think that that was a valid thought. To clarify; the idea here was that Women had it easier because they were *denying me sexually*. 

This is, of course, the thought process of a pretty stupid 13 year old. The fact that I had self worth squared right over the axis of sexuality should indicate some severe problems to begin with. 

The idea here is that I had *no way of seeing what their lives were like*. I had privilege, I didn't need to. We are at a blind, which is part of what makes privilege so insidious; to recall a great quote from a terrible human, ""There are known knowns, and there are known unknowns, but there are also unknown unknowns; things we don't know we don't know."" 

We're men. We have it the easiest. Doesn't mean everything was great *for you*, just that in the ""gender"" category, we're on easy. We don't need to worry about a whole host of things that we will *never ever learn about*. But there are things we can know, things we can try to understand. It is not our fault. It is not your fault. It is not their fault. In understanding your privilege, you make the world slightly better by realizing another aspect of your actions, and responding accordingly.

Lawtonfogle,,,"This might be the result of no one in particular.  I don't have the code in front of me so I can't be 100% sure, but it sounds like this is what is happening.

Iris uses ChaCha.
Chacha is a human search engine, which from my understanding means it is like google, except every person can rate the results which then affect what results are returned by future questions.

This means that people can manipulate the results through no fault of the technology itself.  If the majority of people with technical know how enough to edit something like ChaCha's results have some political ideology, the results will eventually start reflecting it.

As such, I doubt the creators meant for this to happen and I doubt any employee along the way tried to get this to happen.  It is a result of using popular opinion to answer certain questions.

The very important point to realize is that while popular opinion may lean one way, the popular opinion of people who are interested in some question may be different.  While most people might say abortion isn't wrong, those who are interested in doing a search for the question ""why is abortion wrong"" may have a different popular opinion.

While it seems in the case of ChaCha the problem is quickly revealed, even more well known search engines do this to some extent.  For example, Google will look at the past searches you have done, compare it to people who have done similar searches, and then use the searches they seemed to like to effect what your own search is.  They are also biased based upon where you are located (which is why someone like myself, who has their internet set up to always report different locations) ends up getting completely different results for the same search.

EricTheHalibut,,,"&gt;And as a side note, can someone be both pro-life and pro-euthanasia?

Support for *voluntary* euthanasia could easily be combined with opposition to abortion, if one considers life to begin at some point before birth and that there should be some procedures which parents should not be able to consent to on behalf of their children (both fairly normal positions to hold). Voluntary euthanasia is a person's free choice to end his life, abortion contains no choice for the person whose life is ending.

Involuntary euthanasia could also be supported, on the basis that an unborn baby (that is, one which has reached whatever threshold one is using for life) has its whole life ahead of it, whereas an incurably incapacitated person cannot hope for improvement (and, perhaps, cannot even think) and so is losing nothing by dying.",0,1328486923,,0,c3o8xtz,t3_pb6gv,2.0,t1_c3o1326,68216,1428302145,0,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1313674608.0,t2_5ot0c,,,0

 The outpouring of support online for Planned Parenthood and women in need of breast cancer screenings has been nothing short of astonishing, and because of it, the Planned Parenthood Breast Health Fund has received more than $3 million from thousands of people across the country in only three days.

 After facing pressure from anti-women&amp;#039;s health political organizations, the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation announced that it was ending future funding for lifesaving breast cancer screenings and breast health education at Planned Parenthood health centers.

 Many of these patients have contacted us to share their stories about how Planned Parenthood has provided much-needed breast health care and education - care that has improved or saved their lives.

While not all feel this strongly, that some do should show that there is something deeper than protecting life driving these individuals.  Also notice how many pro-life individuals want to shut down all of Planned Parenthood's services, even though that are unrelated to abortion and only have to do with saving lives.

I also tend to find pro-life individuals to be strongly opposed to the teaching of safe sex and insistent on forcing abstinence only education, even though multiple studies have shown such tactics end up increasing abortions.

I also notice that most pro-life individuals ascribe to conservatism, the same political ideology that is against socialized health care.

On one side, capital punishment, as it currently exist, is applied very unfairly and can be considered 'corrupted' by both racism and sexism.  Then there is the problem that no guilty verdict is 100% sure.  This last part, especially, is why I am against the death penalty being practiced.

But as a theory, it isn't like the rest.  War, poverty, homelessness, lack of medical care, hunger, ect. kills innocent people in both practice and in theory.  But capital punishment, in theory, deals with people who have not only committed a horrible act showing disrespect for the freedom and lives of others, but who are also beyond ability to be reintegrated with society.  Killing (or letting die) someone who is 'innocent', be it a child starving to death, a civilian caught in the cross fire, or a poor individual not able to afford a life saving operation, seem to be inherently different than killing someone who is, by no means of the word, innocent.

Obviously, and as I have already said, in reality the death penalty is imperfect and thus should be avoided.  But in theory... it doesn't seem to belong on the list.

It's actively damaging the entire community. Because of that, those of us sticking behind, and I include myself in that group, are (I believe, understandably) sensitive to this kind of thing.

In truth, it's a form of censorship, and can often be motivated by anti-feminism. As a frequent poster on [[/r/Feminism](/r/Feminism), I can tell you that this tactic is often used as a method of preventing free speech about feminist issues. 

Both [/r/Feminism](/r/Feminism) and [/r/Feminisms](/r/Feminisms) exist as spaces for people to discuss feminist issues, concepts, news, etc., anything related to feminsim. When a topic clearly becomes MRA-related (check the MRA subreddit's sidebar for a good introductory list of MRA pet causes) and has no real connection to feminism, the discussion is taking place in the wrong subreddit, like when people talk about how great Captain Picard is on [/r/StarWars](/r/StarWars), but with more malicious intent. 

At least that's my take on it. I don't frequent [/r/Feminisms](/r/Feminisms) as often because I would like to take back [/r/Feminism](/r/Feminism) instead of falling back. That said, it's good to know [[/r/Feminisms](/r/Feminisms) is here when I need a safer place to discuss something.

Swan_Writes,,,"Actually, while counteractive, the opposite is often true :  LGBT teens  have [higher pregnancy rates](http://www.blogher.com/teen-pregnancy-rates-higher-glbt-teens-heterosexual-peers) than their hetero counterparts. 

I think this is a side effect of the social sigma. Gay teens often go through a trial of trying to be strait, especially when the surrounding culture happens to be predominantly pro-hetero. People who have the drive and will to through themselves out of closet are also more willing to be risky in general than those that have not, so these results are probably skewed because all the timid, careful LGBT teens who don't get pregnant are also not openly gay yet, perhaps even to themselves.

As an aside, almost all the gay women I happen to know socially have children from relationships they had with men from before they settled into who they really where, whom they really loved, and none of them were teen moms, yet not all of them really choose to have children, and often they get divorced and out of the closet while their children are still young.

It is a holdover for when women could not control their fertility.

Women were protected from subjecting themselves from danger by virtue of men that did the work. This goes all the way back to caveman days. Women are the limiting factor in reproduction, but society still needs some dangerous shit to get done. It was impractical to send just as many women out as men to hunt the mastodon, as the risk of losing a woman had further reaching implications to the future of the tribe.

I think it's ok for men and women to be sexualized. But I think the issue here is that there's an undue amount of pressure on women to be sexualized, insulting them if they're not. These shirts are asserting that the value of a woman is in how openly sexualized they are, and that being modest is an insult. It's not accepting of women being just normal people in that sense.

If there's just a picture of outgoingly sexy woman in public, I don't have a problem with that specific picture, but it's part of a larger trend where there's a lack of modest or normally dressed women represented in media, and also a lack of men.

The end result is that people expect women to dress and behave in an over sexualized manner, and women who don't are mistreated for it.

That being said, I think there's a time and place for women to be sexualized, just like the men. It's not that it's inherently sexist by itself, it's more due to how often it occurs.

ENTP,,,"I'm not a PUA (pick up artist), and never will be, and am more or less completely uninvolved with the seduction community (barring reading a book by them and having conversations with members of seduction communities) but I feel the need to offer a little perspective, and maybe even a little empathy to the misguided, socially awkward, and sex starved young chaps that tend to gravitate to the seduction community.

Firstly, there would not be a seduction community if the manipulative, misogynistic, and cynical attitudes and strategies outlined by PUAs didn't work. If there was absolutely no truth to it, then PUAs would not be PUAs, because no woman would touch them.

Dating and meeting women is scary. Rejection hurts, and is a daily part of life for a man attempting to meet a woman for long term relationship or even a short term fling. Working up the courage to approach a woman (interestingly, I've never been approached by a woman, but this does show an example of a gender role: men are expected to initiate, maybe its because men are wired to want sex more? who knows) then deal with rejection is pretty painful.

tl;dr: I'm not for ""seduction"", but there are a LOT of socially awkward men out there who may never meet a woman, and harmful gender roles have created a society in which it is very difficult for men, particularly less attractive ones, to form a healthy sexual relationship with a woman.

[deleted],,,"The thing is, this law would have been a good one if it was not for all the crazy ass-hats that will accuse any woman who has a late miscarriage of murder. 

After all, if my girlfriend was pregnant, and somebody poisoned or abused her, causing her to miscarry, I'd not consider it unreasonable to consider the killing of the foetus a crime in addition to the abuse.

Unfortunately that is not likely to be how these laws will be enforced, and limiting liability to third parties ( i.e not the mother ) would still get doctors and abortion practitioners harassed under it.  

The saddest thing about all this is that it means you cannot have sane rules. If you look at Norway or Sweden, we have strict time-limits on abortion ( 12 and 24 weeks in respective countries ) , but it is not a major problem in practice because women here can access a clinic without being harassed, healthcare ( including abortions ) is tax funded, so they can afford it, and hormonal contraceptives are heavily subsidised and available to anybody who doesn't have medical contraindications ( high blood pressure, history of blood clots ... )

I would go so far as to argue that the conservative positions on contraceptives and abortion is causing women to have more abortions, and to have them latter than they otherwise would, and that will not be good for anybody.

ThroAwayTransvisions,,,"&gt;We gave the Saudi's the go ahead to suppress that uprising in return for Saudi Arabia's blessing in Libya.

I agree, thats a bunch of bs. It doesnt change the fact that his conduct with Libyia, Tunisia, Egypt, and Syria, are counter to that of previous administrations. Its a pitfall of a realistic foreign policy. This goes back throughout us history: Jefferson, Polk, McKinley, T Roosevelt. 

&gt;I believe that the Neo cons retort to what you've said here would be ""well ofcourse...this is what we thought would happen. We'd push the first domino (Hussein) and the rest will fall on their own"".

And i disagree with that, i have debated this with several people. The toppling of Saddam was a major influence on the uprisings, but not in the way neo cons make it out to be.  The Middle East was tired of being *controlled* by the US in the way we *controlled* Iraq through Saddam and the invasion. They are happy with US *support* and friendship, but want to be independent and equals, not puppets. Which the US has so far essentially agreed to as long as we dont turn Libya into Cuba post War of 1898.

&gt;I just see this incredible double standard. Bush tortures Sheik Muhammed and everyone wants war crimes charges but Obama assassinates a 16 year old american citizen and all I here are crickets. Its frightening. 

Im on the fence of saying Bush committed ""war crimes."" I think ""war crimes"" should be reserved for things like genocide. He did do a lot of things worthy of investigation and definitely unconstitutional and immoral, unfortunately Obama has continued some of these, and yes it is a double standard. I think the reason he gets off with it, is because in the end he has gotten more done on foreign policy without committing ground troops or long term engagements. I know its horrifying, but its a numbers game. Obama get the same objective ~~without~~ while killing fewer people. Not saying its right or we should not be upset about it, just saying why he gets away with it.

&gt;I knew he was pulling a fast one on all of you during the campaign and I wrote at length about it but over the last few years as he was obviously all bullshit I've been astonished at how he's so completely pulled the wool over his followers eyes. Its scary. I'm sorry you seem like a very intelligent kind person but this is insanity.

I hope you dont think i am ""follower"" of Obama. Because his administration has gone about as well as i expected, *averagely*. I didnt know specifically what he would do wrong, but i knew his shit wasn't made of gold. People often ask me if i am disapointed by the overall outcome. No, i knew he wasnt a messiah who would bring forth some type of revolution and that he would end up falling a certain amount to the status quo just as much as anyone else would. I'm sorry, you too are incredibly intelligent, but if you think Ron Paul wont have his pitfalls as well, you are making the same mistake you accuse Obama's followers of doing. That of demagoguery and worship.

ThroAwayTransvisions,,,"&gt;I think they bicker about small issues and magnify them for something to energize their base

oh 100% agree.

As to the Arab Spring. This is apart of the change to foreign relations. 

&gt;Libya was a fucking train wreck. Qhaddafi gave up is WMD program and then some western nations got together and bombed the fuck out of him and now his son is being tortured and he was executed like a dog in the street. 

Train wreck really? What is important to note about the arab spring is that it was started by the people of those countries, it was not started by western nations. Unlike in Iraq where the US forced something upon a people, the citizens of those countries rose up on their own accord in opposition to pro-western tyrants such as Gaddafi, Mubarak, and Ben Ali, because they were essentially puppets of the US; western nations merely decided to support those democratic efforts. This is a huge change for the US, rather than protecting tyrannical regimes just because they do what we want, we supported a democratic cause rooted in the beliefs of the people themselves. There would have been massively more killing if the west had not gotten involved. Also, Obama chose to have a true coalition, not like Bush's ""Coalition of the willing"" that was essentially unilateral US leadership. The western group that provided air support was not primarily US led either, this was a big change toward international cooperation, something the gop criticized him for and would have rather had an iraq style invasion. Also good to point out the US and the west didnt act until asked by the Lybians and the Arab League both. 

&gt;his son is being tortured and he was executed like a dog in the street.

You are going to hold him accountable for the actions of revolutionaries not under his control? He is being tortured [really?](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8969560/Saif-al-Islam-Gaddafi-held-in-isolation-but-is-in-good-physical-condition.html) Even if he was, he is being held by Lyban authorities. You cannot hold Obama responsible for the actions of a sovereign government. Ill give you that it is wrong he hasnt seen a lawyer or his family, but once again, cant judge Obama on actions of the Libyans. 

&gt;Did you see the women getting beaten in dragged through the streets in Cairo the other day?

Once again, cant hold him accountable for the actions of foreign government.

&gt;How's he been with Iran?

What are you implying? That he has done something wrong with Iran? Trying to open ties and including them in negotiations over Iraq and Afganistan (their two longest borders) is wrong?

&gt; He assassinated 3 US citizens in Yemen in the last 3 months and one of them was 16.

Notice i said i *mostly* agree with his actions with the arab spring. His silence on Yemen and Bahrain i do not agree with. Although he has said a thing or two about Bahrain, which i was happy to hear, and the US is now starting to seriously pressure Syria.

&gt;Never mind all of this...he signed NDAA. That is completely inexcusable...

ThroAwayTransvisions,,,"By honesty i mean what i said about Ron Paul as well. Its a belief in what he is saying while also thoroughly understanding why they believe it, whether or not it is right or wrong. You dont get that from a lot of polititians. Ex, every time you ask a republican why they want to lower taxes, why they oppose glbt rights, why they support isreal, they can never explain why they view it that way past just a talking point. I feel Obama (not on every issue) can, but that doesnt mean i agree with him all the time.

&gt;Other than repealing don't ask don't tell he's been an abject failure on every major aspect of his Presidency.

DADT, handling of the arab spring (although a few initial fumbles) i agree with him on mostly, getting out of iraq and hopefully afganistan, his overall approach to diplomacy is a BIG change from previous decades (this sounds silly but it actualy is important), his energy policies, and on a personal note as a trans woman i appreciate being able to change my gender on my passport (something i cant do on my dl in tx) and his recent focus on glbt issue internationally. I find these successes, and he did at least try for a public option, although as you pointed out, he did fail.

But at the same time, yes, he has failures. Healthcare, his handling of isreal, certain womens issues, some economic issues, NASA, etc. On the whole, i would say he has done an *average* job. But at least he has done an average job working for ends that i mostly agree with, instead of the opposite direction.

&gt; you're not going to get anything different out of Romney or Newt that you'll get out of Obama.

Do you really believe that? I agree that both the dems and the gop are shitty choices, but with the gop we would be getting major tax cuts to the rich, more ""cowboy"" diplomacy, increased military spending, more deregulation (same deregulation that got us in this economic mess). They would also curtail women's, minorities, and glbt rights along with the general civil liberties MORE than Obama has (for clarification he has not curtailed minority or glbt rights). Just look at the gop's views on anti-discrimination laws, unions, healthcare, corporate law, or ANY foreign policy matter and you will see that they are worse than Obama.

Im fine with Obama being criticized from the left, hell i do myself. But when given the choice between him or any of the gop candidates, ill choose Obama anyday. At least with Obama you get attempts at progress on most issues, whereas the gop is mostly regressive, obstructionist, and dogmatic.

On the contrary, i disagree with him on several issues such as the recent ones involving emergency contraception, NASA (one a care about a lot), and some economic issues. 

Most of the support i have for Obama i have out of a ""lesser of two evils"" reasoning. But I have gotten that honesty from Obama at times (although not as much recently), a bit more honesty in regard to other politicians. Still not the kind of honesty you expect from people in the real world though. 

I have read ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and i see that this years NDAA and recent decisions over the FDA inch towards that. This year's NDAA had some awful parts about it that i hope it can be challenged in court as i feel they would be ruled unlawful.

HertzaHaeon,,,"I think religion at its core is oppressive, yes, because it relies on dogmatic thinking, accepting opinion as truth based on nothing but faith, rejection of critical thinking, embracing traditions, the idea of chosen people or individuals, etc, etc.

That doesn't mean religious people can't do good. I'm well aware of them and know many good religious people.

I think religion has a net negative effect, and we're very far away from the point where we can freely choose to live without having to bow to other people's superstitions and delusions in any way. That's especially true for many women, lbgt people and other minorities around the world, and I find it very sad when feminists apologize for religion and blindly focus on the positive aspects.

adribean,,,"I appreciate this critique, but I think it fails to address that Liz Lemon is written as an anti-hero. The show mocks her for her half-assed feminism and white privilege (for example, the episode where she assumes Tracy can't read and tried to 'help' and she's explicitly called a racist). You're supposed to be kind of disgusted that feminism is the flag pin on her lapel and little more. 

I do agree that Tina Fey is not ugly, of course she's not. But that's a reflection on completely screwy beauty standards in media. a la, Christina Hendricks can't get dresses to wear to awards shows because no one wants someone above a size two wearing their clothes. I'm sure that much of the 'ugly girl' thing comes from things that have actually been said to her as a woman who has her face on TV a lot. 

That said, Tina Fey as a character in the show is a real kind of person and all the critiques listed are accurate. I just don't think we should blame the show for it existing.

carolinax,,,"&gt;The fact that many 12 year olds are pressured by their families and agents to enter the industry, or are poached from problematic situations in economically suffering countries, compounds these problems.

The same can be said of 18 year old models from around the world/Eastern Europe, in addition to tweenage girls who go into modeling with the support of their parents and healthy mentoring within the industry. I'm not sure where you were going with that. I brought tweenage models because somehow 10 year olds shouldn't be photographed, and yet Karlie Kloss can become a sensation at 13.

&gt; Fashion photography is a very different animal from portraiture/fine art, however artful the photography may be. 

That nude model was on the cover of an publicly-funded, and publicly available art magazine. Sure, it was in protest to other censorship, but is using a child's body to convey your message of protest any more ""pure"" than using a child's body to sell a product? You can bullshit yourself, but you can't bullshit me.

&gt;The industry is based on enhancing sex appeal and buyability of a product.

Also, art is it's own product. I wouldn't be surprised if some of those portraits were for sale at the gallery. 

&gt;Even if the photographer's intent were 100% ""pure,"" you have to be aware of the audience you're releasing your work into.

Who's the largest buying demographic of fashion magazines? Women. 

&gt;Legitimizing imagery that sexualizes children because the photographer ""didn't mean it"" makes it more okay for other instances where the child was coerced, abused, exploited.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold your speedy horses. In no way shape or form am I [legitimizing](http://feministactivism.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/creepy-sexualization-of-children1.jpg?w=490) anything that blatantly [sexualizes](http://www.feministfatale.com/tag/sexualizing-children/) children. 

I agree with you when you say that the work we do doesn't exist in a vacuum. However, we can't go about blowing things so dramatically out of the water that you lose perspective of what we're actually dealing with here. This model isn't being coerced into this because there's waaayy too much publicity on her. If she was really doing these things against her will, she wouldn't be doing them for long. Everything else you describe is CP. I don't think **anything** legitimizes CP. 

&gt;You can't look at these photographs like they magically exist on their own and ignore who they were made for, who will see them, and how it relates to everything else on the market.

I'm curious to know who you believe will be the primary viewers of these images? They're made to be viewed by the target market, women if the images are published in a women's fashion magazine. In her glamorous photo shoot the underlying message was fashion's obsession with youth. Placing a child in adult's clothes only shows how ridiculous the situation is getting in the industry. 

I get it. I do. It's fucked up when little girls are made to look and act like they're much older. There's plenty of time for that later. But implying that a photo of a kid with messy, tousled hair, a blank expression, and an open mouth will suddenly launch the ships of a thousand pedos (because this is what *everyone* is concerned about, even me to a small degree) is so remarkably hilarious **because pedophiles will salivate over any attractive child.** Weird huh?

You can't draw a perfect analogy between a septuagenarian and a child, as senior citizens are desexualized in our culture and seen as sexually inert. Seeing a child in a grown up woman's clothing, hinting at nudity, is seen as sexually suggestive and taboo.

You can't just ignore cultural context and say ""I don't see it."" Even if you don't see it, cultural precedent exists.

I personally see the very first photo of the model as the most sexualized, with a woman's blown-out ""sex hair"" hairdo and smoldering eyes, etc. The rest are debatable.

spanktruck,,,"Yup. 

OK, so, most Orthodox Jew--men and women--cover their collarbones, elbows, and knees. Women wear skirts and men where pants. Colours etc. are fine. (There's one infamously crazy, but not quite Haredi, text that places strict limits of what colour hearts may be on clothing, if red is inherently wrong, etc.) After marriage, Orthodox women cover their hair, either with wigs or with tichels (scarves) or snoods. (Men cover their heads at all times with a kippah or with a hat). 

Most Haredi groups severely disapprove of colour--it attract the eye--which is part of the reason Haredi men are big fans of the black-n-white, and why women tend to stick to blues and greys and blacks. (Satmar is the most extreme example for women, with solid black stockings at all times, solid black shawls to help hide their figure, long LONG black skirts, and black caps to hide their bald heads--they shave their heads rather than let one strand show. Other Haredi groups see the black stockings as immodest because they draw attention to the leg. I am not kidding. Haredi fashion, man!).

Haredi groups also have very very strict neckline requirements for women (not so much for men, which is bull, modesty requirements are almost equal for men and women) and sleeve length requirements (often going to the wrist). 

So that school is perfectly modest by 90% of Jews' opinions, the problem being that the crazy ultra-Orthodox Jews are giving those women crap just for being out of the house and in their line of sight.

This is especially despicable because there's a principle in Jewish law that you shouldn't embarrass people publicly. Most Orthodox Jews won't shake hands with someone of the opposite sex, but there's a few important responza that say it is better to shake the hand and avoid embarrassing the other person than to make any sort of big deal out of it. The idea that people would go out of their way to embarrass and humiliate people is shameful. But then again, Haredim also violate the Shabbat by stoning cars that drive through their neighbourhoods, so my respect for them is as low as possible.

It's a function that is entirely independent of gender and race. In the past, whenever the monarch wanted to go to war, whether king or queen, it was the poor who wound up as conscripts in the armies. It was the poor who had their families shattered by these power structures.

The people who find themselves in power try to hoard that power; they get greedy about it... and when they do, they start believing themselves to be above the rest of the populace, as if having power gives them the excuse to flaunt it over other people, instead of wielding power responsibly and fairly.

spanktruck,,,"""Orthodox"" Jews is a misnomer here. 

Kikar HaShabbat, where the protests took place, is in a heavily ULTRA-Orthodox (hereafter Haredi) neighbourhood of Jerusalem. It's very close to Meah Shearim, a neighbourhood where tourists (including some friends of mine) can have rocks thrown at them, have glue poured over them, etc. It's also close to Geulah, a more moderate Haredi/right-leaning Orthodox neighbourhood, There are semi-regular 'modesty patrols' of Haredi Jews (often from Mea Shearim) asking people to dress modestly. (Geulah is still popular for religious shoppers). 

In short, it's the Crazy Pants capital of Jerusalem. Pretty much any Jew who isn't Haredi thinks they're absolutely nuts. (Of course, Rabbis saying that [this is insanity](http://www.aish.com/jw/s/An_Open_Letter_to_the_Beit_Shemesh_Spitter.html?mobile=yes&amp;c=y) don't get as much press). 

In addition, this is in reaction to the Beit Shemesh protests, which were an intra-Orthodox brouhaha. Haredi people in Beit Shemesh were abusing (spitting on, throwing sotnes at) ""immodestly"" dressed (probably meaning knee-length skirts and use of--gasp!--colour) women and girls. Orthodox Jews in Beit Shemesh protested being made to feel like criminals for walking around. Beit Shemesh is also the home of the so-called ""Taliban Mom,"" who dresses in 7 layers of burka-equivalents and who refuses to speak in front of men. Beit Shemesh is also a crazy-pants place.

Second, the article cites a pretty dubious/flawed study. Rebecca Jordan hits it pretty hard in her book [_Brain Storm: The Flaws in the Science of Sex Differences_](http://www.amazon.com/No-I-Dont-Want-A-Goddam-Kindle-Amazon-But-Thanks-For-Asking-For-The-Thousandth-Time/dp/0674057309).

linuxlass,,,"&gt;They may enjoy building, but they favor role play. So it’s bye-bye Bionicles, hello princesses. 

How does this even follow?  My daughter does role play, but she has a collection of realistic hard rubber animals, as well as a wooden pirate ship with wooden people. She sometimes used her stuffed animals (mostly beanie babies) in her stories, but usually not.  I recall hearing lots of exclamations and growls eminating from her room when she was 4-6 years old.  

She's 11 now, and likes dragons. She's tried several times to make dragons that can glide, and she's writing a ""book"" involving dragons - her friends enjoy reading each chapter as she finishes it. This Christmas, we gave her a couple of hard rubber dragons to add to her animals. :)

Furthermore, my son, who is definitely more stereotypically ""boy"", nevertheless loved sparkly, shiny, and soft things as a kid. More often than not, he used his legos to build houses with elaborate gardens (he bought a bunch of flowers and trees and vines from ebay with his allowance), and used the translucent colored blocks to build elaborate structures that he could then put a light inside. These days, he's really into computer programming with pygame, but also spends a lot of time creating graphics and 3D models for his games.

We limited our kids' exposure to plastic and commercialized toys, and encouraged open-ended play.  The shiny sparkly stones my son liked as a little kid became ""gems"" in a shopkeeper game he played with his sister when he was a little older. The Christmas lights in his room became parts for electrical circuits he would build with batteries. My daughter loved playing ""slave catcher"" (a Redwall-inspired game) and sword fighting with sticks, and building a house with a ""thatched roof"" in the backyard with her brother, and when he outgrew these games, she became best friends with a boy and they ride bikes and wander in the ""woods"" near our house and explore the creek.

She's never worn a dress or skirt in her life, but when she had to wear something black for her band concert and I said she could have either pants or a skirt, she chose a skirt.

shallah,,,"&gt;In an America where abortion has been legal for over thirty-five years, the procedure can be surprisingly inaccessible: even in cases of rape, imminent threat to the mother’s life, or complicated miscarriage—and even with a willing doctor. 

&gt;How did the post–Roe v. Wade world come to resemble pre-Roe so closely? While ""abortion wars"" may immediately bring to mind the very real threat of antiabortion violence, sociologist Carole Joffe shows how a pervasive stigma operates less dramatically but just as effectively to maintain cultural, political, and economic barriers to access.

&gt;After thirty years embedded in reproductive-health research, Joffe relays compelling testimony from doctors, health-care workers, and patients as they struggle against these barriers that shame women and marginalize physicians, even within the medical community. Real-life stories include those of poverty-stricken rape victims scrambling—and sometimes failing—to cover the cost of abortions that should be covered by Medicaid; a doctor having to beg her superior for permission to perform in-hospital a medical abortion too dangerous to handle at a clinic; and a woman whose miscarriage is causing septic shock refused care and bundled off to another hospital.

jacobman,,,"tl,dr: too much to summarize. Ignore if you don't want to read. 

I really appreciate this article as it includes the source of all the analysis. It should be required that all articles like this provide things as clearly as this one does. 

Here are possible issues I see with the study and conclusion: 

1) 8th grade and below is the main population for the data. If math specifically is being used for the tests, do the skills needed for the simple math at that age represent the same skill set that is needed for high level math later on? If math isn't specifically used for the testing, what types of questions are asked? 

2) While the study does show that the cultural noise makes obtaining a good estimate of the actual distribution of innate mathematical skill hard, that does not prove that some of the populations are not fairly close to the true distribution of abilities. This is important because any population without significant cultural influences that does not differ much from the natural distribution may see differences in gender representations in math intensive fields due solely to differing standard deviations in the gender populations. The fact that cultural influences are present does not mean that natural distribution influences are not also present. 

3) The data of the difference in test score averages to ratio of the test score variance for men to women shows a strong negative correlation. If this data is fit and the fit is assumed to represent the expected distribution properties for any of those two parameters, two things can be noticed. When it is assumed that this line represents the expected distribution for any of those two parameters, we know that the true distribution would lie somewhere on that line. If the true distribution were to be located at the point where there was no difference in variance of the skill between men and women the mean for the mathematical skill parameter for men would be 0.12 higher than that of the female population. If the true distribution was located at any other point, such as where there was no difference in the mean skill between men and women, there would be a difference in the variances of the two genders. In particular, at the point where the mean skills were equivalent, men would have an approximately 1.08 times larger standard deviation. In general the fit does not suggest an equality between the skill distribution of men and women with the confines of the test that was administered for this study. 

However, I do admit that the noise in the data points is quite high and therefore defining the precise line that the true distribution lies on from such an analysis is likely prone to much error. It could be that the true distribution lies on a line that has a smaller slope, in which case it is possible that the true distribution lies on the point where the difference in mean scores is zero and the ratio of variances is one. This would be the case in an ideal world where men and women had the exact same potential, but I would say that the data is at best inconclusive on if the world truly is ideal. 

4) The study points out that by increasing womens pay both boys and girls test scores increase. However, they then only suggest trying to equalize pay differences as an option. 

First of all, it is mentioned in the article that ""eliminating gender discrimination in pay and employment opportunities could be part of a win-win formula for producing an adequate supply of future workers with high-level competence in mathematics."" This implies that the differences in employment and pay are due to discrimination, which was not shown in this study. Furthermore the entire purpose of the study was to study what the reasons for the employment differences could be. The fact that the conclusion assumes discrimination calls the entire study and approach into question, as it implies that the person conducting the study had already arrived at a conclusion without data. 

Second of all the study does not attempt to think of any other possible reasons for the increase in achievement with higher equality in womens pay. This could be due to the fact that the researchers had went into the study already convinced of what the truth was, as I indicated earlier. I can easily think of another possibility that was not mentioned. 

It is possible that there is widespread discrimination against men with regards to their ability to raise their children. This would mean that the mothers education and income would make more of a difference in influencing childrens education. It would also mean that giving unequal treatment to women's education and income would result in better educated children, even if this practice was discriminatory towards men. If this hypothesis were true, the data would represent discrimination against men, and the best approach would be to eliminate these inequalities with regard to raising children. Overall, the data is simply inconclusive, but the different possibilities represent vastly different situations that require vastly different approaches. 

I appreciate these studies and I hope that each one is approached without jumping to conclusions before hand or before the data fully supports those conclusions. As long as studies like this continue to be done, these unanswered questions should be able to be answered, but impartiality must be stressed, especially with such a controversial topic.

jacobman,,,"&gt; This nonsense is so elementary that even fifth graders can quickly point out to Ms. Trotta that there is no expectation of rape from close contact with males elsewhere, for instance, with coworkers, colleagues and in social settings.

False. It is expected, as pretty much no-one expects that among all people working there is not a single rapist. There are rapists, and until there are not, it would be illogical not to expect some number of incidents. What is not expected is that the victims will not be supported, which is part of the point Liz is making. 

She's saying that it's costly to mingle women and men, because the woman who are unjustly assaulted do have to be supported, just like in the workplace and in social settings. I don't know where she's going from there, but if she's suggesting that the cost of mingling men and women might outweigh the gains from having both sex's at the military's disposal, then without further information, that seems like a reasonable question to look into if you're interested in the efficiency of the military. 

As I've mentioned in the past, this whole hoopla about the Liz Trotta quotes is blatant poaching of someone's words in order to present the most damning sound bites and inflammatory representation possible while circumventing the responsibility of taking an honest look at what reasonable things the person could be trying to say. 

Liz Trotta didn't do a good job at making a point, but these articles seem like pure propaganda drivel, as it doesn't attempt to approach the conversation with any amount of impartiality in order to figure out what somewhat sane points the person might actually be trying to make. Instead the articles approach the situation assuming that the person talking is not a reasonable person like most people are.

I WAS in the navy (submarines) and I am retired. I don't know when you served, but things were not like you describe them... not at all... when I was in. 

I DID work with Marines, of course. NO ONE wants to willingly fight and die. Would a Marine shoot someone if necessary? Absolutely. It's their job. Do they run around shooting people indiscriminately? No. Do they WANT to kill? No, I don't think so. 

And I did NOT have my 'head in the sand'. You DO enforce peace through superior firepower. That is the way of the world works, whether you like it or not (and I don't). But I am a realist. 

I, too, can be very critical of the military; the same as I can be (and am) very critical of politicians or corporations. Nothing, and no one, is perfect.

Stating that a 5-year old may have GID does nothing in terms of altering that childs life, especially if the parents are already allowing the child to express their gender.  No decisions about actually changing the child physically would be brought up until they near puberty, at which point you will have had 7+ years to view and further assess the desires of the child.  

The only change that would come from a diagnosis such as that, is possibly convincing parents to let their child explore their identity.  It sounds like in the case of this article, the parents were already allowing their child to do that.  Really it feels like the diagnosis is more for the parents so they are aware of what they could be dealing with, and less for the child in question.

But then, I've often wondered about how effective advertising that doesn't convey really new information really is.

For example, does advertising for Coke or Pepsi really affect sales in any way at all?  Most people who drink soda have a strong preference for one brand or another, I doubt strongly that a person who prefers Coke will try Pepsi due to an ad.  And people who have no preference generally take whatever is available.

From an abortion standpoint there are, basically, three groups.

1) People who are, or lean, pro-choice.

2) People who are, or lean anti-choice.

3) People who have not formed any particular opinion.

Group 2 might, possibly, become a bit more involved if they see a dismembered fetus, but they may also get irked at the thought of kids seeing the ad and being squicked.

It seems unlikely to me that even the more wavering members of group one would be pushed to neutrality or anti-choice positions by a gross out ad.

Which leaves group three.  Are they more grossed out than anything, and thus pushed away from the anti-choice position, or do the dismembered feti engage their empathy and drag them to the anti-choice position?

gglife,,,"&gt; I think it's already treated rather like a physical condition - how many mental disorders do you know that surgeons can cure?

My point exactly.  It's not a mental condition, it is a physical one.  To ""cure"" GID, you do not take drugs to alter the brain and the way it thinks, you take drugs to alter the body so it matches the brain.  

&gt; It is heavily policed, however, by psychiatrists because other conditions need to be ruled out and there can be a lot of illnesses that go along with it. 41% of trans people attempt suicide, which I can't help feeling is largely because of the prejudices of society.

It is heavily policed for now.  True, other conditions can lead to feelings of GID, but they are rare and usually severe in nature to begin with (sociopath is the prominent one I have heard of).  Informed consent is becoming more readily available for things like hormones.  

Psychiatrists will most likely retain control over the irreversible decisions (SRS) but for all of the steps that can be reversed, like hormone treatment, we're going to start to see them lose their control.  

I don't think it's fair to claim that since there is a high suicide-rate (caused by the prejudices of society) that a psychiatrist is mandatory.  Nobody's transition is the same, and not everyone faces the same hardships.  Not every therapist is concerned with strictly your well being, and some can outright be gatekeepers.  I don't think it's fair to force a person who is handling their transition fine to pay money to an unnecessary professional.  

That being said a good therapist can do wonders and for some is absolutely necessary.  I feel like that is a decision that should be left to the patient though, and not enforced - and in fact, this is exactly the type of thinking we're seeing with the new WPATH and the rise of informed consent clinics.

The clip you linked to tells a very tragic story, but hardly a very relevant one for this debate. We're two westerners on /r/feminisms arguing about the proper and improper use of a word, this being a context where any non-feministic male point of view may be a bit short of dominant (and this is what I mean by my ""wrong"" gender, wrong *here and now*, or in any similar context).

[3 (noun, destruction)](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/rape_3),

HappyGiraffe,,,"The article is wildly problematic and diminishes the experience of thousands of transgender individuals, but beneath all the bullshit is a sentiment worth discussing. 

It has been the history of diagnosing GID that boys are more heavily policed than girls. I believe (correct me if I am wrong) that diagnostic criteria for GID have been revised since the days when, in order for a boy to be diagnosed with GID, he merely had to display a preference for so-called ""feminine"" activities or clothes, but a girl had to display the belief that she needed or would grow a penis. 

Even with the adjustments, it still remains that males are more frequently pathologized when it comes to displaying non-cis behavior, and I feel this is largely due to our social preference for the masculine over the feminine, the idea that we, socially, are more likely to accept a ""boyish girl"" than a ""girlish boy."" Some may pitch this as misandry, but I see it still as a symptom of socialized misogyny that devalues the feminine. 

As the mother of a boy, I am torn on this. On one hand, I hate to think that a preference for pink would warrant a trip to a psychiatrist among some circles, but on the other I would never want him to think that, should he ever feel wrongly-bodied, that I would downplay and make him stuff it aside as ""merely some childhood thing.""

So when someone doesn't fit our gender roles, does that mean they are mentally ill, or perhaps they are just different?

On one hand, they are clearly atypical or abnormal.  Much like homosexuality is abnormal in that the majority of the people, the mean, don't do it.  But then again, having a college degree is abnormal, as is a life long monogamous marriage (either gay or straight).

It makes sense, but it also ignores that Big Business isn't a spectator. Sexism is maintained via an interaction between popular culture, advertisement and local culture. Big Business plays a leading role in the advertisement department and while I will concede that it is not the prime cause for sexism, it does have an important hand in maintaining and furthering it. 

For example, there is little doubt that many women face a lack of self-confidence due to the projection of an unreasonable image primarily by the fashion and make-up industry (fashion and make-up models usually look far more 'perfect' that movie stars for example). Those same industries claim to have the answer to these self-confidence problems. It's in their interest to further sexist stereotypes and they really love doing that (see also labiaplasty and the diet industry). As such, trying to change our culture without tackling them is going to be an unreasonable task.

Edit: On second thoughts, are we thinking of slapping down Big Business in the same way?

ulookprettytiedup,,,"I understand if someone wants to try to adjust their rates based on eliminating a risk. For instance, I have to pay for a (horrible no good) high deductible individual plan. I was not able to have any kind of prenatal or birth coverage without opting in and paying an extra 700 a month. However, even though I have eliminated that risk for myself, my rates still go into a pool that will pay out to someone who paid for that coverage. Although I will never have prostate issues, and my plan would probably deny any billing for prostate issues (I did not have to opt out of this, my status as a female does the opting out for me), my premium still goes into the pool that pays out for prostate issues. If they were to do their insurance magic and factor in the lowered monetary risk a person was taking by eliminating birth control from their coverage, I'd be willing to bet its pennies, because technically at the very least half the insurance population is already not at risk for BC. The issue lies with implying that you get any say in what your premiums go to in the end. If you use the flood insurance example, you are only eliminating yourself and your risk from the end payout. If there is a major flood, you can bet part of the money you paid for regular house insurance will still be used to cover the insurance companies losses.
If you get a group plan (ie employee based) that option of adjusting rates is moot, because the point of that is the ""bulk"" discount. The insurance companies already know not everyone will use every service, and have a calculated risk with a price tag on it. Im not even going to get into the religious exemption, because again, unless they are self insured, they will still go into the ""pool"" with other people who are covered for BC.

First, you realize that the ['wrong' gender is actually female,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISme5-9orR0) right? That's a historical and global reality.  Thinking women or others see you as wrong-gendered is a reality only within the confines of your own self-perception. 


Given the above, it seems to me that you have brought some baggage to this conversation that we need to unpack.  Absolutely no one here is demeaning the male experience.  No one is accusing men of being 'chauvinist pigs' or anything of the sort.  Women also use the word rape.  No one is saying they see phalluses everywhere.  You are infusing this conversation with your own perceived notions of how women see and talk about rape.  

Your 'feelings' are certainly a valid channel of analysis, but perhaps in this case you also need to step out of yourself for a moment and look at the bigger picture.  Although you may *feel* as though your words are spoken in a vaccuum, with a special meaning only you understand, there is a greater likelihood that your thoughts, actions, desires, and yes, the words you speak, are a product of your context.  What you ""believe in and stand for"" are not really about you, but your parents, community, etc.  

In terms of your belief that these words have no greater implications, please see my [example](http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/pwtfl/rape/c3t5r3a) about a student, a story which attests to the connection between word and action.

itsasocialconstruct,,,"I am not Muslim or from the Middle East, but I will share some of my thoughts on European countries that ban the burqa and face covering. The law represents one end on a spectrum that I will call the Totalitarian-Relitivist spectrum. Totalitarian here would refer to myths about a culture that assume some sort of essentialist knowledge of it. When the French government banned the burqa they are doing so because their observations of Islamic culture lead them to believe that the burqa is without exception a means of oppressing women, and that it has no cultural value beyond that. In doing so it is implied that Muslim culture is oppressive of women. So from this it can be abstracted that the French government is deciding that Western culture is a) not oppressive to women and b) that it is preferable that people assimilate to Western culture if they live in France. In many ways it can be said that the law is a manifestation of West vs. East mentality and a manifestation of a Colonialist outlook: the French government is 'civilizing' Muslims, bringing the 'light of Judeo-Christian freedom to the barbarians.' (Sound familiar, India?)

Now it would be just as bad to say something like, ""Well, if Muslim women are being honor-killed and their political and economic freedoms are non-existent, well... that is *just their culture.*"" Because lets face it, women are being killed, they *are* oppressed, we can't just *do nothing,* that would be the Relativist attitude. This attituude *also* (like Totalitarianism) assumes that their is an essential *difference* between the West and the East. By that logic the law still makes sense: French society? Too different to allow for Muslim culture.

So then what can be taken from this. Both view points are... the word I will choose is 'useless.' Rather I would say that we need a balance, where we recognize that a) parts of Islam are oppressive to some women and b) parts of Western culture are oppressive to some women. We must work with the conflicts between extreme relativism and totalitarianism to find an answer that doesn't reify difference. The paradox presented is a not a place to give up at, but rather to think about problems in new way. 'Resistance is fertile' as they say.

Also be weary of privileging people based on identity...

INxP,,,"&gt;rape is a gendered, power-based crime, and using the word as a metaphor plays right into the same oppressive gendered narrative as the act it came from

Hair-splitting time, then. 

I have to admit that it seems that any discussion on this particular subject always gets, sooner or later, distorted and diffused by forcibly tying it to these ideologically loaded concepts that people just insist on reading into any and every thing that is being said about it, or, as is the case with these metaphors, about anything completely unrelated using just some of the same terminology.  Let's give it a go anyway, and see if I manage to get my stance more clear.

Sometimes a cigar *is* just a cigar, not a thinly veiled symbol of phallic male dominance that the brotherhood of patriarchy wants to shove down your throat. And sometimes a metaphor *is* just a metaphor, not an attempt to trivialize, oppress, or participate in a gendered narrative.

For just one very concrete example of using the term ""wrong"": [a certain very popular local band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMMP), led by two female singers (who have also done a song for the local branch of Amnesty International for their campaign against violence against women, FWIW), have in one of their more popular songs a somewhat poorly translatable line about how ""the frost rapes this land"". *To me* that's just a poetic line using the term as a metaphor -- and I can't quite think of any alternative term to replace it without losing some of the expressive power and accuracy of that line -- which is essentially about (not actual rape, but something as unrelated as) living under the harsh climate of Northern Europe. 

But you want me to believe that what the song is *really* about is the band *playing into the same oppressive gender narrative as the act it came from*? That what these women are *really* doing is trivializing the act of rape and contributing to the oppression of women?

I'm truly sorry if this makes impossible my peaceful coexistence with anyone, but I simply don't know how to force myself into seeing it that way. What I see in the whole debate is more akin to an attempt by some people to monopolize a commonly used word with expressive power far beyond it's most strict and literal meaning, for what I can only see as political purposes -- the intentions are of course good, but the methods I just can't really approve of. It's my language too.

I understand that rape *can be* by definition a gendered crime *if* we choose to define it as such, as some institutions have done (which I'd claim to be a pretty clear case of institutionalized misandry, but that's another discussion). I also understand that even when including non-penile sexual violations and/or those that have a male as a victim (penile or not), it may in practice be a predominantly male-on-female violation, *if* we choose to exclude prison environments, as we often do (for reasons that aren't entirely acceptable to me), and so on and so forth. If we however accept that one does not need a vagina to be raped, and that people convicted of crimes are people too, and that a rape can also be an act of violation that does not involve inserting a penis into something (or just being a man), then we're not really talking about a gendered crime anymore.

Likewise we could conveniently just *define* oppression as ""all the bad stuff that men do to women"" and conclude that women are oppressed because they're women, and men aren't because they're men, but I hope this is not the level of the discussion we're supposed to have. Or anyone is.

Power-based I could easily agree with, but even that gets a bit blurry the further away we sway from the ""conventional"" definition of a forceful act while using or threatening with violence. I'm sure there have been cases of men being retroactively accused of rape (not of being irresponsible, or inconsiderate, or assholes, but of *rape*) for having mutually consenting sex with an intoxicated partner, when any power aspect was never a real motivation, although I'm not sure if this is (yet) a very common scenario. Anyway, I believe for most cases the power aspect does, at least to a degree, apply.

What I simply don't understand is that how does the use of a term as a metaphor constitute an act of oppression when the term itself isn't derogatory towards any group or gendered -- any particular act of violation may or may not be gendered, of course, depending on the case, but that does not cover the full meaning and applicability of the term. (If anything, even the field of its *literal* applicability seems to be expanding as we speak, largely due to Women's Rights activists wanting it to include scenarios that traditionally wouldn't have been included -- not necessarily a bad thing, but something to keep in mind when accusing others of misusing the term as if there even exists one universally accepted definition for its literal meaning.)

I also do understand that just hearing the word can be an unwanted reminder of traumatic events, for which exact reason I often hesitate to use it even if it seems to be the most descriptive term in any particular context. But that's because I don't want to be an insensitive asshole, not because I'd be trivializing, oppressing or participating in a gendered narrative if I would in fact use it. 

Most of the time these assumed implications just seem awkwardly forced and glued-on in order to gain significance for issues that just aren't there -- they're *somewhere*, but not there. It's this ""Everything is about Me and My Womanhood"" attitude that most bothers me here -- some things simply aren't. Sometimes it's just other people talking about other things that have nothing to do with you or your socio-political interpretations, using words that you want to claim ownership to, meaning things with them that you don't mean with them, and being accused of all kinds of things by you, simply because you refuse to see that they come from a totally different place and are not the boogeyman you need them to be in order to give you a stronger sense of meaningfulness for your struggles.

I hope that doesn't sound too harsh, but it's not the first time I get to hear from other people what I *really* mean when I say what I say, and what I *really* do when I do what I do, and it does get old after a while. And I hope you can appreciate the irony if it feels to me like someone is trying to trivialize my own feelings and thoughts about myself and the world I live in, oppress my freedom of determining myself what I believe in and stand for, and narrating me as the bad guy based on nothing but my ""wrong"" gender (you know, the one that does nothing but rapes and approves of all kinds raping, because male chauvinist pig).",0,1329941289,,0,c3twh0q,t3_pwtfl,7.0,t1_c3tr6ts,38314,1428401263,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1287854245.0,t2_4gem9,,,0

letsgocrazy,,,"&gt; Personally it is hard for me to understand how some people need such a reminder

It's not that I needed a reminder - like most people I internalise feelings into thoughts without having to emotionally relive them every time I recall the memory.

I am still more than capable of feeling compassionate towards people - however, this way of presenting an idea, I feel, was particularly strong - remember, these ideas have to reach people who have clearly not internalised that kind of feeling.

In particular I was thinking of how uncomfortable I felt recently when I visited a doctor for a urinary blockage - the waiting, the ""I'm going to just have to shove a finger up your arse"" (unexpectedly, but what are you going to do? rebook?), having to talk about personal aspects of my life etc.

Even when you go for your occasional STD screening, you're sitting answering personal questions to a stranger - no matter how nice they are.

Even with the best staff and the nicest environment it's not nice. 

It doesn't even have to be about abuse at all - it's just, like, well, that kind of thing isn't top of everyone's fun-time list.

So coercing people into having worse stuff done at a particularly vulnerable time is shitty.

&gt; When I read another article about this ""debate"" I feel it in my bones, the wrong that the politicians and affiliated organizations are doing to women - my friends and my family. 

I really sympathise. You know, I can't say I've been as close to that kind of suffering - but trust me, even with my limited experience I can tell you that the laws disgust me too, and I can feel their wrongness in my bones as well.

It honestly breaks my heart that in a country that thinks it's number one, it really is stuck in the dark ages and there are so many people that willfully march lock-step with this institutional perversion.

I'm actually a bit amazed that it's even possibly to suggest shit like this.

Anyway, back on topic.

I certainly hope the actions of of the female politicians that came up with this counter proposal hit home with a lot of men who might not have been reached another way.

[deleted],,,"Yeah I completely understand your reaction and I am glad that the bill has gotten at least one person to really *feel* what it is like to have your body scrutinized and told you don't know what's best for yourself.

Personally it is hard for me to understand how some people need such a reminder, but I also have A LOT of personal bias that many don't.  Most of my young friends and older family friends (as well as members of my immediate family) have been raped, assaulted or molested in their lifetime and so I have always had a present reminder of how it feels to have undergone such an assault on the self.  I have also always kept in mind that it would only take one rapist without a condom to leave a friend or family member with something much worse than an emotional scar - a living breathing person brought into the world at the hands of a criminal and a political system that would force a victim to live with a reminder of that horrific event for the rest of her life.  

Now, I know people say there's adoption, or that some people do love their children borne out of such terrible circumstances, but not all people are able to do it.  This argument often doesn't cover women terminating due to birth defects, dangerous pregnancies, results from incest or other youth molestations, or an underage or ill-prepared woman.

This also doesn't even include women that *need* BC in order to curb severe cycles, hormonal imbalances, or other medical problems.  For myself I take it in order to calm my PCOS symptoms and without it I would be having 2 months without a period, then a month-long heavy flow.  Not to mention the cramps so bad that I wanted to die and migraines that would last for days.  My symptoms without BC are so bad that there is no way I would have been able to do half of what I've accomplished today. 

I'm sorry for the rant.  I guess my point is that familiarity with people that could have had their futures ~~jeopardized~~ destroyed because of such laws makes me a lot more angry and upset than someone that maybe hasn't been as close to such a large amount of wronged women (and men as well if we are talking generally about abuse and molestation).  When I read another article about this ""debate"" I feel it in my bones, the wrong that the politicians and affiliated organizations are doing to women - my friends and my family.  

I think it's because I've felt their pain when talking to me about their experiences, I've seen their triggers because of the events, and I've cried with them as they expressed their thankfulness for the people that were able to end the unplanned pregnancies caused by those atrocities.

shallah,,,"quote:

&gt;Conservative U.S. evangelical churches have broadened a long tradition of international missionary work, intended to convert and “save” individuals, to include political work related to a right-wing political agenda. The resulting assault on human rights is alarming

&gt;In thinking and writing about the Christian Right, we are careful not to conflate its work and agenda with that of religious bodies in general. Our brush must not be broad or simplistic. Only if we have accurate information and a thorough understanding of the best means of defending human rights will our liberal, reformist, and progressive work succeed. 

snip

&gt;The U.S. is not the source of all right-wing religious activity in the Global South. Nor is it uninvolved in the rise of a global right-wing religious wave of cultural, economic, and social conservatism. The growing collaboration between the U.S. religious Right and conservative Christians internationally benefits each, and both threaten the pursuit of human rights.

&gt;We urge you to study the presence of anti-human rights forces in your country, so that you and your allies closely monitor and regularly challenge their work.

&gt;During 30 years of studying the U.S. Right, we have developed some rules of the road for activists challenging the Right that can apply as well to the Right internationally:

&gt;&gt;Do not imagine Christianity or any other religion to be monolithic. Try to examine each situation with a researcher’s dispassionate eye.

&gt;&gt;Do not generalize and demonize the followers of right-wing leaders. Their motives are complex and it will do no good to denigrate or insult them.

&gt;&gt;Remember that, while not all money is dirty money, enriching oneself with public funds should be exposed, even when the corrupt individual supports human rights goals.

&gt;&gt;It can be enlightening and educational for people to learn the theological, ideological, financial, and valid critiques of the organizations that have attracted them. That may be new information for them.28

yes, i agree that i've never heard of sagan or NGT saying anything derogatory towards women. i think sagan was even a self-professed feminist. however, hawking is quoted as saying women are a ""complete mystery"" to him, which spawned [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/o47xn/one_of_the_worlds_greatest_thinkers_stephen/) (and one on [/r/mensrights](/r/mensrights), which is a completely separate issue) and related misogynistic comments, like these:

&gt;Because he relies on logic and reason.

&gt;I've always said the most successful route to dealing with women is the most illogical and irrational route you can find.

do i think hawking is a misogynist? no. but people used his statement as a way to legitimize their individual sexism, which is fucking frustrating.

i too am subscribed to just about every math and science subreddit that exists because i'm a mathematician. while i don't see posts that are *that* blatantly and offensively anti-woman very often, i do see sexist comments being upvoted in pretty much all of those subreddits. often the comments are subtly sexist and are just taken as true despite there being **no evidence other than some scientist's observation**. literally exactly what i just did, but for some reason i get called out on needing a citation but they don't... examples below.

[post about women in computer science by a computer scientist.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pfkvb/how_do_i_get_you_women_interested_in_computer/) 

&gt;In my opinion, girls are more able to think holistically, while men are more able in methodical and logistical thinking. These are just my observations.

this guy says men are more logical than women, no one argues. accepted as true.

&gt;Oh my appearance has suffered from late-night programming. That's definitely true, since most girls are very social and would not want to be physically affected (Our school had about half that dropped for that reason). The two directions don't go well together.

he goes on to say women drop out of CS because staying up late programming makes them less attractive, and that's what women prioritize. no one argues.

[this post is about a study that claims math skill differences between men and women are culturally and not biologically determined.](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/nbhnv/ams_study_gender_differences_in_math_are_cultural/)

most of the offensive comments have been subjected to the feminist downvote brigade since it's old, but here's a gem.

&gt;Biggest load of bullshit I've read in a while. This is really bad. Science shouldn't have to try and be politically correct.
FWIW, I'm currently in Korea and the boys perform better in math &amp; science than the girls here as well. It's not necessarily a bad or sexist thing. It's just how it is.

this comment was downvoted but received 30 upvotes. so 30 people thought this was good insight into the issue of women being underrepresented in engineering,

&gt;Men are there to make scientific and engineering progress.
I'm actually serious here, this is not mysoginy talking... are any actual women studying engineering?
We had 12 girls out 300 people in our generation of electrical engineering students. After 2 years... 5 are left. Despite girls getting special attention due to female quota. In university ratings my university always gets its best grades for A HIGH NUMBER OF FEMALE STUDENTS! That means other universities have even less female engineers.

brightifrit,,,"Say someone needed to go read up on their history and current events before making comments about men working harder for their cookies. Women do most of the world's labor and earn the least pay for it. They make up 50% of the wold's population, yet they account for 70% of the world's poor. Women in places like the Congo get raped so frequently that it becomes a fact of life for them, and you're saying that they have to work harder to ""earn the cookie"" of being able to fetch water for their families without worrying about getting assaulted? 

And until you have experienced what it is like, even in our pampered Western world, to stay at home and raise small children--to give up dreams, careers, hobbies, and time to yourself so that you can clean up poop and listen to small people scream at you all day--you are in no place to say that men work harder. I suffered so much sleep deprivation with my first child that I started hallucinating from it, and had postpartum depression on top of that. For nine whole months after I had the kid. With my second, I experienced a rare hormonal disorder where every time I nursed her, I felt depressed enough to kill myself. Yet, since I gave up the job where I actually earn money when three months pregnant with my second, because it was the best thing to do for my family, that somehow means I've earned less cookies? 

Let me tell you how life went for me the other evening: after a day of screaming, tantrums, diaper changes, grocery shopping, errand-running, vacuuming, scrubbing, and mopping, then making dinner while my kids bugged me and cried for attention the whole time, I finally got them fed and into the bath. After taking out my one year old and setting her down for 60 seconds, she pooped all over a chair, the kitchen floor, and my shoe. After I put her back in the bath to wash her off, she started drinking the poopy water. And after taking her out again, I got distracted and didn't remember the mess in the kitchen until I was in a different part of the house and started wondering why it smelled like poop. So I cleaned it all up and got some spices simmering on the stove so my husband wouldn't have to smell poop when he got home, before putting the baby to bed and cleaning up after dinner. May I ask what *you* do for a living, that is so much more difficult and makes you so much more deserving than I?

I get up an hour before everyone else, put my own needs last for most of the day, and work weekends when everyone else is taking a break. And yet when I want something simple, like the ability to go to a party or walk home at night without being told that I should expect to be raped and it's my fault if it happens, or to chose my own method of birth control, or to have people see me as something other than a uterus and some boobs--woah there! You haven't worked hard enough to earn those cookies. Those men over there, they've *earned* the right to control their own reproductive system and get drunk at a party without expecting people to blame it on them if they get raped. What, because they can lift more than me? Because having a child doesn't absorb their health and their time the way it does with me?

I don't know what the dynamics of your family are, but I'm assuming your mother led, or leads, a life similar to mine. Possibly harder, depending on your age and income bracket. After all, most US mothers who spend just as much time working for pay as their husbands still do the majority of the childcare and housework. You are telling me that your mother hasn't worked hard enough to earn as many ""cookies"" as you? As much dignity, safety, and say over her body and her future as you?  For shame.

brightifrit,,,"No, because my husband actually gave me that one. That's the sort of attitude he's run into when frequenting r/mensrights, which I subscribed to eagerly when I first came to Reddit, thinking it was going to be something awesome. Turns out it's more of a hate-fest than anything else. I am very interested in the advancement of men's rights. One of my guy friends, who I met in a Philosophy of Feminism class, has dedicated his life to the subject. He's explained a lot to me, and I agreed with all of it. Problem is, I don't see the sorts of things he talked about on r/mensrights. I see rants about female privilege. What about the fact that men are raised believing they can't show any emotion but anger? Now there's a place where you have solid ground to get some real work done. We're surprised when men end up in jail for hitting their wives, but we continue to teach our sons to bottle their emotions instead of expressing them in a healthy way. Instead of complaining about greedy entitled women who expect to have dinners bought and doors opened, why not approach the issue by calmly explaining how such practices are detrimental to both sexes? The idea of a men's rights movement is a good one. Right now, the movement is being defined by anger and misogyny.

dada_,,,"&gt; EDIT: You don't have to be a man to be an MRA.

No, you just have to be pretty morally defunct to think that you should focus on the minor problems of the privileged while ignoring the *massive* discrimination that women have to face.

If you really wanted equality of the genders, you'd be a feminist. That's what feminism is about. And more male feminists means more focus on what few male gender equality issues exist—and there aren't very many.

You may personally have the best intentions, I don't know, but /r/mensrights exists to revile women. I've seen what gets posted there and it has very little to do with equality. I'm about as contemptuous of it as I am of /r/beatingwomen.

HertzaHaeon,,,"/r/athiesm isn't that bad. I've seen several posts where a christian comes in and denounces some negative part of the church, shows appreciation for secularism, or some such. They're usually treated respectfully and fairly.

I have three rules for tolerating religion — don't use religion as an excuse for hate and bigotry, don't use it against science, and don't push it on non-believers through politics. These rules are also generally agreed on in /r/atheism.

If your family doesn't hate homosexuals or think atheists will burn in hell, then I don't think a majority of atheists would have any problem with them.

In my experience there are several parallells between atheism and feminism. Sexism also makes people angry. Feminism also lashes out at the people, structures and organizations that perpetuate the bigotry and myths that they oppose.

EricTheHalibut,,,"The comments about fathers no longer loving their wives were probably looking at it backwards even then, and almost certainly where I am nowadays. 

Without children, both partners are likely to be working: that should mean that there won't be any alimony or similar payments. The main costs of divorce would be the loss of economies of scale and possibly some of his share of the investment  in the household assets. This means that if he no longer loves his wife, a divorce is entirely sensible.

Conversely, with children there is more pressure to remain married. Apart from concern for the emotional well-being of the children, he would expect to lose much more money. It is much more likely that the mother will have taken off at least a few years (especially back then) so there will be at least temporary spousal support, and the risk (whether perceived or actual) of getting screwed with respect to custody, visitation, and child support. This means that even from a purely selfish point of view, divorce is unlikely to be a good idea.

Since someone who is cheating is going to need to need to meet his (or her) lover(s) away from the places frequented by his own set, whereas someone who  is divorced or unmarried can date in his usual haunts, it seem likely that the older men the source was attracted to were those filtered from their peers by the fact that they were cheating. Combine that with children discouraging divorce and you get the effect that source saw.

EricTheHalibut,,,"&gt;It's considered rude form in many ethics systems to discriminate as a result of intrinsic qualities such as this.

Part of the problem is that, even with the ACA, the US health funding system doesn't work as either a social benefit (priced on the basis of income) nor as an open capitalist system (priced on the combination of market forces and expected payout), because the actual policyholder can't usually shop around. 

If there were an open, competitive market for insurance without anti-discrimination provisions, one would expect to see that, once prices settle, the prices would be based on the specific risks as near as can be estimated for that person: someone who is predisposed to have diabetes will be charged more, a woman will be charged more, a person with vision problems, and so on. If men start going to see doctors more and earlier, their premiums will rise accordingly. That is fair, in an utterly amoral way. 

If all discrimination on the basis of intrinsic differences were banned, insurance pricing would have to ignore most of the key risk factors except diet/exercise, smoking, drinking, and sexual activity (and that would be an absolute minefield). Age could reasonably be permitted too, since once such a system were in place everyone would be both young and old.

phapha,,,"Every post (or 'tweet') has to be 140 characters or less - that's why they're so short and use instant message contractions (""r"" for ""are"", ""lol"" for ""laughing out loud"", etc.).

You can tweet/post something to your own page (""Hi, I'm tweeting!""), or direct your post *at* someone, especially as a reply (@Mary, @Bob, @SpamBot66).

People use 'hashtags' - topic names with a pound sign in front - to mark a post as belonging to one or more topics (#Feminism, #GiantsPatsGame, #Obama). The topic is often extra description or just a joke (#IrrelevantThoughts, #YouJustGotTold, #winning). When many people post to the same topic in a short time span that topic joins the ""trending"" list on Twitter. That's how CNN can report ""Rick Santorum was really trending on Twitter last night"".

So a typical tweet can look like: ""@newbride2011 omg can't believe u don't know twitter lol #technology #losing"". The archetypal tweet is something boring and narcissistic like ""cutting my nails"" or ""just tripped over a rock"", and doesn't include topic names or hashtags.

gerwalking,,,"They didn't step on her toes in the *conversation* (at first, anyways). They stepped on her toes by being associated with a sexist video. I know it's an extreme example, but imagine a black man coming across a known member of the KKK, and yelling at the member for being a racist piece of shit. If your first reaction is to go ""wow, the member wasn't doing anything and being quite polite. The Black man's point would have been so much better if he treated the KKK member with respect"" you have your priorities messed up. We know the KKK is fucking awful and people have a reason to be passionately offended by them. Likewise to a smaller extent, we know this woman had a concrete reason for being upset with geeklist from the get go. Even if she was rude and made them feel bad, that's a technicality compared to the offense the group she's being mean commits in having a video making the majority of an entire demographic uncomfortable.  

The reason tone argument is important to understand and call out is that it's often used to derail. You can see it clearly in the conversation of the original content for this thread. Rather than actually addressing her concerns, the majority of the conversation was about her seeming aggressive. They didn't want to talk about their sexist video, instead they wanted to paint the person pointing out they had a sexist video as a bad guy. Regardless of your opinion on her tone, the fact that the tone became the topic of conversation rather than the sexist video is really demonstrative of how people try to get minorities to shut up. The next biggest one (and one you could also see in the conversation, meaning it'd probably be their major one if she had been sunshine and sparkles in her approach) is saying that it doesn't bother people they know thus she's imagining any offense or just being oversensitive. 

It's usually a lose-lose situation. If you're aggressive you get told you need to be nice. If you're not aggressive you get ignored or told it's not a big deal.",0,1332471484,,0,c43z50i,t3_r8e6l,6.0,t1_c43xqxg,7423,1428577067,7,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1313799343.0,t2_5p4l8,,,1

mrmomolad,,,":( Wow. The truth. It must hurt.

Male privilege has been with us for how long? a thousand years? ten thousand? So having even a bit of chance to talk frank about our sexcapades is pretty freaking cool, and we're aloud to be emotional about it. Including flippant, sarcastic, angry, rude and even resentful. Even all at the same time! If you're so sensitive to men's fee fees than try browsing the rest of the internet. Or watching tv. Or walking outside. 

The patriarchy is what dictates that men are impervious to having feelings, so if some guy happened to get turned into another forgettable sex toy by a woman, you don't get to blame the lady.
If a woman or some women say “All men are sex-crazed beasts” it does not take away the power that men have. They will not be oppressed or made lesser.

Men experiencing individual instances of prejudice is not on the same level as women systematically being portrayed as lesser to the extent that they are kept in a lower social/economical state than the average man.
When you are privileged, “similar” experiences simply do not happen on an equal footing because they do not otherwise reflect marginalisation.

Also, The article ain't sexist. Sexism = prejudice + power. A woman can’t be sexist towards a man because women don’t have the institutional power to do so due to historical oppression.

Oh and you're condescending too!:
""So, don't worry about pleasing everyone. Instead, try to find someone who appreciates you as an individual.""
aw...how kind of you to share this advice that no lady has ever heard before! You are so right, we really should find someone like that! You know what's funny though? No matter how wonderful a guy is, they've internalized some really poisonous crap. So every once in a while they say or do something that really shakes you because you’re no longer totally certain they see you as a human being, and you feel totally disempowered to explain that to them.

It seems that you've missed the point Emily's making here. So you've used the classic case of  ‘I can’t attack your argument, so I’ll have to attack you’. cool. cool cool cool.

KKV,,,"The Act's reauthorization should be blocked at every turn. The Act contributes directly to the continued bias against men with regards to violence socially, legally, and in terms of resources available. It continues the assumption that male suffering isn't worth addressing. It continues to treat men as naturally abusers and encourages women to feel naturally like victims.

The Act does not subject women who make false claims to perjury, there is no punishment for falsely reporting any sort of abuse, particularly because things like, ""Negative looks"" and ""Name calling"" qualify as abuse, of course, only when men are accused of doing it.

MissCherryPi,,,"I haven't heard that episode, but I have read the transcript on a blog somewhere, can't find the link. 

I'm not denying the influence of hormones on behavior. But I am saying that cultural messages can amplify those effects. 

When a study is done on alcohol or caffeine, in addition to a control group that gets none of the substance and is told they are not ingesting it, there is often a group that gets a plain drink but is told it is caffeinated or alcoholic - because the expectation that a person is drinking alcohol or caffeine will change their behavior. And researchers want to separate out behavior caused by the *idea* that one is getting buzzed and what the actual effects of the substances are. Of course, caffeine and alcohol can and do change your brain and body chemistry. But those effects are amplified by all of our cultural messages and personal ideas about them. 

A person taking hormones will change - that's the point of taking them. But some of those changes are going to be a result of that person's ideas and expectations of the effects that the hormones will have. Or, in response to those changes. Feeling more secure, confident and attractive because of the physical changes brought on by the testosterone could increase libido - in addition to any changes that the testosterone had directly on the person's sex drive.

Willravel,,,"I agree with the central thesis of this article, that men do not seem as interested in the finer details of women's beautification. I find myself wondering why women wear uncomfortable shoes for hours a day that could potentially lead to messed up toes, blisters, and even back problems. I hope they wouldn't go to all that trouble on 'my' account (my meaning me as a typical dude). The thick make-up, the bleached hair, in some cases even the bleached anus... none of that stuff interests me in any way, shape or form. I hope I've never given the indication to any girl or woman (or boy or man) that I expect them to go to extraordinary measures of changing their appearance or being really uncomfortable in order for me to find them attractive. 

The way it's argued, though, is more than a little problematic. I'm not so sure it's true Ms. Emily could go out and find a guy to 'stick it in'. If she did, imagine the man in that situation. He's an experiment, valued really only as data to support an argument. I ask this with a straight face: what kind of man goes to bed with a woman who doesn't value him? Moreover, what kind of person goes to bed with a person that doesn't value that first person? It makes me wonder if it's an issue of low self-esteem, or perhaps they're just much different from me, sexually, and I have no right to judge them. 

I think the point of the article could have been made without that kind of comment. And the last line, ""Real men don't give a shit if you miss a patch."", is a No True Scottsman if I've ever seen one, and it undermines the argument. Initially the argument isn't about 'real' men, but about men in general. I like the argument that men in general don't care all that much about beautification, but this idea that 'real' men don't care about it seems to shift it from a tendency to an ideal or goal.

&gt;People who want to stop abortion can make a difference with education, counseling and genuine efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies and support child-rearing.  They need to work toward safe and affordable day care and health care for children and toward generous workplace policies, including adequate family leave, so that parenthood is not an onerous and difficult prospect in America.   In last year’s report “Failing its Families,” Human Rights Watch wrote that at least 178 countries have national laws guaranteeing paid maternity leave.

majeric,,," I liked a lot of the response up to a point... but then it delves into what I would consider to be commonly accepted but rather heavy handed ideas of misogyny. 

&gt; It's because they feel entitled to have women in a submissive position to them. They want to live in a world where women are considered automatically dumber, where women are expected to clean up after them, wipe their brows, and kiss their asses, all with a smile on our faces and without asking much more in return but an occasional bit of jewelry and a door-opening, which is just as much about the man feeling more powerful as it is about being nice to the woman.

I feel they are heavy handed because I look around at *all* of my straight male friends and I really have a hard time believing that any of them would perpetuate this rather horrific notion. 

So it forces me to ask the question. Is it intentional? Do we do it to ourselves in some rather subtle ways? (It feel like we all probably carry some slightly misogynistic ideas that it's the collective butterflies that creates a tornado.)

And in some sense the cracked article does touch on the hint of an idea (while entirely missing the mark). I have to wonder if Hanlon's razor applies to misogyny. 

&gt; ***Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.***

I was watching some Christopher Hitchens (his comments about the solution to poverty made me think of this subreddit. I will probably post it later) recently and there was a point he made (or quoting another evolutionary biologist perhaps) where he conveyed the idea that we were in essence barely sentient creatures. 

It is the religious among us that would have us believe that we are in full control of our faculties because an over emphasis on freewill. The evolutionary biologist/naturalists among us might recognise that we are more subject to our natures that we give ourselves credit for.

I am not saying that we don't have free will or that our reason doesn't have the ability to override our nature. We are certainly ""civilized"". However, for those who don't spend a great deal of time being self-critical or forced to consider issue that might affect them, the concepts of inequality might never come up. 

So surface ideas that are ultimately wrong may never get challenged. I recently got into a rather lengthy debate with someone who refused to acknowledge trans people because he felt that genetics were always an overriding default to gender regardless of how someone felt. It was a frustrating argument to have but I could see how he came to his incorrect conclusion. It was hard to move him on what he say was overwhelming evidence against gender dysphoria.

I'm not entirely sure what the solution is. Certain the Religious Right seems to play the pathos (emotional) argument over the Logos (rational) argument. I gotta wonder if we shouldn't take different tactics. Australia had a great marriage equality ad because it appealed to emotion. I think it was quite effective. (regardless of the obvious flaws about pretty people only deserving to be happy but I digress).

jdac,,,"&gt; so you dont want a guy to eat you out? 

I'm not into guys, so no. Also, Wong isn't using this as a metaphor for cunnilingus, but for sex in general (well, maybe PiV sex in particular, as per his ""humping"" reference). 

Also, why are you trying to infer my desires from the fact that posing women as consumable makes me uncomfortable?

&gt; umm i think a huge population of women absolutely knows the important relationship between hunger and desire for the other sex as well as romance novelists and the millions who read them. 

You're invoking the bandwagon fallacy here, but in service of what? My objection is to the metaphor of sex with food, particularly of the sexuality of *women* with food, because food is a material product to be consumed and women are not. The number of people who do or don't buy into that construction are immaterial to whether I like it or not.

&gt; hunger, appetite etc are constantly used in relation to sexual desire for a reason. you dont crave that cake or steak from your stomach (unless you are starving). you crave it becuase of how good it will make you feel when it happens and how it will satiate a temporary desire. same with sex.

You have a point. Sex and hunger are very similar drives, as the psychological study of motivation and emotion recognizes. The reward value of sex and the reward value of food in our brains are, if not interchangeable, similar in function. But that's not what I take issue to. What I'm taking issue with is women being metaphorically posed as food.

I don't quite know what you're saying in that second sentence there; we don't crave food from our stomachs any more than we crave sex from our genitalia. Trivially, even when you're starving, you experience that in your brain, and your brain is capable of suppressing hunger pangs. You are also capable of consciously ignoring them. This goes for sex as well.

We acknowledge that hunger influences us (and it had better, lest we starve), but who seriously accuses sandwiches of being out there to tempt them? We may say food near to us is distracting, but we don't argue that the food is self-aware and is willfully using its succulence to distract us from work or conversation. But this is the belief about women that Wong is describing; women know the effect they have on men and they're doing it on purpose, wah. Only a very few people can credibly claim that they are *powerless* over their desire for food. I don't think there's grounds for Wong to claim that men are similarly powerless against their sexual urges.

In any event, Wong stretches the ""cast-away sees fellow cast-away as talking porkchop"" metaphor in service of his contention that attractiveness makes men feel powerless over women (something I don't agree with). Given the cisheterocentrism of the article, a more direct recasting would be ""men so starved for sex they start to see other men as women."" But then, to be played that straight then there would have to be a scarcity of women around.

critropolitan,,,"&gt;seems like the solution to this is to simply not have children. Women have that choice. Being a Parent by its nature involves some level of self sacrifice from both mom AND dad.

Being a parent *in the real world* most of the time means *vastly more sacrifice* if you're a mom then if you're a dad.  Dads are the *best dad ever* if they do a fraction of what their female partners do.  

A man can easily be a parent and still have an independent life of his own, losing little or nothing of his personal identity and outside life.  He is not socially defined by being a dad, its just one of the things he does.  He can go to work and expect his partner to take care of his child, and, as an added bonus, since she's not working or working less, she'll usually be expected to do most of the housework and perhaps cooking too!  This is not the case for every family but it is certainly typical and definitely something a man can get if he wants it.

For a woman however, it would be nearly impossible to get that arrangement.  The best she could hope for is some vague equality - one that will never really be equal because equal child care taking would still amount to greater sacrifice on her part since she bore all the physical sacrifice and her partner had none of it.  So to actually be an equal sacrifice, her male partner would have to do *more* than half the childcare - something extraordinarily unlikely.  Most likely however, a mother's life will be somewhat restricted after having a child - she will do most of the care for it and therefore lose work and productivity at work over it - a mother's ability to maintain an independent social life without the kid or her husband is usually sharply curtailed because responsibility, in our patriarchal society, for figuring out what to do with the kid is hers.  It is actually socially **unseemly** for a new mother to be out socializing late while leaving her child with some professional caretaker - not so at all with fathers. Being a mother almost always constitutes a very central part of one's identity if they are a mother, they are no longer [their first name] but [son/daughter's mom].  

No, the solution is to eliminate the privilege men have in this arena and to create a society where women can, like men, choose to have children without having to lose their independent lives and identities.",0,1334186285,,0,c4b64sr,t3_s3sn8,2.0,t1_c4b0ayf,25341,1428702236,0,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1259365445.0,t2_3qt2h,,,1

AnthonyZarat,,,"The executive branch in Brazil is moving towards interpretable law.  The judicial branch is resisting this.  The court has thrown out a number of convictions based on vague criminal statutes (more on this later).

The key-phrase to identify this constitutional tug-of-war is ""não se admite critérios subjetivos"", which means ""subjective factors are not acceptable.""

In this case, the law established an absolute lower limit of 14 years for consent-competency ... BUT in some situations the limit can be more than 14 years.  The court did not like this.  The judges extended the reasoning, stating ""what matters ... is not what is written on the identification document of the child or adolescent, but how they behave themselves.""

In other words, if subjective factors can result in an increase in the 14 year limit, then the justices ruled that subjective factors must also allow a decrease in the 14 year limit.

This whole thing started with dissatisfaction about fast-tracking of ""environmentally friendly"" infrastructure projects.  Specifically, several Amazon dams were approved under a fast-track law that allows reduced scrutiny for projects with small impoundments and large remediation budgets.

From what I understand, back in the 70's and 80's ""outting"" public figures was a big deal in some circles, on the idea that public figures had sacrificed an expectation of privacy and the public needed to know that people they respected were queer. Given the desperate and fledgling nature of the movement at the time, I can sort of understand (if not entirely condone) the motivation behind this.

Now, I don't think many people still think like that, at least not consciously. ""Outting"" someone against their will only seems to get general approval if that person is an active, hypocritical opponent of the rights of other LGBTQ people - the Ted Haggards and George Rekers of the world.

But yea, there is this disconnect between the gay community's general valuing of being ""out"" as a virtue, and the very different nature of ""outting"" someone as trans.

I'm gay and a trans man. Being socially out as gay, and being publicly known as a trans man, are very different things. Being gay is an aspect of my personality and my visible social relationships. Being a trans man is an aspect of my medical history. 

I am out as gay; it's part of my social life. I am far more private with details of my medical history, including my situation as a trans man. Many people, including friends, have assumed that because I am out as gay this gives them persmission to also treat my status as trans as public information.

I understand their confusion, but it's not the same thing. And I really, really don't want them to talk about my medical history with their other friends, or their families, or anyone else. They want to treat this information as being part of casual conversation, and it isn't.

linuxlass,,,"First, I'd like to say that this is not attachment parenting, as described by William Sears.

Second, this article describes women who wrap their identities around their kids, hardly a healthy, ""natural"" attitude. It's more characteristic of the middle-class ""my kid is special"" mindset. It contributes to the culture wars.

I breastfed on demand and my kids self-weaned, used a baby sling (and later, a backpack), cooked fresh (not organic, because it was too expensive, though I did buy veggies from the farmer's market), slept with my kids, and gave them wood to play with. They also played with rocks, pvc, string, seashells, Duplos, and dominoes.  It made sense, fit my instincts, and was simply *easier*. 

I could go camping, or end up shopping all day and not have to lug a big diaper bag (oh yeah, I used cloth, too - it was significantly cheaper and produced much less trash) full of stuff, I didn't need a huge stroller, I didn't need bottles and all sorts of baby items. I didn't have to worry about my kid running off since he was in the backpack. I didn't feel trapped at home.  It's just *easier* for me to do things the way I did.

My kids were not expensive, inconvenient, particularly clean (I never managed to get their knees, elbows, and necks completely clean of dirt), or absolutely safe.

When my daughter was barely old enough to walk reliably, she wanted to crawl up the end of the slide. I let her, though I kept a sharp eye on her. Both my kids have learned to trust their instincts about what's safe and what's dangerous.

When my son was 2, he wanted to use the screwdriver and saw wood. We gave him a small drywall saw and clamped a 2x4 to the coffee table for him. Safe? Not really. But he never did more than occasionally scratch his knuckles, and he was so proud when he finally managed to cut off a slice of the wood. A few years later, he presented me with a small shelf he'd made, and colored himself with crayons. I still have it somewhere.

I *want* my kids to be independent. I've always let them decide if they wanted to wear a sweater, jacket, gloves, or hat. When they were little, I let them run off at the park and climb trees, as long as they came back when I called. I encouraged them to walk to school by themselves when we moved to a new neighborhood -- my daughter was 6, my son was 8, and I gave them each a Google maps printout showing the route, and walked them a couple of times to point out street signs, and then left them to manage on their own.

Why would anyone *want* to chase their toddler with a cracker?!? The kid knows where his mother is, and that she has food. He'll come back for a snack or a hug at some point. Me? I'd rather sit on the bench and read a book, and just keep an eye on things.

Shortly after my daughter was born, I had to have my wisdom teeth out. I expressed as much milk as I could and put it in the freezer so she could eat while I was on codeine. I found that preparing a bottle was much more trouble than it was worth, that I decided after a day to accept the pain and just go back to nursing her.

People (mothers and fathers) should just do what works for them, and stop worrying about what other people think. And other people should just let parents do what works for them. We all want our kids to be happy and healthy, so as long as things are working well, why judge?

gmath90,,,"I watched a documentary called The Gender Code the other night, it's easily found on sites that stream documentaries. It takes a look at advertisements and images of femininity and masculinity and explores Western (I'm assuming you two are from Canada or the US or Europe?) cultural meanings regarding gender, especially images of gender. It touches on how female attractiveness and sexuality is rooted in passivity, non-agency and subordination, rooted so much that female attractiveness is in fact an expression of those things, while male attractiveness and sexuality is an expression of celebrated ""male"" traits like confidence, power, assertiveness, control over one's environment, etc. It's really accessible, there isn't much in the way of ""jargony"" language even though it is an explicitly sociological work (it's based off of a work by Erving Goffman, a very influential 20th century sociologist). If she doesn't have much of a background there shouldn't be anything over her head in the doc, and it's just really interesting regardless.

I think you could offer some insight or at least some thinking points for discussion while being male. I'm a guy too, a white, heterosexual one at that.

I'm not attracted to hairy legs or armpits. Hairy arms I don't really mind either way. Makeup is fine as long as I don't deem it ""overdone."" I prefer hair color to be natural but I have a preference for brown. I don't like the idea of a woman being stronger than me, so I'm kind of turned off by muscle tone. I can't really help this - I'm conditioned (as you are too as is your friend) to respond to certain presentations of the female gender. Basically, I'm supposed to be attracted to certain ""looks"" of women. ""The media"" practically tell you who to be attracted to; a relatively narrow band of body types. It seems that men are allotted a pretty specific body ideal to be attracted to, otherwise men's attraction to other bodies, say chubby or fat women must be fetishized in some way or another while women SEEM to be ""allowed"" to find a broad range of men attractive. I put ""seem"" in capital letters very deliberately as that's what I've noticed in my experience.

Some feminist women may respond sexually to traditional, dominant men who exude that kind of controlling sexuality that men are known to have. This kind of flies in the face of what you'd expect, but it's not really her fault if she's attracted to such men as that's a product of social conditioning. I'm a feminist identified man, and I'm attracted (at least somewhat) to weak looking women who I could physically overpower very easily. I wouldn't say I have a domineering personality either, but I'm still attracted to what I'm attracted to - I even find the ""dolled up skank"" type attractive from time to time. Undoing that means unlearning what you've been ""taught"" and reprogramming yourself, which is difficult but not impossible. 

I guess her conflict lies in that what is deemed attractive has been determined by mainstream male heterosexual desires which are rooted in patriarchal values like female passivity - an example being that women must look like infants or children (weak, lack of control) to be attractive, or the degradation of women - reducing their entire worth to what they look like. I see it as a huge problem that society will have to tackle collaboratively, meaning we need input from women, men, queer, lesbian, gay, bi, trans, straight, etc. alike. As of now, straight men basically ""own"" mainstream sexuality, they decide what is hot or not, and society is built around their desires.

I don't want to leave her with a platitude like ""oh don't worry, she'll find somebody who loves her no matter if she wears makeup and tight jeans or not,"" she's got a legitimate concern that is complicated as fuck.

Anyway, check out that documentary, I think at the very least it will help solidify what she already may know, or it might be an additional insight for her.",0,1335401187,,0,c4gndri,t3_sq3r2,1.0,t3_sq3r2,118232,1428797245,1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1329531939.0,t2_6yaum,,,1

The guy doesn't want his young child to dress in a provocative way which may encourage people to make sexual advances. The child, being young may not fully comprehend the possible consequences for their actions. Sure, they may understand that sex can lead to children. But as children themselves, they do not nor can they fully comprehend the weight of that responsibility.

With that in mind, the child, being female would be the one to carry the child to term, bringing yet another child into the family whose nest she is still in. The father of the child, on the other hand has no such responsibilities should he decide to take off.

So, by attempting to suppress their child's sexuality until after they 'move out' so to speak, they are attempting to curb the possibility that they may be drug into a situation where they would possibly become parents of children again.

&gt;The marital asymmetry hypothesis and specifically, child rearing, seems to be of huge importance here. And luckily, there is an easy way to test the importance of it; namely compare the wages of never-married women to that of never-married men. In 1982, never-married women earned 91% of what never-married men did. (12) In 1971, never-married-women in their thirties earned slightly more than never-married men (13). Today, among men and women living alone from the age of 21-35, there is no wage gap. (14) Among college-educated men and women between 40 and 64 who have never married, men made an average of $40,000 a year and women made an average of $47,000! (15)

&gt;To support your claim Rook, it's all about marriage and childcare. http://www.swifteconomics.com/2009/09/21/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-the-wage-gap/

You know, I've seen that ""never-married 40-64 year olds, women make $47k and men make $40k"" around a *lot*.  The asshole shouted that at Dr. Maddow too.  I'm trying to track that down right now, because I'm curious.

Seems every single citation comes down to

&gt;Warren Farrell, Why Men Earn More: The Startling Truth behind the Pay Gap and What Women Can Do About It (New York: Amacom, 2005), pp. 16-17

Now, amazingly enough, pages 16-17 of that book have absolutely nothing to do with the statistics being claimed, and yet that citation of that book and that range of pages to support that claim is used *all over the place*, which suggests to me a lot of people are cribbing each other's blogs without ever actually checking the source.

But I did check the source.  This actually comes from Figure 1 on page xxiii.  ""Earnings of Never-Married Men and Women Who Have Never Had Children, are College-Educated, and Work Full-Time (Aged 40-64)""  Listed source is: ""Based on raw data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation, 2001 Panel, Wave 2.  The data is median earnings.  Latest available data as of 2004.""

Oh.  Based on raw data.  I see.  No listing of methodology.  No peer review.  In a book dedicated to the proposition that the wage gap is a myth.  No margin of error, no notion if it's statistically significant.  No explanation for why the restrictions that were chosen, were chosen.  What if you include working women and men of all ages?  What if you include non-college-educated men and women?

Of course, given that all the blogs referring to this book don't accurately represent their source at all, I'm not entirely convinced these numbers would even be borne out by the census data, but I've got no way of doing my own calculation right now.  Guess we'll all just have to trust Dr. Farrell.

**Edit**:  I'm looking at this same data now, and I'll show my work.  I'm using DataFerret to look at census data.  My generated SQL ``where`` clause:

    (EEDUCATE in (41,42,43,44,45,46,47))
     AND ((TBYEAR between 1940 and 1964))
     AND (EMS in (6))
     AND ((RFOWNKID between 0 and 0))
     AND ((EJBHRS1 between 40 and 99))

which corresponds to having attained some degree (associate's or higher), being born between 1940 and 1964 (40-64 years old in 2004), marital status of ""never married,"" 0 of one's own children in the family, and working 40+ hours per week.

The result?

There were 1071 men and 1042 women in the sample matching the criteria.  The men worked an average of 44.6 ± 0.49 hours per week, the women 44.2 ± 0.41.  The men made a monthly income of $4367.10 ± $226.69, the women $4190.00 ± $187.38.  All margins of error are at the 5% confidence range using the standard error given in the census data.  This corresponds to an annual income for men of $52405.20 and for women of $50280.00, and no statistically significant difference (among men and women in their late middle ages who never married, never had children, and are college-educated, narrow set of goalposts).

I attempted to actually replicate the claim that was made here (women make $47k, men make $40k) by fiddling with all the variables I could.  I included people with some college but no degree.  I included people working 35+ hours per week rather than 40+.  I tried a birth year range of 1945-1969, just for the hell of it.  I tried using total household income rather than personal income.  I'm unable to reproduce anything even *remotely* resembling the claim that women in this group make more.  They always make less.  Sometimes the amount less that they make is statistically insignificant, but the mean for men has never been lower than the mean for women.

I decided to go ahead and try this one while I was at it:

&gt;Today, among men and women living alone from the age of 21-35, there is no wage gap.

I went with the 2008 panel, wave 9, the latest data available.  Universe is:

    ((TBYEAR between 1977 and 1991))
     AND ((EHHNUMPP between 1 and 1))

Which means birth year between 1977 and 1991; 1 person in household.

Imagine my surprise!  Of 2,908 men, they made an average of $2,918.90 ± $120.70 per month; of 1,993 women, they made an average of $2,673.40 ± $118.19.

I know someone like that. His conclusion, however, was that he knows what the oppression and marginalization of women is like because he had a rough childhood, and therefore he has a say in it. That's another common problem: people don't realize that every form of oppression is different. Oppression of women is different from racial oppression or homophobia. Certainly it is different from having had a bad childhood.

Worse yet, his advice was that women simply give up on constantly ""getting angry"" about their oppression and ""use it to make themselves stronger"". Of course, that's what he did in his youth, and because a massive, society-wide system of misogyny is exactly the same as having a rough time as a child, he must be correct.

It's very difficult to make privileged white men even acknowledge that there is a problem at all. And because they think highly of themselves, their first reaction is usually ""well, they should just work hard like me, and then they'll be successful too"".

He would get confused with discussions of privilege (not that we talk about it a whole lot) I think because he felt like he hadn't had any, growing up poor, fatherless, and in a strict religion that he rebelled against. When he read this article, though, it got him thinking about the people he works with - a hispanic man, an overweight black woman, a tomboy country girl, etc. - and considering where he has advantages that they don't.

The other thing that helped get these discussions started for us was that episode of 30 Rock where Liz talks about John Hamm being in ""the bubble"". My husband also happens to be a cartoonishly handsome, tall &amp; fit white guy, and I started joking with him every time he benefited from his bubble status. Eventually he started to really see how well he's treated, and I think reading this helped the idea of privilege as a male fall in along privilege as a ridiculously attractive person. 

Anyways, what I'm trying to say is - not everyone who can't acknowledge privilege is that way because they think so highly of themselves. For some, it's just that they can't think outside themselves. It's a paradigm shift, and one that's worth having patience with a person. Of course, some people really are just jackasses and will refuse to change.

impotent_rage,,,"Well, let me clarify once again, I never defended his use of the c-word.  In fact when I first saw him using this language on reddit, I went to him and talked to him about it and asked him to please stop, if not because it's inappropriate and sexist, then at least because he represents our space as a mod.  I'm not going to defend him on that point.

The rest of his comments - are you trying to say that if a person has ever expressed an opinion that you feel is wrong, then they are unfit as moderators?  Because I assure you, that if you were to subject my own comment history to that kind of scrutiny, I wouldn't pass either.  In fact I doubt anybody here would pass.  We have a diversity of views and beliefs.

What I am, in fact, saying here, is that wabi does a good job of being impartial, fair, and keeping his personal beliefs separate from his duties as a mod.

""competently and genuinely present that viewpoint to others"" - I didn't mod him in order for him to speak for feminism.  I modded him to clean the spam filter and handle abusive trolls, as well as help weigh in when the conflict between MRAs and feminists gets a little too heated.  He's quite good at diplomacy and conflict resolution, and his perspective as an MRA helps with that.  

&gt;Instead, it’s a forum for people who dislike feminism to tell feminists and people interested in feminism why they dislike it. Someone asks a question, then the “anti-feminist” (for lack of a better term) gives response that’s sarcastic, antagonistic, and, importantly, disingenuous. It’s one thing to disagree with someone; it’s another to claim, “she takes this stance because she don’t care about logic or reason”. Respectful disagreement entails recognizing that the other person has genuine beliefs, even if they are not your beliefs.

Oh I definitely agree - both with your views about how a good discussion should go, and also with your analysis that this is what's wrong with r/AskFeminists.  Part of the issue here, quite honestly, is the limited time in a day.  With my limited time, I've prioritized r/feminism.  I view /r/feminism as my most important responsibility, because so many people looking for feminist discussion on reddit are going to come there first, if for no reason other than the intuitive name.  So when there's issues to solve in both /r/feminism and also r/askfeminists, I've spent my time working on what's going on in r/feminism.  What that's meant is that a lot of problems with /r/askfeminists have not been addressed lately.  The past few months, I've just kind of let that subreddit go, I haven't been paying much attention to it.

A few things have changed lately.  For one, we've gotten rid of a few of our worst and most headache-inducing MRA antagonists in r/feminism, and we've spent the time needed to clarify, announce, and enforce policy at r/feminism.  And even moreso, we've added new mods who are helping take care of things to give me more time to focus elsewhere.  So with new mod help, and with a little more time to spend, we're now finally tackling the issues over at r/askfeminists, so that it can actually serve its intended purpose of providing a feminist perspective to outside inquirers.  demmian is my newest mod and he's volunteered to do most the work in making this happen - he's the one handling our new flair system.  And I think that should address your final concern, which is the willful misrepresentation of feminism.  With the flair in place, readers should be able to see at a glance which comments are the ""official"" answers of the forum, and which members are actual feminists whose answers can be taken credibly as speaking for feminism.

me_jayne,,,"Thanks for your comprehensive response.  This answers all my questions. 
I don't have an opinion (or interest, really) on this person's character.  What I find disgusting is that someone with sexist views would moderate a forum that represents feminist viewpoints.  Some examples: 

-	Calling someone a cunt.  Your response is, “well, the person did something horrible”.  The problem with calling people “cunt”, “nigger”, “faggot”, etc goes beyond the person being addressed; it’s the usage of the term itself that reflects a sexist/racist/homophobic/etc viewpoint.   It doesn’t matter whether the woman’s behavior was reprehensible or not, it’s the assumption that there’s something gendered about reprehensible.  Similarly, if a black person does something awful, calling him a “nigger” is insulting to all black people (and human decency in general) because you’re taking the stance that race and undesirable behavior are related.  
-	The white knight nonsense.  When you use this argument this, you (a) presume the votes and comments are coming exclusively from men (ignoring the presence of women, a sexist fallacy), (b) presume the motivations of the voter/commenters (a logical leap and demeaning to men by accusing them of insincerity), and (c) buy into the gendered stereotypes of men as sex-crazed (demeaning them again) and women as objects to be won.  It’s also just a lazy way to dismiss idea you don’t agree with.  More relevant for our discussion, it’s sexist towards men and women.
-	This comment is just black-and-white sexism: “Translation: my partner needs to have this (x) social status and have things in his life going well or I'm gone.  These type [sic] of posts are only made by women. Guys tend to be more understanding if their girlfriend is having a hard time, as long as she is good to them. I'm generalizing, and I'm sure there are exceptions... but I think my generalization holds with everyone I know and what I've seen on reddit”.  Aside from the logical fallacies here, the conclusion is that, gosh darn it, women are just more superficial than men!  Are you really going to defend this one?
-	Briefly looking at this person’s comments, I see that he is coincidentally the author of a comment I found very annoying just the other day, before I saw this post.  A woman complains that men she’s buying weed from texts her to show her breasts first.  Your co-mod thinks that it’s totally fine that men do this to her, because, after all, he does the same thing to women all the time.  Awesome, so she shouldn’t dislike it because from his perspective (as someone who asks for boob pics) it’s all cool.  I don’t care about what texts he shares with his friends, my only gripe is with how *dismissive* of her discomfort he is.  His women friends are fine with it, so why shouldn’t she be cool with harassment from men she doesn’t know well?  To put it mildly, this show a complete lack of sensitivity to women’s issues.  


So, OK, I think these comments are all sexist.  You say that you don’t agree with all his comments, but that it doesn’t affect his ability to mod.  I don’t understand how someone who clearly doesn’t endorse even a version of a viewpoint – and, indeed, is antithetical to it-- could act as a moderator for a forum that *represents* that viewpoint.  It would be one thing is the sub was advertised as a forum on gender issues in general; but to supposedly be able to *competently and genuinely* present the viewpoint to others?
And this, for me, begs the question: what is the point of your sub?  Thanks for providing an explanation.  I assumed (and got the impression from the sidebar) it was so that people could ask feminists questions about feminism.  This sounded really interesting.  Instead, it’s a forum for people who dislike feminism to tell feminists and people interested in feminism why they dislike it.  Someone asks a question, then the “anti-feminist” (for lack of a better term) gives response that’s sarcastic, antagonistic, and, importantly, *disingenuous*.   It’s one thing to disagree with someone; it’s another to claim, “she takes this stance because she don’t care about logic or reason”.  Respectful disagreement entails recognizing that the other person has *genuine beliefs*, even if they are not your beliefs.  I am pro-choice, for example, but I understand – cognitively-- why some people are not, and I could explain the pro-lifers’ reasoning.  So, next, someone points out that this person doesn’t represent a feminist viewpoint and a spat follows.  For what it’s worth, as an outsider, it seems like a better name might be r/FeministDebate or something, because the content isn’t really reflected in the current name.  It made more sense once you explained that it was intended as a space to funnel feminist:MRA debates.  Of course I don’t presume that your subreddit should cater to me.  I am disappointed, though, that people could get an inaccurate description of feminism… willful misrepresentation is a dirty trick in any debate.

[deleted],,,"In the UK there is no shame in having an abortion. It's not nice, but it's not a deplorable action and most women take measures to avoid being in such a position. My best friend used birth control (the pill) meticulously and it failed. She needed an abortion and she says it was the most traumatic experience of her life, but if her birth control failed her what choice did she have? She had no money to raise a child and she was too young for such a responsibility. Abortion was the best option for her, and she made the best choice.

Even without the stigma and shame of an abortion, women don't do it for fun. They do it because it's  necessary. Those against it are ultimately for a horde of unwanted children with no future, doomed to a life in care. Adoptive parents are not high in population as it is. Why add to the problem?

It's a woman's decision despite the circumstances and I'd rather keep it as such.

She was the only woman in the family that could have children, everyone else either had a c-section for their one and only child, not wanting to go through that again.  We were basically a bloodline that wasn't meant to bear children, and had c-sections not been available, we would have died out.

And a lot of the attitude about it was due to the lack of the religious institution forcing guilt on the people for the whole ""every life is sacred"" train of thought.  The human body spontaneously aborts fetuses all of the time, and we aren't made to wear shame for that.

impotent_rage,,,"&gt;This is disgusting. Do you know what the other mods think? 

What would you like to know?

Look, just because you can post a wall of links, that's hardly damning evidence against his character.  Wabi-sabi is an MRA and a feminist.  I've read through the list of quotes you've listed, and none of them are ""disgusting"".  Certainly I may have a different opinion than him in many of these examples, but nothing linked here disqualifies him from modship.  The closest thing you've provided is his use of the c-word, which I thoroughly disapprove of, however you will notice in context he is condemning thoroughly reprehensible behavior.  I do agree that this doesn't justify use of the word.

I've modded him because the userbase of r/AskFeminists is a mix of feminists and MRAs, as it is designed to be a meeting place between the two movements.  I felt it was appropriate for this to be reflected in the moderating team, and with wabi's inclusion, the mods are now also a mix of feminists and MRAs.  

Wabi has been an excellent mod.  His presence as a mod has nothing to do with who we've banned and who we haven't.

I think it might help if I explain the reason for r/AskFeminists.  We created the subreddit because we had a problem in r/feminism with too many MRAs coming to r/feminism to demand explanations from feminists.  MRAs who view feminism as illegitimate would post lots of content trying to disprove or argue against feminism or feminist principles, and wanted to use r/feminism as a space to debate against us.

Obviously this was a problem, it was derailing our ability to maintain a feminist focused discussion.  But I also wanted to maintain our focus as an open discussion, I didn't want to go a heavy handed direction.

So I felt that the best approach was to create a space where this kind of content is allowed.  That way, those who want to debate with feminists can do so legally, without having to come into our space and break our rules.

And it's actually worked very well.  Most of that content has been diverted off r/feminism, so that r/feminism remains on topic and focused.  And when we find people coming to r/feminism to debate with us, we can remove their posts and request that they take it to r/AskFeminists instead.  That way we aren't silencing anybody, we are simply asking everyone to keep it to the correct forums where it is on topic.  

It is true that r/AF has had a big problem with imbalance.  There are far more MRAs than feminists, and the tone of the discussion certainly reflects that.  We have just rolled out a new idea to try to help with that though - we have just started tagging feminists with flair, so that feminist answers will be given more weight and credibility and will be easily identified as the ""official"" answers of the forum.  I'm optimistic that this will restore some balance and sanity to the discussion.",0,1337191218,,0,c4osn1v,t3_tp0ui,2.0,t1_c4okajm,53773,1428938040,-1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1258896529.0,t2_3qhhr,,,1

It ought to be obvious by now that MRAs exist to defame and destroy feminism. They're no allies in the global fight for civil liberties.

And I haven't even touched on the abject misogyny they're constantly espousing and upvoting.

I consider MRAs to not be very different from racists or homophobes.

It's so hard to see what's really free choice when our free choices just so happen to align with cultural norms of power and dominance.

TheRealmsOfGold,,,"[Warning: this is a kind of ramble from a learning feminist. It's long and probably not too insightful, but if you're interested, I'd love to hear your comments.]

I stopped for a minute while reading this article to reflect on my growth as a feminist. Some time ago I would have responded negatively to the claim that on Disney packaging, none of the princesses look at each other. "" 'Who is the fairest of them all, bitches?' Yeah right, they're trying to force meaning where there is none.""

Now I give time to fairly consider this sort of claim. There are people, even feminists, who will force meaning where there is none, surely. But the real problem was my willingness to look into such a claim seriously. On lots of packaging, the interaction of the pictured characters helps sell the product (on diapers, for example, the parents are usually smiling at each other, or at the baby). And here, it is true, the lack of eye contact among the princesses is kind of scary, when you consider that that lack is consistent.

The final stage in my thought process was this: years ago, I would have thought it was forcing meaning to say the princesses don't know how to interact with other women, because each of those princesses is in a separate story. But now, I think of it in more postmodern terms. If they teach us by their example to not look at other women, then that teaching is part of their experience.

SovTempest,,,"To use an analogy with the agreed upon point of passive females in Fairy Tales: it's sexist because even if you want to expose your child to something different, it's very difficult to do so. Few options are out there, and parents don't have time to police and design all the media a child receives. And even if they do, there's a social aspect to this media that means if your kid isn't watching to the same things as their friends, it affects how they can interact which although managable means more work, effort or stress for both parent and child.

It's racist because it's a key example of a widespread media problem. Racism is widespread, and systemic, sometimes visible and sometimes subtle.

That, in my opinion, is what makes it racist. The fact that it's a big part of a shared US/Canadian culture, but is so white-centred. Is it 'inherently racist'? Well racism as I know it, isn't really about a specific attack or instance of prejudice. It's about a legacy and a culture that combines many things over a hundred years of history. As is mentioned in OP's link, I think it's part of a media culture that just leaves non-white people out of things. 


I consider classic Disney movies kind of fucked up anyways, euro-centric culture and rarely any positive or progressive values, so I wouldn't particularly pick on Snow White.

So do I, but there's an important qualification that we should keep in mind: the constitutionally defined freedom of speech, as outlined in the First Amendment, is a statute meant to prevent the government from censoring specific opinions (among other things) that it does not like. It's the same in every Western society, at least that I've studied. Private institutions do not have to abide by such a statute. Essentially, you have the right to put up a Nazi poster, but you don't have the right to put up a Nazi poster inside my house.

No one's freedom of speech is being violated by disallowing blatant misogyny, or homophobia, and the likes. People who use that argument aren't defending themselves other than by simply stating that opinions exist.

MHiroko,,,"Thanks for the thoughtful answer! You've articulated what I was feeling (isn't it great when that happens!). A part of me was like ""Who does she think she is to cover this song like this?"" I didn't interpret it as an homage, either, partly for the fact that the only thing she kept from the original is the lyrics, and seems to have no tribute to the style of the music. As if she didn't care for any of it except for the lyrics, and why....?? Why do those lyrics speak to her.... when they seem highly unlikely to represent anything in her life? But then, maybe that is just me jumping to conclusions. =/

I almost feel this is similar to people who aren't Chinese or Japanese getting tattoos of Chinese or Japanese symbols on themselves. But somehow that doesn't bother me like this did. 

I guess the privilege of being in the dominant group (in this case, the white race) is having the luxury of picking and choosing which aspects of a minority culture you like and are entertained by, and then being able to walk away from it. NWA rapped from their experiences, like you said, their music was an expression of their reality... and it just seems so privileged to be in a position where this artist can go in and decide to use their music as ... a way to be ""edgy"" (??) and then just go on living her life. The privilege, I guess, is being able to pick the appealing parts and ignore the less appealing parts... because somehow I think if she did see the less appealing parts of NWA's experience of being black males in America, she wouldn't have so easily taken claim to their music. 

EDIT: I just read your other comment and you just firther articulated how I feel (much better than I could lol). Your point about how a the particular cover of ""Bitches Ain't Shit"" is supposed to be comedic rings true with the cover in my post, as well. Except, I don't know if the artists attempt was to be comedic; in this case it seems more like she is trying to be... edgy and cool, like ""hey I'm down with the black folk!"" Which.. is just as bad.

cleos,,,"&gt; ""men can't control themselves

Men can't control themselves is not only a bad reason, it's completely untrue.

Men are perfectly capable of controlling themselves. Even when drunk, they cannot ""accidentally"" rape anybody.

I think your statement ultimately reflects the idea that we should continue to oppress women because women are oppressed.

I know this sounds like a loaded, dramatic, and sort of ridiculous phrase, but broken down:

I say ""Women should continue to be oppressed"" because I see gender segregation in bathrooms as a form of oppression because it perpetuates the idea that men and women are different enough that they can't go to the bathroom in the same place. For some reason. In a world where men are seen as superior to women, perpetuating differences serves to widen the superiority/inferiority gap.

I say ""because women are oppressed"" because it reflects the rape culture in our society, where women are prey, men are predators. Where men sometimes ""can't control themselves"" and where a woman ""shouldn't"" have been drinking too much or walking down the street alone. Where a woman's clothing is considered provocation for assault by a man. We live in a culture that consistently women that promotes the restriction of their freedom (don't drink, walk alone, wear certain types of clothing, etc) and men are left unchecked (nobody says to men 'maybe you shouldn't go to the club. You'll be around drunk women in revealing clothing and you might not be able to control yourself).

Not all, but many.

Weakening patriarchy in any way helps men too.  In the case of anti-homosexuality and anti-woman attitudes one of the major benefits is that the social pressures and tools that are used to force men into patriarchal gender roles are weakened.  If being gay is no big deal, your manhood isn't threatened by people saying you are.  Which gives you more options.

In the end, from my viewpoint, the ultimate goal is the destruction of patriarchy and the extant gender roles.  That's the origin of most of the problems men face.  Patriarchal gender roles say that men are to be cannon fodder, same as they say women are to be baby machines.  Anything that weakens those gender roles, and the underlying thinking that causes them, can't really avoid helping men.

sotonohito,,,"&gt;So does anyone have any ideas?

Yeah, feminists.  We've kind of been fighting against patriarchy since feminism existed.   With a pretty good degree of success too.

One thing that is happening is the stigmatization of same sex relationships and the normalization of same sex marriage.  This, I argue, is actually a very big deal though it may not seem like it at first.

Marriage has traditionally been defined as a relationship between unequals.  We see it explicitly both in the European past and the third world present in the form of dowry, the notion that women are a burden and men must be paid to marry them.  

We still see it today in the West in attitudes towards marriage, the idea that a husband and a wife aren't really equal partners, but rather that ""wife"" is a term implying a subservient position. We don't see that made explicit too often, but it's there.   It becomes explicit in jokes and questions about same sex relationships where lesbians are asked which of them is the man, or gay men are asked which of them is the woman.

Same sex marriage changes that, and it'll have a ripple effect into straight marriage.  The notion that straight  marriage is a partnership of equals will get a real boost from same sex marriage.

Similarly destigmatizing male homosexuality will have the effect of weakening patriarchal male gender roles in general.",0,1339442145,,0,c4z762z,t3_uw23n,2.0,t1_c4z4sfk,9741,1429118917,7,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1217627737.0,t2_37jm9,,,1

feimin,,,"&gt;Since it comes from critical race theory, the euphemism surrounding certain socioethnic groups is ""disadvantaged"". Critical race theory rejects this particular term, and thus would not use the opposite term. The idea of ""advantage"" is also problematic in the sense of one group viewed as ""lesser"" and the other ""normal""; an advantage would denote being viewed as more than ""normal"".

MissCherryPi,,,"&gt;insufficient reason to try to throw up any obstacles to people making informed, free choices for themselves

The petition is actually asking the FTC to require that surgeons give patients more information. 

My personal experience is that there really are women out there who have no clue what is normal about their own bodies. I have a friend, and at the time this incident happened she was 30. She's beautiful, has an MBA and is really into fashion. We were watching television and during the commercial break I showed her [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYhCn0jf46U) on my laptop - just as in ""hey check this out, isn't it neat?"" She got really quiet. And said, while holding back tears, ""I didn't know."" This wonderful adult woman that is one of the coolest most well put together people I know had no freaking clue that the fashion magazines she spends so much time on are Photoshopped. She thought the reason he face and body didn't look that perfect was because of her own failure. 

So yes, I think that there are women, who seeing that their genitals don't look like the ones their husbands and boyfriends masturbate to in pornography will go get this surgery because they think they are deformed. If they knew their bodies were in the normal range and did it anyway - I don't care.

Not really. Adrenaline helps you kill mammoths, not necessarily anger. My point about pop psychology was that you can come up with evolutionary reasons for anything including anxiety but no one really knows where any of this stuff comes from. Likewise, there's a lot of evidence that anxiety has beneficial effects, so it doesn't make sense to write it of as being a purely social construct. 

&gt;they're not repressed in a way that leads to this type of anxiety or ""perversion of anger"" as you put it.

I would argue that there's just as much evidence for the idea that men are socialized to deal with problems through anger as there is that women are socialized to internalize it, and considering the amount of violent crime committed by men I would say we would be better off if everyone were socialized to express themselves in the stereotypically feminine way, even if it did make us all neurotic. 

And I don't think men are any more free than women in how they express themselves, consider being a man who expresses himself in a stereotypically feminine way as opposed to a woman who expresses herself in a typically masculine way.

pass_over,,,"I'm going to be a pedant with this, only because I find the idea of catharsis really fascinating.

First of all, not all ""venting"" is catharsis.  For something to be cathartic, it has to have certain qualities.

It refers specifically to drama, and the idea is that by watching characters undergo fluctuations in emotion, the audience experiences those fluctuations also and it releases pent-up emotional energy.  These characters and experiences teach people how they should feel about something; as Aristotle wrote ""men are sometimes too much addicted to pity or fear, sometimes too little; tragedy brings them back to a virtuous and happy mean.""

Therefore, ""venting"" is not cathartic in the true sense of the word.  With catharsis there is a strong sense of bringing people back to how they SHOULD be feeling.  I've always thought the logic behind venting is letting a person feel however they want about something.

I wish I had more truly cathartic experiences.  Most people think that letting you ramble on and get angry all over again is good for you (that's all that venting is).",0,1328114150,,0,c3mucea,t3_p4km3,6.0,t1_c3ms50m,19214,1428277898,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,,,,0

letsgocrazy,,,"&gt; With the idea of ""catharsis"" there is also the implied closure that comes from letting it out.

Yes, but the implication is wrong. The idea that you can fully 'let out' some kind of feeling is based on nonsense.

Does having sex stop you from wanting to have sex again? Does eating a big meal stop you from wanting to eat a big meal again? 

Even going back to my Buddhist thinking - the only way you can get rid of things is to work let them go, which can be a difficult habit to get into.

Rehearsing ideas and feelings doesn't make something go away - certainly not violent behaviour.
It may give temporary relief, but that's not the same thing.

 KUNDUZ, Afghanistan - An Afghan man killed his wife for giving birth to a third daughter rather than the son he'd hoped for, police said Monday.

 Storai had given birth to the couple's third daughter three months ago in Mohasili village in Afghanistan's northern Kunduz province.

 Nadera Geya, head of the Kunduz women's affairs department, called the killing one of the worst examples of violence against women she had encountered.

 Acid attack Violence against women is common in Afghanistan.

 With foreign combat troops set to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014, and moves ongoing to kickstart a peace process involving the ultra-conservative Taliban, rights watchdogs inside and outside Afghanistan fear women's rights may be sacrificed.

 NBC News reported that President Hamid Karzai announced over the weekend that he will hold a conference in February focused on eliminating violence against women.

If we assume that domestic duties including cooking dinner, doing laundry, gardening, light mantenance, and so on, takes 10 hours a week (and that is very optimistic), it is perfectly reasonable to ask oneself whether, if they worked that extra 10 hours, they could earn more than it would cost to employ someone else to do that work for them: for upper-middle class people, domestic workers are not necessarily irrational, and it might even be sensible for lower-paid workers. Certainly when I can afford it, I shall almost certainly hire some kind of charwoman even if I can't afford a maid or a cook-housekeeper: time spent cleaning would be better used to advance my career.

Thus one must ask if it is moral: for gardeners, maids, cooks, and so on, I don't think it is in and of itself wrong: on the one hand, you are having more money or more free time (or both), on the other, you are employing someone who would otherwise be unemployed. This brings it down to a question of the conditions of employment, but if the conditions of employment are fair and reasonable, employing a domestic would be.

The struggle against ritual genital mutilation is one best fought together and on all fronts.

This is a thread about female genital mutilation, but advocates against FGM should be careful not to disenfranchise potential allies by reacting too harshly to introducing a similar issue, and by the same token of this being a thread about FGM anti-circumcision advocates should broach the subject with the humility and respect which are expected of guests.

I'm sure that I've managed to irritate people on both sides of this with this post, and I'm sorry for that.  I'm not trying to upset anyone, I'm just trying to encourage some cooperation by reminding people of one anothers' perspectives.  The anti-circumcision folk would do well to remember that female genital mutilation *is* a more serious issue, and the anti-FGM folk would do well not to dismiss anti-circumcision folk simply because their issue *isn't* as serious.  There's room for all of us to get justice in this world, and we've got a much better chance of doing so if we all work together.",0,1325980141,,0,c3exvk5,t3_o6hw0,1.0,t3_o6hw0,62453,1428141062,4,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,,,1.0,0

adlittle,,,"To an extent this is a known phenomenon.  Professionals including social workers and violence prevention advocates and counsellors have long identified that abusive relationships go in cycles.  A build up phase where things go badly and start falling apart, the explosion which is characterized by physical and/or emotional violence, then a honeymoon phase that is concurrent with or leads back to the build up.  I've worked with many people over the years (mostly women though with men as well) who have been the victims of such violence.  It is remarkable and often painful to see just how people return to violent relationships.  There are as many reasons as stars in the sky and I have come to see that a support person can only give the right tools for protection and direction to a safe place.  The individual must decide her-or himself when to quit the relationship.  Obviously abusers know their partner well and no doubt there's love to some extent in all of them.  When in prison they use the tools readily available, namely cajoling and reminding them of the good times and frightening the victim about what will happen if the charges go through.

&gt; They're finally getting around to changing it, now.

Maybe now stories like mine will start showing up on those big, national studies about rape and assault. Maybe police and people on the street will start taking victims of rape more seriously, regardless of their gender. Maybe what happened to me will stop being ""funny"" to society at large.

letsgocrazy,,,"&gt; If the immediate reaction to seeing a female is ""flirt at her"", then that's a sign that the community has a problem

I think it's a sign that the individual has a problem. It's frowned upon in real life, it's frowned upon in the community, it's frowned upon anywhere - and realistically, who think they are likely to pull after making some comment about a woman in a Reddit?

No one except an utterly immature person.

But immaturity is the problem - and I bet their immaturity manifests in many other ways as well. 

Think of all the other non gender politics based issues that Reddit has with members of it's own community - for example:

A while ago someone posted a page of reddit from xa mount of years ago - remarking how clean it was, no puns, rage comics etc.

So halfway through some comments someone said something that sounded like a quote from a  film, then someone quoted the film, then someone else did - and they were all upvoted.

As serious discussion about conduct within the community gradually being eroded by pointless junk idiotic behaviour.

I pointed out that it was *this* kind of thing that was ruining Reddit - making the signal to noise ratio too low.

Of course, I was told I didn;t know how to have fun, what else was the internet for etc.?

So my point is this - the immature idiots who have no sense of community or respect for others are like that in all aspects of life.

Think of the kind of idiots you might have gone to college with: Play loud music, keep the place a mess, not really interested in studying, quick to anger, friendly, stupid, casually racist, casually sexist, late on rent blah blah blah.

These are the people who can sit there and ignorantly make comments to women in forums... and you know what - they probably don't ""hate"" women for being women, the are just immature.

Rudolph and Donner want to get home because there's a giant blizzard coming. 

I am a huge fan of feminist media critique - especially of children's television.

That leaves quite a few factors to explain the lack of child abuse.

1. Tiny sample size. In an identically sampled survey, the pure mathematical uncertainty is just over 10%. It's closer to 6 or 7% with some starting assumptions, but the fact is that if these people had hired a competent statistician or had one review their research plan, the sample size would have had to be tripled.

2. Self-selection. Are lesbian couples who elected to be enrolled in the longest-running study on the effects of their parenting likely to be better parents?

3. Nonresponse. 7% of the families dropped out of the survey for undisclosed reasons. These could be as innocuous as moving away or as serious as having the child run away from home at 15. We don't know.

egypturnash,,,"&gt; People are able to insert themselves into the stories as Bella because she isn't a character so much as a template.

Have you ever read McCloud's ""Understanding Comics""? There's a whole chapter on the power of this same technique in a visual form - having simply drawn main characters to enable reader identification is one of the major things McCloud cited as a hallmark of Japanese comics compared to American ones. (This was back before the generation of kids raised on Pokemon were old enough to be pro creators.) And this is in one of *the* books on comics-as-an-art-form. There is *definitely* some worth in being aware of the power of having your lead character be a shallow template for readers to project themselves into - ie, a ""Mary Sue"" or a ""Gary Stu"".

I am not saying it's necessarily a *good* thing that Twilight (or Harry Potter, which I found to be nigh-unreadable) is so damn popular. But what's there to learn? What *is* going right in these books? What are they doing that transcends crude prose and plotting so handily, and how can I as a creator bring some of that to my theoretically-better-crafted work?

(We will ignore the fact that one of the things these works have going for them is a GARGANTUAN MARKETING CAMPAIGN. What do they have that made them into something someone was WILLING to put one of those together for?)

Crap, I think I just talked myself into reading Twilight. TO THE TORRENTS.

And honestly the more I think about it the more I am coming to think that the two main things that make a Mary Sue are (1) being badly-written and (2) being a female self-insert character. Thus, about half of the list of ""crimes"" committed by a Mary Sue are mostly ""the things a young woman would be interested in writing about"" without the all-important caveat that these are also the things a COMPETENT female writer might be interested in, except a good writer would be able to write them better, and remember to give her character some flaws that come back to bite her on the ass. And the other half of a Sue's ""crimes"" are to be *super-awesome* and to have various signifiers of her *super-awesomeness* - again, all executed poorly and without any restraint. Which is a crime that TONS of beginning authors perpetrate - but when boys do this, we just tell them that their writing sucks and maybe offer suggestions on how to suck less, we don't tell them that their writing sucks in part because *they're writing about what they're programmed to be interested in by some combination of nature and/or nurture*, and suggest that part of how they can suck less is to *not write about that*. Which is kinda what the whole concept of ""Mary Sue"" has ended up saying.

And let's be honest, if you write a story about characters who have NONE of the ""traits"" of being a Mary/Gary Sue/Stu in any amount... you've written one of those short stories that shows up in the *New Yorker*. And given that the context of the original post is talking about COMICS and using BATMAN as an example, well, fuck a whole bunch of that tedium, bring on the superpowers/dramatic pasts/angsty presents/dark destinies/world-saving/etc, let me briefly fantasize about *having enough power to actually change the world* before I get back to worrying about my job/divorce/kids/mortgage/etc.

Also why the fuck am I up at 3AM thinking about this instead of getting to sleep what the hell is wrong with my sleep schedule lately sheesh.

&gt;You don't care to live out the same fantasies Meyer has. But either the orbital mind control satellites are working overtime, or a lot of people are interested in living out Meyer's fantasies.

People are able to insert themselves into the stories as Bella because she isn't a character so much as a template.

&gt;I think that this is a pretty good argument for Bella having a lot of value outside of the author's head, and being pretty damn compelling.

egypturnash,,,"This is a really, really interesting piece. I need to think about ""Mary Sue"" for a while.

(Though as a tool for making Interesting Stories, Mary/Gary is still worth using - if everything is going too easy for your character, it's time to throw in some conflict, whether it be due to the consequences of their own actions, or external events. And let them fail now and then. It's worth running down things like [the Mary Sue test](http://www.ponylandpress.com/ms-test.html) as well, to see how many clichés you're using, and think about which ones you might want to turn inside-out... but on the other hand, the minute you begin saying ""this character is more awesome than a normal person and it would be totally awesome to meet/be them"" you start getting major ""sueness""; I for one LIKE reading and writing about larger-than-life characters who I would like to either hang out with or be if they were real - I don't want to spend time in my imagination with a mundane person I don't like!)

Honestly I feel like the main thing that distinguishes a Mary Sue from a ""good character"", besides the ""it's a female lead"" that the article is about, is that a Sue is poorly written and doesn't have any flaws. That's it. Write her well, give her a few flaws that actually have consequences, and she's not a ""Sue"" any more. Bad writing is bad writing; people love to mock Rob Liefield's nineties comics creations and man those guys would score high on the Sue test - but some of them have been picked up by people who can actually WRITE, and have found personality beyond ""roid rage with a big gun and/or katanas"". And guess what? Teen boys ate up the original super-Sueworthy stuff when Liefield was doing it.

Which I guess is a roundabout way of saying, yeah, why the fuck DO we need a special term for ""badly written female self-insertion characters"" when (a) a badly written self-insertion character can RAKE IN THE BUCKAROOS sometimes (Liefield, Twilight, Harry Potter, James Bond...) and (b) people who have developed some skill in critiquing narrative can recognize a badly written self-insertion character regardless of gender?

But then again I'm currently in the middle of doing a comic about four parallel versions of a woman whose name ended up being an alternate shortening of mine (""Margaret"" inexplicably shortens to ""Peggy"", which I use, and also more sensibly to ""Rita"", which is the name that the Muses served up for this character), three of whom are TOTALLY FRICKIN' AWESOME SUPERBEINGS in realities tuned for AWESOMENESS.

BowlingisnotNam,,,"I don't get this one.  She is reduced, because in this little tidbit of her life, she supposedly thinks that looking healthy (good in lycra) is a positive point in being healthy (which is what the commercial is about.  Not necessarily true, but thats a different matter).

Why would you disrespect her by calling this focused point in her life (her diet) as her defining characteristic?  I assume thats what whoever wrote the review was meaning, that this dumb little commercial somehow disregards anything and everything she has ever accomplished because it focuses on what she eats and why.  

She wants to be healthy and look good.  Are we supposed to punish her, or even the ad, because it makes a simplified point about a simplified aspect of her life?  Its not a biography, it isn't trying to be exhaustive of every aspect/characteristic of her life. 

Why would this be reductionary?  The problem isn't that things don't always (read: almost never) make a full and honest depiction of someone as a person, its that you've decided that unless it does, it somehow is disrespectful to someone as a person.  I just don't see anyone at fault here except the kind of person who disregards a person's life because one simple little (possibly arbitrary) piece of someone's life is portrayed and you decide that ""reduction"" is happening, because nobody cares about her other characteristics, else they would portray those too.

If I did a commercial this exact same way, in these exact same circumstances, with the exact same background, and you came up and told me that my life was being reduced to a ""woman-on-a-diet,"" I'd tell you to go fuck yourself.  You don't get to decide what defines me and what doesn't, and you certainly don't get to decide for me whether or not to have disdain for a simple fact that sometimes people like to be healthy and look good too. 

EDIT:  I don't understand the downvotes.  Do they mean that I was wrong?  Did the commercial somehow forget to mention that she was a gold medalist?  Or did we see different commercials where the one you saw said ""she may be a gold medal winning athlete, but that doesn't matter because we are going to ignore everything about her because she is what we are going to refer to as ""woman-on-a-diet, because this commercial defines her.""?

geminimindtricks,,,"the thing is, in almost every society here on earth, our hegemony is patriarchal. Meaning that our rulers, thinkers, movers, and shakers are predominantly male (even god is a he). This probably stems from men actually being inferior sexual beings--females are the true rulers of the human race, multiple orgasms, forever sexually potent whereas men have one job, they come and then they're essentially useless. 

  Well imagine how insecure that would make you as a gender group. 

  So it's no surprise that society is now shaped around men, it's one giant global circle-jerk of men trying to make each other feel better about not truly being the superior sex. So now, thousands of years later, this is that manifestation.  The ""I"" of society is a 21-55 year old middle class white male (unless you live somewhere where being white is the ""other"" but for all intents and purposes the ""I"" is white), everybody else is the ""other"", minority, ""special"" but not in a good way, as the title of this post describes.  
  
  I think ""other"" is more fitting though.  That's why the lead character of every movie is a guy. If the main character is a girl, the movie is a ""chick flick"" (practically a special interest), intended specifically for that minority and not for the mainstream audience. 

  Unfortunately, that's the way life is. If you're a woman, you're fucked. Especially if you realize how fucked up it all is. And if you try and explain these concepts anywhere other than in r/feminism or somewhere else where the ""other"" is the ""I"", you get called a feminist as if it's a bad thing and told how ""wrong"" you are for seeing the truth of the matter.  

  I know I got a slight bit off-topic but the bottom line is that, as John Lennon said so eloquently, ""Woman is the nigger of the world"". We are others, we are different, we are our own demographic, and men and women both keep perpetuating this societal construct because it would be a hell of a difficult thing to change everybody's minds about what they were taught about gender roles growing up.

&gt;From now on, toys will be organized around types like “Soft Toys” and interests like “Outdoor” and “Arts &amp; Crafts” with gender-neutral red and white signage.

Unless said parent is as dumb as a sack of pink or blue rocks, finding toys will not be a problem. Parents will now go to the doll section to look for Barbies and Action Men, and the dress-up section for doctors and firemen costumes. Besides, reintroducing gender divisions wouldn't help parents at all - they'd just have to look across three floors to find something rather than five, and it may confuse stupid parents even more if the toy in question is gender-neutral.

She likes fairies, dinosaurs, pirates, animals, costumes, Legos, princesses, and games of all sorts.

Of course, she has friends, and she has heard their opinions on ""boy toys"" and ""girl toys."" I overheard my daughter suggesting to one of her female friends that they play with dinosaurs. Her friend said, ""No, that's boy stuff."" 

I held my breath. I wasn't surprised, but I was saddened to hear such a statement. I wondered what my daughter would say.

She shrugged and said, ""Oh, well I like boy stuff too."" I'm sorry she accepted the ""boy stuff"" categorization her friend made, but delighted that she didn't give one single fuck that her friend thought it wasn't the ""right"" choice based on their sex.

It's perfectly fine to enjoy Doctor Who as adventure sci-fi, AND recognize that the show might benefit from a slightly more feminist viewpoint.

[deleted],,,"&gt; ""I'm a kissogramme,"" Amy revealed, dramatically, ""I go to parties and I kiss people, it's a laugh."" The Doctor just looked on in horror. 

Of course he did. He still considers her a child, because he just finished getting to know her as a child. He's also got a bit of an asexual streak running through him, so it all makes him uncomfortable (see the conversation about pregnancy in A Good Man Goes to War).

&gt;I had thought she was an inspiring police woman. 

Then you're a laughable idiot, author. Real policewomen don't wear short skirts and fishnets as a part of their uniform. Further, admirable, strong characters aren't built with cookie cutters. Personal strength and virtuousness come from places other than one's face-value societal role.

&gt;From the Doctor's disbelief at Amy's job to the knowing looks of the old lady

It's taboo. Amy's home life just crossed into her work life. Awkward/funny!

&gt;The shot placed her firmly in the category of 'sex object': just a pair of legs and a sexy uniform. [...] On one hand, clearly Amy and her uniform were there to be sexualised. 

Right, because if someone is physically sexy, that whole person is a sex object and nothing more, right? Never mind that Amy's sexuality was *immediately* made only a *section* of her character *by* the addition of the ""kissogram""-job dividing line, as the fact that she gets paid to be treated as a bit of an object means there's more to her; and of course, never mind that she is also a sexual objectifier, shown when the Doctor changes clothes later in the same episode. 

&gt; In Doctor Who there is often a lack of direction in life for the female leads. It's very disappointing to see character after character not have any aspirations. The female characters are portrayed as strong women; they're brave and often save the day, but wouldn't it would be better if they had careers or at least some aspirations in life to accompany this?

It works sometimes (as said, with Martha), but to give all the characters careers and direction would immediately downplay the Doctor's dramatic influence. The lack of direction is so we can watch the Doctor help those who need it *find* direction. The 'companion' role is usually filled by a female to create a gender balance with the Doctor. Companions are *not* directionless because they are female.

&gt;Unfortunately the writers chose to make Martha fall in love with the Doctor. This unrequited love eventually caused Martha to leave the show. Making her ultimately defined by her relationship to a man. 

How the hell does this work? Do you really think it's this simple? The stress of travelling through space and time AS a doctor (someone who chose a career path of *helping people* which means an increased sense of responsibility for others), of having her family *tortured* for a year that no one remembers, on top of just wanting a normal life for herself and happening to be heterosexual, led her to leave the TARDIS. Everyone leaves at some point. That Martha had a crush on the Doctor does not mean she is ""defined by her relationship to a man."" She's defined by her *strength* and *intelligence.* She also fell in love. That's *fine.*

Do you remember when Martha's fish friend died in *The Doctor's Daugher*? She practically had a contained nervous breakdown. *No more TARDIS for Martha. Martha has PTSD now.*

And hey, what about Jack? That man pined obsessively over the Doctor for *hundreds* of years. He joined Torchwood *to find the Doctor,* after having his directionless life as a career criminal upended by the Doctor's influence. Jack's later 'career' was *defined by* his submissive, romantic (at least on his side) relationship with a man. But that doesn't fit this feminist schema.  I'm not really surprised it was completely left out. But my point is this: **The Doctor severely affects every life he touches, male or female, human or alien.** He's the last of the Time Lords. It's his job. Narratively, he's a sort of demi-god. 

I don't know if I have the energy to keep going with this. I'd be capable of refuting every single point in the piece, I can see that now. But I don't really feel like writing a novel, and I don't really feel like experiencing the full fury that comes with watching someone vivisect the best show on TV to use the useful pieces for misguided sociopolitical gain.

EDIT: Nope, can't even stop here --

&gt; The ultimate achievement of Amy, Donna and Rose was getting a man: married to Rory, engaged to Shaun and fobbed off with the alternate version of the tenth Doctor, respectively. 

So many times, **NO.** The denouement (hero/heroine gets the guy/girl) happens *after* the climax, which is what makes the heroes heroes and the heroines heroines. *Saving the world during the climax* is the ultimate achievement, FFS, just like in any other traditional action/drama narrative, and the women of Doctor Who do a fantastic job of it.

I agree the Dr.'s companions have always had their stereotypical pitfalls. But i feel this article is a bit harsh at times, especially on Amy.

Amy was incredibly strong. I always loved the way she handled rory, and i never felt she was defined by her relationship. If anything Rory was defined by their relationship, why else was he there? except for Amy.

As for River:

&gt;But her life and actions were defined by the Doctor. Her education, the fact that she became an archaeologist, her whole career path was driven by him, she wanted to track him through time. Ultimately, when she knew she'd never see him again, she sacrificed herself to save his life.

This is just a result of Dr. Who being INCREDIBLY escapist, which in all honesty is its appeal. Its just fun. Also lets not forget that her life was defined by her birth, she was created by the Silence To Revolve around the Doctor. If anything she overcame her socialization to make her own choice, what is stronger than that?

Also, I've been engaged with critical cultural studies and media theory for the past few years, so while I appreciate your summary of how media works, I'm much more interested in the social influence of the media.

With regards to the bumbling father archetype, yes, I do think it's harmful in that it steers men away from traditionally feminine roles, but I would not make the claim that these depictions have somehow tainted the cultural view of men, making them seem grossly inept. There are enough alternate depictions of empowered men that males everywhere haven't felt any sort of marked drop in competence, and men are still largely employed in traditionally male jobs (that is to say, the high-paying/dangerous/mechanical jobs), and following traditional male roles. In any case, I'd argue the commercial we're discussing has a similar impact to the bumbling father archetype, in that it places the young boy in a position which precludes ""feminine"" traits. When interpellated in the ""manly man"" model, as in truck commercials, again young boys are actively steered away from more passive, traditionally feminine roles. You see, I'm offended by this ad not just as a feminist, but as a man and as an individual in support of gender-equality. These depictions are just as bad, if not *worse* than the bumbling father archetype; since these images aren't portrayed in a comedic light, they appear more edifying, and slip unnoticed into the back of a person's mind. These images actively preclude true human agency in both men and women, so instead of derailing the conversation and bombing the post and comments with downvotes, why don't you try to add a constructive male perspective instead?

And now honestly, I don't even know why an attack was called on this post, since many of my views coincide with yours (or at least, I'd hope they do, since I'm fighting for men too here). Yes, I called out an r/MR user who obviously wasn't critically engaged enough to interpret this video; that doesn't mean I was attacking all of r/mensrights, and in fact, if it wasn't for the rampant and mindless anti-feminist sentiments on the subreddit, I'd have subscribed a long time ago. See, it's not the goal of r/MR that I have a problem with, it's the users' resistance to *all* feminist theory, even those aspects which are relevant to men's rights. If r/MR users would stop commenting on posts like this for the sole purpose of derailing conversations (conversations which would be beneficial for women *and* men), I would not have a problem with them.

*[Also, to avoid any further shitstorm, whenever it seems that I'm speaking in absolutes, I'm only speaking that way for clarity's sake so I don't get bogged down in deconstructive clarification. Yes, I know there are some r/MR users who appreciate feminism, don't bother correcting me. As well, whenever I speak of feminine and masculine traits, I'm speaking from a cultural perspective; I don't actually believe that there are many inherent masculine and feminine traits outside of biology and outside of what we've constructed.]*",0,1324601794,,0,c3afe2v,t3_nhyhg,6.0,t1_c3aap5s,29211,1428062862,1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1269322788.0,t2_3yei7,,1.0,0

Diastema,,,"Sure, I understand, theoretically, how a ""numbers system"" would work, even though I find the idea of treating people like a numbers game sort of off putting. If we're going to look at it from that perspective, if you put in 100 job applications you're likely to get more call backs than if you only put in a job application at places you truly have an interest in, but how well is it going to end up for the applicant? Probably not as well as it would have if he just kept going for the jobs he really wanted. If you talk to tons of girls, sure, you're more likely to get a ""yes"", but the chance of meeting someone you really click with is diminished because of the bigger ""net"" you're putting out. 

Clearly this is not the best analogy ever, and in no way am I trying to suggest that talking to a woman is the same as putting in a job application, but as far as numbers go it about evens out to the same basic principle. 

I genuinely don't believe that every guy that interrupts a woman reading is a total ass/jerk/whatever, but I also think the point has to be raised that sometimes women occupy themselves specifically not be approached. You're more likely to be left alone if you look busy, and a lot of women know this. I used to ride public transport quite frequently, and if I looked busy I wouldn't be stuck with strange small talk and awkward propositions.

It's hard to tell whether the girl is ignoring you because you're you, or because she ignores everyone. 

And I'm being pretty hypothetical, I never ride trains or buses, or even elevators. I'm rarely ever in situations where people are ""stuck"" with me. 

I was just brainstorming a numbers game type thing. Like, I've heard that those guys that have lot's of success with girls, get shot down by 100 for every girl they have success with. That kind of method having great success, means that they are actually rewarded for bothering you, in the long run. That's all I was saying. Mathematically, I lose every time I'm respectful and I let the girl just walk away without noticing me. 

As a single guy, I should hit on every single girl I see in some way. I personally don't have the type of personality for that kind of thing. And that 100 gets you 1 thing isn't a guarantee. 100 could get you nothing. 1,000 can get you nothing too. 

I'm sort of rambling. 

But no, I'm not a jerk and I don't bother people. I just know that it would be better for me if I did. There's no reward for being a ""nice guy"" and leaving people alone. ""Being a jerk"" and saying hi to each and every girl, seems to eventually pay out.

This included dolls, a play cook set, even a weaving loom that were neutral in colour.

That they/we would have anything in common is illogical. It would be like saying that women are a group because they lack penises, which I think we can agree is unacceptable.

Having said that I would reiterate a point that got me kicked out of r/manhoodacademy. Sexism, internalized in the case of these young men that victimized this young woman, is a problem for us all. It is  difficult to lead a successful life carrying such attitudes. But sexism has always been crippling for men as well as women. 

Indeed seeing it as such is a much more honest and persuasive means of moving past it. The psychological isolation that comes with these attitudes perverts adherents, whether they are men or women. You can see it in the colonized minds of Concerned Women of America as much as you see it in the leadership of the Catholic Church.

NUMBERS2357,,,"&gt; Similarly, if you’re an atheist whose first response to something like this is, “Don’t blame atheists! Most of us aren’t assholes!” you are awful, too. You’re right–most of us aren’t! And that has nothing to do with the fact that this is happening on an atheist forum–not to mention at atheist conferences–and yet, instead of wondering, “How might I help clean house in this community I care about, which I do not wish to see filled with assholes?” your first instinct is to explain to women why they’re wrong.

This is dumb.

&gt; [if you say] “Don’t blame atheists! Most of us aren’t assholes!” you are awful, too.

This is, I think, a natural reaction to a post whose title says that the author hates atheists.  I don't see how pointing out that I'm not, in fact, an asshole, is somehow invalid, when someone attacks me in that manner.

&gt; and yet, instead of wondering, “How might I help clean house in this community I care about, which I do not wish to see filled with assholes?” your first instinct is to explain to women why they’re wrong.

As for my first instinct, my first instinct when I see someone say they hate atheists is to say ""fuck you too"".  And my first instinct isn't the cleaning house thing, because I don't really care about the ""atheist community"", I don't feel part of any such community, I haven't been to any meetings of any such people, I'm just a person who doesn't believe in God.  And I'm not telling ""women"" why they're wrong, I am disagreeing with *one* woman.  Who started things off by saying she hates me.

To me, this is like an article starting off saying ""why feminists make me hate all women"" then explaining disagreements with feminism.  Even if you granted the disagreements with feminism, the headline and corresponding tone would still be BS.  In such an article it might have the line: ""If you say 'I am a feminist, and neither I nor most feminists think these things', well *you're awful too*"".

In terms of rape I'm not sure why you would suddenly start caring about the woman's rights because she was raped, unless your real problem is with women controlling their own sexuality. Added bonus is allowing rapes to continue with minimal consequences for rapists, because not only will we fail to prosecute them we ensure their victim is encouraged to get rid of any foetus that was conceived.

However in this instance, no one really joked about the subject at hand. In the comments there seem to be mostly jokes about raping/ and or having sex with a minor, which has nothing to do with the topic of a young atheist receiving a book by Carl Sagan from her Christian mother. 

If you want to joke about having sex with a minor... there is a sub reddit for that. 

Reddit is weird. It attracts all sorts of people and opinions. 

But anyone lurking around here is either blind or in denial if they don't recognize the casual misogyny that seems to seep through where you least expect it to be. (like r/atheism)

On a different note. I would like to add that /r/atheism is all about joking around, and humor these days in general is crude and unsophisticated. Especially on the internet, where we don't really face any concequence for saying something stupid.

The issue with transgendered individuals is a bit complex. There's the federal definition of sex, the certain areas where sex is segregated such as restrooms/showers/locker rooms, etc. Most people don't care, or at least are ambivalent as long as it's not brought to their attention, but when it comes to legal recognition of sex in the context of the transgendered, there isn't much consistency at the levels of government, and it doesn't always comport with one's identity anyways.

While the clinical treatment of transgendered individuals is fairly well understood, the causes surrounding their for lack of a better term condition isn't. I think that has made governments reluctant to make large, swift changes all at once, and while it may be difficult to swallow, I think that's a prudent if inconvenient path.

As for getting inspected at airports, one could argue that if it wasn't enforced that same sex individuals were the only ones allowed to inspect people, it wouldn't be an issue. A compromise might be that one can request a same sex individual, but part of that would be require revealing one's sex. That unfortunately, comes back to the legal definition of sex, so simply allowing anyone to inspect you and having zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior from either sex would solve that issue *and* could also speed up the lines if there is a proportionally smaller number of available inspectors of a particular sex available.",0,1329005386,,0,c3qa39c,t3_pkc90,5.0,t1_c3q9rsn,2249,1428337391,-1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1311668258.0,t2_5khv4,,,0

groops,,,"I can't speak for everyone obviously, but a lot of the hesitance that I have felt about speaking up on rape issues in the past has pretty much been a combination of general discomfort with the subject area with a feeling that I cannot legitimately comment on it.  This has been especially true in situations where the people I am speaking against are not men - which happens a lot more than I would've expected it to.  

One of the first times I aggressively called people out on victim blaming bullshit involved a comment thread on another site (that should have been a safe space) where I knew irl a large number of the people posting.  Someone had written an article elsewhere talking about her experiences being sexually assaulted in a particular community years earlier, and broader problems she thought her experiences were indications of. Someone else crossposted it, and the first ~90 comments were one of the biggest clusterfucks I have ever seen - people were picking apart her actions to try to find things she had done 'wrong', and were joking around about how she must just enjoy being raped. A large number of the comments - and almost all of the most offensive ones - were from women.

The thread was horrific to me, but I wasn't sure how to respond.  It was beyond the point where anything subtle/not confrontational would've been productive, but I felt utterly uncomfortable appropriately (aggressively) calling out a bunch of people that I knew, and felt especially extra utterly uncomfortable doing so to women that I knew when it was a rape related issue.  

I ended up talking to another one of my friend's about it, and eventually posting a pretty scathing reply, because even though it was uncomfortable to do it was more uncomfortable to let it slide.  Almost as soon as I replied, tons of other people replied in the same vein - and by the end of the thread, some of the people who participated in the initial clusterfuck realized the problems with what they had done - and the ones who didn't probably will still hesitate to bring their bullshit in to public in the future.  

The reaction I got was comforting - I think I was the only person who thought my response was inappropriate.  I ended up getting a lot of PM's thanking me for speaking out from people saying that they had wanted to speak out as well but were reluctant to be the first person to go dramaz.  It's allowed me to feel a little bit more sure in speaking out about related issues since then, and I'm better at regularly doing so than I used to be.  But it's still a really uncomfortable thing to do, and I still have to actively convince myself each time that it's something I can legitimately speak out about.

When guys don't respond to things like this, I'm sure sometimes it really is because they just don't give a crap.  But a lot of the time, it's not because they don't give a crap - it's because they're sitting back in their chairs shaking their heads feeling utterly uncomfortable with the situation but also feeling utterly uncomfortable speaking up about it.  That doesn't mean that they shouldn't be speaking up and certainly doesn't exculpate their silence, but I do think it's an important and noteworthy difference from simply not speaking up because they don't care.

bikemaul,,,"I don't think tearing down and restarting the social system is possible. 

I hope to see a continuing relaxation of the general roles and expectations of men being providers/protectors and women as nurturers/social/support. How we value these roles will also likely become more equal as the system becomes less rigid. 

I think young adults now integrating into society will in general gravitate towards their gender's traditional role. As long as the basic building block of our society is seen as a single man paired long term with a single woman these roles will be reinforced. 

I think gender roles would be greatly changed if fathers became the primary care giver for children. I don't think most women are willing to give up that role.

On a personal note, as a child I had the idea to dress up for my fourth birthday party in a dress, probably because I liked playing dress up with my big sister. My parents told me I might be unhappy when other people thought the dress was strange. In the end I did not. It made me realize even loved ones could be inflexible.

I do think it's important to teach children to be accepting of non-traditional roles. Yet, gender roles are a reality and it's not fair to force a child into the many difficult situations that do result when they are outside the norm. 

I am encouraged looking back at the how much gender roles have changed in the past 200 years.

Lydersen criticized coerced and unwanted physical interactions between management/customers and employees.

No. No they're not on the front lines or in the same combat situations. Medics, drivers, helicopter pilots etc. are referred to as the side lines. In the U.S. Military women are excluded from units at the level of battalion and below that engage in direct ground combat.

(And there is the other matter that, in a lot of countries, the policy is that only a person of your own gender can do a physical search. As someone who travels a lot internationally, I was NEVER searched by a man) EDIT: Actually I remember I was once, and the poor boy apologised profusely for it. But that was like once incident in 20+ years of international travel.

My mom is Eastern European, and I know that in the ""iron curtain days"" they were even completely anal about things like beards. My mom knew someone who literally couldn't get into the country because his passport pic had facial hair. Compared to that, some border patrols now are actually mild.

Last time I applied for an international passport, they basically needed a picture that would be easy to recognise by facial recognition software. My dad actually had his fingerprints taken. It's part of the increased paranoia of over-the-top security at airports. They also asked about ""defining characteristics"" like scars or tattoos - and while this is not on my passport, I'm sure it's on file somewhere. I do not like this evolution - but this is the reality of international travel today.

Their interest is to categorize you in as many boxes as possible, because next to being a citizen, you are also a potential terrorist and a potential criminal.

Separately from that, the problem is not necassarily that gender is displayed on ID's. The problem is you can only pick one or the other. If you could add ftm, mtf, or ""other"" - or whatever, the situation would be different. Also, if they truly insist on only searching people by a customs officers of their gender, they should hire trans individuals.

&gt; By blacklisting Chris Brown from the Grammys for a &amp;quot;few&amp;quot; years, the Grammys have gone above and beyond expectations for the social exile of an adult man who hit his girlfriend so hard she went to the hospital, and honestly it was really, really hard for them to show even that much support for victims of domestic violence worldwide.

&gt; The Grammys think that they were the victim of Chris Brown hitting Rihanna in the face.

There are books and books on this, but to try to summarize it in two examples: 

1. My piano teacher was this old Russian woman who grew up in the Crimea.  In her village, all the very old women walked with a severe limp.  
The reason was that when the Turks invaded, they raped all the women and cut their Achilles tendon on the right side so that for the rest of their lives people would know they were trash that had been 'violated' by Turks.  
Sex was used a weapon to shame the entire community, not just the women.

2. In Afghanistan, a man stole another man's property.  To punish him, they raped his sister.  This rendered his property spoiled and thus worthless to sell to a husband later.

shallah,,,"&gt;Lloyd, whose heritage is Anglo and Roma, eloquently describes the role that race and class play in the popular understanding of sex trafficking. Girls who are trafficked across borders are thought of as victims, and so are white, middle-class American girls. But the black and Latina girls with whom Lloyd works are thought to have chosen their life, to be oversexed or scheming or too lazy to do anything but sell themselves. They are referred to as young adults, even when they are far under 15, and cops call their rapes “theft of services.” Even though federal law says that anyone under the age of 18 who is sold for sex is a victim of severe trafficking, with no need to prove coercion or force, if the girl is an American and of color, she will too often be arrested, charged with prostitution and jailed.

&gt;In a particularly striking section of “Girls Like Us,” Lloyd notes that media attention related to exploited and missing girls matters:

&gt;&gt;    It makes a difference in whether your disappearance gets copters and dogs or flyers. It makes a difference in how you’re treated by a jury of “your peers.” It makes a difference in whether your family members are believed or taken seriously. In over a decade of working with thousands of girls, most of whom have been missing at some point, many of whom were literally kidnapped and held by force, I have never seen a GEMS case that has gotten an Amber Alert.

camelhorse,,,"This is exactly correct.  

Language, not just ours but all languages, is based on *metaphor*.
This means we'll use a word to capture *some* of the aspects of its original meaning,
but not *all*.

Simple example: Walking down the path of life.  We don't *walk* down life, life is not a *path* guiding
one along a simple direction from point A to point B, but there are more than enough aspects of walking
down a path that we *do* understand our own lives in these terms.

But the author of this quote would object to that.  

So if I object to murder I would want to eliminate the phrase ""murder""
from language when not discussing killing.  ""My team was murdered"" is now an evil sentence.

Killing.  ""Hey, kill the engine a second while I check your tire pressure.""
That's now an evil sentence.

We can go further!  What about the *millions and millions* of people worldwide who are starving to death?  So now we can't use phrases like ""She was starved for attention"".  

Or what about torture, of which rape is a subsection.  ""Tortured by guilt, he confessed.""  This is now an evil sentence.  

Language is infinitely expressive and ANY TIME anyone submits a word or phrase should not be used,
then THEY are the ones who become evil.

&gt; The Democratic Party also strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age-appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives. We also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions.

GoodGrades,,,"Keeping it rare is actually a good point imo, and for two reasons. One, most women who get an abortion are not in a great position. They may have just been raped, they may be facing terrible financial or emotional difficulties, so I think we can mostly agree that having better access to good sex education, rape prevention programs, and contraceptives which would prevent many potential abortions would be a good thing for many women. The second, and potentially more important reason relates to the pro-life side. Before abortion was legal in the U.S., an estimated 1 million illegal abortions occurred annually, right on par with the number of annual abortions post-*Roe*. So what we can say to pro-lifers is that we're happy to work with them to potentially reduce the number of abortions occurring per year, but that criminalizing abortion is very clearly **not** the best solution, no matter what your opinion on abortion may be.",0,1329802144,,0,c3tbvyf,t3_py905,1.0,t3_py905,31933,1428391363,-1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1319584869.0,t2_648km,,,0

passwordrememberfail,,,"Great points.  I totally hear and respect what you're saying, but there is a clarification that I think needs to be made here.  

I'll give you an example from my classroom to explain my concern.  
A student (we’ll call him Joel) expressed at the beginning of this semester that he did not understand why the term ""Indian Giver"" was offensive, since he said it lightly and had not intended it to give offense.  I know that he is a genuinely nice guy who had no malicious intentions. Me just telling him it was ‘offensive’ just meant he wouldn’t do it around me anymore, not that he actually understood why it was offensive. 

We spent a few weeks in the course learning about the brutal realities of Residential Schooling and the history of aboriginal peoples in North America, which many of them did not really know a lot about.  After that, Joel shared a story with me last week.  When Joel was in highschool an aboriginal classmate had dressed for their graduation ceremony in full traditional dress.  Joel and other students had snickered under their breath and made degrading comments about it.  He told me that it was not until this day that he realized why what he had participated in was contributing to oppression, and he would never do something like that again.  At that moment I knew he would never use the term “Indian Giver” again either.  His new knowledge led to a deeper understanding, and ultimately respect. 
Maybe saying “Indian Giver”, or using the word ""rape"" in isolation does not seem like a big deal, it is connected to a narrative of real violence and oppression. You only need to look at bullying and suicide rates for aboriginal students in white-dominant classrooms, or statistics which have been detailed in this thread about the vast occurence of rape.  It is indicative of a greater social problem; in the case of the ""rape"" word, trivializing it indicates more about the society that tolerates that kind of attitude than anything about the personal character or benign intentions of the gamers talking about ""baseraping"".

majeric,,,"Ya, apparently ""It"" doesn't get better according to the author but then goes on to describe how it actually it does... '

There's nothing in the ""it gets better"" project that suggests that ""it"" is the world. ""It"" has always been the context of a person that gets better.

They realize that their life isn't as shitty. They get to choose the environments in which they hang out. They have more control over their own lives and thus, life gets better because they have context... a different environment... more choices... All things that makes one life better.

I mean I agree with the sentiment that the author expresses but I think it's a needless attack on a project born of a really simple and elegant idea where Dan Savage after hearing about another gay kid who committed suicide wanted to tell them that life gets better if they just hold out long enough. Because he knows the stories of so many LGBT people where their lives did get better.

Then he realized he *could* tell these youth... through the internet.

""It Gets Better"" isn't a solution. It's not the end of bullying. It's just a collection of stories. It a part of the process so that LGBT kids know they aren't alone. That they can imagine their lives living free from bullying. 

One should never use it as an excuse not to try and fix it for queer teens now... but criticizing the project seems erroneous.

Know what the purpose of saying ""sex positive"" is?  It's just like saying ""well I'm not one of _those_ kinds of [insert race, minority, Jew, or something here].  You say ""sex positive,"" which describes _nothing,_ for the purpose of eliciting a reaction in your audience members in which they fill in the void with their own pre-conceived stereotypes of what a ""sex negative"" feminist might be.

It's just a subtle way of making a boogieman out of mainstream feminism, so you can make yourself look better, and all other feminists into badguys.

nomadic_kitty_vomit,,,"Gagh!  The reddit ate my comment.  Okay, take two.

I think that historical context is interesting and important in that it informs our understanding of the present, but that it complicates and confuses the usefulness of the terms.  I'll use racism to explain, as it is easier to show.

Under my understanding of the definition, if someone sees someone, and attacks them because of their race, that is racism.

If the attacker faces less or no punishment from the institutions that are supposed to protect everyone, that is institutional racism.

If the attacker's race only gained control of the institutions 50 years ago, I do not think that it changes the attack being racist.

I prefer this for two reasons, the first is that that past has very little utility compared to the present for predicting the future (This would take a long time to explain so you are welcome to either reject it or file it under 'interesting things to try to learn more about later'.  Basically, everything from the past that can affect the future is encoded in the present), and the second is that we can create cost functions for the amount of bigotry in a group (e.g. University campus, workplace, city or country) and try different ways of minimizing it.

It's also a much simpler thing to look at (Okay, maybe this is a third reason).  Who is historically oppressed between Portogie and Filipino?  A Scot and a Greek?  How large does an institution have to be, and how long is history for something to be historical?

shallah,,,"&gt;All true, but **there’s just one thing opponents have left out, or don’t seem fully aware of: Alabama has actually required ultrasounds for abortion patients since 2002. Since the majority of abortions in Alabama, as in other states, take place before eight weeks — when a transvaginal ultrasound is customarily used for a clearer picture — thousands of women may already have been subject to this form of state-mandated “rape” for over a decade.** That legislation, the 2002 “Woman’s Right to Know” act, was challenged in court for other reasons, mostly related to the First Amendment, but eventually upheld. Forced vaginal penetration does not appear to have entered the conversation until the recent uproar in Virginia, using that language, struck a chord. The imagery and subsequent outcry, says Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, was “able to shed light on it in a way a thousand legal arguments can’t.”

&gt;In fact, the relatively novel part of the Alabama legislation rests in the “See” part. As it stands now, the bill, which is expected to go before the state Senate sometime this week, requires not only that an ultrasound be performed before an abortion, but also that the technician or doctor “provide a simultaneous verbal explanation of what the ultrasound is depicting, which shall include the presence and location of the unborn child,” and to “display the ultrasound images so that the pregnant woman may view them.” If the bill becomes law, Alabama will join Texas in having one of the most extreme ultrasound laws in the country — not because of a forced transvaginal ultrasound, which is actually already commonplace in several states. The latest “pro-life” innovation is the state is forcing a woman to look at an image and, where applicable, listen to a fetal heartbeat with the express aim of dissuading her from her choice.

&gt;The pro-choice movement’s legal arm, including the Center for Reproductive Rights, couldn’t get the earlier Alabama law overturned, though it tried.

The assumption or denial of agency really colors people's reactions, and thus those reactions reflect the societal expectation of agency.  For example, a child pointing a cocked finger at you and saying 'Bang, you're dead!' is considered cute largely because there's no perceived chance the child could actually act upon that in any meaningful way.  Said child is perceived to have no agency; even if the child *does* have the ability to shoot someone dead, that agency is not recognized societally.  Now consider having a strange adult do the same.  It comes across as threatening because that adult could well act upon it or intend to and is perceived as such.  Said adult's agency is recognized societally.

When women challenge the gender paradigm it's considered cute, frivolous, or harmless because of the societal perception which does not recognize women's agency.  When men challenge the gender paradigm it's considered a threat because the actions of men are, societally, given weight and power; their agency is recognized.

ibsulon,,,"I'm not sure about the messaging. (Disclosure: white gay male, feminist, totally agree with the message. I've also studied a bit in the mass communication fields and am *only* talking about strategy, and I am also a former Evangelical with insight into that community.)

I can tell you the entire primary and secondary message targets in the IGB campaign. The primary is gay kids at risk. The secondary is older LGBT to fundraise for the Trevor Project.

Who is the target here? Is it conservative women? Is it congress? Is it the media? Those of us who already agree are not called to action. (IE calling your congresscritters.) Those who disagree are unlikely to watch, and further it doesn't target the opponents' messaging. 

The opponents' messaging is, ""If Catholics' freedom of religion can be abridged because of popular consensus, it establishes a precedent that our freedom of religion can be abridged later, and we'll be forced to stop preaching against gays, hire atheists in our churches, and &lt;insert slippery slope argument here."" (Oh, and there are two Catholics and a Libertarian running for office.)

The dog whistle message is that women and men come to the Church in crisis, and this removes yet another opportunity for those people to come to Jesus and live more Christian lives. (Yes, it's BULLSHIT. But it is an important subtext to understand.) Their contention is that the Church should be the central support structure, however ill-equipped it is to provide such a service to their own communities, much less the greater public.

We, as allies, can't approach the subtext. I believe a good strategy for messaging is a call to action for Evangelical women with these points.

1. The health care bill was changed such that insurances are the provider of services, not the churches,
2. As many as 1/3rd of fertilized eggs pass through during a period, never implanted. God obviously does not believe that the fertilized egg is a human being, or he wouldn't allow so many babies to die. (Does anyone have a fact check on this? I remember hearing this at one point.)
3. Our voices matter. Our lives have been improved with birth control. 
4. We have the duty to speak up for those less fortunate than us. (This is the trickiest part, because it gets into some bad stereotypes about poor people and birth control in that community.)

So really, whether or not the guy did anything wrong isn't even the question. The question is whether or not women have the right to set their own personal boundaries, or dictate the terms under which they are romantically propositioned.

jacobman,,,"That's a good distinguishment. Though, when I last looked, I'm pretty sure that it specifically said BC pills, but I could be wrong. I would have to see the specific mandate again. 

Either way, it would be misleading to say that it's for all forms of contraception and sterilization. Obviously you'll never get a prescription for some forms of contraception. 

EDIT: It took me forever to find [this](http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2010/07/preventive-services-list.html). It does appear that more than just BC pills are covered. All contraception methods for women that are FDA approved are covered. This still leaves the condom comparison relevant. 

It seems that the mandate only applies to women, [talked about here](http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2012/february/27/five-questions-health-law-mandate-birth-control.aspx). That's pretty short sighted and one sided, as it's completely possible that FDA approved contraception and sterilization methods will be developed for men in the future.

Also, pointing out that the cost of the contraception is not the only important point is not an argument for why BC pills should be completely covered .

It's an easy decision for you. You go ""oh sweet, my contraception won't cost me anything anymore"", but as it has been mentioned in the past, there are also men involved. Even if men weren't the vast majority, you still would have to frame your argument on why BC pills should be covered at all in a way that takes into consideration the comparative effectiveness, cost, and current support of other contraception methods. In addition to this overall economics should be considered. 

Just because BC pills are good, doesn't necessarily mean that completely covering them is something the government should be mandating, and honestly, I haven't seen much actual discussion on the issue yet. All I've seen on reddit so far has been finger pointing on sexism of some sort. While there may be sexism in this situation, that is not an argument for why the measure should be in effect.

Besides which, when you look at how many adults who are completely comfortable with the gender of their bodies still don't feel comfortable with traditional gender roles, gee, maybe it makes sense to infer that it's the role definition that's fucked up, not the people.

Yes, they are. It's being marketed that way. That's what pisses me off. Women are often being told by the people marketing this surgery that it IS for men. As a man, from a man's perspective, I would like for women to know--don't undertake this surgery on my account. That was kinda my whole point. I'll continue to broadcast that opinion to anyone who will listen. 

Many interviews that I have seen have young, sometimes *very* young adolescent women concerned that men see them as ugly, unclean, or any number of things that largely just aren't true. These women are being preyed upon by those exploiting a teen's often fragile self-image.

But yeah, I had a few drinks in me last night and I was pissed off at the way this is being presented by some in the medical profession--so, I came off pretty aggressive. I agree wholeheartedly with the interaction between you and MissCherryPi earlier. If a woman has come to a decision to do this for any reason, more power to her. But there's an active selling going on that is fundamentally predatory, and *that* I am against.

marshmelo,,,"&gt;even a respectful discussion about atheism that doesn't bow to the terms religion has set up is seen as profoundly disrespectful

It can be, but that wasn't my particular issue. I'm not an indoctrinated soul, but some of my family is Christian and it really bothers me when the atheist community, for instance, argues that nothing good ever came of Christianity, or makes generalizations about people and their religions that they honestly know nothing about.

The uneducated atheist tells us that because he was raised to obey rules that make no sense to him, and taught these rules in ways that did not better him as a person, the entire religion is defunct and should be abolished. But he didn't retain any of the knowledge about the religion or its history/customs, and refuses to consider possibilities other than whatever was shoved down his throat when he was too young to understand it.

Our culture in the United States has granted much privilege to white, heteronormative Christian males. But if I fit into three of those categories instead of four, I'm in virtually the same privilege boat as nearly any other person who is any combination of three. Social privilege doesn't really stem from religion; they stem from something else within us all. We are all capable of hatred, intolerance and bigotry. Some of us choose to use religion to reinforce it. Some of us choose to use *the lack of* religion to reinforce it - and there, you have the /r/atheism community, in my experience.

They're just a very embittered people, /r/atheism. They come from a culture that rejects and reviles them, in most cases - assuming the majority of them are Americans. I understand why they might feel that way, I just think that as long as the community is full of young people - the way the site is just churning in new young people every day, keeping the demographic young - no one there can offer the insights of anyone who has moved past the anger. It's okay to be angry, at first.

One of their central illusions is that society is right now being sustained entirely by men, because women are worthless, and that an economic collapse followed by a bloody revolution, during which men secure their rights as the superior gender, is inevitable. People have been advised (incidentally, by commenters who got voted up) that buying a gun is a good way to prepare for when this occurs.

Underscoring just how deranged these people are is the fact that none of this is particularly controversial, nor does it get voted down. At least never when I was paying attention. It's not the opinion of a small subsection of crazy people.

I actually think a place like this is dangerous, when you take into account the massive attack on women's rights and women's healthcare in the US right now, and the fact that so many women still suffer from severe domestic violence.

dada_,,,"&gt; Some people, feminists included, are *doing it wrong*. I fully accept that. Militant feminism, brutal denigration of men, etc., is not the right way.

The reason why I don't really think it's worth talking about ""militant feminism"" and the deliberate misandrists is because they barely exist. It's the most marginal group within feminism and has virtually no power whatsoever in society—other than the power vested in them by the patriarchy so that they can be used to defame feminism. They have no political influence to speak of.

Besides that, a lot of these so-called misandrists, if you bother looking at what they write and how they think, are really just being deliberately facetious about the whole thing. It's a way of reminding people that *actual* gender hatred (namely, the kind that men perpetrate, which is the only one worth talking about) does exist and is worthy of condemnation.

brightifrit,,,"I think it's unfortunate that men accused of rape are sometimes guilty until proven innocent. On the other hand, it was legal for a husband to rape his wife in the US until 1997. And most women who actually report rape face social stigma and blaming. There are cases where the men need better justice, but there is much improvement to be done on the women's side as well. The attitude I find with Men's Rights is that while rape is bad, they're defining it much more strictly than it should be defined. If a woman decides to stop having sex halfway through and the guy forces her to continue, that is still rape. Unfortunately that's not what I hear around Men's Rights sites. ""It was her fault,"" ""she was the one making out with him,"" and that sort of thing, seem to come up a lot. It's as if they think that because there are some cases where the woman has used rape accusations as a tool to harm others, that means that all rape cases should be instead treated as if the woman is guilty of false accusation until she proves she's innocent. 

As for ""chivalry"", now there is a system that ultimately benefits no one. Chivalry was a code of behavior for knights in the Middle Ages that dictates how one was supposed to show respect to other knights. This included showing respect to the other knights through the way you treated things that belonged to them, such as their horses, serfs, and wives. That's right, chivalry is all about treating women and horses in a way that won't offend their owners.

Men's Rights is like that.

Our culture discriminates against both sexes. Men are sometimes labeled as stupid, lacking sexual self control, and being unable to do things like parent and cook, when if any of these things are the case it is purely because men have been raised to believe that they are this way. The pressure that men in more conservative subcultures receive to be the sole providers for their family is enormous, and has a tendency to absorb their entire identity. This is not to the same level as women experience with being moms, but it is still a real problem. There is still work to be done on both sides. But this is not the same as believing that rights are being taken away from men. Privileges? Yes. It's certainly a privilege to have a wife that is legally considered your property, who legally can't refuse sex with you, can't divorce you, can't cheat on you but is forced to watch you do whatever you'd like, who is expected to take care of the children, run errands, cook, and clean all day, be fresh for you when you come home, keep working while you rest, and then have sex after the kids go to bed. That is what things were like for women 100 years ago. The Men's Right's movement wants that back. Seeing the women with an equal number of cookies makes them feel like they have less now, so they want those cookies taken away so things can be the way they were.

It's easier to enjoy photographs of people when you learn to not project pieces of yourself into the model, or pieces of the model into your own psyche, but rather just appreciate that the person in the picture, or on the runway, is very photogenic and fits a particular image, and that's why she's a model.

They hate Arabs because they are so secluded from the outside world the only times they really hear about Arabs doing was during the second Intifada so their frame of reference is scewed, and they tend to be a hateful people (when I say they I am only talking about the *most extreme* amongst the religious minority in Israel, which is a minority of a minority, but they're in the news the most.) One common misconception by westerners about Israel (among many) is that it's a left right spectrum of extreme/not extreme where on the left you have the gay rights/women's rights/anti-theist socialists and on the right you have war mongering genocidal religious jews. 

The religious have absolutely no interest in the perpetuation of the state of Israel. The only reason they live on that land is because of it's religious significance (which means very little to the government). I'm having a hard time typing this without grimacing, but essencially they pay fewer taxes, get more welfare, have more children, and thrive off of the securaty of a nation they couldn't give enough of a shit about to stand up and defend. This is also why they live in the West Bank, which is essentially Palestinian territory (Israel owns the land for security reasons, but it's really *for* Palestinians). 

It's also worth noting that even in Ramat Bet Shemesh, which is the even more religious subset of Bet Shemesh, the ""spitters"" are in the minority.

Women dressing in what would be considered extreme levels of modesty by most standards is fine IMO, as long as they do it out of devotion to their religion, and by their own choice. If it is in *any* way out of fear then it is oppression.

The reason the religious are allowed to stay so separate is when the state of Israel was founded religious jews seemed to be dying out. An extinction of the [Shtetl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtetl)   era of judaism would have been a victory for the oppressors the early zionists were trying so hard to overcome. David ben Gurion set up many laws and rules (most notably that religious are exempt from military service) in order to keep the religious protected and sustainable. He did his job a little too well, and with an average of over 5 kids a couple (and personally I have seen numbers up from ten) they have expended to become a fairly strong minority in the Israeli population that no one really knows how to deal with.

I mostly agree with Wong's analysis. I definitely got the ""you'll be rewarded with a woman"" message as a kid. Not so much the ""women have so much power over men because men want sex"", though I've got friends who definitely exemplified that stereotype. He failed to mention how much of masculinity is done by men for the benefit of other men. 

But what I really want to say is: I think these conspiracy theories about women (that they're diabolical temptresses who want to destroy masculinity and overpower the male gender, et cetera) only justify, not cause, the hatred of women, as this article seems to imply. In order to convey this idea, I'm going to engage in a little bit of theater.

Gimme a second to set up my tripod and spooky conspiracy background music. Bear with me. Cambot, dim the lights, please.

James W. Prescott in 1975 published a paper called ""Bodily Pleasure and the Origins of Violence"" in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, about a cross-cultural study of child-rearing practices and violence. He claims that deprivation of bodily pleasure (leaving infants to cry instead of holding them, sexually repressing adolescents) correlates with higher levels of adult violence and increased subjugation of women, among other things. He also found that indulging infants and not hampering sexual exploration was correlated with lower levels of the things he measured (which included mutilation of enemies, theft, and belief in supernatural agents along with commitment to female inferiority, apparently).

More recently, George Lakoff and Johnathan Haidt, commenting independently on the psychological and physical basis of morality, identify two large families of moral systems: nurturant ones where goodness is in preventing harm and giving care, and authoritarian (for lack of a better term) ones where goodness is in enforcing justice and fairness (which necessarily includes punishment). Both are present in society today. Lakoff links this back to two broad models of parenting: nurturant parenting, where your parents support and comfort you; and ""strong father"" parenting, where you are obedient to a legitimate authority who knows how to be good and punishes you for being bad.

Combine this with what we hear from the study of motivated reasoning, or of people whose corpus callosum has been severed, who find we humans to be master rationalizers&amp;mdash;we act or decide first and then tell ourselves stories to explain why&amp;mdash;and it starts to seem reasonable that the conspiratorial beliefs about women Wong describes might just be necessary components of justifying the misogyny our society is already committing and committed to.

Okay, you can turn up the lights again.

(Looking at things this way also changes the way you look at the Republican War on Women. Not favorably, but interestingly.)

As for war itself? I'm pretty damn sure war doesn't exist simply to give men a venue for competition over women. As L. F. Richardson [found](http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/statistics-of-deadly-quarrels/1) and as his successors continue to observe, war is a catastrophe whose causes defy easy analysis. The Carlinesqe ""war is men killfucking each other with surrogate dicks over whose godcountryfather has the bigger dick"" hypothesis is a little simplistic, I think.

b) Using examples from movies and books is relevant for discussing media influence. But using them as examples of how men actually behave or feel is poor form.

floweryleatherboy,,,"Despite not being one, I can access a heterosexual vanilla young male experience enough to think this is a good analysis.  A very good analysis, if you take the summary points.    The summary is not ""men think about sex all the time"", it's: men feel powerless, think manhood was stolen from them, believe in the promise of getting the hot chick, view women as decoration, think women tempt them to ruin.   

In general this kind of analysis, heavy on the, let's call it women's street sense is I think the right way to understand the current gender system.   A lot of our old institutional 70s feminist academic rhetoric doesn't get at the modern essences.  

Other examples... the good points in and best summary of the scum manifesto are not, e.g. ""women want to kill men"", it's ""men secretly envy the richness of female social experience, and sublimate that into sex"".  I think there's useful street smart analysis like, men are afraid if they aren't slightly vanilla dominant over women they are actually gay.   ""Men create wars because of their penises"" is an underused analytical tool. 

Really, study this article, it's worth understanding.   I was very young and very closeted when I felt some of these ways, but I did at that time, and many of these things are core for understanding patriarchy now.

ohgeronimo,,,"To some extent men undergo those same thought processes, but in my experience the sexual inadequacy comes into play quite a bit more. Most of my young (geeky) college friends went through a period where they saw it both as the world lying to them, and as them failing. They tended to go through the entire introspective mess, questioning themselves, and at the same time they'd blame the world. They'd say the world hadn't been fair, that they still deserved a girl, but that the world had raised the bar and added extras. They clinged to the fantasy that they deserved something for working hard, that the world was just and giving. So that bar was raised, and then they'd look harder at themselves and because they live a life flooded with sex and shows of bravado would assume that they were not meeting the standards for sex and masculinity. And to some extent that works. They work on being more confident, more aggressive, which allows them to convince women to give them a chance. But then there's the feeling of being less powerful. Suddenly life is about winning women, being a man to become the knight and be the hero to meet the standards of the world that were raised.

And then you get the jerks. The ones that, even if they're succeeding, can't realize why they feel so compelled to keep chasing the dream. They decide that because they're doing everything right, it must be the other party at fault. So they hate women, because life isn't fair.

Eventually, some men realize that life isn't fair, that they need to be outgoing and confident and so forth, but hopefully they come to the conclusion that if life isn't fair and they still don't get what they want that they need to just be rational and accept it and move on. But others, and these are the ones that set bad examples, cry and attack and blame because they just never see the problem is within themselves and that the world owes them nothing.

It was like thinking about Christmas the night before. I knew it wasn't helping, but the smallest curve of the female body would set me off. All I had to do was acknowledge one small thing and my body wouldn't let me relax and act natural.

dada_,,,"&gt; Why is this a false equivalency, and could you give an example of something that isn't a false equivalency?

I don't think there's anything you can use in the place of rape when we're talking about this subject.

The obvious difference is that being punched in the face is a million times more preferable to being raped. So it becomes easier to decide to not legally pursue it. But more importantly, there are different social processes at play in the case of assault. We're at the doorstep of sociology here so I won't go into the details, but while rape victims tend to be vilified and distrusted, female assault victims from male assailants get a greater deal of support from men due to their perceived gender role of fighter.

Yes, that's a major double standard, and there are all sorts of complex reasons for why this occurs, but suffice it to say that different crimes have different sociological backgrounds, which sometimes makes them hard to compare when we're discussing cultural implications. This isn't entirely an accurate description, and I'm completely disregarding other important facts pertaining to violence (which is another very important type of oppression that men carry out against women), but it serves as an illustration.

I should note that not truly understanding what rape is (which a lot of us don't, including myself) doesn't disqualify you from trying to empathize (I think this is the word you mean, instead of ""sympathize"") and educate yourself. There are lots of experiences that we lack but still have to deal with in some capacity. I'll never truly understand racism, either, since I'm not part of an oppressed demographic, but I can still try to suspend my own judgment and hopefully gain some semblance of an understanding of what it is. People are more capable of it than they might think, as long as they're willing to spend some time educating themselves.

&gt; I don't know how you see things, but generally any time that I hear of a sexual assault or rape, the only thing I hear from peers is 'report it, report it, talk to the cops, go to the police, you should talk to someone about it', and never have I heard 'don't report it, suck it up'.

People don't really outright say ""don't report it"", in part because those who actually make a conscious decision to visit the victim are usually those who do so in order to offer their support. This is about a cultural bias towards the assailant's side of the story. We might be talking about someone reading a newspaper article about something that happened on the other side of the country.",0,1333746093,,0,c49akm7,t3_ruog0,13.0,t1_c499ng8,4887,1428669629,1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1294411787.0,t2_4p6lz,,,1

Why is this a false equivalency, and could you give an example of something that isn't a false equivalency?

[deleted],,,"&gt;It's also telling that you don't require him to say yes. Double standards.

No, I don't require him to say yes when he starts the sex. Now I know you're trying to be an idiot.


But for other people reading here later, I'll add that rape isn't about sex, rape is an act of violence, psychologically as much as physically. Rape is also about control, and loss of control.


If you want to talk about stop having been rendered useless, he was the one that did so and took away her control of the situation. He should have stopped, or seeked enthusiastic consent after the very first time she said stop.

He took away a part of her control over the situation, and the rest was taken by what we call 'rape culture'. Rape culture is that which puts the onus on the girl to 'put out' after a few/a single date. Rape culture is where women are simultaneously told to dress nicely for a date or be a horrid unlovable bitch, and that by dressing nicely she was 'asking for it'. Rape culture is the pressure on women not to seem 'cold'. 

Oh, hey, that sounds familiar, almost as if she wants him to stop, but feels societal pressure to continue and make light of the situation, ie: by tickling, even after she's said stop. And last time I heard, tickling wasn't an unambiguous way of saying ""Please fuck me now"", otherwise we have a lot of disturbed moms and toddler tummies out there. 


And then he's already shown her that he doesn't respect her calls to stop. That's not 'breaking down resistance', that's making her feel as though she has no control over the situation. Now what are her options? Being called a stone cold frigid bitch &amp; socially ostracized, or continue. Great. It's not as if calling rape doesn't get her called that, because people still question her about the rape and why she didn't stop it, or conversely, if she stops before the rape, then she's accused of calling rape falsely. She calls rape, she's socially ostracized. She stops the rape in a more friendly manner, she's still ostracized. (Btw, only 2%-8%, setting dependant (average very close to 2%), of claimed rape cases are ever found possibly false). That's also part of rape culture. And again, people, like you, tell her she was 'asking for it'. 

The effect is so drastic, that ~60% of rape cases are never reported by the victim, because they believe the police will not believe or sympathize with them. 


(edit: I felt I should add to this, to make it a bit clearer. *As a psychological assault*, rape diminishes the victim's feelings of control far below what they can actually control. What happens thereafter is the actions of a mentally compromised person.  For example, they will grasp at any method of control they see. So with one story, we have a young girl who was raped by her riding instructor repeatably, but she used that to get free riding lessons. Does that mean she wasn't actually raped? No, that means that mentally she needed some way of justifying or controlling what was happening to her)

So, what about the case where she actually was willing, and didn't really say so? Well it takes about two fucking seconds to ask, and who the hell sexes without dirty talk anyways?

Y'know, gently caressing her belly after tickling a bit, sliding a finger up and down both of sides of her belly, ""Mmm, you have really nice breasts, babe, I'd love to play with them"".

Oh, wait, he did do something kinda to that effect. She said stop. 
&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;


Wanna talk about awkward? It's only awkward if it goes wrong. If, for example, she has assumed yes and doesn't answer, and he's just waiting for her to answer. Without asking, if it goes wrong, it's rape. Now, which of those is more awkward and less likely to lead to a second time?

So when we look at the general instead of the specific, we ought to ask ourselves the question of *why* women generally decide not to report.

This is actually rather important. This climate of dismissal is seriously holding women back from reporting crimes. They're often reluctant to come forward and take action, in part because they're afraid they're not going to get any support, and talking about their abuse might instigate a reprisal from their assailant.

The American Medical Association states that rape is the most underreported crime of all. This [government report](http://www.hmic.gov.uk/media/without-consent-20061231.pdf) from the UK states that ""between 75 and 95 percent of rape crimes are never reported to the police"". You might be able to imagine how devastating it is to be violently attacked and raped and to have nobody in the world believe you, or even to get called a liar.

Great. If you are in an established relationship. Not so great if you want to hold a persons hand or kiss them after a first date. This again is why nobody actually follows the rules on this list. They are not practical for the sort of social situations we face in the real world. 

Second,

I asked because I am a man who dates women. That means that I can only speak to my own experiences as a man who dates women. Perhaps you are in a different situation and a different dating culture  and your experiences were different because of it. I may be ignorant of this. I said it better here, but that is what I meant. 

Third,

Yeah, dirty talk is great. The only problem is that you did not ask permission first. How do you know if she sees what you say as sexy dirty talk or rather as a threatening or offensive:

""Sexually based forms of non-consensual communication, whether verbal, written, electronic, or telecommunication based""

You don't know till you ask. Right? I am sure you understand my point but I will make it clear anyway. Asking a girl if she wants to fuck could easily be interpreted as unwanted sexual activity. By your own rules you must ask first. The same goes for your other lines. Indeed for any line that is in any way sexual. So do you ask permission to engage in sexual communication first? How exactly do you phrase that? Unless of course, she finds that query itself to be unwanted sexual advance. Better ask first if you are allowed to ask if you can sexy talk or you are committing a ""sexual offense""! 

At some point somebody has to risk subjecting the other person to an unwanted sexual advance or sex would never advance. We all know this, lets not pretend we do not. 

This is the problem. These rules can easily be shown to be unwieldy to the point of being absurd by applying them to real life social situations. This is true of most lists that try to regulate horrifically complex social behaviors. 

Lets see this list for what it is, an attempt to quash and control spontaneous displays and communications of human sexuality. The motivation may be admirable, but it is what it is. And it sucks. It is silly and completely unrealistic. People want spontaneity, they want to take risks and triumph. 

You have failed to address my last point however, which was my most important one. I am still waiting to read your explanation about why my first kiss with my wife was so horrible. I mean look at me, my acts are an affront to all you hold dear. My wife and I committed a long string of ""sexual offenses"" by your rules. At least report us to the sexual regulatory council for reprimand.

Asking permission at every instance of ""escalation"" of intimacy makes a mockery of intimacy and of the idea of consent in general. This is the sort of behavior I would expect from somebody who thinks that women are irrational, vindictive man-haters who are aching to find a reason to accuse a man of rape. Therefore men must be ultra careful to make sure they have written permission in triplicate before eye contact is made, or heaven forbid, those crazy women will tell everybody you raped them and you will have no way to prove otherwise.

Do the women you are with not feel comfortable telling you to stop if you do something they do not like? Do you not like women who are capable of being in control of a sexual situation? 

You sound like a person who distrusts and fears women and female sexuality in general. Of course I assume that you are a man and are talking about females. But your gender or your partner's really does not matter. Your idea of ""consent"" is equally silly no matter the gender.

After sifting through a lot of that thread, the best comment I came across was by a redditor named montereyo. Here's the entire comment, because it's worthwhile:

*Let me take the exact facts that you've presented in this story and spin them from a different perspective.*

*My name is (say) Jennifer. I texted this guy Joseph that I've been out with a couple times - we had some pizza and a beer and played some Mario Kart lounging on his bed.*

*Later we began kissing a little. It was pretty nice but then he began getting too aggressive and putting his hands up my shirt. I'm not okay with this - I say, ""okay, stop."" He moves to the edge of the bed and looks hurt. He looks like he feels rejected, and I feel bad about that - it's not that I don't like Joseph, it's that I'm not ready to move beyond kissing at this point.*

*I want to lighten the mood and communicate that I'm not rejecting him outright, so I reach over and start tickling his sides. He grins and attacks me with tickles. I'm laughing and squirming and gasping ""Haha, stop, please stop!"" He lets me go, I take a deep breath to try to stop laughing, and he lunges to tickle me again! This happens several times until my stomach is exhausted from laughing.*

*All of a sudden Joseph gets a serious look on his face and crawls on top of me. He gives me a deep kiss and runs his hands up my shirt again. His touch is rough, and he yanks my shirt up to touch my breasts. This is different than our kisses before and I am scared; I feel out of control. I try to say ""stop"" but my terror tightens my throat and it only comes out as a whisper.*

*The rest is history*.

*Edit to clarify. I am not trying to make up details to make the woman more sympathetic. Instead, I am trying to illustrate the following point: what if the guy's perception of the situation is the description laid out in the original post, and the girl's perception of the situation is what I describe here? It's perfectly possible; people experience, perceive, interpret, and remember the same events very differently. What he sees as passion, she sees as forcefulness. What he hears as a mild, not-too-serious ""stop"" is what she hears as a ""stop"" so full of terror that she can barely get it out.*

*What then? What if both situations are ""the truth"" from two different perspectives? I don't have an easy answer.*

lotusmira,,,"This was a fantastic article.  As [Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/5900444/ashley-judd-writes-a-kickass-feminist-essay-about-her-puffy-face) said, I don't normally follow celebs so I didn't know/think much about Ashley until now.  I hadn't heard about this ""puffy face"" controversy.  But whoa - she made some really outstanding points, and she did it succinctly and clearly.  

Highlights, IMHO:

&gt;The assault on our body image, the hypersexualization of girls and women and subsequent degradation of our sexuality as we walk through the decades, and the general incessant objectification is what this conversation allegedly about my face is really about. [...]
&gt;

&gt;That women are joining in the ongoing disassembling of my appearance is salient. Patriarchy is not men. Patriarchy is a system in which both women and men participate. It privileges, inter alia, the interests of boys and men over the bodily integrity, autonomy, and dignity of girls and women. It is subtle, insidious, and never more dangerous than when women passionately deny that they themselves are engaging in it. [...]

&gt;If this conversation about me is going to be had, I will do my part to insist that it is a feminist one, because it has been misogynistic from the start. Who makes the fantastic leap from being sick, or gaining some weight over the winter, to a conclusion of plastic surgery? Our culture, that’s who. The insanity has to stop, because as focused on me as it appears to have been, it is about all girls and women. In fact, it’s about boys and men, too, who are equally objectified and ridiculed, according to heteronormative definitions of masculinity that deny the full and dynamic range of their personhood. It affects each and every one of us, in multiple and nefarious ways: our self-image, how we show up in our relationships and at work, our sense of our worth, value, and potential as human beings. Join in—and help change—the Conversation.

RT is the source here.  They were founded by the state owned new agency and are still state funded.

Politicians who are trying to control women's bodies are actively engaging in oppression. It is not oppressive or shaming to resist. It is not problematic to be assertive, to name or to call our oppression.

At least it doesn't correct it in the short term. In real life spheres, it may cause a short term correction. In online spheres, it seems to have an opposite, entrenching effect, probably due to the anonymity of online interactions combined with the sexism-supportive websites that abound.

I think shaming can get the ball rolling. Both IRL and online, shaming sexism is more for the benefit of other observers rather than the one behaving in a sexist manner. Shaming them tells everyone else, ""Look at how badly this person is behaving. This is unacceptable.""

And the more people who point it out, especially with public figures, the more the public and media are forced to address the issue. It becomes less a topic of one-on-one shaming and more of a general, societal pressure: *Why* are you behaving this way? This isn't acceptable.

unclegrandpa,,,"This is so not true. You absolutely can shame people into changing their behaviors. I cannot believe somebody would even suggest the contrary. I am not familiar with Brene Brown, but I see she is social worker - NOT a sociologist. A sociologist would never (I would hope anyway) suggest something as naive or as empirically incorrect as the excerpt you have quoted. 

Shame is an important part of the socialization process, this is basic stuff here - like sociology 1000. Shame is not simply something that occurs time to time that we can shrug off or somehow resist. Cultures use shame to enforce various social norms and to regulate people's behavior. It is a sort of informal punishment for transgressions. It is used because it is an effective way of controlling behavior. As a matter of fact, informal social pressure (like shaming) is often far more effective in changing behaviors than more formal methods (like our legal system). 

On another note, to call the use of shame a ""master's tool"" is naive and thoughtless. The use of shame never has been and never will be limited to the enforcement of patriarchy. Furthermore, shame (and other informal social pressures) are often the only forms of social power available to the marginalized, disenfranchised, or otherwise powerless. Look how non-violent protestors have used public shaming to humiliate their oppressors and encourage change. 

And finally, what form of social regulation has not been used to enforce patriarchy (or some other injustice) at some point? If we were to follow the OP's logic then EVERY form of social control or social power is tainted, hence unusable.

sskmpd,,,"&gt;Okay, so you acknowledge how few women are in those fields to begin &gt;with?
Nice way of ignoring the rest of the comment. Please answer the rest of the comment as well. 

&gt;And men have many many many advantages. In general, men can go &gt;anywhere and expect to be treated fairly decently. 

That was not what was being discussed. What was being discussed was ladies night at the bar and your claim that this couldn't be an advantage for women since it was commodification. What is it? Is is an advantage for women or isn't it? 

&gt;Women, on the other hand, well, there's a reason women build &gt;women-only 'safe spaces'. There's a comparison to be made on such &gt;safe-spaces, but I'll note that women's safe spaces don't tend to be &gt;labelled 'hate groups', and there are a hell of a lot more women-only &gt;spaces.
Maybe that is because most of the 'hate group'labeling is done by the very same people that build female only spaces. 

&gt;Because if you admit that privilege exists, then you can call out &gt;others privilege and expect others to call out your own privilege.

Please read the section on female privilege over at finally feminism 101. 

&gt;There aren't many people in SRS for example, who would say that &gt;SRS is perfect. Currently, for example, I'm part of the group in SRS &gt;that is trying to lead SRS away from fat-shaming, virgin-shaming, &gt;and develop a sex-positive attitude that doesn't harm asexuals. 

Good for you. 


&gt;In return, I've learned a lot of things from SRS, such as things about &gt;trans people I hadn't thought of before, (such as including the space), &gt;about rape and rape culture I hadn't considered before and why &gt;enthusiastic consent is necessary, etc. etc.

Good for you. Do you want a cookie on how progressive you are? 

&gt;To be an ally of LGBT/SRS/feminism/other such groups doesn't &gt;necessarily involve agreeing with them on everything, but it does &gt;involve championing your own struggles with privilege. And if &gt;everyone adopts such a position, then a lot of privilege will be laid &gt;bare and everyone to have a better idea of their own and others &gt;privilege.

And I repeat, read the section on female privilege over at finally feminism 101, hint it's existence is not open to discussion. 

&gt; That sounds to me as though you haven't studied ethics? (That's a &gt;question) Any rule system, for example, would consider that if an &gt;action could be done with malicious intent, then the consequences of &gt;the action should be carefully considered


Maybe you shouldn't use the high and mighty tone. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism v.s. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics
Can we please decide on what kind of ethics should be used? 
What I am hearing is that a male privilege is a privilege because it bestows a male with something, but what could be perceived as a female privilege can't be such because of the intent and mindset of the one granting it.

&gt;I am still wondering if privilege is something that is invisible to the one wielding it: How can women be the judges of both male and female privilege?

There aren't many people in SRS for example, who would say that SRS is perfect. Currently, for example, I'm part of the group in SRS that is trying to lead SRS away from fat-shaming, virgin-shaming, and develop a sex-positive attitude that doesn't harm asexuals.

&gt;Can we agree on one model of ethics that is used consistently? I am getting confused about this model where sometimes it is the intent of the action that is to be judged, sometimes the consequence of the action itself is to be judged. 

That sounds to me as though you haven't studied ethics? (That's a question) Any rule system, for example, would consider that if an action could be done with malicious intent, then the consequences of the action should be carefully considered. Also, any system which allows for asymmetry would also consider the perspective of the gestalt and perspectives of the components of the gestalt, thus only being concerned with the consequences, but having to think about the intent/perceived intent/etc. to determine what the consequences would be. And a host of other things that cause intent to annoyingly be relevant, like . The long and short of it is  that if there's a problem with intent or with the perceived intent, this may cause subtle consequences that are troublesome. And if the consequences are bad in the first place, then the action is of course unethical. 


Then also, I'm not sure what in particular you're referring to, but I suspect it may be the typical emotive argument for feminism and related movements. Emotive arguments, as it happens, are useful tools for feminists because they cause people to reconsider justifications they have made for their behaviour, but they also by nature aren't logical in and of themselves.

I have read lots and lots and lots about the theory of privilege. And as it is presented on say finally feminism 101, I am still wondering if privilege is something that is invisible to the one wielding it. How can women be the judges of both male and female privilege? 

&gt;In your complaints you fail to even recognize the social structure, creating a false equivalence between your situations and those presented. I mean heck, 'Girl's Night' at bars is usually used as tool for the men, since more women will be around. That's not an example of men being oppressed, that's an example of women being treated as a commodity. 

Doesn't change the fact. Women have an advantage. Can we agree on one model of ethics that is used consistently? I am getting confused about this model where sometimes it is the intent of the action that is to be judged, sometimes the consequence of the action itself is to be judged.

Yes, please let us talk about that. Since I happen to hold a master's degree in engineering physics.

The long posts from men about how when this one women mistook their genuinely good intentioned behavior or extreme shyness and called him a creep which sent him into an uncontrollable spiral of depression - its still HER fault for a) feeling threatened which she was obviously wrong to do and b) calling him a creep and making him feel bad because let's face it, she was obviously wrong by realizing that his behaviour was completely fine. (what a psycho bitch right?) 
And let's face it, when she then felt threatened and from that encounter she was no longer able to speak to strangers or venture outside, well that's her own fault.

It's unfortunate, but there are certain behaviors that seem weird to people. Sometimes people act a certain way because of aspergers and/or their personality.

If it makes me uncomfortable I'm going to protect myself and avoid that person. My priority is to protect my safety, not protect someone else's feelings.

Why are women worried about men hurting them? Because the majority of sexual violence is committed by men against women. Because most violence in general is committed by men - because when a woman is physical hurt it is usually always by a man. Because the average man outweighs the average woman and can do much more damage to her than she can do to him.

No one ever said that. It's just that using ""creep"" to describe both awkward people and stalkers does a disservice to the awkward people by lumping them in the same boat as the pedophiles and the stalkers and whatnot. 

Using a dictionary definition of the word doesn't negate its colloquial connotations. It's used in the ways people have complained about. You need to decide what the word means to you: does it mean an awkward, annoying person, or a pedophile?

&gt;is like saying that an African-American's use of honky has the same sting as non-African-American's' use of the N word.

It's a pejorative term that unattractive men and men with Aspergers dislike. The difference between honky and nigger is because honky was never used oppressively.

reginajose396,,,"And this is why black feminists/womanists refuse to identify themselves with the feminist movement. I mean seriously, like there are hundreds of books that are about how the feminist movement continually ignores women of color in their fight for ""equality"". Like from the suffrage movement, when white suffragists were confused why black men received the right to vote because they were basically animals. Completely ignoring that black people only had the right to vote in name and totally throwing black women under the bus. In the 1960s women were fighting for the right of women to work and break the image that all women should be housewives completely dedicated to their families without any aspirations of their own. But black women have been raising the children of white people since the beginning of slavery. Black women have always been working in a white supremacist heteropatriarchial structure in which they were seen as less then.
You’re response doesn't even baffle me. this country has been built on 400 years of white supremacy from slavery ( in which black women were constantly raped, watching their half white children being raped by slave masters, watching their black husbands  being emasculated and lynched and also sexually abused by slavery masters, constantly compared to animals and denied to their humanity) to Jim crows, to a racist prison system that locks up black men in record numbers (for petty drug laws, despite the fact that most people who drugs are white, and since the 1980s the 500% increase in arrests have been due to drugs, and that all-white juries are more likely to convict to black people and that black people face tougher and longer prison systems for the same crimes white people commit)
so this country has been built on genocide of native americans, slavery, jim crow laws, internment, lynching’s etc. etc. and it wasn’t until 2001 that the last anti miscegenation were removed from all the states. Racism is not over. Why do people assume that racism is not the normative story of this country when it has never been like that? Ever. 
Ask yourself, why is it that minorities are underrepresented in every medium. Ask yourself why don't white audiences want to watch a show with a mostly non white cast that doesn't confirm to racist stereotypes.

But the time frame the story is set in (fantasy though it is) is a world where a lesbian romance would not really be viable or realistic. Also, there are only a handful of characters, so even if some women were lesbian they wouldn't necessarily be the women who get pov sections. The women here are shown in more realistic situations, they are married off for power and money, some are raped or held captive by the families of their husbands, and their husbands direct their lives. The stories are in some ways historical fiction, there's a lot that goes on that is more about portraying a realistic world. I am female and found the books satisfying in terms of the women's thoughts and feelings. None are too masculine, some are just angry mothers, or protective or damaged from years of being treated like a bartering tool.

rooktakesqueen,,,"I've never encountered a group of people more dedicated to diversity and radical inclusiveness than feminists.  I've never seen a feminist community that didn't ban discussion that could be considered racist, ableist, homophobic, or any other sort of bigotry.  I've heard many feminists say that the cause of all underprivileged groups is aligned with the cause of feminism, and I've never in my life heard a feminist say the opposite.

""Feminism exists within society, which those -isms originate from"" does not in *any way* implicate feminism or feminists in supporting or perpetuating those issues.  Misogyny originates from society too, feminism certainly can't be implicated in that!

Feminism does not stand in contradiction with activism in favor of racial equality, sexual orientation equality, ability equality, or any other struggle of an underprivileged group.

If you or OP want to provide concrete examples of, say, feminists hurting the cause of racial equality, I'd love to see some.

**Edit**:  I guess my point is this: if you ask a middle-class straight white feminist whether she has privilege, most would probably admit to it freely.  The fact that they're focusing their efforts against male privilege doesn't mean they can't recognize other kinds of privilege exist.  In fact, I bet most people who consider themselves feminists *also* consider themselves anti-racism, anti-homophobia, anti-transphobia, etc. and actively oppose those privilege structures too.  To attack a feminist for *having privilege* is counterproductive derailment.  Everyone has privilege.  Some people have a lot more, some have a lot less, but you don't need to be a member of *every* underprivileged group before you can legitimately talk about the privileges you *don't* have.",0,1334788085,,0,c4dwjk2,t3_sfyv0,3.0,t1_c4dsrom,16372,1428749728,3,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1254201409.0,t2_3nhcf,,1.0,1

I put up a poster on the Facebook page wherein I said that I needed feminism because I was helped by feminists during a dark time, and their introduction to feminism lead me to acknowledge my privilege, etc., but eventually I eschewed the feminist label because of the white cis middle class centrality.

What I do agree with is that the Who Needs Feminism project is lacking, and I'm not sure if that's due to its organizers or its subjects. You're taking people from Duke, which implies that they have a fairly high amount of privilege (my partner is a Duke grad and I go to UNC, so I've experienced the campus), and what you're getting in return is people saying they need feminism so that they can get gender neutral Legos and stop shaving and wearing bras.

I think the project aims high and hits low because you are primarily getting white cis voices talking about what they think feminism is all about, which amounts mostly to having freedom over your appearance and equal wages.

folk have to understand especially us men folk that feminism is not anti man its anti patriarchy/misogyny/sexism

the double standards you mention Embo (i hope u dont mind me shortening) are results of the toxic restrictive gender roles that we men create and maintain on a daily basis at the expense of women. That archetype that says we have to be these tough stoic bad asses  traps us in to violent harmful means of exists by which violence and power domination and control become defintional  to what it means to be a man rather than just specific choices among a host of options.

You mention that men are seen as horny animals but that narrative is presented and cosigned every day by men who have the institutional power to change it and regular guys like us (mind you im speaking systemically here) that sex is just something that guys are about but its strange u would mention such a thing without recognize that often this masculine hypersexuality women pay the price for in terms of rape and rape culture.

 to speak to your prision comment. a careful reading of that situation shows the toxicity of patriarchy better than anything. Men who are seen as weaker become the sexual furniture of the bigger stronger men and are often refered to as hoes, or the b word which are gendered insults towards women. what this means is in the absence of women (which is the kind of an environment that a male prison is) the men there CREATE WOMEN to have a foil by which they can reflect and prove their dominace control and masculine essense as it has been read into by the static gender roles patriarchy creates and that feminism would see us free from.

majeric,,,"&gt; Just because some people consider him a feminist doesn't make him a feminist to everyone else.

Don't you see how your language is insulting? ""some people"" is more diminutive in emotional language than ""everyone else"". You've just dismissed his contributions out of hand and placed me in a defensive stance for this argument. So, this stops being a conversation and becomes an argument. 

Had you said ""some people  don't consider him a feminist and some people do consider him a feminist"" would place him in a position of neutrality without knowing what the numbers are. 

And is feminism even a popularity contest? Do you have to have enough supporters that agree that you're a feminist before you can claim to be one? Is it tenured like being a prof? Do you have to have approval among your peers?

I just feel like those who don't reasonably respect people's choice to identify as a feminist are using the ""No true Scotsman"" fallacy. Who gets to pass judgement on who's considered a feminist? The goals of feminism are fairly clear, anyone who chooses to work towards those goals should be considered a feminist.

It is erasure to deny someone's choice to claim the label of feminist.

&gt; It's extremely convenient to claim that any problematic aspects of his work aren't actually his work but injected by Fox.

I wasn't saying that in absolute. I wasn't blaming it all on Fox. I was presenting it as *one* of the reasons why his work may be flawed. I noticed you by in large ignored the rest of my points.

&gt; when he barely touches basic standards of human decency. 

That's hyperbole. ""**barely** touches"". Stories are about conflict. If they just represented ""human decency"" then they would be dull. Antagonists have to represent the negative side of conflict. Realistic protagonists have to have character flaws that they learn and out grow. 

Out of curiosity. What TV series do you use to measure the standard  of good feminism? Is there an example?

&gt; It's interesting that his mostly-male fans rush to lionize him

Do you know this as a fact? I kind of feel like you are falling into the traps of confirmation bias. The statement just smacks of it. *Confirmation bias* because I have no doubt you have one or two examples in your head that support your perspective but can you objectively state for a fact that only male fans lionize him?

&gt;The fundamental problem, feminist-wise, is his concept of feminism itself: subverting the trope of the weak woman character with a strong woman character

Being a trope unto itself isn't a bad thing. You have to demonstrate why being this particular trope is bad. To take from the website itself: ""On the whole, tropes are not clichés. The word clichéd means ""stereotyped and trite."" In other words, dull and uninteresting. We are not looking for dull and uninteresting entries.""

There's nothing wrong with having strong female leads. I don't think Buffy falls into the Smurfette trope because the show has an even number of female protagonists and well as female antagonists. Each woman on the show has her strengths and weaknesses. I think Darla is a tragic figure struggles and ultimately fails to find her place in the world which is why she falls back on misogynist behaviour to lash out at the world.

I think Joss Whedon is criticized because he is the only one that falls under scrutiny because he's one of the few writers/directors that's really trying to make a difference. As such, his work is pedantically picked apart... And like any thing that's popular, you're going to have some knee-jerk reactionaries who decide that if something is popular it must be flawed and rationalize a dislike for it. Which will consequently be re-enforced through confirmation bias by the some examples. 

Lastly, I am aware that Whedon isn't perfect. There are moments where in his work, it's uncomfortable. But the effort is there. I think he succeeds more than he fails and on the whole, he makes the TV industry a better place by having his work in it.

majeric,,,"Whedon obviously doesn't have full control over his creative process. Certainly Fox screwed over the creative introductions of Dollhouse and Firefly. The marketing and creative process were probably manipulated by all the players. Certainly the choice of actors were probably chosen for their appearances as much as their ability to act. Joss worked with what he had. The horrible Black Widow TnA Avengers poster is a product of shitty misogynistic marketing and not Whedon's creative decision.

And Whedon was young when he created Buffy. He was telling a charged story. Certainly some of it is going to miss the mark. It's challenging to write about feminism in a way that can be consumed by the mainstream misogynistic society in a way that will be accepted and considered. That was the power of Buffy. Misogyny could be a big rubber monster (as a very superficial example) and the perspective was novel so people accepted it in turn. You see that she's starts off being the person being manipulated and controlled by the people around her. Some for noble but misguided reasons like Angel and Giles and some for horrible reasons... and in the end. She's the leader. She's the person who's empowered herself to defeat the bad guys.

Lastly, I think you have to introduce misogyny in a story to discuss it... and it can't just be the obvious bad guys. It has to be integrated into your friends and your family and even your own behaviours. Giles and Xander and even Buffy herself perpetuates misogyny such that they go through the process of overcoming it. Nothing is more evident than Buffy's relationships. In a lot of ways those are the real ""evils"" that she has to over come... not the weekly rubber monsters. Her choices aren't perfect... and as a result that's *realistic* and for a lot of people really subtle. It's where the real growth of the character lies. 

Her concluding conversation with Angel sums up all that she's learned about relationships. She learned that she doesn't have to go running back to others every time she's hurt or scared. That she doesn't need Angel, Giles or anyone else to feel safe. She recognizes that it's a continuing process of learning and that if she comes back to Angel again in a relationship, she is going to do so as an equal.

You have to consider the over all story to consider if it succeeds or fails to address issues of misogyny. You can't just cherry pick scenes or events or even single story lines label them as examples of his misogyny. The story is a continuous storyline. The characters grow and develop over time. So to misogyny has to exist to be vanquished over time.  The themes are subtle and pervasive. 

In the end, I think Buffy is a story that I would want people to watch. Something that I'd want to show my niece when she's old enough to appreciate the story and the underlying morality tales. Is Whedon perfect? No. He makes mistakes.... but in the end, I think he does far more good than harm.

That's a disgusting statement. It's called ""erasure"". In the gay community, bisexuals are subject to it all the time because people refuse to respect their right to self-identify. 

&gt; nor does it make him incapable of writing misogyny

And nor is he in complete control of his creations. Fox had the most disgusting influences on Firefly and Dollhouse.

I've actually already read some of the examples that you've provided. The fact is that you have to create misogynistic content in story in order to discuss it. In order to present it to be dissected or changed. 

I'll indulge an example. However, [this is an example](http://wondercow.blogspot.ca/2005/05/joss-whedon-is-misogynist-homophobe.html) and I am not really interested in getting into a pedantic dissection of each argument:
*Of course* the Watchers are misogynistic. They are antagonists in the story.  They are perhaps the very definition of underlying background radiation of misogyny that exists in Western Society. They are misogyny that caps the potential of women everywhere. The kind that's perpetuated by an older generation like our parents.

Buffy is subjected to it on a daily basis. The type of misogyny that is wrapped up by Part of her journey is about recognizing that she's grown beyond it. Also the Watchers are a foil for Giles as he learns to grow beyond his own misogyny and let Buffy go and be an independent woman.

Most stories are about conflict resolution. You have to create the conflict in the first place. Whedon does this. The monsters he creates in his stores are just a vehicle for the real evil that he talks about. About abuse. About how sex is used in controlling and shaming us. 

Go back and read those articles again. You'll find that they never discuss the resolution of these issues but simply present their introduction and label them ""misogyny"".

This is an incredibly nerdy discussion, but I disagree.  I think Iron Man, Thor and The Hulk all have practical stances there, given their powers and body types.

I also disagree that ScarJo's boobs would be more emphasized if she arched her butt inward instead of outward, which is a more comfortable defensive posture.  

The idea behind this picture, along with most superheroine pictures, is, let's get as much boobs and butts showing as we can.

Look at her.  She's not even facing us.  That's how imperative it is for that ass to be on display.  That isn't to say such an ass ought to be shamed or covered up.  It's merely to say that that is where viewers' **and** artists' priorities are.  This isn't just the onlooker's fault; there is a complicity in the artist's ways.  

Either way, ScarJo is painted here in a contorted manner so as to arch her back, poise the butt, and proffer some side-boob.  It's ridiculous.  It's not a matter of being unattractive or not.

Anyway, many people creating these safe spaces fully recognize that excluding men does not trample on their rights or on equality overall, and spend a lot of time engaging in feminist gatherings that do include men.

JulianMorrison,,,"Actually I meant penis length exactly and specifically.

Intersex babies with intermediate genitals and a long phalloclitoris are coercively assigned male, with a short one, assigned female. This is standard medical practise. Often these assignments turn out to have been the wrong one.

Girls with clearly female arrangements and clitorises in the male length range quite often get them cut down (CUT DOWN, how the fuck barbaric is that?) to fit the ""biological"" definition of sex. Boys with clearly male arrangements but short penises are ""diagnosed"" with the medical condition ""micropenis"". Because this is obviously a flaw, not just diversity, right?

Human biology, even of the external markers of sex, is intricate and individual.

Human cultural *coercively assigned* sex is overly simplified. It would be literally true to say that *physical sex* (as most people think of it, rather than the reality of the meat) is socially constructed. Sometimes it is even *surgically* constructed, without consent.

BowlingisnotNam,,,"I understand that it is often stifling to be around men in a society that practically runs on male-centric values.  Do you think that a social movement like feminism works best when it purposefully creates divisions in who gets to discuss what, with whom, and where? Can you envision how that would make for equality?  

I don't understand how you could think that a reaction to male-centric values is the same as a proper refutation?  The message comes across as ""women and only women (born women) for equality in action, speech, assembly, potential and representation!""  Do you see the disconnect between equality and exclusive representation?  The internal struggle in feminist theory is about whether we represent equality through women's voices, or if we represent women's voices through equality.  You had better see the difference.

Think about this, too:  Which is do you think informs people's positions most, their gender, their experiences, or their values?  If their values flow from their experiences, which are often in relation to their gender, does feminism that excludes men/trans-women further support the idea that gender-centric values in a person are products of their own gender?  I think it does, and I can't see how exclusive representation in any sense allows for equality.

I don't think the exclusion of men is done for equality, I think that its done because our culture makes it easy to guess someone's positions on gender based on their gender.  This caters to the patriarchal norm of the privileged man over the marginalized woman.  To challenge that dynamic takes a balance between asserting equality and patience to those who don't value it.  It doesn't mean challenging privileged status with a different privileged status.

majeric,,,"**Analogy**: A comparison between two things, typically on the basis of their structure and for the purpose of explanation or clarification.

I find that analogies entirely fall a part when you examine them for their ""clarification"".

To suggest that women are locks implies they are barriers of entry. To what though? The only thing that it could imply is pregnancy. ""Keys"" and ""locks"" are pointless analogies if one doesn't ever plan on opening a door.

From the male perspective, there's some naive realist perspective that spreading one's genetics to multiple mates is some how evolutionarily ideal. I mean some animals work like  this. However, that entirely ignores the social consequence of multiple pregnancies in humans. The fact is that, we as a species, have to raise our young for a considerable length of time (our big heads that house big brains means we have tiny useless bodies for a long time). For a male to divide his focus among multiple mates is entirely short sighted.  So how is a someone a ""master"" when he spreads the group resources too thin and minimizes the genetic diversity?

From the female perspective, it assumes that they are *only* for pregnancy. The fact is that sex as an act of pleasure and/or social bonding. In fact *most* (like 99%) of the acts of sex in this world aren't for the purposes of procreation. So, 99% of the time neither party is interested in unlocking the door. Sex is far more a social act than an act of procreation.

A lot of Reddit basks in the intellectual glow of certain perspectives (""atheism = reason"" and so on), but there are few channels that I've found live up to my initially rosy expectations. At first sight, the whole site looks like a community of deep intellectualism, but progressive politics are lacking in many places, and for me, that no longer counts as deep or intellectual.

Now the only subreddits I frequent are /r/feminisms, /r/feminism, /r/depthhub, a few of the big news channels, and couple of classical music subreddits. I learned within a week to stay as far away as I can from /r/atheism; many people there are not just bigoted, they're caustic, even vindictive. I don't even read much of the SRS stuff unless somebody has linked it within one of the feminism channels.

It's hard to enact social change through Internet comments—when a bigot can hide behind a screen thousands of miles away, he or she is unlikely to listen to a plea for fair treatment (especially if that plea asks for the level of introspection that feminist thought asks for!). So I use Reddit for a few certain things, and then turn to the people around me in real life for the rest of my day.

CatFiggy,,,"&gt;Yeah, from what I've seen they've been pretty good and, while sometimes bans are handled inappropriately, the mods are generally quick to apologize and print retractions.

I was banned from SRSDiscussion, and I thought they were being completely unreasonable. It's another circlejerk with fewer rules. 

The question was ""Are laws which would benefit people of higher classes more, classist?"" (or something). I mean, say, ordering everybody to be vegeterian, while some people, due to location or poverty, have only access to meat.

I insisted that it was not classist because it was not fueled by and had never taken into account *classism* -- or, it doesn't necessarily, so the answer to the question is still ""no"". Is it classist? Well, there's no classism, so I don't see how it could be classist.

I was eventually banned for breaking, I believe, rule IV, which states that one must assume others are arguing ""in good faith"". Well, people had been giving me sarcastic one-word answers to which I would reply with well-thought-out, paragraphs-long, logical and polite comments. I was unaware of the rule and a mod, who'd been arguing on the other side (as was everybody; how is that a discussion?), asked me if I was arguing in good faith. No, I said, I was not. I had at first, but they acted like shit. His reply was ""Rule IV. **BANNED**"". Pretty good, very classy.

 I did complain to them that rule IV -- or whichever rule the mod cited -- did not require anyone to *themselves* argue in good faith. That'd hold up in a court of law, but not in that serious, serious discussion sub.

And why should some apologies rid them of guilt, when they could simply not act shitty in the first place? (Not that I ever heard from them again. Still banned, as far as I know.)

(Snow White deals with royalty, so survival is not at stake in the tale, but biological lineage and who inherits is very much at issue). Maria Tatar says something similar.

&gt;The appellant [Assange]'s physical advances were initially welcomed but then it felt awkward since he was ""rough and impatient"" … They lay down in bed. AA was lying on her back and Assange was on top of her … AA felt that Assange wanted to insert his penis into her vagina directly, which she did not want since he was not wearing a condom … She did not articulate this. Instead she therefore tried to turn her hips and squeeze her legs together in order to avoid a penetration … AA tried several times to reach for a condom, which Assange had stopped her from doing by holding her arms and bending her legs open and trying to penetrate her with his penis without using a condom. AA says that she felt about to cry since she was held down and could not reach a condom and felt this could end badly.

&gt; Day Z's ladies look a little something like this. Players will be presented with a one-time option to switch to female characters when they first connect to a server after applying the patch.

&gt; As well as adding ladies and changing the bandit code so players don't automatically don a mask when their humanity dips low, patch 1.6.0 adds switchable outfits. You can persuade a player to part with their vestments, perhaps at gunpoint, or go scavenging for your own.

I'm not saying women comedians aren't the victims of objectification or sexism, because they are, but I'm not sure I buy the undesirable thing.

When Louie calls his 4 year old daughter an asshole, every parent in that room knows exactly what he's talking about. Does it make him seem kinda like a shitty dad? Sure.

derpymao,,,"I've been thinking about this a lot as I have a female friend who has recently been working the local comedy circuits. From what she told me, it is definitely a scene that is still very male dominated, and from some mainstream perceptions it could definitely look like there's a lot of ""I'm funny, but unattractive"" spiels in the female acts. 

I think it's easy to draw a parallel from the most recognizable and famous female comedian in Canada to deduce that her act is what has propelled her to where she is now. When you have such a small sample size to draw from, there are only so many conclusions you can come up with.

To be honest, I'd say that a lot of mainstream humor that I know of is self deprecating in some way or another. Also, to be the top of your game in mainstream comedy is a surefire way to know that a lot of that humor has widespread appeal (and therefore, probably pretty stupid in some ways). So to reach that sort of pinnacle and mass appeal, the jokes that resonate most with the most people will probably tend toward more stereotypical or conservative elements.

That is a pretty grim view though, I suppose, when there do also exist a lot of inspiring comedians out there that are fiercely intelligent (and are also appreciated by a fiercely intelligent audience).

Maybe it's just that here in Canada in particular no female has stepped up to be a whirlwind of comedic and inspirational power yet.

[deleted],,,"You're absolutely right.

I think i got caught up in the just words, rather than giving a proper look at at the context. My bad.

I've been thinking that I'm coming to a place where works are simply default bigoted, because it comes from artists formed from bigoted societies. Artists produce art, but societies produce artists. I don't think one can escape producing sexist, racist, etc. works as a result. Right down to the language, we have sexism.

The bigotry can only be negotiated, not erased. As you say the barriers can be challenged, but i think only a change in society could change whether or not a work is bigoted. Also, if you can bump me some papers on the Shakespeare debate, i'd be really happy. Had no idea that this was being examined - the fact that it is wildly comforting.

I know that seems really pessimistic, but i think over time it can be changed by taking an active role in how we produce our media. Going over and getting rid of bigotries in one's short stories, just like looking out for grammar mistakes, for example. I think we can get there. I just hope i'm there to see it.

[deleted],,,"Sexism, like racism, is pretty simple. Both forms of bigotry require judging people on inconsequential characteristics. For example, 'women can't drive'. There's nothing in being a woman that makes them intrinsically bad drivers - ovaries don't block the steering column, vaginas don't fuck up one's vision. There's nothing about being a woman that makes them less likely to be able to drive well.

Easy test - if there's a phrase that can't be reversed in the matter of male/female or applied to other races, it's probably racist. 

I fully agree that the books are more....male-oriented. I think in broad strokes Martin treats women characters as interesting, fully articulated beings, but you're right, there seems to be compromising positions and even humiliation that's squicky at the least, and hard to justify narratively. 

I tend to think that baseline media in our world tends to be sexist since the producers come from our sexist ass-society. That said, the books are a bit worse than average for sexism, i think, and the TV series is a little less sexist than average.

It also reinforces the idea that everybody fits into a neat little binary system. They don't.

The answers to 1) and 2) are ""no,"" because an object does not have motivation or mental phenomena, and only things with motivation and mental phenomena can be sexist or objectifying.

3) Yes.

4) Almost certainly.

The answer to 5) and 6) are ""We will never know,"" because authorial intent is not something to which we have access. That's basic literary theory.",0,1339010551,,0,c4x4f5r,t3_uny9e,4.0,t1_c4x3pio,2740,1429082985,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1315500667.0,t2_5thx9,,,1

sipos0,,,"This is a pretty stupid idea. 

Even from the strictly economic standpoint that the argument is being made, ignoring the other benefits of people having control over when/if they reproduce, it is retarded. 

I'm all for internalising economic externalities (making people pay for the costs their actions cause others or benefit from the benefits their actions cause others) because it leads to socially optimum levels of consumption of the relevant goods. Making polluters pay for the clean up of their pollution is not only fair but, a good thing because it leads to the right amount of the good causing the pollution to be produced. Without measures like this, more than is helpful is produced because the market fails to take into account the cost of clean-up when setting the price so, people buy the good even when they benefit less from it than the cost of cleaning-up after it. 

The problem with the argument that women should pay extra for taking the pill is that there are already positive external benefits for women taking the pill that are not internalised (less unwanted babies that cost society money for example). If anything, the taxpayer should be paying women to take the pill because of the (much greater amount than the cost of cleaning water) money it saves the state in potential adoptions, caring for children and school costs etc. 

Leaving aside the economic arguments, people have a right to decide when they reproduce and shouldn't be stopped from having that right because they can't afford to pay for the pill. It should be free to start with, ignoring any externalities. Also, the fact that there is only a pill for women creates the potential for the cost being unfairly borne only by women. 

I've never read Forbes but, I was under the impression that it was a well respected business magazine. Irrespective of their position on whether women should get the pill free, it's editors should know enough economics and be smart enough that it should be obvious to them that, even when you internalise externalities, the pill should be subsidised, not taxed.

sipos0,,,"Disclaimer: I'm a guy.

I think it would be interesting for people to hear from a woman working in a male dominated field about how it is working in a field like that. I work in particle physics - it's a pretty male dominated area* - and I found hearing experiences from female colleagues who are friends interesting, surprising and sometimes shocking. I think it's an interesting area for discussion and I think a lot of good could come out of a discussion like that in terms of changing people's attitudes and, possibly getting more women working in traditionally male dominated areas.

I agree that it could also open her up to a lot of unwelcome sexist comments from bone headed redditors which is a real shame. 

I see your point about doing an AMA like that potentially minimising the significance of the person's work. I think really a female rocket scientist/particle physicist etc has two reasons to do an AMA. One is that she is working in an interesting field (especially to a lot of reddit) and one that she is a woman working in a male dominated field. I think the first reason has probably already been covered for most areas so may attract less interest than the second but, I'm not aware of examples of AMAs about the second. 

(if you are aware of something like this that's already been done, please let me know - I'd be interested. I remember one about a man working in a female dominated field). 

I think it makes sense to either make it an AMA about a rocket scientist/particle physicist or whatever (in which case I see no reason why the person should need to disclose their gender) or an AMA about a female rocket scientist/particle physicist etc working in a male dominated field. I would hope that if it was an AMA about the second, people would think a little harder about how stupid their sexist comments are before making them. 

*There is a series of charts about demographics of one of the major particle physics collaborations, on one of their posters, and one of them claims it is 90% men and 10% women.

cleos,,,"Not to beat a dead horse, but I think it's imperative to understanding this article to differentiate between *conformity* and *identity*.

Adherence to gender role expectations is not a continuum with ""cis"" on one end and ""trans"" on the other. 

Trans people (speaking of MTF and FTM), like people who identify with their assigned gender face the same issues that cis-gender people face.

A person who is identifies as one gender, regardless of whether that gender matches up with their sex or not, is going to be viewed by strangers (society) as either a man or woman. 

A female born man or a male born man is still viewed as as man by passersby. 

But regardless of the biological sex of the person, the man is still going to be judged by the degree to which he adheres to the gender role expectations of men.

If a person that society labels as *man* has the occupation of a nurse, he is viewed as not conforming to gender role expectations. Strangers that see a person who presents as a man doing the grocery shopping in the middle of the day is going to be viewed differently - and less favorably - than a woman grocery shopping in the middle of a day or a man in an office. 

A woman who is biologically female is not inherently conforming to the social male gender role anymore than a woman who is biologically male is, because role adherence relates to the degree to which a person adheres to a social identity - and ""cis"" or ""trans"" refers to a self-identity. 

Another way of thinking about it:

**Note**: The following scenario isn't meant for you (soducked), exactly. It's really a way for *me* to work this out. Please, feel free to comment, but this part is more me explaining it to myself or something than explaining it to you. 

In 2X a few days ago, there was an AMA of a girl with a father who cross-dressed. When he was in the house with the family, he wore women's clothes (make-up, heels, stockings, etc). But he still identified as a man. 

Let's say there are two twin brothers on the street, both are biologically male and physiologically look like males. Neither have shaved their faces in a week. Both of them decided today that they were going to put on a dress, a wig, heels, lipstick, stockings, a skirt, a blouse - and there were doing so in a genuine, non-costumelike way.

Both of these men are going to be treated negatively for wearing clothing that is not typical for their gender. They might be insulted, attacked, or ignored. People might point at them or move away from them. What people see are *men* who are wearing *women's* clothing. Both both of those brothers might identity as men. Or only one might. Maybe neither of them do.

Let's say that both of them jokingly decided to dress up as women, but one of the brothers secretly identified as a woman. Regardless of this self-identification, they're both being treated the same way because they're viewed as men wearing women's clothing.

But, if we fast-forward a year or two:

One of the twins identifies as a man. The other twin once identified as a man, but then began openly identifying as a woman. This twin shaved his beard, adopted a female name and female pronouns, and is undergoing hormone therapy to develop a more feminine body form. In neutral clothing, this twin is viewed as a woman. 

Two years from from their first dress-up day, the twins are walking down the street, both in dresses, makeup, heels, stockings, etc.

But what society sees (strangers see) is a woman with a cross-dressing brother. Unless she explicitly tells anyone of her trans status, nobody knows. Her co-workers and boss treat her like a woman, strangers walking by see her as a woman, etc. Because she's perceived as a woman, she will face all the same crap that women face - regardless of what their chromosomes or genitalia are.

If she decides to become a construction worker, she's going to be judged in the same way that all women in masculine/male dominated roles are going to be judged. If she wears her hair down, wears skirts, lipstick, and a push-up bra, she's going to be treated differently than if she wears a (woman's) pantsuit and wears her hair in a bun. 

To reiterate, the social privilege of conformity to gender isn't tied with self-identity with gender. Whether you *present* as a man or a woman is of greater influence than whether you *identify* as a man or a woman, because theoretically the only person who knows about that identification is you - the self.

But as to actually how the characters are treated by the author, I don't see there being much sexism.  Much in the same way that while there is much content dealing with sex, the writing itself isn't what one would likely considered erotic literature.

That is, trans people (speaking of MTF and FTM here) *want* to be seen as either a man or a woman. When a person passes them, the person is thinking in terms of man/woman or masculine/feminine.

Strangers are not making judgments on their gender/sex matchup - rather, they're making judgements on whether they present as men or as women.

The degree to which a person conforms to one's societal gender role expectations is *not* synonymous with the concept of what gender they identify as.  A man who is a nurse will be considered nontraditional though, and he may be penalized and looked on negatively for engaging in a role that is not typical with his gender.

I'm very interested in social psychology - specifically, in social perceptions - more specifically, in gender.

I did an undergraduate thesis and a study on peoples' perceptions of those who do not adhere to traditional roles. I had participants rate men and women who were engaged in traditional and nontraditional occupation and lifestyle behaviors on the factors of Likability, Intelligence, and Attractiveness.

Traditional/nontraditional are terms used to denote whether a person is engaging in a role behavior that is typical or atypical for their gender. In my study, I had nontraditional women would be women who engaged in behaviors such as mechanic work, a pilot, or a police officer. Nontraditional men were men who were hairdressers, doing the grocery shopping, or being a nurse. They were engaging in behaviors that were typical of the other gender. And, in certain instances, they were penalized for failing to conform to their traditional gender role (most significantly, nontraditional men were rated as less attractive than the other groups).

However, ""trans"" isn't the same thing as not conforming. A woman-born-woman can be very masculine and still identify as a woman. 

I think the major thing with the sentence of yours that I quoted is that the first part refers to social identity - the degree to which a person adheres to or does not adhere to the norms of their gender, while the latter half refers to self-identity - whether a person identifies with their assigned gender.

I think they're looking at it through a slightly narrow window. *Compared to male cis privilege,* female cis people are not nearly as exempt from sex-based oppression. But *any* cis person, regardless of their genitalia, is exempt from more oppression than a non-cisgendered person.

So I agree with your first two paragraphs. As for your third, I'm not sure I'd go so far as to accuse the author of being willfully ignorant.

Did you google it? There is no link to any of the major dictionary sites on the first two pages, the closest is a like to ""www.urbandictionary.com"" halfway through the second page. Categorizing humans as ""men and women"" is exactly what makes up humans. Deciding/being born feeling, seeing yourself as any other sex then you were born as changes nothing about biology. I cant wish really hard that I would have been born with three arms and expect people to treat me like I have a third one when I tie on a fake arm can I? No because that isnt how I was born. Can people be polite to me and not tease me about it, yes. Thats called compassion but should the world have to change to align to my views, no thats hypocritical and disgusting! 

Im not sure how having a male and female facilities is ""sequestering women"" any more than its ""sequestering men"". There are differances between men and women thats just a fact. Woman have different needs then men do, its a fact. What do we as a culture actually gain from removing mens and womens restrooms and going to just unisex bathrooms? How do you legistale that? What penities do you impose on people not willing to use restrooms due to being a rape victim and not wanting to be subjected to doing private stuff around people of the opposite gender? 

In short I think your view point is un-thought-out, short sited and possibly immature but I do hope that you can shed some light on it.

How is distinguishing a male and a female restroom sexist? It's sexist because it's in the general category of ""sequestering women"". It's an adaptation to the assumption that men can't be civil around women. It's an adaptation that doesn't *condemn* men's incivility, but merely works around it by keeping women separate, as if it were a force of nature.

It's also cissexist, because categorizing humans as ""men"" xor ""women"" is erasing of personal identity for many of them and flatly does not apply to some of them.

Even if we could somehow eliminate categories like sex (or race, or age, or whatever socially significant characteristic you want), they would simply be replaced with other categories based upon some sexual or biological criteria.

Origami_mouse,,,"I don't see why we can't shave our armpits - so long as we know why we do it, and we're comfortable doing it, then why not? How does it make anyone any less of a feminist? 

Personally? I wish *men* would shave! I do. I just think it's kinda icky and gross - the way sweat sticks to the hairs and bacteria can grow and just urgh. (Thank you, biology lessons. And, yes, I know you guys wash) 
And I find my deodorant (I unfortunately suffer from perspiration) works better on smooth skin.

And I like the look. Sure, it could be because I've been socially programmed to think that shaving armpits is desirable - certainly when my wisps of blonde turned darker. But I'm honestly ok with that, because of the benefits it gives me personally - hygiene benefits that were made clear to me not only at school but at home. By a woman who didn't always shave her armpits no less. I know that it's likely that society has told me to see bare pits as the hight of desirability, but frankly, it's not the worst thing that I've been subconsciously told.

FYI: Yes, I do shave my legs on occasion. I like the feel of them when I'm wearing my summer pjs, rather than my hairs tickling me (sensitive skin). I'm blond, so yes, the social ""necessity"" isn't quite there, but I have brunette friends who don't shave that often and I think it looks fine. I don't care if you shave your legs or not - it's up to you and for your own reasons. If you're not comfortable with the social backgrounds, don't shave! If you're aware that you're just ""conforming"" to social's definition of feminine beauty, but you shave anyway, it doesn't negate any of your feminist beliefs in the slightest. 

I don't shave my nether regions, just keep it tidy, but mostly because I like having it shorter - breaths better down there then. Less messy when I'm dripping blood all over the place. 
Reason I don't shave? Itches like fuck. And high maintenance. And I don't personally like the look. I like my hair. I think it's interesting. (It's got like, 3 shades!) 



Otherwise, no, she doesn't answer the question very well, but she *does* put across the main point of feminism - equality for all. She points out that the majority of people that are quick to dissociate from feminists are actually believers in many of the ideals. I took them to largely be rhetorical questions, personally.

Well surely not because she feels any pressure to conform to some sort of cultural ideal of womanhood or femininity, hell no... she just ""likes shaving"". Uh, yeah.. that's it. 

It is the exact same type of social pressure that convinces women to ""like"" shaving their armpit hair as convinces them to dislike being called a feminist. It does not come as a surprise to find the author completely oblivious of this little fact, however, as this is a poorly thought out article in general. 

I mean, this author does not even address her central point - how it is that feminism became a dirty word. She asks why people don't want to be called feminists several times, but then rather than serving up an answer, she throws out a few cheers for feminism and that is it.

This is an important topic and the author is clearly not up to the task. She needs to be called on this fact, not praised.

The only relevant experience I have is having been a musician who's actually done a few things (nothing huge just a few albums and touring a bit) I know that the best way to get a hold of most people in the public spotlight is through their PR team. This not only means actors and musicians, but politicians, and anyone successful enough to be famous (including non-entertainers like Niel DeGrasse Tyson). So I'd look up the person, and try to find a contact for their PR team, then send their PR team a proposal and explain how the person might benefit. This is where the AMA requests might come in handy, but only if it's heavily upvoted. Mostly I'd probably just sell it as a session where they could answer unique questions from folks some folks who are fans and some folks who aren't, which could be an opportunity to reach a new audience as well as reach fans on a deeper, more intimate level.

For example, I'm going to guess that /r/feminisms is not made up primarily of death metal fans. So, were I to try to get Angela Gossow on board I might point out that this discussion originated in regards to feminism  meaning it might be a good way to reach out to a whole new demographic (feminist/female) which could lead to higher concert attendance and record sales. Now here's where the AMA requests might come in handy. Let's say someone put up an AMA request for her and everyone active in /r/feminisms went over to that post and upvoted, giving the thread 1000 upvotes. Well now we can link to that thread and say ""look, here's 1000 people who don't even necessarily know your music who all want to talk to you. You might be able to convert them to fans. And being a vocal group, they might be able to spread the word a bit"". 1000 new potential fans is a big deal for any death metal group. Or if we can't get that many votes on an AMA request we just say fuck it and make the same sales pitch without that thread.

Of course most of this is speculation based on limited experience as a wannabe rockstar and redditer. 

As for how to go about getting in touch with their PR team, a lot of these folks have contact information for their management teams right on their websites.

Cosmetic surgery especially cosmetic surgery on sex organs is sometimes treated by liberals and feminists the way that premarital sex and homosexuality are treated by the rightwing evangelicals: issues where they offer psudo-rational explanations for paternalism when really the issue is an unjustified 'moral' impulse rooted in personal disgust more than an internally consistent ethical code.

4yrs2l8,,,"First of all, I would like to point out that I'm not the OP. I'm only linking to these pieces here.
Especially, for the second piece I decided to put the link to the infographic in the title and the posting in comments because for me the former gives more opportunity for a critical discussion as it has way more clarity than the text.

I think the text treats the issue you are bringing up in two points:
1. there is the assumption that the acting person/man is not willing to *maybe* rape someone, i.e. he is not willing to do anything that might possibly be rape. I think you are correct that from a philosophical point of view we get in a lot of trouble if we start asking if we can take anything regarding our actions for granted.
2. This quote:
&gt; Saying that consent is not 100% is not the same as saying you, personally, have no agency or ability to consent; whatever your circumstances, you make the best-seeming possible choice at the time

It seems to me that we can approach the problem from this point. 
“consent is not (never) 100%” transforms the degree of consent into a quantity. In my opinion we can not perform this transformation, but there is a lot of room for philosophical debate, again.
But I think we can be quite sure now that “consent” is used with two different meanings here. The first one being derived from the way society treats people (that is the aggregation of a lot of cases) and the second one being the result of our own personal ability to consent (that can never be absolutely reliably communicated).

Both have limitations and they are often nearly bound to end up in ideals (which one might, from a philosophical point of view, call stupid). I personally think OP understands this, as may be indicated in the two points I brought up and in the infographic as well. The latter, it seems to me, paints a quite absurd picture.


Additionally, I would like to add that your examples might not really fit in. If a daughter asks a father for money it is very likely that the father is the one having power over the daughter and not the other way around.

There's a difference between calling a man a known rapist based on prejudice, and saying you're not absolutely sure he isn't based on being careful. One is sexist, the other isn't.

What's your alternative solution? How can women solve the dilemma of knowing that few men are rapists, but you can't tell by looking at them?

No, it's not relevant at all. It isn't wrong for someone to say that most muggers are African American because they'd then be missing Mexican/Asian/white mugging threats. It's wrong because MOST African Americans are not muggers, and arguing that it is appropriate to see all of them as potential muggers is a bad argument.

The EXACT same reasoning applies to Schrodinger's rapist. The fact is, even though almost all rapists are men, that still MOST men are not rapists!

And no, I'm NOT saying that women should stop feeling subjective fears, because I recognize that's not in your control most of the time. However, it IS in your control to not make arguments that are clearly faulty and promote the type of logical mistakes that lead to racist thinking.

Like I said, there are plenty of other arguments you can make to justify concern about sexual abuse that DON'T make this mistake. So why on Earth do you go out of your way to save this ONE silly argument that is clearly analogous to racist-types of thinking that you'd immediately discard? You're not being reasonable or consistent here.

And how can you say it's a WEAK analogy to racism? It's the EXACT SAME ARGUMENT, just with the variables changed.

And I'm not arguing that women can choose to not be fearful in those situations. What they CAN do, however, is not make blog posts that glorify this silly and irresponsible argument.",0,1327369406,,0,c3jyyko,t3_onnem,13.0,t1_c3jq0xc,60046,1428228187,1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,,,,0

HertzaHaeon,,,"The argument made here is that racism is wrong, but the reality is that people are colored by it and any realistic approach takes this into consideration. That's why people's reaction to a big black guy are understandable, even if they're based on racism. The black guy in this example understands it and modifies his behavior a little to ease people's reactions. It's still shitty for him, but so is it for the people he scare. They're probably mostly nice people.

The fact that it's basically only men that women have to worry about is very relevant. If it wasn't, you'd have a point because women would be missing the risk posed by other women. But they're not.

The argument here isn't that all people are something bad. It's the opposite — most people aren't bad. It's just that you can't tell which ones are, and when making decisions about your own comfort and safety, women will choose to act on this insecurity on the one obvious identity they can see. I think that's an understandable choice among shitty options.

You're dimissing this because of a weak analogy to racism. If that's your best argument, it isn't much. What's more, you're appealing to high principles and objectivity for something that doesn't involve those. You're arguing as of women have chosen to be prejudiced against men and can stop it when they want, but in fact it's a forced reaction to an actual threat.

revglenn,,," Dude here. When someone doesn't participate in a lousy behavior, and no one ever talks about the crap they have to deal with, it's pretty easy to be shocked upon suddenly being confronted with something.

On NYE a friend of mine had a bit too much to drink and passed out with her head in my lap on the train home. I've always believed that alcohal doesn't make you behave in a different way as much as it makes you behave like who you really are. There were of course many a drunk on the train that night and a few assholes decided to try and mess with her, trying to poke, prod, wake her up and 2 guys tried to grope. Stern words, looks and a couple well placed shoves kept anyone from actually touching her, but I was amazed, AMAZED, that people would actually behave that way. Especially in public with someone there with her. I remember reading something on reddit recently about how rapist, and other sexually aggressive people think that everyone is like them. It makes me wonder if they thought that I was going to be like ""Sure! Have a grope! She'll never know!"". 

I guess that's the shit that goes on pretty regularly, that no one involved wants to talk about. People should talk about it more though. It's really hard for those of us who are not that way to know when someone else is going to be that way. I feel like I got to see a glimpse of a really ugly part of humanity that night. It was pretty shocking, and it shouldn't be. People in a given situation who are capable of action, be it telling someone to knock it off, keeping someone who is vulnerable company, calling the cops, whatever it may be should know more about this dark undercurrent of the world. Because if we don't understand the problem it's really hard to be part of the solution.

c0mputar,,,"I think it has a lot to do with how people are raised by their parents. When you do something stupid growing up, who gets blamed? You.

People have a hard time dividing self-caused pain apart from pain that is caused by others, when attributing blame.

Unless it's clear self-defense or temporary insanity caused by being victimized in some way, there is probably no clear case where someone should be blamed for being hurt by others (in my opinion). I'm sure some hypothetical obscure example may be found, but I haven't thought of one yet.

With respect to domestic abuse, the number one cause of domestic abuse is actually domestic abuse. The end result of an instance of abuse, and who the perpetrator is, dictates whether or not the police get involved.

Rhianna did not deserve to get attacked, but, as members of the public, we still have no idea why Chris attacked her... but there was a reason, no matter how shallow or deluded it may be. So when people look at the incident, they have to think that there may have been a good reason (to them), if they have the perpetrator's interests at heart. So once they are able to come up with a scenario that the attack was possibly retribution, they can attribute blame to the victim (Rhianna) in the same way their parents attributed blame to them when they fell off a tree or called someone fat (and got hit for it).

It would be far easier to make the point with regards to victim blaming if you make that distinction...

syrinkitty,,,"&gt;I still can't shake the notion that Pinkie isn't just singing about scary monsters...

But she is. You're over-thinking it. Sometimes scary monsters are just scary monsters, and not a clear allegory to rape and abuse. And even if you aren't, the point is that you don't have to let fear control your actions - and laugh at them, because they can't hurt you - not that you should serenade your attacker with kindness.

&gt;Are we supposed to accept that he's completely oblivious to Applejack's suffering?

He was probably lying down, and Applejack would refuse to let him get up, telling him only that it was ""going well"" and she could ""easily handle it."" What's more in line with Applejack's character: being too proud to admit she's in over her head, or letting people push her around? The former seems more likely, especially given the context of the episode.

&gt;Good girls smile and work hard; bad girls are crazy and should be shunned.

But then there's the Luna episode, where Luna is portrayed as a ""bad girl."" People misinterpret her motivations, pre-judge her, and she feels rejected. Twilight helps her and the other ponies overcome those prejudices.

The main six are hardly princesses, either. They make mistakes all the time, and sometimes even lose their minds from the stress (Party of One, Applebuck Season, Lesson Zero, Sonic Rainbow, etc) and have to be reigned in by their friends. If they were 100% perfect all of the time, you might have a point. ",0,1325801149,,0,c3eamxg,t3_o2wat,6.0,t1_c3eaae3,1974,1428129906,5,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1312644326.0,t2_5mlk8,,1.0,0

I generally conceive of grossness, weepiness, and creepiness as traits that belong to people, not monsters. And, the line: ""If he thinks he's scary than he's got another thing coming and the very idea of such a thing just...""
This seems like it could only make sense in the context of an interpersonal relationship. And, like, why should the monsters be defeated through pure positivity, rather than cautious understanding, and loving support with good communication? I know I'm harping on this incident, but it really stuck out, just because of the severity of what it might mean. Even if there's a 90% chance that I'm wrong, that's still a 10% chance that MLP is telling girls to win over their attackers with kindness. (How many young viewers actually live with their assailants?)
 
I'm also not so eager to forgive Applejack's brother... I dunno. Part of it might be that the main characters are all girls, so the girls will be the ones who step up and help. But, the brother didn't notice, and he didn't respond. Don't they live together? Are we supposed to accept that he's completely oblivious to Applejack's suffering? I may be wrong, but I don't recall him apologizing either.

I agree that the two stupid pony boys weren't behaving lustfully. It still seems to support a theme of ""don't pay attention to boastful, narcissistic bitches."" And that's an attitude towards femininity that lets ""good"" girls dismiss the mental issues of ""bad"" girls. And that, I guess, is the underlying moral message that bothers me about shows where being a ""princess"" is celebrated: Good girls smile and work hard; bad girls are crazy and should be shunned.

I totally admit that I may be applying personal situations to a kid's show inappropriately; but this is a theme that has a long tradition in media. Although I admit my sensitivity in this issue: One of my female friends has been using this sort of attitude against a friend with severe issues, and that's way more important to me and less important to y'all than a discussion about a dang kids' show. X-P 

Man, sorry for being a bitchy ole man. I totally agree that this is by far the best show for girls that I've seen, and I'm totally thrilled that the characters are not weak or one-dimensional.

Silencing men who want to express outrage over male genital mutilation is in a way exercising a type of privileged access to discourse about genital mutilation simply because support for male genital mutilation is tolerated or supported in America, and FGM is rightly regarded as horrific.

http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/04/12/faq-why-are-you-concentrating-on-x-when-y-is-so-much-more-important/

It is not the fault of feminism that not all feminists concentrate all their time on every single thing that happens to every individual who happens to be a black woman.  The purpose of feminism is to struggle for gender equality and against patriarchal subordination of women generally, it isn't to direct media attention towards every indignity any woman suffered anywhere.  

Unfortunately most voices in contemporary feminism have fallen so far away from the original focus on dismantling patriarchal power structures, to the less scary to the political mainstream focus of celebrating identity politics, that even suggesting this is likely to be slammed as now unfeminist or racist or otherwise reactionary.

There are those within the community that are ignorant and oblivious of the plight of african american women, and there are those who are racist I am sure. In a group this large there are bound to be people who are like this, however a movement waving a banner of ""equal rights for all"" would look pretty hypocritical if those waving it couldn't easily be convinced of the people they are marginalizing.

PopeNimrod,,,"It seems a little unfortunate that the blame here is going to ""comics"" and ""comic artists"" and not the two companies directly responsible. DC and Marvel don't and never have cared about cultivating a readership outside of young boys, which is how both companies can be constantly losing money despite owning some of the most valuable property rights in the world. 

If people are only familiar with comic books through these companies, I hope they will at least give the medium another chance by looking into indie comic artists like Allison Bechdel, Craig Thompson, Chris Ware, or Marjane Satrapi, whose works often present gender themes in much more responsible ways.

justaverage,,,"Yes. 

Let's take a look at minimum wage. Let's say a state has a minimum wage set at $8 per hour. Let's say that state decides, based on the cost of living, that minimum wage should be increased to $8.60 per hour. Great for people who make minimum wage. They just received a 7.5% wage increase (I remember the last time I got such a hefty raise, it was nearly 5 years ago now...).

Obviously, all of those people who are working minimum wage jobs are now costing their employers 7.5% more. To recoup these losses, costs go up.

While all of this is going on, let's take a look at someone who is earning $15 per hour in the same state. Do you think they are going to get a 7.5% 'cost of living' increase? Hell no they aren't. In a good year, companies will give a cost of living increase of 2-3%, and in recent economic times, it isn't uncommon to see no cost of living increase. This person just saw their 'real wages' fall.

While all of this is going on, the owner of the company gives them self a nice bonus, netting 20% more than they did last year, their pay goes from $100,000 to $120,000. The increase reflects more than what their lowest paid worker earns in a year, and about 75% of what their 'average' $15/hour employee is earning in a year.

HertzaHaeon,,,"I think you have a very blck and white view of people, kind of a George Bush logic of with-us-or-against-us. People aren't that simplistic. There is a distinction between being a hater of women (which is what misogyny is) and having old-fashioned ideas.

You don't have to like Dawkins, but this absolute dismissal of him and everything he's done is very much like how anti-feminists dismiss feminists by digging up some controversial statement. If you've been around here you know how it works — mention any feminist blogger, for example, and you'll get links to some post they've made that can be interpreted as hateful of men, trans people or some such. And boom, everything they ever say can be easily dismissed.

Evangelical atheism is obnoxius to those who pefer status quo, who think religious people deserve automatic respect, or those who have never suffered under religion or superstition. After millenia of religious dominance, *any* criticism will easily be seen as angry, militant or ""evangelical"".

I've met very few atheists who think all religous people are evil and that all religion is evil. That's just prejudiced. 

We don't have to promote religion. We don't have to respect it, only tolerate it. You can be as religious you want, or support them, but in a society with religious freedom I should be able to be completely free from anything religious.

I'd like to compare this to sexism. A lot of sexist people aren't evil. Many of them are decent. In fact, they find meaning and solace in rigid, conservative norms and roles. You evangelical feminists are so obnoxious with your preachy ways. Attacking people's dearest ideas of how society should be arranged isn't the way to do it — it only makes them more insular.

I'd like to see the science that shows there's a one-way correlation between wealth and secularism. It's perfectly plausible that secularism promotes wealth as well. We have plenty of deconversions and success stories to justify our outreach. But regardless of that, our fight isn't just about affecting religious people, it's about ourselves, our freedoms and our community. Not everything we do is about deconverting those pesky religious people. That's just another prejudice.

By contrasting it with the elevator story, he is not playing down the reality of rape in the US. Maybe the guy shouldn’t politely try his luck, because it evokes the fear of rape?

Is it that the elevator story is not petty in comparison? I mean, it is. So, is it that by downplaying her confrontation, it disregards the reality of creepballs?

Even when it comes to his expertise, Dawkins is an idiot. Evangelical atheism is obnoxious, just like evangelical anything. To think that religion is the most evil thing in the world is plainly to have your head up your ass. There are obviously decent religious people and indecent ones. We have to identify what kinds of religion are good and how to encourage and promote those. Attacking people's faith in God isn't the way to do it - that only makes them more insular.

If the rates of suicide (and the chance of death, and the percentage that use guns/hanging/ect) were all equal between men and women, then we can conclude that suicide is likely caused by factors that equally affect men and women.  If the suicide rates are different (as they are), then we can conclude that the factors that affect suicide in women and men are either different or affect either sex differently.

On topic: *Triggers* exist for most any traumatic experience.  There is a constant problem in moral and ethical behavior of how we conduct ourselves to not cause harm to others.  Some problems are simple to solve (no physically touching others who don't want to be touched).  Other problems are more complex (what about when our sounds hurt people).  

I still remember the first day of one of my sociology classes, when the professor stood up and announced that if you ever felt like you couldn't take stand being in the class, to just leave the class or to skip that day, but come talk to him.  The reason being, it was a class on child abuse and some of the things we studied there deeply affected even the people who had not history of abuse.  No other class have I ever heard the teacher actively encourage people to walk out if they felt like they couldn't handle it.

Of course, I think there is a major difference between dealing with a group of people who are trying to determine the correct limits to place on their actions because it may trigger some people and dealing with a group of people who don't believe in triggering.

The latter is a problem we have been dealing with in many other realms, people who ignore evidence for evolution or ignore evidence of homosexuality being natural.  And honestly, there isn't really a good solution to dealing with people who ignore evidence that doesn't fit their worldview.

On some level though, it is ironic that some atheist are now on the same side as creationist and homophobes.

Feuilly,,,"I'm sorry, I assumed that this wasn't about men's suicide at all because it was posted in /r/feminisms, not /r/feminism.

&gt; ""More females attempt suicide than males. (3 female attempts for each male attempt.) ""

&gt; The data is from the US, and considering that women don't outnumber men 3:1, I would conclude that a higher percentage of women attempt suicide.

It's certainly possible and probable given the information in the fact sheet about the teenaged girls. However that specific information on the site doesn't lead to that conclusion. 3x as many female attempts as male attempts doesn't mean that 3x as many women attempted as men. There are lots of possible situations that could lead to that data, because the data is not very good. It could mean that the same number of men attempt and fail to commit suicide, but women try it 3x as much. It could mean that men and women attempt it the same amount, but 3x as many women are suicidal. It could also mean that more men are suicidal, but women who are suicidal try it much more than 3x. All of these things could result in the 3 times as many female attempts, unfortunately, and I think they're pretty substantially different from each other, don't you?

&gt; I assume from your assumption that women's attempts of suicide being common knowledge that you work in or have a personal interest in a field related to the science of behavior.

It was covered in middle and high school. It's also covered in all sorts of news outlets whenever there's a big to-do about suicide which is unfortunately much more regular nowadays with all of the focus on LGBT youth.

&gt; Suicide is not a simple nor clear marker of societal oppression

I think we can all agree that no one thing is a clear marker of societal oppression. If there was I probably would not want to live in that society because I imagine it'd be pretty shit all around.

&gt; The purpose of posting this link, at least in my intentions, was to highlight that suicide is more complicated than it is often made out to be, I think quite opposite to what you say irks you about it.

I almost always prefer the data in a much more vanilla form that allows me to make my own comparisons. It allows much more powerful analysis of the situation, and I don't like studies citing studies citing studies and having to wade in to find the original data. Often you lose meaning, as happened here, since this isn't actually talking about suicide attempts, but instead failed suicide attempts only.

It's quite possible in this case that there is no good data, and that people are just repeatedly mentioning the same study cited in the WHO report because there is nothing better. In cases like that I'd sometimes wish that there was no data at all, so that some organization with deeper pockets than me was forced to collect it, so that we could act and discuss based on solid information.",0,1328852196,,0,c3pqe36,t3_phd3l,5.0,t1_c3pp4fl,7544,1435740665,0,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1247633936.0,t2_3jrhw,,,0
Feuilly,,,"It is not the same for two reasons. Firstly, you can only kill yourself once, so it is innately indicative of the number of people who did it, and not necessarily how frequently they did it (because they can only die once, as mentioned above). Secondly, they have the actual numbers on suicides in the fact sheet, so you can easily fill in the missing details.

10.95 suicides per 100,000 people

79% of those are men, 21% of those are women. That means ~ 8.65 men and ~2.3 women per 100,000 people.

We don't get nearly that information with the non-fatal attempts. We don't get the number of acts per 100,000 people, and we don't get the number of people per 100,000 people, either (the two are not the same in this case, because people can have multiple non-fatal attempts).",0,1328849730,,0,c3ppzvs,t3_phd3l,5.0,t1_c3pp30o,5304,1428327625,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1247633936.0,t2_3jrhw,,,0
Feuilly,,,"&gt; That is what is delivered. Of attempted suicides, 75% are by women and 25% are by men.

Please actually read what I am saying instead of just parroting the same nonsense over and over again.

If I say I am interested in the number of women who attempt suicide, then that means that I don't want individual women who attempt it twice to be counted twice. What you are doing is counting individuals who attempt it multiple times as being multiple people.

If you count the number of visits to the hospital for suicidal behaviour, then it should count a person once even if they go to the hospital twice. Do you understand how that is different?

One is a potential issue of the repetition of suicide attempts of women, and the other is an issue of the prevalence of suicide attempts among women.

&gt; Now you are adding as an additional request to factor in ""successful"" suicides, which as mentioned earlier, is irrelevant to your original request of comparing attempted suicides. 

Actually, the word 'attempt' automatically includes both failed attempts and successful attempts. That's why the actual WHO report mentions non-fatal suicide behaviour to distinguish between attempts that result in suicide, and attempts that do not.

&gt; The goalposts keep moving and we really do not need your condescension, either. A rate to percentage conversion was provided without denigrating your understanding of maths.

The goalposts haven't moved. They're the same as at the very start, and you simply keep providing the same information over and over again without actually understanding it.

Incidentally, the percentage of suicide attempts by men versus women is not really a comparison of the actual number of suicide attempts of men versus women.",0,1328849272,,0,c3ppx7l,t3_phd3l,9.0,t1_c3powid,5864,1428327586,5,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1247633936.0,t2_3jrhw,,,0

Don't get me wrong; patriarchy is a major problem in religion. However, to outright say that all religion is this way is naive and unfounded.

JulianMorrison,,,"&gt;Is it sexist to tell someone they're attractive

I think, mostly, yes. (Assuming you mean ""use this as a conversation opener"", not ""compliment the efforts of your girlfriend"".)

Society puts huge pressure on women to be attractive, forces them to pour constant work into it. If they succeed, it uses their attractiveness to take away their agency. But what use is beauty to a woman? Tell a woman who is beautiful and knows it, that she is beautiful, and she will feel like you just told her that grass is green. Yes, thanks, already knew that. You may be amazed. She is not. (And if you use beauty praise as a way to butter up an insecure woman, then you suck.)

&gt; Why else would you be showing it off

Edit: I don't venture past touching my closest of co-workers on their shoulder and a hug when it's clearly appropriate. A big part of unwanted physical contact, for me, is also what they are subconsciously queuing you to do. From men, I often feel like touches were to toughen me up: rough backhanded pats on the chest or over enveloping and suffocating side hugs. From women, I received a plethora of touches suggesting I back the fuck off. These things are being presented alongside the more routine sexualized contact which sends me into a spiral of self-doubt and rage. Hating all of these, I typically just bow out of physical contact.

Oddly enough, when I used to present as a gay man everyone (seemingly) **loved** my physical contact and would grope *me* inappropriately all the time.

The worst is that I was recently in a situation where I felt like I couldn't speak out at all, because the person giving me unwelcome touching was a friend of mine, and a lesbian trans-woman. I worried that I was being homophobic and transphobic, and I worried about expressing my apprehensions to anyone for fear of coming off as a jerk. She would often pull me in to sit on her lap and hold me there even when I would make it clear that I didn't want to be there. She also frequently kissed me on the cheek and hold my face close to hers, in an extremely intimate way. She did that with many girls, and I felt awful because I know that she wanted to feel accepted and not like a pariah (as she had just recently come out). I talked to her once about it but was afraid of coming off like a jerk, so I sugar-coated it a lot. Eventually I did go to an administrator about it, though my complaint was so laced with apology it must have looked very watered-down.

linuxlass,,,"Don't give random people compliments (or make negative comments, either):

* about things they have no control over: their name, anything genetic (eyes, etc)

* about things that it is *possible* they have no control over: their voice, their size/shape, their hair.

* about things that are really none of your business: the book they're reading, the expression on their faces. (positive comments about books, music, and tech are ok, but not compliments per se. I give an example below.)


Don't tell someone they're attractive if they have no reason to care what you think. You're imposing on them, and you're also creating an awkward situation where they have to make a decision about whether to respond politely and possibly swallow their feelings of discomfort, or else respond honestly and feel bad about being rude. It's a no-win situation, and very selfish on the man's part to do this.

If you see a random person who you find attractive, and want to talk to, be polite, and say something of substance and with meaning. ""Excuse me, I couldn't help noticing the interesting pattern on your sweater. Is it hand-knit?"";  ""I'm sorry for interrupting you, but I noticed the book you're reading is one on my own queue. Is it any good? What do you like about it?""

And then pay attention to any body language or other nonverbal cues that the person really doesn't want to talk. Put their interests and comfort above your own. This is what polite and civilized people do.


For people you already know in some way (a co-worker, a neighbor), you don't have to be quite so careful, but still be very careful about what I said above about compliments. In this situation, the woman has very little choice about avoiding you in the future, so don't make her feel like you're a creep and she has to watch out.

INxP,,,"I assume mainly [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor). I.e. that ""raping the enemy"", for example, may have as little to do with literal rape as ""killing time"" has to do with literal murder. (Not a native speaker here, so pardon me if I can't come up with a better comparison.)

Sometimes I hear terms like ""raped"" used figuratively in video games when one side is rendered helpless by another side who is brutally dominating the encounter, especially when there's an element of forceful humiliation involved. Yet there is nothing like a forced (or unenthusiastic, or any other kind) sexual act in any literal way. In some games so-called ""baseraping"", for example, is a quite frowned-upon yet common strategy that involves killing the enemy players as soon as they spawn, leaving them unable to effectively defend themselves, and in the end often feeling very much frustrated, humiliated and even violated. It isn't considered exactly fair play or sportsmanlike, but it ""gets to the goal"", so it's still often the end result of having two unbalanced sides, especially in team-based games where being the good guy effectively just means dropping out of the game and not really helping the opponent in any tangible way.

Best keep in mind though that these are games where the goal is literally *killing other people* -- virtually of course, but generally in as realistic a manner as possible -- so it's not like the ""raping"" is the only or worst atrocity happening, whether literally or figuratively. The goal in these games is *not* to be a civil or a nice guy -- that's what real life is for.

So I can easily see its relevance *as a metaphor*, even if I'd rather avoid the term myself (for reasons that should be pretty clear to anyone reading a thread like this). While I can appreciate the fact that it's a very loaded word that may not be nice to use lightly, I have to admit that I see as a little obtuse anyone who claims they don't see how it can possibly have ""anything to do"" with something that isn't a literal rape, or that the main reason or motivation for using the word in any figurative way must be making light of real rape or rape victims. I don't think the word would be used figuratively at all if it wouldn't immediately raise some very powerful emotional allusions to a very real form of violation that everyone instinctively understands to be wrong and extremely harmful to whoever has to experience it.

(I also assume that any ""trigger warning"" would be pretty moot in a thread titled ""rape"", albeit I think there's a bad pun to be forced in there somewhere when talking about first person shooters. Excuse me, I'm very tired and coming up with the silliest associations.)

wasserperson,,,"Copied over from my response on her post:

As a White, male, straight, upper-middle class US citizen, I completely agree that my experiences on the receiving end of individual and institutional sexism, racism, classism, heterosexism, &amp; other ""isms,"" don't really amount to an overall experience of oppression.  

I also don't think the frame of ""oppressor"" works very well to describe my experience or my role in society, but I do believe that:
1. I operate within a system of oppressive power dynamics that works to privilege me at the expense of people that aren't like me.
2. My actions can support that system or increase that oppressive dynamic regardless of my beliefs or intents.
3. People oppressed by that system should decide for themselves who their oppressors are, and what that word means, and while I hope to be seen as an ally, if I'm not, then I generally have at least as much if not more power to help change that.

In my conversations with other White people, I hear a lot of confusion about the difference between oppression, discrimination, prejudice, &amp; so on.  I think the messiness of vocabulary &amp; the rarity of good dialogue makes for lots of evasive, sloppy thinking.  I think it's uncomfortable to reconcile my internal sense of myself as a good person with the idea that I am complicit in a system of very bad things.  &amp; it's easy to default to a reductionist position of ""I've struggled too, &amp; I've been judged/discriminated/constrained because of my gender/skin color/sexuality too.""

Struggle isn't the same as oppression; racism isn't the same as prejudice; etc.  

I think, personally, the ""oppressor/oppressed"" distinction isn't very useful when looking at the United States, because we're pretty far removed from the kind of feudalism or stark Marxist class boundaries where that term originates.  &amp;, as I understand our history, most of our social progress has come through intersectional alliances, not through stark revolutionary conflicts.  Again, though, that's the view that currently best fits my knowledge, &amp; I don't have a monopoly on logic or information.  Even working just from what I personally know, I can make an intellectual case for the more binary oppressor/oppressed distinctions in the US.  So, just because I don't see the frame as useful doesn't mean no one can, does, or should.  &amp;, honestly, I do think there's a lot of White men in specific, and US people in general, who have trouble saying, ""I don't think that's the best way of looking at _____, but I can see how you might &amp; I respect your choice.""",0,1330404144,,0,c3vqqba,t3_q89lk,1.0,t3_q89lk,42813,1428433399,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1324680273.0,t2_6i2bj,,,0

This was not what I had expected, and when I first started to talk about it to other right-watchers, I got strange looks and a change of topic. As more women got into monitoring the right, the idea became more accepted. It's about time this analysis got major public attention.

She is arguing that insurance be required to provide coverage for contraceptives.  Not that contraceptives be handed out by the government.  Not that they be 100% covered.  But that employers cannot decide to refuse to cover a doctor prescribed medication or procedure based on religious or moral affiliation.  The issue is that Georgetown University, due to its Jesuit affiliation, does not include birth control in the plan they offer.

Insurance is not free, as many Americans who have premiums deducted from their checks and pay steep co-pays can attest to.

The Republicans also need to find a way to counter-balance the Democrats' hispanic support. Disenfranchising and deporting hispanics isn't effective enough: they need a way to get hispanic votes too. Since employment, welfare, or education are all areas where Democrat policies are, broadly speaking, more advantageous to lower-class voters, the Republicans are left with religious motivation. That means they have to court the RCC, without upsetting the core right-protestant support base.

MissCherryPi,,,"&gt;Women who are not committed to the relationship or who have issues with marriage may be less likely to change their names. 

It's correlated with having established a career. Women with an established career are more likely to make enough money to not need anyone else to support them. So if the marriage goes bad, they can leave. Women who don't change their names (correlated with women who don't make a lot of money) are just as likely to have bad marriages, just less likely to file for divorce. 

I don't appreciate your extremely personal attacks. Implying that I am a bad wife and that I'm stupid don't mean anything of relevance to this discussion.

HiMaintenanceLoClass,,,"Two comments:

If he is going to take a feminist stance, he could start by not referring to Sandra Fluke as a ""college girl."" Would he call a 30 year old male student at Georgetown law school a ""college boy""?

Also, regarding number 5 (We were told that society owed us a hot girl), I think it would be worthwhile to consider that almost all movies with female protagonists guarantee them a guy (though not necessarily a hot one) at the end. Yet somehow women don't feel entitled to sex from men (at least the author doesn't mention that). Rather than creating a sense of entitlement in women, these representations tend to create a sense of distress around the idea that women might not live up to expectations by ending up with a husband. I guess my point is that these heteronormative representations of romance aren't just teaching men that they deserve women, they are teaching everyone that we belong in a (hetero)sexual relationship, and if we don't end up in one, there is something wrong with us. Perhaps, as the author suggests, men are more likely to react violently to this feeling of inadequacy.

reallyreallyanon,,,"Sorry in advance how absurdly long this is.

Okay. In that case I guess there are two parts to the reply, one saying why some may consider it justified to break the law, and another to say why this may be justified in an ongoing manner even if the law is not changed. I will also add (and explain in more detail later) that I do recognise that this leads, at best, to murky waters ethically speaking. I will also add that arguing that this is an understandable position does not mean that I support it, but just that I could not completely condemn someone for doing it in an absolute manner.

So firstly, why would I claim that breaking the law could be justified? I imagine you could/have guessed where I am going with this - whether or not something causes harm, how much it causes, what should be done about this and whether it is acceptable are all sliding scales. Certainly, if advertising causes someone to feel so badly about themselves that they develop an eating disorder, it is quite clearly physically harming them. No individual advert will be the sole cause for this, but if all advertising promoting image as being excessively important (obviously subjective, but you can broadly imagine the advertising that would fall under this banner) were removed, cases of eating disorders would certainly decrease. The number that would have to be not put up to stop one case is again not something that you or I can specify, but if someone feels that they are helping to stop the great harm that an eating disorder can cause, then they are using a similar justification (albeit at the other end of the grey scale) as you would to break the law to save someone's life by damaging property. I imagine you might also risk damaging a fence to jump over it if it looked like a young child may break an harm. You might push past someone slightly, thus risking catching and tearing their clothes (their private property), to help someone up who had fallen over, even if it was clear that they were not severely damaged. All of these slide down a grey scale, with an infinite number of possible cases in between. I certainly wouldn't want to say, for certain, at what point on this scale it becomes okay on anything but a case by case basis.

Essentially, I am trying to show that this person viewed damaging this property in a similar light as you would view tearing down a wall to save someone's life - justified, despite being illegal. This doesn't mean that I think you should agree, or that the two actions are equivalent, but merely on the same sliding scale, so that you may perhaps understand them.

Now common etiquette says that you will not get sued or arrested etc, for catching someone's clothes when you brush past them to help someone else,  and it if there was a spate of such legal action, the law would probably be changed to allow for this. Similarly, if my friend believes that these adverts are harmful, she could lobby her council, local Member of Parliament, or the company hosting them. Whilst I think that these routes would certainly be good to pursue, as someone who is highly politically active, I can assure you that she is aware of these options, and knowing her political feelings, I would safely say that she has tried similar actions before and felt, in a general, broad manner, that the govt is corrupt and wouldn't trust them to make any sort of moral judgement - to be specific, she is an anarchist. I am aware that the consequences of this certainly could be, for example, used to justify a revolution to try and take dictatorial control of the country, in a highly unethical and undemocratic means. I agree that this is a justified concern, and to address it fully would, I imagine, go in to quite a lot of political/philosophical detail. To give a brief overview of why it may be justified though, I will first point out that many countries have semblance of democracy, and without acting outside the confines of the law and changing the law by force, no democracy is likely to develop. If one does not even have freedom of speech, it is difficult to hold the discussions that could lead to it being implemented without risking arrest, for example. Similarly, if one believes our govt is corrupt, then it may well be the height of stupidity to try and change it by corrupted legal means. Though this is a belief you may dismiss, if you go across to r/anarchism or any number of other subreddits I am sure you will find people who will argue this point a lot better than I (the point of the govt being corrupt). Many things leaked in the Wikileaks saga, for instance, will testify to the fact that the British govt has lied, directly, to it's people, for subversive and immoral means. This does, without doubt, leave one in a very difficult situation - I have claimed that people acting outside the law can be justified, and as such I would find it difficult to deny someone else the right to act outside the law when I disagree with them. For this reason I would come to the point of view that it is largely (perhaps always) best to act within the law, but that it can be justified not to, and that these cases should be looked on individually, and my young, optimistic side hopes that people in general will act in a way that is morally good (whatever that means).

tl;dr - My friend was acting further along the grey scale of preventing harm than you would be happy to illegally, but you are still on that scale. She didn't trust govt to be honest enough to change the law, and I find this hard to argue against, thought it leads to a morally sticky situation.",0,1333551065,,0,c48dwtl,t3_rr1vo,10.0,t1_c48d24l,4864,1428653955,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1320021824.0,t2_65azm,,,1

&gt;This you know how? 

Well, I don't get called a slut, I get high-fives. I've never been told ""Dick or GTFO"". Hearing back from job interviews never hinges on how attractive I am. My acceptance into an orchestra is not rejected outright, (but will be shortcoming as soon as they hear me play). Lawmakers are not trying to control my sexual organs. Medical insurance pays for viagra, if I would ever need it. I can be pope, if I ever become religious &amp; catholic. I have 10% the chance of being raped than a female, and about 1% of the chance of being forcibly raped. If a girl whistles at me in the street, I can take that as a compliment because it is different from the default, as opposed to a reinforcement of my objectification. The ideal image for a man is based on what men like to see in themselves. . . not what women would like to see in men. If I ever participate in a LARP, I can be sure that no one will say that ""Are you sure a girl like you can handle all that heavy armour?"". I'm not scared off from studying Engineering, Math, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, by well-meaning teachers, recruiters, friends, family, or other. No one ever suspects that my effortless 4.0 GPA is because I can suck a cock really well. If I ever want to just cuddle, I can, in fact, just cuddle. When I say no, in any form, it is understood as 'yes' 10x less often. If I go to a gym, almost all of the training is based around a male body and male hormones. If I go to a bikeshop, I can reasonably expect to have been taught how to use a wrench, and for people to expect me to know how to use a wrench. If I play D&amp;D, people don't grab the book from me and look up stuff for me. If I play boardgames, no one is surprised that when a male wins.

Vulgarity itself I don't have a problem with; TAA's tone  is just as irritating as possible.  I think this discourages people who might not agree with his message from listening to it.  Without dissenting opinions, no intellectually significant discussion occurs.  Nobody grows as a person.

He describes the women he's discussing as mindless, cackling cunts before he even addresses what they're talking about. He then suggest that because he hasn't seen feminists object to the discussion that took place the entire movement is bankrupt.  Hyperbolic statements are appealing  to some, repellent to others, and rarely invite reasonable discussion.  

I wasn't trying to suggest you were picking on anybody, but if you're actually interested in the opinions of feminists, you may want to write out a post that conveys the same ideas as TAA's video in 30 seconds of reading as his 6.5 minute video does.

SovTempest,,,"Exactly. Cultural conditioning and the way we automate and accept certain behaviours can mean we're exhibiting harmful actions without being aware that would shock us if we really understood their context or impact. It's about trying to be really patient and critical in examining your own perspectives, and trying not to feel outright attacked when someone has a strong reaction to a way we feel entitled to act.

I was having a discussion with a gay friend in the past about how I'd been completely oblivious to being hit on by another man. She concluded by saying ""maybe you just always assume people are straight."" It was uncomfortable to hear that, but I thought about it for a while. I realized she was right and that I more or less would assume somebody was straight by default until they clearly proved otherwise. Even if this was statistically safe, it can be as oppressive to an individual as any 'statistical' on how somebody should be or should act. I've tried from that moment on to not assume either way with somebody until it's made clear, not to rely on a default assumption. Besides, if you're trying to hit on somebody and they're completely oblivious, it feels like shit. So now since I'm asking the question, I'm better able to realize when someone's doing it to me and send clearer signals in the situation.

My favorite part is when you qualify yourself as an editor. If you read the piece, you may have noticed that it is a personal blog. That means that the author probably does not have the services provided by an editor. Logically, if you are an editor, you provide the service of correcting grammar errors and criticizing pieces of writing. That means the individuals who compensate you make grammar errors. Does that mean that they ""can't write""? It seems that you (""as an editor"") are invested in spending a lot of time reading 'drivel,' perhaps a re-evaluation of your own life is in order.

I could follow your logic further. If authors make mistakes, and editors catch mistakes, and only pieces with error-free prose are legitimate writing, then only authors that can afford to compensate an editor are actually writers. That's outrageously classist, congratulations.

&gt;If there is a family that has withstood the test of time, it is the Judds. From the early days of Naomi and Wynonna’s country duo to the individual work of Wynonna and younger sister Ashley, their name has spanned three decades. Even with the success of chart-topping songs and blockbuster films, much of what has been discussed in the course of their careers is body image. Ashley Judd recently (wonderfully) countered People Magazine’s speculations over her appearance due to possible surgery she underwent by calling out the misogyny and image-harm done to all women through such obtrusive and uninformed reportage. Let’s be clear; the point is not whether these publications are false or true in their reporting. We have a problem when any woman needs to defend her appearance for any reason and is forced into a lose-lose situation when told she is either lying about altering her appearance or condemned for admitting to having work done. Sadly, much of this shaming is being done by gay men and fellow women.

&gt;This culture of shame starts at a specific focal point of anatomy. The internet is rife with examples of commentary and memes– linking to what I think is the most respectful discussion of this situation– of how gay men perceive women’s sexual organs, mostly as something repulsive–often a squidlike sea creature.  I’ve seen this posted multiple times on Facebook; fastest way to be defriended if that’s your goal. This is the most literal definition of misogyny, communicating widespread disgust and fear over female reproductive organs.

&gt;I’ve never understood what value it has for someone to be disgusted by something he claims to not even been interested in, so the frequency with which negative language is used by gay men toward ladyparts and how often other women validate these claims for their gay friends by conflating disinterest with disgust is alarming. The clear issue is that these comments are borne out of a lack of education on sexuality, especially female sexuality; the focus is on external appearance, yet discussions are almost exclusively label the whole of female anatomy “the vagina,” an internal structure. There is a complete disassociation of how the whole, very natural system operates. Regardless of the amount of time one has spent in a biology classroom, the important thing for gay men to understand is when they make attacks on women’s genitals, they are making attacks on women.

&gt;So it goes with commentary on the rest of the body, from which men are often protected. Yes, gay men do experience and self-perpetuate body fascism, which ultimately is another response that validates misogyny: building up one’s body to be as manly as possible to avoid any resemblance to femininity. A misogynistic culture that elevates strong male bodies must also denigrate strong female bodies, so constantly questioning women’s bodies–for shape, slenderness, artificiality or any other bullshit reason you want to come up with–has become de rigueur in our society. The Perez Hiltons, D-Listeds and newsstand gossip rags of the world take this very framework, apply it to the most visible women–celebrities–and sit back to let the chaos of body negativity unfold.

&gt;As the broadest consumers of these publications, television shows and more, women and gay men need to question the dialogue taking place for any change to occur. Educating ourselves on our bodies or those of our female friends’ is step one, followed by actively sharing our knowledge with others. When you see friends sharing body-negative articles, memes or videos, call them out on it; help them question their assumptions. Additionally, you can start sharing more body-positive stories by word of mouth, articles you have read or images that strike you. Body positivity is body power, so a sea-change in the type of dialogue we use when discussing ours and others’ bodies can make a big impact

ktoth04,,,"I'm aware of my oversimplication of feminism as a whole, and curious how you would define the movement if not one for equality?

For the viewpoint battle, I understand how girl can be used offensively, but, yes, I admit, I cannot fathom how the mere phrase ""Good Girl Gina"" can be offensively construed on it's own. 

I think what it comes down to is letting the word own you versus owning the word. We were all girls at one point (based on anyone's definition of young female). Being offended by the phrase ""Good Girl Gina"" alone is the same as being offended by girl. Would we be ashamed if the phrase was ""Happy Human"" instead of ""Good Girl""?  Being human, and being girls, is to me, something we undeniably are (because I align the word girl and the word woman closely). It's part of our identity. I would rather own the word than have it own me.

So what it comes down to is, yes, I guess, I cannot see the problem with the ""Good Girl Gina"" meme. I see the problem with the way it is often used (eg ""On her period, BJ week"" or ""Sees me playing games, Makes me a Sammich""), but not with it's inherent existence.

So if I have this right, your argument is then that the phrase ""Good Girl Gina"" is inherently misogynistic because she is old enough to be outside some women's interpretation of ""young woman"" and should be referred to as a woman instead of a girl. Because of this, we should all find it offensive because some subset of women do.

And what I've been expressing is that because she fits in my view of ""young women"" the phrase is not necessarily inherently misogynistic. I think what is really important is the usage. The GGG phrase can be used misogynisticly, and it can be used... not (is there a word for non-misogynisticly?).

If I had to simplify your argument down to a line it would be ""I'm offended so everyone should be offended too"". If we let every word describing females become offensive we'll be redefining ourselves until the end of time.",0,1334595630,,0,c4cxo6r,t3_sbwlz,6.0,t1_c4cwupx,3841,1428732953,5,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1207237484.0,t2_34cus,,,1

Ciswomen, as a class, are not privileged.  No, they do not suffer identical oppressions as Transwomen, though there is some overlap between them.  If they want to focus on the portion of the Venn diagram that is colored cis, they should have that right.  Disagree vehemently with them, that's fine.  But I think it is wrong to bar them from free association, or to threaten those who desire such a space with violence or invasion.  

For example, the Freemasons are, by and large, men in a position of great privilege - usually not only that based on sex, but also usually that of class and race.  You might think it is absolutely shitty that no women are allowed to be into the secret circle.  But the solution isn't to bust down the doors of a meeting, or attempt to prevent their landlord from allowing them to use the space.

I also think there's more to FAAB-only space than just excluding ""minorities...on the basis of minority status.""  You treated shared ""lived experience"" as a throwaway comment, but I think that shared experience is the crux of the issue - FAAB only spaces exclude both minorities -and- majorities, to focus on one particular, exclusive subsection of the population.

Now for feminine business casual, well, are we going to go with a silk blouse and a subtle skirt? Going to wear some trim dress pants? How are we going to accessorize? Does the office allow denim or capris? Do we want our colors to be neutral and professional or do we want something that evokes a bright and helpful personality? How about fabrics?

egypturnash,,,"""The conference is open only to ""women born women living as women"".""

Well they get a few points for that at least. The refusal of stuff like Mitchfest to allow transwomen, even as they embrace transmen, has always made my brain hurt. Instead of being all ""we are excluding penises and those who were born with them no matter how femmy they may be, but total brodudes with vaginas are A-OK"" these folks are at least saying ""we want this to be an event wholly free of any taint of masculinity"".

I feel like this is much more honest. And sensible. And you know what? I am perfectly fine with there being events only open to people who were born with vaginas who present as women. I recognize that some people are super freaky about PENIS and that some transwomen are, well, dicks. And that there are certain things you have to work super hard to change about how you behave when you were initially socialized into the other gender. I am a pricklady who has a decent number of cis woman friends, but if they wanted to have a evening hanging out that was specifically about a cisfemme space, I wouldn't feel like they should have to include me.

And ultimately, my reaction is, hey, you want a femme festival that lets transwomen in? START ORGANIZING IT. Schedule it with a decent separation from the penis-fearing festivals so none of your cis friends who do those events are forced to choose.

For example, if we, as feminists, get into the business of telling people what gender they are based on the way society puts people into groups - for example, by excluding male-bodied male-gender-expressive persons from feminist spaces, which are we doing? Are we identifying a cohort for analysis, or are we reinforcing social construction of gender?

What if the bro-y-est bro that ever did bro showed up for a women-only feminist conference and insisted that though he (she?) was of male sex - possessing, in fact, a full beard, that he (she?) was female-identified and had a right to be there.

This is an extreme example, and our first reaction would probably be to exclude him (her?) from the conference.

If we do that, we are (in my eyes) doing both of the things you mention at once. We're differentiating this person from a group of people with similar experiences, because it's very unlikely that this person has had similar gender-based experiences to most women.

But on what are we making that judgment? On external gender indicators, such as the beard, or this person's manner of speaking, or this person's way of carrying themselves through the world. And then we are saying the inverse: Women can't have beards. Women can't speak aggressively. Women can't walk like a muscle-bound buffoon.

valeriekeefe,,,"I'm not entirely sure what you're asking, but I think you are. Neurological sex is likely wired the same way sexual orientation is wired. From http://www.tim-taylor.com/papers/twin_studies/theories.html

&gt;Ellis and Ames (1987) have proposed a very comprehensive gestational neurohormonal theory of human sexual orientation, which deals with the genesis of heterosexuality as well as homosexuality. They propose that sexual orientation is primarily determined by the degree to which the nervous system is exposed to testosterone, estradiol, and to certain other sex hormones while neuro-organization is taking place, predominantly between the middle of the second and the end of the fifth month of gestation. According to this theory, ""complex combinations of genetic, hormonal, neurological, and environmental factors operating prior to birth largely determine what an individual's (adult) sexual orientation will be."" 

This makes a lot of sense, given that one of the chief effects of prophylactic provision of an artificial estrogen during pregnancy, DES, was to increase the prevalence of female identification in CAMAB children (and thus we can reasonably expect, neurology) by a factor of 100 over the current estimated prevalence of social transition of 1 in 300. DES also served to increase gynophillic sexual orientations, (lesbian, bisexual, pansexual) in CAFAB children of mothers who took DES during pregnancy.

Further, trans women are more likely to be attracted to women than cis women are to be attracted to women, by roughly a factor of 10 http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf which makes a great deal of sense, given the correlation of atypically high gestational estrogen counts with both.

Just as people are born hard-wired with a certain sexual orientation, which can be expressed as an attraction to a range of individuals, or sometimes none, neurological sex is the same way. People may well be comfortable with a range of gender presentations, may, just as many people with attractions to more than one sex feel discomfort at being unable to express the full range of those attractions, feel a sense of discomfort at being unable to express their particular gender.

It doesn't argue against self-determination any more than accepting that sexual orientation is largely hard-wired, but heteronormativity and to a lesser extent homonormativity (really need to come up with a less pejorative word for biphobic... one that doesn't erase pansexual, asexual, and other non-binary orientations, but that's for another discussion) is not.

There is a unique process of self-discovery that one has to undergo when rejecting ones Coercively Assigned Sex At Birth, a bit more involved than rejecting the orientation that is presumed with one's CASAB, one must admit, but that doesn't mean someone's sexuality changes... the foundation was always there.

One other kind of interesting fact: It's a lot easier to prophylactically ensure queer orientations and neurological sexes than normative ones. ^^",0,1337673613,,0,c4qwgff,t3_tvswc,4.0,t1_c4qn45e,46446,1428974935,0,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,1330319170.0,t2_711h0,,,1

I'd be happy to answer your question from my perspective. I'm certainly not a feminist academic (I'm an engineer!) so please don’t take this as in any way reflecting what others thing/what reality is.

I believe the definition of patriarchy is a system by which males hold power over females by virtue of their gender. I think we can all agree that this isn’t very egalitarian. Where I see this in my own experience as being problematic includes the following:

- Society treating female sexuality as shameful/harmful

- Society treating motherhood as the expected path, and women who choose not to have kids are somehow flawed

- Society treating biological males as lesser if they express themselves in a non-masculine manner

- Society treating headstrong and assertive males as goal oriented, but women who act the same as flawed/evil/bitches

Note how I say society, and not just males? I think the fact that we do live in a patriarchal society causes many people, regardless of gender to hold these (in my opinion harmful) views. I don’t have all the answers, and I don’t think that snapping our fingers and becoming a matriarchy will somehow be better. I just hope that one day we can move a little bit more towards ending gender based discrimination.

sotonohito,,,"Well, to be fair, there's no doubt that the prosecution and extradition is entirely politically motivated.  INTERPOL doesn't usually track down and seek the extradition of a people accused of rape and sexual misconduct under Sweden's laws.

Assange is a scumbag, and his lawyer admitted in a court in England that he did, in fact, force intercourse on a woman who was crying and trying to avoid being penetrated.  That sounds like rape to me.  And I think Sweden's unusually broad rape laws should be enacted in other nations.

I shed not a single tear for Assange and I hope he rots.

But at the same time I recognize that he never would have been prosecuted, and certainly not with INTERPOL involvement, if he hadn't embarrassed the powerful by exposing their secrets.  If he had any decency or real dedication to the cause Wikileaks theoretically stands for he'd resign his post and disassociate himself from the organization.

I don't think that's what most redditors think, unfortunately; but I do think that's what they'll haul out to justify their misogyny.  I have yet to see many who are willing to admit that what Assange did was actually wrong, they're very much into victim blaming and slut shaming territory.  

&gt;Now I feel like it's a boys' club. Just wondering if I'm alone in this?

Nope.  Reddit has always had that vibe.  I'm male, as it happens, so I only see it secondhand, but it's been there at least since I joined up.

I'm a guy, but even I've heard about menstrual cramps and how bad they can be. From the amount of pain I've heard when people describe them I imagine that it's like being kicked in the nuts, all day long. I also happen to be a union rep, so I know that a lot of women sometimes take time off due to cramps.

I replied pointing out that maybe he had a problem understanding feminine pain and I got dogpiled. I've never seen so many guys who had no idea about menstrual cramps! It was really weird and I almost left Reddit. I found out about SRS though, so stuck around.

And the guy made something amazing (Wikileaks), that's not even up for question. But seems like a lot of young and really vocal redditors tend to think that people are either ""good"" or ""bad"" and just reject the idea that someone can do something really good while also doing something really bad. The guy is pure ego, which is an important quality when leading something, but how is it so difficult to believe a person with that mindset would think his needs are more important than the ones of his partners? Why would people all over the world not take the women's accusations seriously? I understand doubt, I doubted, but what I see is plain rejection of the idea. On the other hand, how many redditors think that violating the requests of some women is not that bad? Gosh! I'm still angry about the posts I read in December of 2010.

sotonohito,,,"&gt;So... the opposite of a safe space? 

Yeah, pretty much.

I suppose it could be argued that we should give them credit for at least trying, but I'm not really inclined to do so.  A lot of gamer culture has misogyny built in, and there are an unfortunate number of (mostly male) gamers who defend that misogyny as essential, necessary, and altogether good.  

See, for example, the dust up when it was suggested that the fighting game community could stand to be less misogynist.  The PA Report has a [good writeup](http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/sexual-harassment-as-ethical-imperative-the-ugly-side-of-fighting-games).

We have there a person explicitly defending the idea that the entire fighting game community is inexorably rooted in racism and sexism, and that to try and get rid of the racism and sexism would be to kill the fighting game community.

I'm a gamer, and there are times that my fellow gamers make me want to bash my head against the wall.

Reddit has a similar demographic and in many ways a similar culture.  It says something that /r/MRA has around 36,000 members, while /r/feminism has a bit less than 8,000.  Yet the MRA's feel threatened by the existence of the feminists to the point where MRA invasions of feminist subreddits are a common occurrence.

I think, in part, it's the fact that some men really get into the idea of boys clubs and feel genuinely threatened by the idea that women exist.

beef_swellington,,,"&gt;I antagonized? What? 

Based on your statement:
&gt;No, I said, I was not. I had [argued in good faith] at first, but they acted like shit. 

The implication is that you were no longer doing so. That's how the statement came across anyway.

&gt;Why should definitions ever be ""so far outside of the accepted lexicon""? I think I consider that a defect of dictionaries. In logic, axioms and definitions (and rules of inference) are everything. As with semantics, logic doesn't turn off. You're being logical or you aren't, you raving pan-like armchair. Your argument is valid or it isn't (therefore you must be a tree, elsewise you're eating a turnip).

What are you even talking about. I linked to a bunch of resources that explained classism in terms that directly contradicted your imagined requirement of conscious intent. This isn't other people ""turning off logic"", this is you ""making shit up and expecting people to accept it"".

&gt;It doesn't matter how wrong I was, it's supposed to be a fucking discussion.

And if you're arguing using entirely different and unaccepted meanings for words, you're not going to have a very productive discussion. You could get banned if you won't shut up about how affirmative action is ""reverse-racism"" too, because that's also meaningless language. There's no discussion to be had when you insist that your unique definition of a previously-defined concept is what everybody should be using now.

CatFiggy,,,"Well, yes. The thing is, first and foremost, that the Brawny Man as a ""character"" of commercials is on a completely different level than the person using the product.

The *vast* majority of the time, it's a woman shown using the detergent/soap/mop/whatever. I actually can't think of one time that it was paper towels and it was a man using it. There was a Resolve commercial recently, and its angle^1 was that cleaning products were terrible and Resolve was enacting a revolution. ""Women all over the world/country are standing up and saying, 'No more!'"" Of course, women are the only ones concerned with the cleaning product. The fact that the narrator says ""women"" rather than ""people"" (or ""homeowners"", ""parents"", etc. ...) goes right over everybody's heads.

So while in all the paper towel commercials it's *women* wiping up messes (often after kids, a dog, a husband, or some combination thereof) with paper towels, and when the paper towel turns out to suck she gets this horrible robbed look on her face. Then the Brawny Man turns up to save the day! These paper towels are *strong* and *hardy* and -- well, we dare say they're darn *brawny*! Like this lumberjack, in his flannel shirt posing in front of a forest!

Not that I expected them to have undergone that entire thought process; just that any thought process concluding in ""the Brawny Man is an example contrary to sexist commercials"" strikes me as ridiculous. (The Brawny Man as a symbol of strength, of course, is also sexist towards men. These commercials are sexist towards everybody. Men don't clean! Men are manly lumberjacks!)

[Google Images search results for ""brawny"".](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1304&amp;bih=706&amp;q=brawny&amp;gbv=2&amp;oq=brawny&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=1&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.509.1210.0.1306.6.4.0.0.0.0.84.201.3.3.0.ekh.1.0.0.bNyoHpPsCWo) The design has since changed to no longer include the forest, for some mysterious reason.

She clearly stated that she was talking to people who *wanted* to be married, and all her points were pretty good. Maybe not universal, but the ""top 10 list"" genre doesn't have to be universally applicable.

I think it's disingenuous for people to interpret her as saying ""all women are crazy, angry, slutty liars"". She's highlighting some real problems. And she's focused on personal issues, not the wider political or social issues.

* you've got psychological issues you need to deal with, not just ignore

* you're overlooking all the perfectly decent guys out there, and instead are looking for traits that don't matter for a long term relationship, so you never find The One

* you get emotionally involved in casual hookups, which clouds your judgement when thinking about whether a guy is long-term material, and so you're wasting time on guys who aren't The One

* you mislead a guy into thinking that you are only interested in a casual relationship, that you're not serious, and so you're wasting time on guys who aren't The One

* you haven't learned how to be a partner, and aren't learning how

* you don't believe in your own self-worth

What's wrong with this list? So it's not exhaustive, and it doesn't address the larger problems about gender roles, etc. I don't know if her book continues in this vein, but for an article, this list is pretty perceptive.

That said, the Jezebel article raises some good points, but notice that they are mostly big-picture kinds of points, and also about half of the points are addressing people who aren't *interested* in getting married (a group of people which are explicitly excluded from McMillian's audience).

Notice that this list overlaps a bit with McMillian's list:

* you have psychological issues

* you have higher standards (this point is more pessimistic than McMillian's implication that if you had higher standards you would have met The One by now)

* You have lots of casual relationships (this point is discussed coming from the opposite angle - that you're ok with only having casual relationships.

dada_,,,"&gt; But to stop every pre-pubescent male from spouting sexist comments on Xbox Live? That is a nigh impossible task without imposing some extremely draconian and nasty laws, which I would naturally oppose.

It really isn't that difficult, and it has certainly been done before on other networks, simply by having stronger rules to combat harassment. You don't have to ban people right away, but giving them warnings and banning them for a week when they reach a certain amount of warnings sounds like a good system.

Telling someone she's a slut or a whore or that she should go get raped by her boyfriend really isn't some nobel thing to do that ought to be protected. It's hate speech. It's something we ought to fight against the same way we'd fight against people making racist comments. If someone tells a Jew to go die in a gas chamber, or a black guy that he's a dirty nigger, that would certainly be grounds for a ban. Why not give hate speech directed against women the same treatment?

Private institutions do not have to abide by an impossible standard of ""freedom of speech"". They really don't have to take part in this sort of thing.

Duckylicious,,,"In the eating disorder recovery sphere, ""triggers"" are used too, albeit in a somewhat different meaning than the OC explained.

Naming specific weights is generally considered one of them (and is therefore usually banned on pro-recovery oriented forums).

It may sound ridiculous, especially if we're talking about abuse victims and PTSD, but at the core of it it makes sense - to use some clearly fictitious numbers, let's say I'm 2' and weigh 100 pounds, and am struggling with bulimia and I think I'm fat. My therapist is working on convincing me that I'm actually a healthy weight on the Breeblebox index and should instead focus on being healthy. I'm about to buy it, then I see a post by someone who's 3' and weighs 80 pounds, complaining how *they're* uber fat. I realize I must be gargantuan in comparison and resolve to not eat for the next three days. Hence, trigger warning.

Of course, outside of an eating disorder recovery community, it isn't entirely realistic to expect people to think ""trigger"" when talking about their height, weight, or the fact that they've lost/gained XY pounds. Narrower definitions of ""triggers"" in this context will focus on specific behaviors (""tricks""), pictures of emaciated people etc. But anyway, there you go.

And just as with your advertisement here failed completely to mention that the place had a Kim Jong Il style modding policy and that the most polite disagreement would result in an instaban so too did the person who advised me to visit SRS fail to mention that.

Just as with your glowing advertisement of SRS, no one warned me that to disagree was to be banned.

Just as with your glowing advertisement of SRS as a great place filled iwth great people who understand you, I was not told that I had to walk on eggshells and never, ever, disagree or I'd be smacked with the banhammer.

It's rather dishonest of you and your fellow SRS advertisers to omit such things.

And no thanks, I won't be visiting any SRS branded subreddit.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  I won't be fooled twice.

sotonohito,,,"&gt;It's like r/atheism.

No, it isn't.  r/atheism has its problems, but mods who crack down on dissent Kim Jong Il style are not among the problems of /r/atheism. 

For me any SRS branded subreddit is pretty much the antithesis of a safe space.  Their position is clear: disagreement will result in an instaban.  I find that position highly objectionable and I would not feel safe or comfortable posting in any subreddit with SRS in its name.  I don't like looking over my shoulder nervously constantly expecting a ban to come out of nowhere and always questioning myself wondering if maybe I steped over some bizarre, arbitrary, and stupid line.  

In general I'm doubtful that the idea of an official troll/circlejerk subreddit is a good idea.  It might sound like one, but rather than blowing off steam I think it trains people to go into troll mode in other subreddits. I'm doubtful about the whole ""blowing off steam"" concept anyway.  Studies show it doesn't work for violence, training people to hit walls or pillows or whatever actually increases their propensity for violence rather than the reverse, and while I'm unaware of any studies on the matter I can see how the same could apply to SRS style trolling.

I absolutely do not trust the mods of SRS, people who spend their whole day gleefully banning the slightest dissent, to suddenly be able to drop the trolling and behave in a civilized manner in other subreddits they mod.  They've been trained to crack down on dissent and rewarded for doing so.  Look at the way the SRS mods imported to mod to /r/LGBT started doing exactly the same thing there that they did in SRS.  Train people to behave in a particular way and, unsurprisingly, they act in that way. Train mods to act like powertripping banhappy types and they will act that way everywhere else.

&gt;It would be like trying to advocate for creationism in r/science by telling everyone there that they're godless heathens. Like breaking in line at the DMV because you're a special case.

No, it wouldn't.  I said something along the lines of ""wait, atheism isn't misogynist.  How did you come to that conclusion?"" That's pretty much the polar opposite of your examples.  I'm politely requesting that you not strawman me, or insult me by comparing me to Creationists.

At any rate, it wasn't my intention to derail this thread into a discusison of SRS. 

I simply felt, and continue to feel, that posts advertising SRS as a great place need a truth check.  I should have put it in a more concise, polite, form and then shut TFU so as to avoid derailment.  That'll be my approach in the future.  

I feel burned because I went there expecting what was advertised here, a nifty place to talk to like minded people, and I found a North Korean style modding environment where the most polite disagreement results in an instaban.  The sharp difference between what was advertised and the reality shocked me, and the ban pissed me off more than it otherwise would have because I expected something radically different based on how the SRS fans advertised their family of subreddits.

I didn't feel similarly hurt by my ban from MRA because I expect that sort of crap from MRA's.  I didn't expect people who had been advertised as nice and frindly and a people modding a great place for good discussion to be similarly banhappy.   Thus my disagreement with the SRS advertisers.  I'm still feeling bitter so I posted my objections badly and used language I shouldn't have.  I'll be changing that for the future.  But I intend to continue my policy of posting warnings about the true nature of SRS when I see SRS branded subreddits advertised in glowing terms.
