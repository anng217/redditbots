No, because I didn't say anything like that. You asked as if the men this satirical outburst is targeted to are the kind of men that have vasectomies. They are. No one is serious about making this into a law. It's *satire*. It's saying hey, stop poking at my uterus, please understand that this is kind of what that feels like for me.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the odds of getting jumped at the bar I like to go to. 

True. I venture only to coffee bars, I do not imbibe alcohol, and I cannot afford legal fees associated with violent confrontation. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about “vote fraud” theater showing up at my poll station. 

A single vote makes no difference from an economic perspective, and I do not vote. Were I to vote, I would expect to respect the independently verified and verifiable paper-trail left by all other voters. Electronic voting machines do not afford this test. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about turning on the news to see people planning to burn my holy book.

True. I am an atheist. However, when I was a libertarian I was appalled by the dismissal of the United States Constitution by those who swore to uphold it.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about others demanding I apologize for hateful people who have nothing to do with me. 

That really depends on the what happens following this post. I am a male.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about my child being seen as a detriment to my career. 

I do not have children, nor a career.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the irony of people thinking I’m lucky because I can park close to the door. 

I am honestly aghast that any would consider legally handicapped (I presume) people as ""lucky"" for their conditions.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about memories of being bullied in high school. 

That is correct, and I choose not to think about such things.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about being told to relax, it was just a joke.

Today, I am less militant in my response to those who proclaim (presumably) teasing to be, ""just a joke."" I do, however, calmly talk to these people to discover why they said what they did, and help them understand it as well. This creates many awkward moments, but *occasionally* someone will gain perspective, for their own benefit, as to why they felt it was advantageous to tease another person.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether someone thinks I’m in this country illegally. 

True, nor do I think that of others since those who permit people beyond an imaginary line on the ground have nothing to do with me.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about those who believe that freedom of religion ends with mine. 

I am concerned of such things, though mildly.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how a half-starved 23-year-old being a cultural ideal affects my life. 

And I wish that I never allowed it to impede my life, but I still think about it.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how much my life is circumscribed by my body. 

Yet, I do. Even though it is a choice I make every day, I do this.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about people wanting me cured of loving who I love.

But I do think of them, for they are perpetuating evil in the world and a crime on humanity.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about those who view me an unfit parent because of who I love. 

I am not a parent, nor do I expect to be within the next decade.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about being told my kind don’t assimilate.
 
I do not understand what that means. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about people blind to the intolerance of their belief lecturing me about my own. 

And I never should have. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about my body as a political football. 

I take it this ""political football"" is that of a woman's right to choose to abort an organism gestating inside of her. I don't have to worry about that. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how much my own needs wear on those I love.

Why would I not think about how my needs affect the ones I love? If I love them, then of course I am going to think about their welfare. If I not concerned about their welfare, I don't think it can be say that I actually love them.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about explaining to others “what happened to me.” 

This is always a choice. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about politicians saying bigoted things about me to win votes. 

This is true, and it is one of the reasons I stepped away from investing personal time and money in politics. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about those worried that one day people like me will be the majority. 

That statement says a great deal. I cannot change the minds of everyone, and I can barely affect the minds of a few. It is very sad, but many people repeat rhetoric rather than think. I have not found conversation in that type of instance productive.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about someone using the name of my religion as a slur. 

That is true. I do not have to think about it. Doing so is a choice.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about so many of the words for me controlling my own life being negatives.

I am at a loss, here. I do not know what these words are other than ""slut."" 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about still not being equal. 

That is true. I do not have to think about it, but I sometimes allow myself to think about whether or not equal opportunity employment laws affect my ability to achieve employment.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about what it takes to keep going. 

I do think about this.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how much I still have to hide. 

I do think about this, often to my own detriment. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how much prejudice keeps hold. 

Prejudice is not limited to any single ethnic or social group, as pointed out above. I do try to not let i affect me.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how I’m meant to be grateful that people tolerate my kind.

And I do not think about that. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about all the things I don’t have to think about. 

Yet I have taken some time to think about them be addressing each in this post.

&gt;But today I will.

-

And I ask, do you see the points mentioned herein as addressing privilege? If so, I ask for who the supposed privileges apply, and how they do. I do not see how each matter is exclusive to any gender, or ethnicity, or socio-economic group.

I take it the point of [this entry](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/10/18/things-i-dont-have-to-think-about-today/) is to point out that those who do not think about these topics do so because of the ""privilege"" indicated in OP's image of the Omaha Beach (Normandy, France 6 June 1944) landing. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about those who hear “terrorist” when I speak my faith.

Correct. I am an atheist. This does not mean that others do not ostracize me for speaking openly and honestly about atheist or philosophy, or that I am not concerned about what other people think.
 &gt;Today I don’t have to think about men who don’t believe no means no.

That depends on what part of what town I am traveling through. A request for spare change can easily turn into a mugging. 
 &gt;Today I don’t have to think about how the world is made for people who move differently than I do.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the phrase, ""move differently,"" refers to either one's gait or inability to walk. As such, I refute this claim. I am concerned about such matters.
 &gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether I’m married, depending on what state I’m in. 
Not to claim I am immune to marriage, or the consideration thereof, but I would be concerned with such things were I to enter into the legal contract of marriage.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how I’m going to hail a cab past midnight.

Reasonable precautions must always be taken - by all involved parties - when criminal activity is more statistically likely.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether store security is tailing me. 
No one is above suspicion. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the look on the face of the person about to sit next to me on a plane.

Please tell me what, ""the look on the face of the person…"" is supposed to mean. A person can have uncomfortable feelings but conduct themselves rationally. Lawyers frequently do this when interacting potential clients, and when running court cases. 
 &gt;Today I don’t have to think about eyes going to my chest first. 
Body-consciousness is not gender specific.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about what people might think if they knew the medicines I took. 
True. Some medications bear a social stigma. Thankfully much legislation and business practices exist to ensure the confidentiality of clients' and patient's medical records. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about getting kicked out of a mall when I kiss my beloved hello.

I am unfamiliar with this occurrence. However, malls are private property. If business owners feel that such displays drive more customers and revenue away from their businesses than the revenue the ""offenders"" provide, they are free to ask the affectionate parties to vacate their property. The community may choose to support or boycott those businesses as consequence. Baselessly bigoted business will undergo revenue-loss and be displaced by the market. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about [whether it is] safe to hold my beloved’s hand. 
Thankfully I live in an area of the world where this is not an issue. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether I’m being pulled over for anything other than speeding. 
This depends on the community I am traveling through, but is correct since I neither drive nor smoke.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about being classified as one of “those people.” 
Every - I repeat - every stratified community or society will categorize an obviously different group. ""Oh, her bag was *so* 2009.""

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about making less than someone else for the same job at the same place. 
No, I actually do think about this. The economy is in a downturn. Women in my profession, in my geographic location make an average of 8% more than men of my profession in my geography location, and it is easier for women to receive federal assistance if their bills fall behind.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the people who stare, or the people who pretend I don’t exist.

Why would I concern myself with people who pretend I do not exist? I am genuinely honest and curious on this matter. The majority of the planet's population is not concerned with my welfare or existence, just as I am not concerned with those aspect of most individuals on this planet.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about managing pain that never goes away. 
That is not so. I have concerns that I must face every day that I actually want to *do* something. Depression, physiological, and psychological concerns are not exclusive to any group. Everyone has their own concerns. I say this not to dismiss the author's pain, but to shed light that everyone, *everyone,* has pain.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether a stranger’s opinion of me would change if I showed them a picture of who I love. 
Then the problem is not with the author, but with those who the author surrounds him or herself with.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the chance a store salesmen will ignore me to help someone else. 
True. No one has to think about this. However, thinking about it may help some of us think about personal hygiene. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the people who’d consider torching my house of prayer a patriotic act. 
True. I am an atheist. This does not make me free of persecution by those willing to commit violent acts.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about a pharmacist telling me his conscience keeps him from filling my prescription.

True. However, I would locate an alternate pharmacist were I so concerned. Not all are so privileged to live near such a robust market. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about being asked if I’m bleeding when I’m just having a bad day. 
That, I must say, is true. I am a male. I find that language rather grating.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether the one drug that lets me live my life will be taken off the market. 
When I get old, I will likely have this concern. The current pharmacological research, development, testing, and distribution methods are antiquated, restrictive, and cost lives every year by preventing life saving drugs from getting onto the market.

324,"&gt;They don't experience the same discrimination, though

No, I should have been more careful with my word choice. I meant the types of discrimination fell into the same category, not that they are experienced equally or that they are identical in form.
&gt;boys are told they can and should be masculine, and tomboys are told that they can't be masculine and to return to femininity

""Girls are told they can and should be feminine, and sissies are told that they can't be feminine and to return to masculinity.""
EDIT: Again, I'm not trying to say they are interchangeable. I just mean that I suspect that the two discriminations stem from the same fear. If it were strictly a matter of ""masculinity = strength,"" wouldn't Joe America, father of a tomboy, be especially proud, rather than at best uncomfortable and at worst ashamed?
&gt;That the term ""tomboy"" exists without an equally-accepted counterpart is a testament to this difference

325,"&gt;One of the examples that was brought up last night,  was the ever popular grey flannel suit guy.  This guy, is the one who  went to work in the 50's and 60's to support his family. He worked long hours and generally speaking was unhappy with his life, and died early of a stroke or a heart attack.  Was the model harmful to men? Absolutely, but it certainly is not sexism.  The grey flannel suit guy, was in the position he was, not because of gender, but because of class.  He simply lacked the class power to be able to personally decide how to spend his time, and were a shift in class to occur, the very same man would find himself in a very different situation. This man faced class based oppression, because anyone who must sell their labour and does not own the means of production is unfairly disadvantaged, however, the moment he returned home to the private sphere, he was the oppressor and not the oppressed.

334,"It's shortsighted to view unpaid work simply as a relationship between the two partners of a household. Unpaid work (done primarily by women) goes ignored in economic analysis and thus the power of the work and the worker is ignored, even though it adds value to the economy (getting fed is nice, as is not catching diseases because you are clean, or being raised from birth). You, of course, are a shining example of the how the system ignores the contributions made by unpaid work to the family and to society. Amartya Sen pointed out that women’s contribution to the family livelihood is perceived to be smaller 
than it actually is, due to stereotypes of men as the chief or sole breadwinner. This gap between real and perceived contribution perpetuates inequality between women and men, because it fundamentally weakens women’s bargaining power in marriage and the family.

If you read about it in the scholarly literature you get lots of paragraphs like this:

&gt;All this has huge implications for international development policy, as well as women’s rights. During 
the ‘lost decade’ of the 1980s, feminist economists argued that the blindness of conventional 
economists to women’s unpaid work was very convenient. It enabled the international institutions 
that imposed structural adjustment policies on developing countries to ignore the true suffering of 
women, men and families due to cutbacks in state provision of essential services. Backs to the wall, 
women struggled – and just about succeeded – in replacing these services and keeping families afloat.

The devaluation of women's home work also allows for systematic devaluation of women's labor economy work- the result of which is lower wages in the workforce. To say that unpaid work is ""never relevant to the topic"" requires an extraordinary level of cognitive dissonance.

I don't even really understand what argument you are trying to make with your last couple paragraphs- you are honestly trying to say that Congress is not an institution run by men? When we literally just had a week where an all male panel testified about birth control? If any argument is bullshit it is surely your argument that all women vote in their own interest and thus congress cannot be sexist. Many women are happy for a pat on the head from the existing power structure, and who can blame them, and thus obviously not all of them will vote for what would truly be in their best interest. When you exist under an already functioning institution of power like patriarchy you are not free to exercise in your self-interest the way you would in a vacuum free of power.

No one is trying to say that women are claiming to have a patent on systematic discrimination. The new waves of feminism have given structure and voice to many many forms of oppression (race, gender, class, able bodied, etc.). If you want to honestly critique a basic idea like unpaid work you should spend two seconds reading one of the many many scholarly resources on the subject, instead of setting up a straw man and watching it burn and giving yourself a pat on the back.",limeade17,2012-02-27 18:27:12,2015-07-01 07:57:55,,t1_c3vjb8g,feminisms,8,0,2015-07-01 07:57:55

354,"I had a long, intense conversation with my boyfriend about the American Apparel ads. He believes that they are better than ""normal"" ads because of the lack of touch-ups, thus showing more natural looking women. He also thinks that it's better for the CEO, Don Charney, to be open about sexuality in the ads rather than pretending to be naive about it.  
My argument is that the touch-ups are not the problem. The problem is the type of photography itself, where it is extremely voyeuristic, and the girls are posed in very passive, one might even same susceptible poses. I also have a huge problem with his argument about being open about sexuality. Let's remember who that is: an older, white male who's subjects are young, innocent-looking females.   
Frankly, I find these ads more disgusting than a normal Cosmo ad.

The rapper talks with dream hampton about his now-infamous XXL video and what he has learned from the backlash 
http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/too-short-interview

&gt;Too $hort: ...when I taped the XXL video, my goal was that this was some kind of comedy piece. So I am sitting there and the thing that I am saying is actually reminiscent of when we as little boys were being bad and (what) we were doing something or learning or practicing. But know I'm understanding that it's actually it’s a form of sexual assault. And it's crazy that I'm just now understanding this.

&gt;I’m not going to lie to you…my eyes are opening just from reading the comments, the stuff that is coming from people. They say stuff like, “Does he get it?” I’m reading it and I am starting to get it. I am looking at this and I am looking at all the stuff that they put out, completely from the entertainment industry, from the movies I watched when I was a kid. A rape scene in a movie was pretty normal. They don’t really do it that much anymore, (but) back then a guy would take it and the girl would enjoy it. They put those images out there over and over again and it’s like so much society is ok with the images of aggressive male and female sexuality. I’m just reading this and I’m reading that, and I’m like I am so much a part of that whole “man” thing.

&gt;…in my mind, I’m not a rude guy who just goes around calling women “b*tch” but at this point, this is not just a wake up call to let go and do something good. I have been doing good, I have a track record. I have been doing good in the community with the kids around the Bay Area. Just being involved with the programs around here. The message that is missing (for me) is about this whole aggressive sexual thing. It is entertainment to me. I have been saying that for a long time. I have been making money off of it. I could have spoke about what I really believed in, I could have been a Tribe Called Quest or KRS-One type artist, but I knew if I just write these little curses, people would want to hear that.

While the legal stuff definitely should be addressed, I couldn't get passed the extraordinary amount of hate that tainted almost every thread I dared read. Even a man who seemed well spoken and reasonable in other respects suggested that r/mensrights should stop attacking r/feminisms because they were ""the enemy"" and therefore a lost cause. 

Not because it was wrong, not because it further enforced the notion that they are a hate group, but because WE (women or feminists to be exact) were the enemy somehow. 

Both I and my husband are shocked. I read him some of the things I read on r/mensrights to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding the point of the men who spoke. He was possibly more outrage then I was, but then again, he's never been through a divorce or custody battle, so he has no reason to hate women. 

I do not understand how men, in this day and age, when in some countries women are actually forced to wear head-to-toe coverings and are forbidden to drive under penalty of DEATH, can actually view women as a force that is somehow oppressing them.  My mind is boggled. 

As for the leader of this men's movement, I wonder if he even thought about how setting himself on fire would effect his 4 year old daughter. Even if he couldn't ever see her again she's going to hear about how her father died and probably blame herself. It saddens me greatly to think that ultimately the children will suffer because their Dad decided an unfortunate accident leading to the loss of custody was actually a precursor to war, proving (to me anyways) that he truly was a completely unfit parent.

I just have a few concerns:

&gt; and to have your reports of everything from that to sexual assaults questioned in a manner that reports of other crimes would not be...

I'm not exactly sure of the process here, but what would one have to do to prove sexual assault that they wouldn't have to do to prove verbal assault or physical assault (that didn't leave a wound, or left a wound that already healed)?

&gt; If you can imagine what it would feel like to be seen as a sexual object rather than a subject ...

Yeah, this mainly is the problem here.  Because of our socialization, women are taught from almost every angle that they are objects and men are taught from almost every angle that they are subjects.  This causes problems when subjective people don't try and empathize with the objective crowd, and the other way around.  It leads to too-simple 'solutions' like ""Well don't wear attractive clothing"" and ""Well don't hit on a drunk person"" that are hardly helpful.

It raises even more issues when you realize that while that may be the majority, there are objective males and subjective females, and they do go together.  At the same time, there are male-male relationships, and female-female relationships where the stereotypes either become more defined or just can't keep up.  When you bring in transgender, genderqueer, and other complications, it all becomes a bit much.

While some people think that these fringe groups don't matter because they are too hard to help, I know that this is where the worst damage is being done.  These people simply have nowhere to turn for protection, advice, or if they are aggressing, punishment and correction.

I *completely* understand where feminists are coming from on the issue, and very many MRAs would agree.

If you're a man not generally in the business of sexually harassing or assaulting anyone it's easy to miss how much goes on, we simply experience far less of it so it looks like a small problem. But it's not, it's a huge problem.

I agree with MRAs that it would do feminists good to understand men's subjective experience of gender and avoid demonising men as a group.

455,"&gt; When we imagine a rape accusation on a campus or in a workplace setting, we generally imagine a woman accusing a man.

This could accurately represent the state of affairs, but the numbers are at least a little bit affected by the sexist definitions of rape and sexual harassment, the sexist handling practices when males come forward, and most importantly society's notion that only females do get raped.  Who is more likely to be a victim is not absolutely important.  The protections should be gender-neutral and serve everyone.

While I can't imagine the torture it must be to prove that you didn't want to be raped to the judge, the jury, and everyone paying attention, saying that they shouldn't have to deal with that is a recipe for disaster.  In any sort of crime, you have to be proven guilty.  You can not be put away for something that you didn't do.  If power is given to those to change the entire judicial system to ""guilty until proven innocent"", then that gives a free pass to inflict great amount of societal harm to anyone who would be willing to use it.

In the context of our ""only women can be victims"" and ""only men can be perps"" society, *that* is going to result in absolute sexism.  The difference between your claim and my claim is that the innocent don't get punished in my idealistic world, and the guilty are adequately punished.  In yours, the innocent can be put away for nothing, the accusers are encouraged to do so by law, and the actual victims of rape are bunched together with the liars and discredited as a whole.",JohnAdamZiolkowski,2012-03-14 18:48:05,2015-04-08 20:36:33,,t1_c410b01,feminisms,0,0,2015-04-08 20:36:33
456,"But let's be serious, this is singled out as a men's rights issue because excluding prisoners, women suffer all forms and degrees of sexual assault at a far far higher rate than men, and men commit the majority of these crimes. When we imagine a rape accusation on a campus or in a workplace setting, we generally imagine a woman accusing a man.

I am a big advocate for being honest when the data supports a similar picture for both genders. For example, I get shit from some feminists I know because I stick to my guns that non-sexual domestic abuse is almost as common for men as it is for women. That's what the data says. But the data also says that women are victims of sexual crimes in far greater numbers than men. (my source is the British Crime Survey, the Scottish Crime Survey (over several years) and the recent American CDC study)

I don't think we can just ignore that context. Nor the context that rapes are rarely reported, and that those who report rape have to go through a horrendous process of being questioned and disbelieved. It is from the perspective of seeing that process and how it can tear a person up that adding the possibility of legal action if the cops decide they can ""prove"" you were lying seems simply horrific, unthinkable.

This is a perspective that women, being more often the victims of sexual crimes, are more likely to develop than men, just as men are more likely to have a fear of false accusation and develop a perspective from there. But we cannot simply dismiss the experiences of women like that. Sexual harassment and worse is pervasive, and the words of genuine rape victims are regularly dismissed.",[deleted],2012-03-14 18:34:31,2015-04-08 20:34:06,,t1_c410499,feminisms,2,0,2015-04-08 20:34:06

Keep in mind most of the ones who support the claim make the distinction between guilty and not guilty.  It isn't one-or-the-other.  If the court can't prove either is guilty, then neither are punished.

* False rape claims hurt the accused, who go to jail, lose their jobs, get placed on a registry list, and way too often kill themselves.
* False rape claims hurt the actual raped, for their claims get looked down upon as a whole.

With those two points, I think it's obvious that false rape accusers should be punished in some ways.  I wouldn't say that the exact punishment would be necessary.

500,"Part of the problem is I'm not posting from my regular account so I can't just rely on people knowing that I know what I'm talking about. :P  

Basically, things like DFD is nice for pointing out what tactics are derails, but it does nothing to debunk them in a way that will win over folks. So I'm asking what evidence or turns of phrase folks find helpful for getting someone to think beyond the derails I cited. For instance, if someone said ""I don't see why women deserve special treatment"", what has worked for you in the past on convincing that person that that mindset is flawed?

What evidence is there that people should stop being selfish when being selfish works perfectly fine *for them*, and the ""because you're being a jerk"" angle doesn't appeal to them(because ""people are jerks to everyone""/""get a thicker skin""/etc)? ",FeministSpeakerTW,2012-04-03 22:50:55,2015-04-10 07:13:36,,t1_c483ggm,feminisms,2,1,2015-04-10 07:13:36
501,"I guess the best generalized advice I can give you is this, speaking from my experience as a middle-class white cis male computing professional:

Most of these guys *probably* understand that discrimination happens, but they think it isn't a big deal.  They think that non-privileged people have to deal with it very infrequently, and when they do have to deal with it, there are mechanisms in place for them to do so.  They think racism, classism, sexism, ableism, ageism, and all the other -isms, are mostly a solved problem already.  They do *not* understand the idea of privilege, or if they've been exposed to it, they probably reject it.

So, you're going to have to establish that it's not a solved problem.  That non-privileged people deal with the consequences of their lack of privilege in many ways, on many levels, all the time.  That there usually *aren't* any mechanisms to deal with it.

I think you'll want both statistics and case studies.  Descriptions of people being forced to deal with their lack of privilege, detailed accounts of how it influences them, how it crops up in their everyday life.  Combine with statistical evidence of institutional -isms.  Showing one and not the other won't work.  Show just the case studies, they'll assume you're cherry-picking.  Show them just the statistics, they'll assume it's caused by factors other than privilege and discrimination.  They need to have the stats *and* be able to link them to a concrete example of how inequality could be the causal factor.

A lot of them probably worked very hard to get where they were.  They don't feel like they got any special treatment because they were white or male or middle class.  So it might be helpful to emphasize that privilege isn't *all* that's needed to get ahead.  Good outcomes still take hard work, even for people in privileged groups.  Privilege is just about where you *start* on the playing field.

Expect to hear arguments about how it's not *fair* to penalize this group of people for privilege they never asked for, and would reject if they could.  The only good response I can think of for this is that it isn't about fairness.  If the world were fair, there would be no privilege.  Fundamentally, inclusiveness and accessibility is about being utilitarian: it's about asking one group of people to make a very *small* sacrifice in order that another group of people can reap a very *large* reward.  You take five minutes out of your day to check your website's color scheme, and you can avoid shutting out dozens, hundreds, thousands of colorblind people from the content you're providing.  You take a day to implement button re-mapping, and suddenly disabled players can enjoy your game just like able-bodied players can.  You take a moment just to consider the impact of your words on someone else, and you save your female or minority or LGBT coworkers immeasurable amounts of anxiety and heartbreak.

Lastly: you're not going to win most of them over.  At the end of your talk, I wager at least nine in ten will still be hostile and will dismiss everything you've said as bullshit.  But you might touch a few and get them thinking, and that's something.",rooktakesqueen,2012-04-03 21:48:17,2015-04-10 07:06:03,,t3_rrau7,feminisms,7,1,2015-04-10 07:06:03

Do they hide the male form, too? Unless the uniforms come with cod-piece or fake beard, I can't imagine the uniforms boasting a male form. 

Perhaps the uniforms are universal in nature, and gender expectations lead some to thing that they are male uniforms. For example, currently the U.S. Army has no male or female uniforms. When they do come out with a female line, they aren't being designed to ""show the female form,"" rather they will tweak the sizing details like shoulder width to sleeve length or waist to hip ratios.

If we are to assume that male/female differences are based on biological/ hormonal factors, when wouldn't this information mean that our behavior over our individual life would be more different than our relationship to the opposite sex?

So many behaviors we have are socially learned. I have a hard time listening to male vs. female stereotypes that are built on this as yet unfounded idea of huge difference in hormone levels.

Another interesting fact is that differences between some individuals of opposite genders can actually be more similar than between another person of the same gender. As humans we have variety of hormonal levels, yet we don't measure each person and then say ""you have _ level of estrogen, so you can be expected to be responsible for only this level of behavior.""

1582,"&gt;In an America where abortion has been legal for over thirty-five years, the procedure can be surprisingly inaccessible: even in cases of rape, imminent threat to the mother’s life, or complicated miscarriage—and even with a willing doctor. 

&gt;How did the post–Roe v. Wade world come to resemble pre-Roe so closely? While ""abortion wars"" may immediately bring to mind the very real threat of antiabortion violence, sociologist Carole Joffe shows how a pervasive stigma operates less dramatically but just as effectively to maintain cultural, political, and economic barriers to access.

&gt;After thirty years embedded in reproductive-health research, Joffe relays compelling testimony from doctors, health-care workers, and patients as they struggle against these barriers that shame women and marginalize physicians, even within the medical community. Real-life stories include those of poverty-stricken rape victims scrambling—and sometimes failing—to cover the cost of abortions that should be covered by Medicaid; a doctor having to beg her superior for permission to perform in-hospital a medical abortion too dangerous to handle at a clinic; and a woman whose miscarriage is causing septic shock refused care and bundled off to another hospital.

Stating that a 5-year old may have GID does nothing in terms of altering that childs life, especially if the parents are already allowing the child to express their gender.  No decisions about actually changing the child physically would be brought up until they near puberty, at which point you will have had 7+ years to view and further assess the desires of the child.  

The only change that would come from a diagnosis such as that, is possibly convincing parents to let their child explore their identity.  It sounds like in the case of this article, the parents were already allowing their child to do that.

But then, I've often wondered about how effective advertising that doesn't convey really new information really is.

For example, does advertising for Coke or Pepsi really affect sales in any way at all?  Most people who drink soda have a strong preference for one brand or another, I doubt strongly that a person who prefers Coke will try Pepsi due to an ad.  And people who have no preference generally take whatever is available.

From an abortion standpoint there are, basically, three groups.

1) People who are, or lean, pro-choice.

2) People who are, or lean anti-choice.

3) People who have not formed any particular opinion.

Group 2 might, possibly, become a bit more involved if they see a dismembered fetus, but they may also get irked at the thought of kids seeing the ad and being squicked.

It seems unlikely to me that even the more wavering members of group one would be pushed to neutrality or anti-choice positions by a gross out ad.

Which leaves group three.  Are they more grossed out than anything, and thus pushed away from the anti-choice position, or do the dismembered feti engage their empathy and drag them to the anti-choice position?

1697,"&gt; I think it's already treated rather like a physical condition - how many mental disorders do you know that surgeons can cure?

My point exactly.  It's not a mental condition, it is a physical one.  To ""cure"" GID, you do not take drugs to alter the brain and the way it thinks, you take drugs to alter the body so it matches the brain.  

&gt; It is heavily policed, however, by psychiatrists because other conditions need to be ruled out and there can be a lot of illnesses that go along with it. 41% of trans people attempt suicide, which I can't help feeling is largely because of the prejudices of society.

It is heavily policed for now.  True, other conditions can lead to feelings of GID, but they are rare and usually severe in nature to begin with (sociopath is the prominent one I have heard of).  Informed consent is becoming more readily available for things like hormones.  

Psychiatrists will most likely retain control over the irreversible decisions (SRS) but for all of the steps that can be reversed, like hormone treatment, we're going to start to see them lose their control.  

I don't think it's fair to claim that since there is a high suicide-rate (caused by the prejudices of society) that a psychiatrist is mandatory.  Nobody's transition is the same, and not everyone faces the same hardships.  Not every therapist is concerned with strictly your well being, and some can outright be gatekeepers.  I don't think it's fair to force a person who is handling their transition fine to pay money to an unnecessary professional.  

That being said a good therapist can do wonders and for some is absolutely necessary.  I feel like that is a decision that should be left to the patient though, and not enforced - and in fact, this is exactly the type of thinking we're seeing with the new WPATH and the rise of informed consent clinics.

Think of the impact culture has on schizophrenia.  In more developed countries, the rate of symptoms remission is about 1/3, with another 1/3 able to function with medication.  But in both cases, the person does not become normal again.  In third world countries, which have far worse medication and doctors to help, the rates of symptoms disappearing is much higher and there is some evidence that a person may even 'get over' schizophrenia.

1710,"Yes, there are times and places where and when girls and women are more likely to get the shittier end of the stick (or at least a very different kind of shitty end of the stick), but ""historical and global"" does not quite equate to ""always and everywhere"" -- one might just as well say that rainy days are a ""historical and global fact"", as are sunny ones too (or can we name a place where it never rained, or always did?). The clip you linked to tells a very tragic story, but hardly a very relevant one for this debate. We're two westerners on /r/feminisms arguing about the proper and improper use of a word, this being a context where any non-feministic male point of view may be a bit short of dominant (and this is what I mean by my ""wrong"" gender, wrong *here and now*, or in any similar context).

In *this* context, though, you'd be all the more welcome if you were.

But I'll just skip the rest of these ad hominems and stick closer to the subject.

1711,"The article is wildly problematic and diminishes the experience of thousands of transgender individuals, but beneath all the bullshit is a sentiment worth discussing. 

It has been the history of diagnosing GID that boys are more heavily policed than girls. I believe (correct me if I am wrong) that diagnostic criteria for GID have been revised since the days when, in order for a boy to be diagnosed with GID, he merely had to display a preference for so-called ""feminine"" activities or clothes, but a girl had to display the belief that she needed or would grow a penis. 

Even with the adjustments, it still remains that males are more frequently pathologized when it comes to displaying non-cis behavior, and I feel this is largely due to our social preference for the masculine over the feminine, the idea that we, socially, are more likely to accept a ""boyish girl"" than a ""girlish boy."" Some may pitch this as misandry, but I see it still as a symptom of socialized misogyny that devalues the feminine. 

As the mother of a boy, I am torn on this. On one hand, I hate to think that a preference for pink would warrant a trip to a psychiatrist among some circles, but on the other I would never want him to think that, should he ever feel wrongly-bodied, that I would downplay and make him stuff it aside as ""merely some childhood thing.""

So when someone doesn't fit our gender roles, does that mean they are mentally ill, or perhaps they are just different?

On one hand, they are clearly atypical or abnormal.  Much like homosexuality is abnormal in that the majority of the people, the mean, don't do it.  But then again, having a college degree is abnormal, as is a life long monogamous marriage (either gay or straight).  People like to use abnormal a an attack in some areas and as a desired trait of rarity in others.  Abnormal diamonds fetch good prices.  Abnormally entertaining video games/music/movies are in high demand.

It makes sense, but it also ignores that Big Business isn't a spectator. Sexism is maintained via an interaction between popular culture, advertisement and local culture. Big Business plays a leading role in the advertisement department and while I will concede that it is not the prime cause for sexism, it does have an important hand in maintaining and furthering it. 

For example, there is little doubt that many women face a lack of self-confidence due to the projection of an unreasonable image primarily by the fashion and make-up industry (fashion and make-up models usually look far more 'perfect' that movie stars for example). Those same industries claim to have the answer to these self-confidence problems. It's in their interest to further sexist stereotypes and they really love doing that (see also labiaplasty and the diet industry). As such, trying to change our culture without tackling them is going to be an unreasonable task.

1740,"I understand if someone wants to try to adjust their rates based on eliminating a risk. For instance, I have to pay for a (horrible no good) high deductible individual plan. I was not able to have any kind of prenatal or birth coverage without opting in and paying an extra 700 a month. However, even though I have eliminated that risk for myself, my rates still go into a pool that will pay out to someone who paid for that coverage. Although I will never have prostate issues, and my plan would probably deny any billing for prostate issues (I did not have to opt out of this, my status as a female does the opting out for me), my premium still goes into the pool that pays out for prostate issues. If they were to do their insurance magic and factor in the lowered monetary risk a person was taking by eliminating birth control from their coverage, I'd be willing to bet its pennies, because technically at the very least half the insurance population is already not at risk for BC. The issue lies with implying that you get any say in what your premiums go to in the end. If you use the flood insurance example, you are only eliminating yourself and your risk from the end payout. If there is a major flood, you can bet part of the money you paid for regular house insurance will still be used to cover the insurance companies losses.
If you get a group plan (ie employee based) that option of adjusting rates is moot, because the point of that is the ""bulk"" discount. The insurance companies already know not everyone will use every service, and have a calculated risk with a price tag on it. Im not even going to get into the religious exemption, because again, unless they are self insured, they will still go into the ""pool"" with other people who are covered for BC. 

Disclaimer: I'm talking about current systems in place. If I was talking about my ideal system, we'd be here for weeks.

If you think of health insurance like any other type of insurance, you can choose what you want to protect, say, your home and contents against (and even what items and how much for you want to cover). If you don't think you'll get flooded, say, you don't need to pay for it but you won't get coverage. This is not necessarily conflicting with the idea of a government-controlled non-profit insurer.

If, OTOH, you think of it as a basic service like the dole, you have to decide, as a community, what level of coverage everyone should get (and pay for), and what people should pay for themselves if they want or need it.

First, you realize that the ['wrong' gender is actually female,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISme5-9orR0) right? That's a historical and global reality.  Thinking women or others see you as wrong-gendered is a reality only within the confines of your own self-perception. 


Given the above, it seems to me that you have brought some baggage to this conversation that we need to unpack.  Absolutely no one here is demeaning the male experience.  No one is accusing men of being 'chauvinist pigs' or anything of the sort.  Women also use the word rape.  No one is saying they see phalluses everywhere.  You are infusing this conversation with your own perceived notions of how women see and talk about rape.  

Your 'feelings' are certainly a valid channel of analysis, but perhaps in this case you also need to step out of yourself for a moment and look at the bigger picture.  Although you may *feel* as though your words are spoken in a vaccuum, with a special meaning only you understand, there is a greater likelihood that your thoughts, actions, desires, and yes, the words you speak, are a product of your context.  What you ""believe in and stand for"" are not really about you, but your parents, community, etc.  

In terms of your belief that these words have no greater implications, please see my [example](http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/pwtfl/rape/c3t5r3a) about a student, a story which attests to the connection between word and action.

1768,"I am not Muslim or from the Middle East, but I will share some of my thoughts on European countries that ban the burqa and face covering. The law represents one end on a spectrum that I will call the Totalitarian-Relitivist spectrum. Totalitarian here would refer to myths about a culture that assume some sort of essentialist knowledge of it. When the French government banned the burqa they are doing so because their observations of Islamic culture lead them to believe that the burqa is without exception a means of oppressing women, and that it has no cultural value beyond that. In doing so it is implied that Muslim culture is oppressive of women. So from this it can be abstracted that the French government is deciding that Western culture is a) not oppressive to women and b) that it is preferable that people assimilate to Western culture if they live in France. In many ways it can be said that the law is a manifestation of West vs. East mentality and a manifestation of a Colonialist outlook: the French government is 'civilizing' Muslims, bringing the 'light of Judeo-Christian freedom to the barbarians.' (Sound familiar, India?)

Now it would be just as bad to say something like, ""Well, if Muslim women are being honor-killed and their political and economic freedoms are non-existent, well... that is *just their culture.*"" Because lets face it, women are being killed, they *are* oppressed, we can't just *do nothing,* that would be the Relativist attitude. This attituude *also* (like Totalitarianism) assumes that their is an essential *difference* between the West and the East. By that logic the law still makes sense: French society? Too different to allow for Muslim culture.

So then what can be taken from this. Both view points are... the word I will choose is 'useless.' Rather I would say that we need a balance, where we recognize that a) parts of Islam are oppressive to some women and b) parts of Western culture are oppressive to some women. We must work with the conflicts between extreme relativism and totalitarianism to find an answer that doesn't reify difference. The paradox presented is a not a place to give up at, but rather to think about problems in new way. 'Resistance is fertile' as they say.

Also be weary of privileging people based on identity...

1769,"&gt;rape is a gendered, power-based crime, and using the word as a metaphor plays right into the same oppressive gendered narrative as the act it came from

Hair-splitting time, then. 

I have to admit that it seems that any discussion on this particular subject always gets, sooner or later, distorted and diffused by forcibly tying it to these ideologically loaded concepts that people just insist on reading into any and every thing that is being said about it, or, as is the case with these metaphors, about anything completely unrelated using just some of the same terminology.  Let's give it a go anyway, and see if I manage to get my stance more clear.

Sometimes a cigar *is* just a cigar, not a thinly veiled symbol of phallic male dominance that the brotherhood of patriarchy wants to shove down your throat. And sometimes a metaphor *is* just a metaphor, not an attempt to trivialize, oppress, or participate in a gendered narrative.

For just one very concrete example of using the term ""wrong"": [a certain very popular local band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMMP), led by two female singers (who have also done a song for the local branch of Amnesty International for their campaign against violence against women, FWIW), have in one of their more popular songs a somewhat poorly translatable line about how ""the frost rapes this land"". *To me* that's just a poetic line using the term as a metaphor -- and I can't quite think of any alternative term to replace it without losing some of the expressive power and accuracy of that line -- which is essentially about (not actual rape, but something as unrelated as) living under the harsh climate of Northern Europe. 

But you want me to believe that what the song is *really* about is the band *playing into the same oppressive gender narrative as the act it came from*? That what these women are *really* doing is trivializing the act of rape and contributing to the oppression of women?

I'm truly sorry if this makes impossible my peaceful coexistence with anyone, but I simply don't know how to force myself into seeing it that way. What I see in the whole debate is more akin to an attempt by some people to monopolize a commonly used word with expressive power far beyond it's most strict and literal meaning, for what I can only see as political purposes -- the intentions are of course good, but the methods I just can't really approve of. It's my language too.

I understand that rape *can be* by definition a gendered crime *if* we choose to define it as such, as some institutions have done (which I'd claim to be a pretty clear case of institutionalized misandry, but that's another discussion). I also understand that even when including non-penile sexual violations and/or those that have a male as a victim (penile or not), it may in practice be a predominantly male-on-female violation, *if* we choose to exclude prison environments, as we often do (for reasons that aren't entirely acceptable to me), and so on and so forth. If we however accept that one does not need a vagina to be raped, and that people convicted of crimes are people too, and that a rape can also be an act of violation that does not involve inserting a penis into something (or just being a man), then we're not really talking about a gendered crime anymore.

Likewise we could conveniently just *define* oppression as ""all the bad stuff that men do to women"" and conclude that women are oppressed because they're women, and men aren't because they're men, but I hope this is not the level of the discussion we're supposed to have. Or anyone is.

Power-based I could easily agree with, but even that gets a bit blurry the further away we sway from the ""conventional"" definition of a forceful act while using or threatening with violence. I'm sure there have been cases of men being retroactively accused of rape (not of being irresponsible, or inconsiderate, or assholes, but of *rape*) for having mutually consenting sex with an intoxicated partner, when any power aspect was never a real motivation, although I'm not sure if this is (yet) a very common scenario. Anyway, I believe for most cases the power aspect does, at least to a degree, apply.

What I simply don't understand is that how does the use of a term as a metaphor constitute an act of oppression when the term itself isn't derogatory towards any group or gendered -- any particular act of violation may or may not be gendered, of course, depending on the case, but that does not cover the full meaning and applicability of the term. (If anything, even the field of its *literal* applicability seems to be expanding as we speak, largely due to Women's Rights activists wanting it to include scenarios that traditionally wouldn't have been included -- not necessarily a bad thing, but something to keep in mind when accusing others of misusing the term as if there even exists one universally accepted definition for its literal meaning.)

I also do understand that just hearing the word can be an unwanted reminder of traumatic events, for which exact reason I often hesitate to use it even if it seems to be the most descriptive term in any particular context. But that's because I don't want to be an insensitive asshole, not because I'd be trivializing, oppressing or participating in a gendered narrative if I would in fact use it. 

Most of the time these assumed implications just seem awkwardly forced and glued-on in order to gain significance for issues that just aren't there -- they're *somewhere*, but not there. It's this ""Everything is about Me and My Womanhood"" attitude that most bothers me here -- some things simply aren't. Sometimes it's just other people talking about other things that have nothing to do with you or your socio-political interpretations, using words that you want to claim ownership to, meaning things with them that you don't mean with them, and being accused of all kinds of things by you, simply because you refuse to see that they come from a totally different place and are not the boogeyman you need them to be in order to give you a stronger sense of meaningfulness for your struggles.

I hope that doesn't sound too harsh, but it's not the first time I get to hear from other people what I *really* mean when I say what I say, and what I *really* do when I do what I do, and it does get old after a while. And I hope you can appreciate the irony if it feels to me like someone is trying to trivialize my own feelings and thoughts about myself and the world I live in, oppress my freedom of determining myself what I believe in and stand for, and narrating me as the bad guy based on nothing but my ""wrong"" gender (you know, the one that does nothing but rapes and approves of all kinds raping, because male chauvinist pig).",INxP,2012-02-22 20:08:09,2015-04-07 10:07:43,,t1_c3tr6ts,feminisms,2,0,2015-04-07 10:07:43

1790,"&gt; Personally it is hard for me to understand how some people need such a reminder

It's not that I needed a reminder - like most people I internalise feelings into thoughts without having to emotionally relive them every time I recall the memory.

I am still more than capable of feeling compassionate towards people - however, this way of presenting an idea, I feel, was particularly strong - remember, these ideas have to reach people who have clearly not internalised that kind of feeling.

In particular I was thinking of how uncomfortable I felt recently when I visited a doctor for a urinary blockage - the waiting, the ""I'm going to just have to shove a finger up your arse"" (unexpectedly, but what are you going to do? rebook?), having to talk about personal aspects of my life etc.

Even when you go for your occasional STD screening, you're sitting answering personal questions to a stranger - no matter how nice they are.

Even with the best staff and the nicest environment it's not nice. 

It doesn't even have to be about abuse at all - it's just, like, well, that kind of thing isn't top of everyone's fun-time list.

So coercing people into having worse stuff done at a particularly vulnerable time is shitty.

&gt; When I read another article about this ""debate"" I feel it in my bones, the wrong that the politicians and affiliated organizations are doing to women - my friends and my family. 

I really sympathise. You know, I can't say I've been as close to that kind of suffering - but trust me, even with my limited experience I can tell you that the laws disgust me too, and I can feel their wrongness in my bones as well.

It honestly breaks my heart that in a country that thinks it's number one, it really is stuck in the dark ages and there are so many people that willfully march lock-step with this institutional perversion.

I'm actually a bit amazed that it's even possibly to suggest shit like this.

Anyway, back on topic.

I certainly hope the actions of of the female politicians that came up with this counter proposal hit home with a lot of men who might not have been reached another way.

1794,"Yeah I completely understand your reaction and I am glad that the bill has gotten at least one person to really *feel* what it is like to have your body scrutinized and told you don't know what's best for yourself.

Personally it is hard for me to understand how some people need such a reminder, but I also have A LOT of personal bias that many don't.  Most of my young friends and older family friends (as well as members of my immediate family) have been raped, assaulted or molested in their lifetime and so I have always had a present reminder of how it feels to have undergone such an assault on the self.  I have also always kept in mind that it would only take one rapist without a condom to leave a friend or family member with something much worse than an emotional scar - a living breathing person brought into the world at the hands of a criminal and a political system that would force a victim to live with a reminder of that horrific event for the rest of her life.  

Now, I know people say there's adoption, or that some people do love their children borne out of such terrible circumstances, but not all people are able to do it.  This argument often doesn't cover women terminating due to birth defects, dangerous pregnancies, results from incest or other youth molestations, or an underage or ill-prepared woman.

This also doesn't even include women that *need* BC in order to curb severe cycles, hormonal imbalances, or other medical problems.  For myself I take it in order to calm my PCOS symptoms and without it I would be having 2 months without a period, then a month-long heavy flow.  Not to mention the cramps so bad that I wanted to die and migraines that would last for days.  My symptoms without BC are so bad that there is no way I would have been able to do half of what I've accomplished today. 

I'm sorry for the rant.  I guess my point is that familiarity with people that could have had their futures ~~jeopardized~~ destroyed because of such laws makes me a lot more angry and upset than someone that maybe hasn't been as close to such a large amount of wronged women (and men as well if we are talking generally about abuse and molestation).  When I read another article about this ""debate"" I feel it in my bones, the wrong that the politicians and affiliated organizations are doing to women - my friends and my family.  

I think it's because I've felt their pain when talking to me about their experiences, I've seen their triggers because of the events, and I've cried with them as they expressed their thankfulness for the people that were able to end the unplanned pregnancies caused by those atrocities.

&gt;Conservative U.S. evangelical churches have broadened a long tradition of international missionary work, intended to convert and “save” individuals, to include political work related to a right-wing political agenda. The resulting assault on human rights is alarming

&gt;In thinking and writing about the Christian Right, we are careful not to conflate its work and agenda with that of religious bodies in general. Our brush must not be broad or simplistic. Only if we have accurate information and a thorough understanding of the best means of defending human rights will our liberal, reformist, and progressive work succeed. 

snip

&gt;The U.S. is not the source of all right-wing religious activity in the Global South. Nor is it uninvolved in the rise of a global right-wing religious wave of cultural, economic, and social conservatism. The growing collaboration between the U.S. religious Right and conservative Christians internationally benefits each, and both threaten the pursuit of human rights.

&gt;We urge you to study the presence of anti-human rights forces in your country, so that you and your allies closely monitor and regularly challenge their work.

&gt;During 30 years of studying the U.S. Right, we have developed some rules of the road for activists challenging the Right that can apply as well to the Right internationally:

&gt;&gt;Do not imagine Christianity or any other religion to be monolithic. Try to examine each situation with a researcher’s dispassionate eye.

&gt;&gt;Do not generalize and demonize the followers of right-wing leaders. Their motives are complex and it will do no good to denigrate or insult them.

&gt;&gt;Remember that, while not all money is dirty money, enriching oneself with public funds should be exposed, even when the corrupt individual supports human rights goals.

&gt;&gt;It can be enlightening and educational for people to learn the theological, ideological, financial, and valid critiques of the organizations that have attracted them. That may be new information for them.28

yes, i agree that i've never heard of sagan or NGT saying anything derogatory towards women. i think sagan was even a self-professed feminist. however, hawking is quoted as saying women are a ""complete mystery"" to him, which spawned [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/o47xn/one_of_the_worlds_greatest_thinkers_stephen/) (and one on [/r/mensrights](/r/mensrights), which is a completely separate issue) and related misogynistic comments, like these:

&gt;Because he relies on logic and reason.

&gt;I've always said the most successful route to dealing with women is the most illogical and irrational route you can find.

do i think hawking is a misogynist? no. but people used his statement as a way to legitimize their individual sexism, which is fucking frustrating.

i too am subscribed to just about every math and science subreddit that exists because i'm a mathematician. while i don't see posts that are *that* blatantly and offensively anti-woman very often, i do see sexist comments being upvoted in pretty much all of those subreddits. often the comments are subtly sexist and are just taken as true despite there being **no evidence other than some scientist's observation**. literally exactly what i just did, but for some reason i get called out on needing a citation but they don't... examples below.

[post about women in computer science by a computer scientist.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pfkvb/how_do_i_get_you_women_interested_in_computer/) 

&gt;In my opinion, girls are more able to think holistically, while men are more able in methodical and logistical thinking. These are just my observations.

this guy says men are more logical than women, no one argues. accepted as true.

&gt;Oh my appearance has suffered from late-night programming. That's definitely true, since most girls are very social and would not want to be physically affected (Our school had about half that dropped for that reason). The two directions don't go well together.

he goes on to say women drop out of CS because staying up late programming makes them less attractive, and that's what women prioritize. no one argues.

[this post is about a study that claims math skill differences between men and women are culturally and not biologically determined.](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/nbhnv/ams_study_gender_differences_in_math_are_cultural/)

&gt;Biggest load of bullshit I've read in a while. This is really bad. Science shouldn't have to try and be politically correct.
FWIW, I'm currently in Korea and the boys perform better in math &amp; science than the girls here as well. It's not necessarily a bad or sexist thing. It's just how it is.

this comment was downvoted but received 30 upvotes. so 30 people thought this was good insight into the issue of women being underrepresented in engineering,

&gt;Men are there to make scientific and engineering progress.
I'm actually serious here, this is not mysoginy talking... are any actual women studying engineering?
We had 12 girls out 300 people in our generation of electrical engineering students. After 2 years... 5 are left. Despite girls getting special attention due to female quota. In university ratings my university always gets its best grades for A HIGH NUMBER OF FEMALE STUDENTS! That means other universities have even less female engineers.

1904,"Say someone needed to go read up on their history and current events before making comments about men working harder for their cookies. Women do most of the world's labor and earn the least pay for it. They make up 50% of the wold's population, yet they account for 70% of the world's poor. Women in places like the Congo get raped so frequently that it becomes a fact of life for them, and you're saying that they have to work harder to ""earn the cookie"" of being able to fetch water for their families without worrying about getting assaulted? 

And until you have experienced what it is like, even in our pampered Western world, to stay at home and raise small children--to give up dreams, careers, hobbies, and time to yourself so that you can clean up poop and listen to small people scream at you all day--you are in no place to say that men work harder. I suffered so much sleep deprivation with my first child that I started hallucinating from it, and had postpartum depression on top of that. For nine whole months after I had the kid. With my second, I experienced a rare hormonal disorder where every time I nursed her, I felt depressed enough to kill myself. Yet, since I gave up the job where I actually earn money when three months pregnant with my second, because it was the best thing to do for my family, that somehow means I've earned less cookies? 

Let me tell you how life went for me the other evening: after a day of screaming, tantrums, diaper changes, grocery shopping, errand-running, vacuuming, scrubbing, and mopping, then making dinner while my kids bugged me and cried for attention the whole time, I finally got them fed and into the bath. After taking out my one year old and setting her down for 60 seconds, she pooped all over a chair, the kitchen floor, and my shoe. After I put her back in the bath to wash her off, she started drinking the poopy water. And after taking her out again, I got distracted and didn't remember the mess in the kitchen until I was in a different part of the house and started wondering why it smelled like poop. So I cleaned it all up and got some spices simmering on the stove so my husband wouldn't have to smell poop when he got home, before putting the baby to bed and cleaning up after dinner. May I ask what *you* do for a living, that is so much more difficult and makes you so much more deserving than I?

I get up an hour before everyone else, put my own needs last for most of the day, and work weekends when everyone else is taking a break. And yet when I want something simple, like the ability to go to a party or walk home at night without being told that I should expect to be raped and it's my fault if it happens, or to chose my own method of birth control, or to have people see me as something other than a uterus and some boobs--woah there! You haven't worked hard enough to earn those cookies. Those men over there, they've *earned* the right to control their own reproductive system and get drunk at a party without expecting people to blame it on them if they get raped. What, because they can lift more than me? Because having a child doesn't absorb their health and their time the way it does with me?

I don't know what the dynamics of your family are, but I'm assuming your mother led, or leads, a life similar to mine. Possibly harder, depending on your age and income bracket. After all, most US mothers who spend just as much time working for pay as their husbands still do the majority of the childcare and housework. You are telling me that your mother hasn't worked hard enough to earn as many ""cookies"" as you? As much dignity, safety, and say over her body and her future as you?  For shame.

I have three rules for tolerating religion — don't use religion as an excuse for hate and bigotry, don't use it against science, and don't push it on non-believers through politics. These rules are also generally agreed on in /r/atheism.

If your family doesn't hate homosexuals or think atheists will burn in hell, then I don't think a majority of atheists would have any problem with them.

In my experience there are several parallells between atheism and feminism. Sexism also makes people angry. Feminism also lashes out at the people, structures and organizations that perpetuate the bigotry and myths that they oppose. The passion a feminist with conviction feels can easily be mistaken for hate, especially when you hear the internal discussions of the group.

2015,"The comments about fathers no longer loving their wives were probably looking at it backwards even then, and almost certainly where I am nowadays. 

Without children, both partners are likely to be working: that should mean that there won't be any alimony or similar payments. The main costs of divorce would be the loss of economies of scale and possibly some of his share of the investment  in the household assets. This means that if he no longer loves his wife, a divorce is entirely sensible.

Conversely, with children there is more pressure to remain married. Apart from concern for the emotional well-being of the children, he would expect to lose much more money. It is much more likely that the mother will have taken off at least a few years (especially back then) so there will be at least temporary spousal support, and the risk (whether perceived or actual) of getting screwed with respect to custody, visitation, and child support. This means that even from a purely selfish point of view, divorce is unlikely to be a good idea.

Since someone who is cheating is going to need to need to meet his (or her) lover(s) away from the places frequented by his own set, whereas someone who  is divorced or unmarried can date in his usual haunts, it seem likely that the older men the source was attracted to were those filtered from their peers by the fact that they were cheating.

2016,"&gt;It's considered rude form in many ethics systems to discriminate as a result of intrinsic qualities such as this.

Part of the problem is that, even with the ACA, the US health funding system doesn't work as either a social benefit (priced on the basis of income) nor as an open capitalist system (priced on the combination of market forces and expected payout), because the actual policyholder can't usually shop around. 

If there were an open, competitive market for insurance without anti-discrimination provisions, one would expect to see that, once prices settle, the prices would be based on the specific risks as near as can be estimated for that person: someone who is predisposed to have diabetes will be charged more, a woman will be charged more, a person with vision problems, and so on. If men start going to see doctors more and earlier, their premiums will rise accordingly. That is fair, in an utterly amoral way. 

If all discrimination on the basis of intrinsic differences were banned, insurance pricing would have to ignore most of the key risk factors except diet/exercise, smoking, drinking, and sexual activity (and that would be an absolute minefield). Age could reasonably be permitted too, since once such a system were in place everyone would be both young and old.

The archetypal tweet is something boring and narcissistic like ""cutting my nails"" or ""just tripped over a rock"", and doesn't include topic names or hashtags. But then a reply could be: ""@phapha who cares about your nails? #BoringSpam #BigWhoop #phaphaSaysTheDarndestThings"".",phapha,2012-03-23 05:47:31,2015-07-01 05:26:22,,t1_c43uojk,feminisms,3,1,2015-07-01 05:26:22
2026,"They didn't step on her toes in the *conversation* (at first, anyways). They stepped on her toes by being associated with a sexist video. I know it's an extreme example, but imagine a black man coming across a known member of the KKK, and yelling at the member for being a racist piece of shit. If your first reaction is to go ""wow, the member wasn't doing anything and being quite polite. The Black man's point would have been so much better if he treated the KKK member with respect"" you have your priorities messed up. We know the KKK is fucking awful and people have a reason to be passionately offended by them. Likewise to a smaller extent, we know this woman had a concrete reason for being upset with geeklist from the get go. Even if she was rude and made them feel bad, that's a technicality compared to the offense the group she's being mean commits in having a video making the majority of an entire demographic uncomfortable.  

The reason tone argument is important to understand and call out is that it's often used to derail. You can see it clearly in the conversation of the original content for this thread. Rather than actually addressing her concerns, the majority of the conversation was about her seeming aggressive. They didn't want to talk about their sexist video, instead they wanted to paint the person pointing out they had a sexist video as a bad guy. Regardless of your opinion on her tone, the fact that the tone became the topic of conversation rather than the sexist video is really demonstrative of how people try to get minorities to shut up. The next biggest one (and one you could also see in the conversation, meaning it'd probably be their major one if she had been sunshine and sparkles in her approach) is saying that it doesn't bother people they know thus she's imagining any offense or just being oversensitive. 

It's usually a lose-lose situation. If you're aggressive you get told you need to be nice. If you're not aggressive you get ignored or told it's not a big deal.",gerwalking,2012-03-23 02:58:04,2015-04-09 10:57:47,,t1_c43xqxg,feminisms,7,1,2015-04-09 10:57:47

2074,":( Wow. The truth. It must hurt.

Male privilege has been with us for how long? a thousand years? ten thousand? So having even a bit of chance to talk frank about our sexcapades is pretty freaking cool, and we're aloud to be emotional about it. Including flippant, sarcastic, angry, rude and even resentful. Even all at the same time! If you're so sensitive to men's fee fees than try browsing the rest of the internet. Or watching tv. Or walking outside. 

The patriarchy is what dictates that men are impervious to having feelings, so if some guy happened to get turned into another forgettable sex toy by a woman, you don't get to blame the lady.
If a woman or some women say “All men are sex-crazed beasts” it does not take away the power that men have. They will not be oppressed or made lesser.

Men experiencing individual instances of prejudice is not on the same level as women systematically being portrayed as lesser to the extent that they are kept in a lower social/economical state than the average man.
When you are privileged, “similar” experiences simply do not happen on an equal footing because they do not otherwise reflect marginalisation.

Also, The article ain't sexist. Sexism = prejudice + power. A woman can’t be sexist towards a man because women don’t have the institutional power to do so due to historical oppression.

Oh and you're condescending too!:
""So, don't worry about pleasing everyone. Instead, try to find someone who appreciates you as an individual.""
aw...how kind of you to share this advice that no lady has ever heard before! You are so right, we really should find someone like that! You know what's funny though? No matter how wonderful a guy is, they've internalized some really poisonous crap. So every once in a while they say or do something that really shakes you because you’re no longer totally certain they see you as a human being, and you feel totally disempowered to explain that to them.

It seems that you've missed the point Emily's making here. So you've used the classic case of  ‘I can’t attack your argument, so I’ll have to attack you’. cool. cool cool cool.

The Act contributes directly to the continued bias against men with regards to violence socially, legally, and in terms of resources available. It continues the assumption that male suffering isn't worth addressing. It continues to treat men as naturally abusers and encourages women to feel naturally like victims.

The Act does not subject women who make false claims to perjury, there is no punishment for falsely reporting any sort of abuse, particularly because things like, ""Negative looks"" and ""Name calling"" qualify as abuse, of course, only when men are accused of doing it. No proof needed, just say you are afraid of the man and he will never see the kids again.

2093,"I haven't heard that episode, but I have read the transcript on a blog somewhere, can't find the link. 

I'm not denying the influence of hormones on behavior. But I am saying that cultural messages can amplify those effects. 

When a study is done on alcohol or caffeine, in addition to a control group that gets none of the substance and is told they are not ingesting it, there is often a group that gets a plain drink but is told it is caffeinated or alcoholic - because the expectation that a person is drinking alcohol or caffeine will change their behavior. And researchers want to separate out behavior caused by the *idea* that one is getting buzzed and what the actual effects of the substances are. Of course, caffeine and alcohol can and do change your brain and body chemistry. But those effects are amplified by all of our cultural messages and personal ideas about them. 

A person taking hormones will change - that's the point of taking them. But some of those changes are going to be a result of that person's ideas and expectations of the effects that the hormones will have. Or, in response to those changes.

2103,"I agree with the central thesis of this article, that men do not seem as interested in the finer details of women's beautification. I find myself wondering why women wear uncomfortable shoes for hours a day that could potentially lead to messed up toes, blisters, and even back problems. I hope they wouldn't go to all that trouble on 'my' account (my meaning me as a typical dude). The thick make-up, the bleached hair, in some cases even the bleached anus... none of that stuff interests me in any way, shape or form. I hope I've never given the indication to any girl or woman (or boy or man) that I expect them to go to extraordinary measures of changing their appearance or being really uncomfortable in order for me to find them attractive. 

The way it's argued, though, is more than a little problematic. I'm not so sure it's true Ms. Emily could go out and find a guy to 'stick it in'. If she did, imagine the man in that situation. He's an experiment, valued really only as data to support an argument. I ask this with a straight face: what kind of man goes to bed with a woman who doesn't value him? Moreover, what kind of person goes to bed with a person that doesn't value that first person? It makes me wonder if it's an issue of low self-esteem, or perhaps they're just much different from me, sexually, and I have no right to judge them. 

I think the point of the article could have been made without that kind of comment. And the last line, ""Real men don't give a shit if you miss a patch."", is a No True Scottsman if I've ever seen one, and it undermines the argument. Initially the argument isn't about 'real' men, but about men in general. I like the argument that men in general don't care all that much about beautification, but this idea that 'real' men don't care about it seems to shift it from a tendency to an ideal or goal. 

You know what would work great in this article? Interviewing a few men. Had I been interviewed, I gladly would have told her that putting on foundation or lip gloss or even spanx (yep, dudes know about spanx thanks to 30 Rock and that young woman billionaire; there's even spanx for men now) shouldn't be done on my behalf, in fact it might even be a negative because it can play into objectification culture.

&gt;People who want to stop abortion can make a difference with education, counseling and genuine efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies and support child-rearing.

In last year’s report “Failing its Families,” Human Rights Watch wrote that at least 178 countries have national laws guaranteeing paid maternity leave. The exceptions include Swaziland, Papua New Guinea and the good ole United States of America.  Working on real issues that actually support the family values these protesters say they hold so dear is one way to stop abortions.

2128," I liked a lot of the response up to a point... but then it delves into what I would consider to be commonly accepted but rather heavy handed ideas of misogyny. 

&gt; It's because they feel entitled to have women in a submissive position to them. They want to live in a world where women are considered automatically dumber, where women are expected to clean up after them, wipe their brows, and kiss their asses, all with a smile on our faces and without asking much more in return but an occasional bit of jewelry and a door-opening, which is just as much about the man feeling more powerful as it is about being nice to the woman.

I feel they are heavy handed because I look around at *all* of my straight male friends and I really have a hard time believing that any of them would perpetuate this rather horrific notion. 

So it forces me to ask the question. Is it intentional? Do we do it to ourselves in some rather subtle ways? (It feel like we all probably carry some slightly misogynistic ideas that it's the collective butterflies that creates a tornado.)

And in some sense the cracked article does touch on the hint of an idea (while entirely missing the mark). I have to wonder if Hanlon's razor applies to misogyny. 

&gt; ***Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.***

I was watching some Christopher Hitchens (his comments about the solution to poverty made me think of this subreddit. I will probably post it later) recently and there was a point he made (or quoting another evolutionary biologist perhaps) where he conveyed the idea that we were in essence barely sentient creatures. 

It is the religious among us that would have us believe that we are in full control of our faculties because an over emphasis on freewill. The evolutionary biologist/naturalists among us might recognise that we are more subject to our natures that we give ourselves credit for.

I am not saying that we don't have free will or that our reason doesn't have the ability to override our nature. We are certainly ""civilized"". However, for those who don't spend a great deal of time being self-critical or forced to consider issue that might affect them, the concepts of inequality might never come up. 

So surface ideas that are ultimately wrong may never get challenged. I recently got into a rather lengthy debate with someone who refused to acknowledge trans people because he felt that genetics were always an overriding default to gender regardless of how someone felt. It was a frustrating argument to have but I could see how he came to his incorrect conclusion. It was hard to move him on what he say was overwhelming evidence against gender dysphoria.

I'm not entirely sure what the solution is. Certain the Religious Right seems to play the pathos (emotional) argument over the Logos (rational) argument. I gotta wonder if we shouldn't take different tactics. Australia had a great marriage equality ad because it appealed to emotion. I think it was quite effective. (regardless of the obvious flaws about pretty people only deserving to be happy but I digress).

2166,"&gt; so you dont want a guy to eat you out? 

I'm not into guys, so no. Also, Wong isn't using this as a metaphor for cunnilingus, but for sex in general (well, maybe PiV sex in particular, as per his ""humping"" reference). 

Also, why are you trying to infer my desires from the fact that posing women as consumable makes me uncomfortable?

&gt; umm i think a huge population of women absolutely knows the important relationship between hunger and desire for the other sex as well as romance novelists and the millions who read them. 

You're invoking the bandwagon fallacy here, but in service of what? My objection is to the metaphor of sex with food, particularly of the sexuality of *women* with food, because food is a material product to be consumed and women are not. The number of people who do or don't buy into that construction are immaterial to whether I like it or not.

&gt; hunger, appetite etc are constantly used in relation to sexual desire for a reason. you dont crave that cake or steak from your stomach (unless you are starving). you crave it becuase of how good it will make you feel when it happens and how it will satiate a temporary desire. same with sex.

You have a point. Sex and hunger are very similar drives, as the psychological study of motivation and emotion recognizes. The reward value of sex and the reward value of food in our brains are, if not interchangeable, similar in function. But that's not what I take issue to. What I'm taking issue with is women being metaphorically posed as food.

I don't quite know what you're saying in that second sentence there; we don't crave food from our stomachs any more than we crave sex from our genitalia. Trivially, even when you're starving, you experience that in your brain, and your brain is capable of suppressing hunger pangs. You are also capable of consciously ignoring them. This goes for sex as well.

We acknowledge that hunger influences us (and it had better, lest we starve), but who seriously accuses sandwiches of being out there to tempt them? We may say food near to us is distracting, but we don't argue that the food is self-aware and is willfully using its succulence to distract us from work or conversation. But this is the belief about women that Wong is describing; women know the effect they have on men and they're doing it on purpose, wah. Only a very few people can credibly claim that they are *powerless* over their desire for food. I don't think there's grounds for Wong to claim that men are similarly powerless against their sexual urges.

In any event, Wong stretches the ""cast-away sees fellow cast-away as talking porkchop"" metaphor in service of his contention that attractiveness makes men feel powerless over women (something I don't agree with). Given the cisheterocentrism of the article, a more direct recasting would be ""men so starved for sex they start to see other men as women."" But then, to be played that straight then there would have to be a scarcity of women around.

2201,"&gt;seems like the solution to this is to simply not have children. Women have that choice. Being a Parent by its nature involves some level of self sacrifice from both mom AND dad.

Being a parent *in the real world* most of the time means *vastly more sacrifice* if you're a mom then if you're a dad.  Dads are the *best dad ever* if they do a fraction of what their female partners do.  

A man can easily be a parent and still have an independent life of his own, losing little or nothing of his personal identity and outside life.  He is not socially defined by being a dad, its just one of the things he does.  He can go to work and expect his partner to take care of his child, and, as an added bonus, since she's not working or working less, she'll usually be expected to do most of the housework and perhaps cooking too!  This is not the case for every family but it is certainly typical and definitely something a man can get if he wants it.

For a woman however, it would be nearly impossible to get that arrangement.  The best she could hope for is some vague equality - one that will never really be equal because equal child care taking would still amount to greater sacrifice on her part since she bore all the physical sacrifice and her partner had none of it.  So to actually be an equal sacrifice, her male partner would have to do *more* than half the childcare - something extraordinarily unlikely.  Most likely however, a mother's life will be somewhat restricted after having a child - she will do most of the care for it and therefore lose work and productivity at work over it - a mother's ability to maintain an independent social life without the kid or her husband is usually sharply curtailed because responsibility, in our patriarchal society, for figuring out what to do with the kid is hers.  It is actually socially **unseemly** for a new mother to be out socializing late while leaving her child with some professional caretaker - not so at all with fathers. Being a mother almost always constitutes a very central part of one's identity if they are a mother, they are no longer [their first name] but [son/daughter's mom].  

No, the solution is to eliminate the privilege men have in this arena and to create a society where women can, like men, choose to have children without having to lose their independent lives and identities.",critropolitan,2012-04-11 23:18:05,2015-04-10 21:43:56,,t1_c4b0ayf,feminisms,0,1,2015-04-10 21:43:56

2218,"The executive branch in Brazil is moving towards interpretable law.  The judicial branch is resisting this.  The court has thrown out a number of convictions based on vague criminal statutes (more on this later).

The key-phrase to identify this constitutional tug-of-war is ""não se admite critérios subjetivos"", which means ""subjective factors are not acceptable.""

In this case, the law established an absolute lower limit of 14 years for consent-competency ... BUT in some situations the limit can be more than 14 years.  The court did not like this.  The judges extended the reasoning, stating ""what matters ... is not what is written on the identification document of the child or adolescent, but how they behave themselves.""

In other words, if subjective factors can result in an increase in the 14 year limit, then the justices ruled that subjective factors must also allow a decrease in the 14 year limit.

This whole thing started with dissatisfaction about fast-tracking of ""environmentally friendly"" infrastructure projects.  Specifically, several Amazon dams were approved under a fast-track law that allows reduced scrutiny for projects with small impoundments and large remediation budgets.  The supreme court is unhappy about this, and wants to move away from interpretable ""fuzzy"" law.

There are books and books on this, but to try to summarize it in two examples: 

1. My piano teacher was this old Russian woman who grew up in the Crimea.  In her village, all the very old women walked with a severe limp.  
The reason was that when the Turks invaded, they raped all the women and cut their Achilles tendon on the right side so that for the rest of their lives people would know they were trash that had been 'violated' by Turks.  
Sex was used a weapon to shame the entire community, not just the women.

2. In Afghanistan, a man stole another man's property.  To punish him, they raped his sister.  This rendered his property spoiled and thus worthless to sell to a husband later.  

In both cases, the bodies of women are merely property or tools for men to use to shame each other.  This is not uncommon in human history.  ",passwordrememberfail,2012-02-20 03:57:05,2015-04-07 05:39:54,,t1_c3sxj6c,feminisms,14,0,2015-04-07 05:39:54

4038,"They are both tasteless. However, using ""rape"" goes far beyond the tactless/tasteless/inappropriate nature of using ""murder"" and becomes deeply offensive and hurtful because murder, at least, is actively prosecuted in our (American) culture with very few grey areas. It's something that we all know is wrong, and we have legislation and authority backing that up.

However, while we can all agree in a broad way that *rape is bad*, the way rape is popularly perceived is horrifically medieval. Date rape is practically culturally sanctioned. Victim blaming is a thousand times more rampant in rape cases.

Therefore, it seems to me to be a double insult to use ""rape"" as a metaphor so casually, because the reality of the matter is that rape victims will have an incredibly difficult time at every stage of dealing with the crime, and most of the flak will come from the people who are supposed to help you.",[deleted],2012-02-20 00:37:42,2015-04-07 05:23:42,,t1_c3svp7g,feminisms,27,0,2015-04-07 05:23:42

4088,"&gt;Lloyd, whose heritage is Anglo and Roma, eloquently describes the role that race and class play in the popular understanding of sex trafficking. Girls who are trafficked across borders are thought of as victims, and so are white, middle-class American girls. But the black and Latina girls with whom Lloyd works are thought to have chosen their life, to be oversexed or scheming or too lazy to do anything but sell themselves. They are referred to as young adults, even when they are far under 15, and cops call their rapes “theft of services.” Even though federal law says that anyone under the age of 18 who is sold for sex is a victim of severe trafficking, with no need to prove coercion or force, if the girl is an American and of color, she will too often be arrested, charged with prostitution and jailed.

&gt;In a particularly striking section of “Girls Like Us,” Lloyd notes that media attention related to exploited and missing girls matters:

&gt;&gt;    It makes a difference in whether your disappearance gets copters and dogs or flyers. It makes a difference in how you’re treated by a jury of “your peers.” It makes a difference in whether your family members are believed or taken seriously. In over a decade of working with thousands of girls, most of whom have been missing at some point, many of whom were literally kidnapped and held by force, I have never seen a GEMS case that has gotten an Amber Alert.

4154,"This is exactly correct.  

Language, not just ours but all languages, is based on *metaphor*.
This means we'll use a word to capture *some* of the aspects of its original meaning,
but not *all*.

Simple example: Walking down the path of life.  We don't *walk* down life, life is not a *path* guiding
one along a simple direction from point A to point B, but there are more than enough aspects of walking
down a path that we *do* understand our own lives in these terms.

But the author of this quote would object to that.  

So if I object to murder I would want to eliminate the phrase ""murder""
from language when not discussing killing.  ""My team was murdered"" is now an evil sentence.

Killing.  ""Hey, kill the engine a second while I check your tire pressure.""
That's now an evil sentence.

We can go further!  What about the *millions and millions* of people worldwide who are starving to death?  So now we can't use phrases like ""She was starved for attention"".  

Or what about torture, of which rape is a subsection.  ""Tortured by guilt, he confessed.""  This is now an evil sentence.  

Language is infinitely expressive and ANY TIME anyone submits a word or phrase should not be used,
then THEY are the ones who become evil.

As long as we are putting kids in jail for otherwise consensual sex* or even things as simple as taking sexual pictures of themselves and sending them to each other, I think it is pretty clear that our society doesn't want teenage girls to have a sexuality at all.

4159,"&gt; Even President Clinton declared (and many others have embraced) that abortion should be safe, legal and rare. 

I believe that the Democratic Party platform said the same thing up until about 2006. The more recent versions have rather better language:

&gt; The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports *Roe v. Wade* and a woman's right to choose a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay, and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right.

&gt; The Democratic Party also strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age-appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives. We also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions.

&gt; The Democratic Party also strongly supports a woman's decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre- and post-natal health care, parenting skills, income support, and caring adoption programs.",superiority,2012-02-21 05:55:21,2015-04-07 07:24:40,,t3_py905,feminisms,2,0,2015-04-07 07:24:40
4160,"Keeping it rare is actually a good point imo, and for two reasons. One, most women who get an abortion are not in a great position. They may have just been raped, they may be facing terrible financial or emotional difficulties, so I think we can mostly agree that having better access to good sex education, rape prevention programs, and contraceptives which would prevent many potential abortions would be a good thing for many women. The second, and potentially more important reason relates to the pro-life side. Before abortion was legal in the U.S., an estimated 1 million illegal abortions occurred annually, right on par with the number of annual abortions post-*Roe*. So what we can say to pro-lifers is that we're happy to work with them to potentially reduce the number of abortions occurring per year, but that criminalizing abortion is very clearly **not** the best solution, no matter what your opinion on abortion may be.",GoodGrades,2012-02-21 05:29:04,2015-04-07 07:22:43,,t3_py905,feminisms,-1,0,2015-04-07 07:22:43

4185,"Great points.  I totally hear and respect what you're saying, but there is a clarification that I think needs to be made here.  

I'll give you an example from my classroom to explain my concern.  
A student (we’ll call him Joel) expressed at the beginning of this semester that he did not understand why the term ""Indian Giver"" was offensive, since he said it lightly and had not intended it to give offense.  I know that he is a genuinely nice guy who had no malicious intentions. Me just telling him it was ‘offensive’ just meant he wouldn’t do it around me anymore, not that he actually understood why it was offensive. 

We spent a few weeks in the course learning about the brutal realities of Residential Schooling and the history of aboriginal peoples in North America, which many of them did not really know a lot about.  After that, Joel shared a story with me last week.  When Joel was in highschool an aboriginal classmate had dressed for their graduation ceremony in full traditional dress.  Joel and other students had snickered under their breath and made degrading comments about it.  He told me that it was not until this day that he realized why what he had participated in was contributing to oppression, and he would never do something like that again.  At that moment I knew he would never use the term “Indian Giver” again either.  His new knowledge led to a deeper understanding, and ultimately respect. 
Maybe saying “Indian Giver”, or using the word ""rape"" in isolation does not seem like a big deal, it is connected to a narrative of real violence and oppression. You only need to look at bullying and suicide rates for aboriginal students in white-dominant classrooms, or statistics which have been detailed in this thread about the vast occurence of rape.  It is indicative of a greater social problem; in the case of the ""rape"" word, trivializing it indicates more about the society that tolerates that kind of attitude than anything about the personal character or benign intentions of the gamers talking about ""baseraping"".

There's nothing in the ""it gets better"" project that suggests that ""it"" is the world. ""It"" has always been the context of a person that gets better.

They realize that their life isn't as shitty. They get to choose the environments in which they hang out. They have more control over their own lives and thus, life gets better because they have context... a different environment... more choices... All things that makes one life better.

I mean I agree with the sentiment that the author expresses but I think it's a needless attack on a project born of a really simple and elegant idea where Dan Savage after hearing about another gay kid who committed suicide wanted to tell them that life gets better if they just hold out long enough. Because he knows the stories of so many LGBT people where their lives did get better.

Then he realized he *could* tell these youth... through the internet.

""It Gets Better"" isn't a solution. It's not the end of bullying. It's just a collection of stories. It a part of the process so that LGBT kids know they aren't alone. That they can imagine their lives living free from bullying. 

One should never use it as an excuse not to try and fix it for queer teens now... but criticizing the project seems erroneous.

The best thing to say in the face of compulsions is ""so what? Maybe it's a compulsion, but what bearing does that ever have on what we *should* do?"" This is especially true of things that don't really contribute either way to a person's wellbeing, like whether or not they have sex.

Still, sex-positivity, I think, is a legitimate (and legitimately *distinct*) lens for looking at the way sexuality manifests itself both in our culture and between private individuals.

4266,"""sex positive"" is a bullshit term.  There is no such thing as a sex negative feminist.  We all enjoy sex, and we all wish that everybody _could_ enjoy sex, and we wish that sex were not weaponized.  But it _is_ weaponized, and most people have negative experiences _of_ it.  That's not sex-negativity, that's realism.

Know what the purpose of saying ""sex positive"" is?  It's just like saying ""well I'm not one of _those_ kinds of [insert race, minority, Jew, or something here].  You say ""sex positive,"" which describes _nothing,_ for the purpose of eliciting a reaction in your audience members in which they fill in the void with their own pre-conceived stereotypes of what a ""sex negative"" feminist might be.

It's just a subtle way of making a boogieman out of mainstream feminism, so you can make yourself look better, and all other feminists into badguys.

It's uncle tom bullshit, is what it is.

4269,"Gagh!  The reddit ate my comment.  Okay, take two.

I think that historical context is interesting and important in that it informs our understanding of the present, but that it complicates and confuses the usefulness of the terms.  I'll use racism to explain, as it is easier to show.

Under my understanding of the definition, if someone sees someone, and attacks them because of their race, that is racism.

If the attacker faces less or no punishment from the institutions that are supposed to protect everyone, that is institutional racism.

If the attacker's race only gained control of the institutions 50 years ago, I do not think that it changes the attack being racist.

I prefer this for two reasons, the first is that that past has very little utility compared to the present for predicting the future (This would take a long time to explain so you are welcome to either reject it or file it under 'interesting things to try to learn more about later'.  Basically, everything from the past that can affect the future is encoded in the present), and the second is that we can create cost functions for the amount of bigotry in a group (e.g. University campus, workplace, city or country) and try different ways of minimizing it.

It's also a much simpler thing to look at (Okay, maybe this is a third reason).  Who is historically oppressed between Portogie and Filipino?  A Scot and a Greek?  How large does an institution have to be, and how long is history for something to be historical?

4283,"&gt;All true, but **there’s just one thing opponents have left out, or don’t seem fully aware of: Alabama has actually required ultrasounds for abortion patients since 2002. Since the majority of abortions in Alabama, as in other states, take place before eight weeks — when a transvaginal ultrasound is customarily used for a clearer picture — thousands of women may already have been subject to this form of state-mandated “rape” for over a decade.** That legislation, the 2002 “Woman’s Right to Know” act, was challenged in court for other reasons, mostly related to the First Amendment, but eventually upheld. Forced vaginal penetration does not appear to have entered the conversation until the recent uproar in Virginia, using that language, struck a chord. The imagery and subsequent outcry, says Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, was “able to shed light on it in a way a thousand legal arguments can’t.”

&gt;In fact, the relatively novel part of the Alabama legislation rests in the “See” part. As it stands now, the bill, which is expected to go before the state Senate sometime this week, requires not only that an ultrasound be performed before an abortion, but also that the technician or doctor “provide a simultaneous verbal explanation of what the ultrasound is depicting, which shall include the presence and location of the unborn child,” and to “display the ultrasound images so that the pregnant woman may view them.” If the bill becomes law, Alabama will join Texas in having one of the most extreme ultrasound laws in the country — not because of a forced transvaginal ultrasound, which is actually already commonplace in several states. The latest “pro-life” innovation is the state is forcing a woman to look at an image and, where applicable, listen to a fetal heartbeat with the express aim of dissuading her from her choice.

&gt;The pro-choice movement’s legal arm, including the Center for Reproductive Rights, couldn’t get the earlier Alabama law overturned, though it tried. It has, however, been challenging the Texas law sinc",shallah,2012-02-28 21:21:47,2015-04-07 20:06:28,,t3_qa8bf,feminisms,1,0,2015-04-07 20:06:28

The assumption or denial of agency really colors people's reactions, and thus those reactions reflect the societal expectation of agency.

Said adult's agency is recognized societally.

When women challenge the gender paradigm it's considered cute, frivolous, or harmless because of the societal perception which does not recognize women's agency.  When men challenge the gender paradigm it's considered a threat because the actions of men are, societally, given weight and power; their agency is recognized.

Who is the target here? Is it conservative women? Is it congress? Is it the media? Those of us who already agree are not called to action. (IE calling your congresscritters.) Those who disagree are unlikely to watch, and further it doesn't target the opponents' messaging. 

The opponents' messaging is, ""If Catholics' freedom of religion can be abridged because of popular consensus, it establishes a precedent that our freedom of religion can be abridged later, and we'll be forced to stop preaching against gays, hire atheists in our churches, and &lt;insert slippery slope argument here.""

Their contention is that the Church should be the central support structure, however ill-equipped it is to provide such a service to their own communities, much less the greater public.

We, as allies, can't approach the subtext. I believe a good strategy for messaging is a call to action for Evangelical women with these points.

2. As many as 1/3rd of fertilized eggs pass through during a period, never implanted. God obviously does not believe that the fertilized egg is a human being, or he wouldn't allow so many babies to die. (Does anyone have a fact check on this? I remember hearing this at one point.)
3. Our voices matter. Our lives have been improved with birth control. 
4. We have the duty to speak up for those less fortunate than us. (This is the trickiest part, because it gets into some bad stereotypes about poor people and birth control in that community.)

4317,"The point is ""the stink"" was entirely the skeptics/atheists making. She asked politely for men to have respect of aomeone's self-professed boundaries, and enough self-awareness and tact to recognize when someone wanted to be left alone. What she got in response was a lot of loud, brash indignation that turned into drama that was eventually turned around into loud, brash indignation and drama that she herself was somehow responsible for. 

Let me just reiterate--your point is that she is responsible for the stink made over her somewhat innocuous request.

So really, whether or not the guy did anything wrong isn't even the question. The question is whether or not women have the right to set their own personal boundaries, or dictate the terms under which they are romantically propositioned.

The movement's opinion of that request seems to be a resounding FUCK NO. Which is really disappointing, because a tenet of atheism seems to be ""I have the right not to be preached to against my will. I have the right not to hear all this crap codified and legitimized by people in higher positions of authority than me. I have the right to control the my filter of the world.""

Either way, it would be misleading to say that it's for all forms of contraception and sterilization. Obviously you'll never get a prescription for some forms of contraception. 

EDIT: It took me forever to find [this](http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2010/07/preventive-services-list.html). It does appear that more than just BC pills are covered. All contraception methods for women that are FDA approved are covered. This still leaves the condom comparison relevant. 

It seems that the mandate only applies to women, [talked about here](http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2012/february/27/five-questions-health-law-mandate-birth-control.aspx). That's pretty short sighted and one sided, as it's completely possible that FDA approved contraception and sterilization methods will be developed for men in the future. Why aren't vasectomies covered? It is a method of sterilization.

Also, pointing out that the cost of the contraception is not the only important point is not an argument for why BC pills should be completely covered .

It's an easy decision for you. You go ""oh sweet, my contraception won't cost me anything anymore"", but as it has been mentioned in the past, there are also men involved. Even if men weren't the vast majority, you still would have to frame your argument on why BC pills should be covered at all in a way that takes into consideration the comparative effectiveness, cost, and current support of other contraception methods. In addition to this overall economics should be considered. 

Just because BC pills are good, doesn't necessarily mean that completely covering them is something the government should be mandating, and honestly, I haven't seen much actual discussion on the issue yet.

Instead our options are taken away from us, for reasons that I can only imagine are not for our benefit. 

I'm not sure, but probably the only reasons we don't have this control over our own money is because insurance companies want to force as many people to buy into insurance as possible. I'm not sure exactly how it works, but with this little information, that's my best guess as to how the current system has come about.

Yes, they are. It's being marketed that way. That's what pisses me off. Women are often being told by the people marketing this surgery that it IS for men. As a man, from a man's perspective, I would like for women to know--don't undertake this surgery on my account. That was kinda my whole point. I'll continue to broadcast that opinion to anyone who will listen. 

Many interviews that I have seen have young, sometimes *very* young adolescent women concerned that men see them as ugly, unclean, or any number of things that largely just aren't true. These women are being preyed upon by those exploiting a teen's often fragile self-image.

But yeah, I had a few drinks in me last night and I was pissed off at the way this is being presented by some in the medical profession--so, I came off pretty aggressive. I agree wholeheartedly with the interaction between you and MissCherryPi earlier. If a woman has come to a decision to do this for any reason, more power to her. But there's an active selling going on that is fundamentally predatory, and *that* I am against. 

I'm certainly no expert myself, and while we may disagree on some things my intentions are good, I support all decisions women come to for themselves and their bodies. I do, however, like being part of the conversation.

 I hope to interact with you again. :)",texanwill,2012-03-07 20:26:51,2015-04-08 09:15:45,,t1_c3yloy5,feminisms,1,0,2015-04-08 09:15:45

I'm not policing anyone's body. The New View Campaign produced a video about the way these surgeries are marketed. Then an actual Vaginal Surgery Consultant claimed that reality vaginal cosmetic surgery nothing like the video. So I just pointed out all of the ways her rhetoric is exactly the same as what New View is criticizing. 

I've never said that women shouldn't have this done if that's what they want. I just think that a lot of people who get this surgery don't know that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have said it's dangerous, AND that there is a wide range of shapes and sizes of labia that are natural. That's why I'm for FTC regulation of how this is advertised.

The uneducated atheist tells us that because he was raised to obey rules that make no sense to him, and taught these rules in ways that did not better him as a person, the entire religion is defunct and should be abolished. But he didn't retain any of the knowledge about the religion or its history/customs, and refuses to consider possibilities other than whatever was shoved down his throat when he was too young to understand it.

Our culture in the United States has granted much privilege to white, heteronormative Christian males. But if I fit into three of those categories instead of four, I'm in virtually the same privilege boat as nearly any other person who is any combination of three. Social privilege doesn't really stem from religion; they stem from something else within us all. We are all capable of hatred, intolerance and bigotry. Some of us choose to use religion to reinforce it. Some of us choose to use *the lack of* religion to reinforce it - and there, you have the /r/atheism community, in my experience.

They're just a very embittered people, /r/atheism. They come from a culture that rejects and reviles them, in most cases - assuming the majority of them are Americans. I understand why they might feel that way, I just think that as long as the community is full of young people - the way the site is just churning in new young people every day, keeping the demographic young - no one there can offer the insights of anyone who has moved past the anger. It's okay to be angry, at first. But so much anger only leads to more of the same.",marshmelo,2012-03-12 19:53:08,2015-04-08 17:05:05,,t1_c409vq0,feminisms,1,0,2015-04-08 17:05:05

In 2005 that amounted to 1,181 women, or three women every day.

4584,"&gt; Some people, feminists included, are *doing it wrong*. I fully accept that. Militant feminism, brutal denigration of men, etc., is not the right way.

The reason why I don't really think it's worth talking about ""militant feminism"" and the deliberate misandrists is because they barely exist. It's the most marginal group within feminism and has virtually no power whatsoever in society—other than the power vested in them by the patriarchy so that they can be used to defame feminism. They have no political influence to speak of.

Besides that, a lot of these so-called misandrists, if you bother looking at what they write and how they think, are really just being deliberately facetious about the whole thing. It's a way of reminding people that *actual* gender hatred (namely, the kind that men perpetrate, which is the only one worth talking about) does exist and is worthy of condemnation.

If a woman decides to stop having sex halfway through and the guy forces her to continue, that is still rape. Unfortunately that's not what I hear around Men's Rights sites. ""It was her fault,"" ""she was the one making out with him,"" and that sort of thing, seem to come up a lot. It's as if they think that because there are some cases where the woman has used rape accusations as a tool to harm others, that means that all rape cases should be instead treated as if the woman is guilty of false accusation until she proves she's innocent. 

As for ""chivalry"", now there is a system that ultimately benefits no one. Chivalry was a code of behavior for knights in the Middle Ages that dictates how one was supposed to show respect to other knights. This included showing respect to the other knights through the way you treated things that belonged to them, such as their horses, serfs, and wives. That's right, chivalry is all about treating women and horses in a way that won't offend their owners. It was romanticized in the Victorian era and turned into the nasty pedestal people take it for today. I would like for it to go away, for everyone's sake.

Someone comes and gives the group with five cookies another five, so they have just as many as the first group. Now the first group starts complaining. Why is the other group getting more cookies? It's not fair! Those cookies should be taken away so that things can be fair again.

Men's Rights is like that.

Our culture discriminates against both sexes. Men are sometimes labeled as stupid, lacking sexual self control, and being unable to do things like parent and cook, when if any of these things are the case it is purely because men have been raised to believe that they are this way. The pressure that men in more conservative subcultures receive to be the sole providers for their family is enormous, and has a tendency to absorb their entire identity. This is not to the same level as women experience with being moms, but it is still a real problem. There is still work to be done on both sides. But this is not the same as believing that rights are being taken away from men. Privileges? Yes. It's certainly a privilege to have a wife that is legally considered your property, who legally can't refuse sex with you, can't divorce you, can't cheat on you but is forced to watch you do whatever you'd like, who is expected to take care of the children, run errands, cook, and clean all day, be fresh for you when you come home, keep working while you rest, and then have sex after the kids go to bed. That is what things were like for women 100 years ago. The Men's Right's movement wants that back. Seeing the women with an equal number of cookies makes them feel like they have less now, so they want those cookies taken away so things can be the way they were.

One common misconception by westerners about Israel (among many) is that it's a left right spectrum of extreme/not extreme where on the left you have the gay rights/women's rights/anti-theist socialists and on the right you have war mongering genocidal religious jews. 

The religious have absolutely no interest in the perpetuation of the state of Israel. The only reason they live on that land is because of it's religious significance (which means very little to the government). I'm having a hard time typing this without grimacing, but essencially they pay fewer taxes, get more welfare, have more children, and thrive off of the securaty of a nation they couldn't give enough of a shit about to stand up and defend. This is also why they live in the West Bank, which is essentially Palestinian territory (Israel owns the land for security reasons, but it's really *for* Palestinians). 

It's also worth noting that even in Ramat Bet Shemesh, which is the even more religious subset of Bet Shemesh, the ""spitters"" are in the minority.

The Israel/Palestine conflict is what most of the world sees, but the Israeli population has a huge rift between the secular majority and the religious minority. And the religious themselves are diced up into so many sub-sects that it's hard to deal with any problem rationally without a massive cultural overhaul. The reason the religious are allowed to stay so separate is when the state of Israel was founded religious jews seemed to be dying out. An extinction of the [Shtetl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtetl)   era of judaism would have been a victory for the oppressors the early zionists were trying so hard to overcome. David ben Gurion set up many laws and rules (most notably that religious are exempt from military service) in order to keep the religious protected and sustainable. He did his job a little too well, and with an average of over 5 kids a couple (and personally I have seen numbers up from ten) they have expended to become a fairly strong minority in the Israeli population that no one really knows how to deal with.

They both show up for the rescue, both express interest in her, but she basically insults both of them and the climax is the battle scene, not any sort of romance scene.

In Empire, they are both competing for her, but it's pretty clear that she's interested in Solo (even the kiss is a way to piss of Han instead of reflecting any feeling for Luke). Yoda indicating that ""there is another"" (aka Leia is Luke's sister), is also in this movie. The movie ends with the ""I love you"" ""I know"" exchange, establishing the Han/Leia match for good. The notion of Lucas retconning the kiss and Leia's interest in Luke and switching to Solo for Jedi doesn't make any sense, because it all occurs in Empire in the first place.

Jedi just elaborates and solidifies what was already established or hinted at in Empire: that Leia and Han get together and that Luke is Leia's brother.",aetius476,2012-03-28 17:03:09,2015-04-09 20:22:21,,t1_c45i2a4,feminisms,6,1,2015-04-09 20:22:21

This is made easier by the ubiquitous presentation of cis-het white young vanilla male experiences for easy reference. *knowing wink*

I mostly agree with Wong's analysis. I definitely got the ""you'll be rewarded with a woman"" message as a kid. Not so much the ""women have so much power over men because men want sex"", though I've got friends who definitely exemplified that stereotype. He failed to mention how much of masculinity is done by men for the benefit of other men. 

But what I really want to say is: I think these conspiracy theories about women (that they're diabolical temptresses who want to destroy masculinity and overpower the male gender, et cetera) only justify, not cause, the hatred of women, as this article seems to imply. In order to convey this idea, I'm going to engage in a little bit of theater.

Gimme a second to set up my tripod and spooky conspiracy background music. Bear with me. Cambot, dim the lights, please.

James W. Prescott in 1975 published a paper called ""Bodily Pleasure and the Origins of Violence"" in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, about a cross-cultural study of child-rearing practices and violence. He claims that deprivation of bodily pleasure (leaving infants to cry instead of holding them, sexually repressing adolescents) correlates with higher levels of adult violence and increased subjugation of women, among other things. He also found that indulging infants and not hampering sexual exploration was correlated with lower levels of the things he measured (which included mutilation of enemies, theft, and belief in supernatural agents along with commitment to female inferiority, apparently).

More recently, George Lakoff and Johnathan Haidt, commenting independently on the psychological and physical basis of morality, identify two large families of moral systems: nurturant ones where goodness is in preventing harm and giving care, and authoritarian (for lack of a better term) ones where goodness is in enforcing justice and fairness (which necessarily includes punishment). Both are present in society today. Lakoff links this back to two broad models of parenting: nurturant parenting, where your parents support and comfort you; and ""strong father"" parenting, where you are obedient to a legitimate authority who knows how to be good and punishes you for being bad.

Combine this with what we hear from the study of motivated reasoning, or of people whose corpus callosum has been severed, who find we humans to be master rationalizers&amp;mdash;we act or decide first and then tell ourselves stories to explain why&amp;mdash;and it starts to seem reasonable that the conspiratorial beliefs about women Wong describes might just be necessary components of justifying the misogyny our society is already committing and committed to.

Okay, you can turn up the lights again.

(Looking at things this way also changes the way you look at the Republican War on Women. Not favorably, but interestingly.)

As for war itself? I'm pretty damn sure war doesn't exist simply to give men a venue for competition over women. As L. F. Richardson [found](http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/statistics-of-deadly-quarrels/1) and as his successors continue to observe, war is a catastrophe whose causes defy easy analysis. The Carlinesqe ""war is men killfucking each other with surrogate dicks over whose godcountryfather has the bigger dick"" hypothesis is a little simplistic, I think. Which of course, raises the question: what other analytical tools do you bring to bear in trying to understand war?",jdac,2012-03-27 23:46:14,2015-07-01 04:57:55,,t1_c45keo7,feminisms,9,1,2015-07-01 04:57:55

a) He talks about how all the people masturbating in public are guys. But examining the converse is important as well: How many guys do *not* masturbating in public? Using such a small population to make assumptions about ""all guys"" is absurd.

b) Using examples from movies and books is relevant for discussing media influence. But using them as examples of how men actually behave or feel is poor form.

c) In the process of analyzing why some men hate woman, there's more than a subtle hint of ""boys will be boys"" logic. He states that men think with their penis, that they're slaves to their impulses, that their entire thought life revolves around sex and impressing women, etc. He essentially portrays all men as perpetual adolescent boys -- a common theme in media portrayals, I might add.

I.e., my wife surprised me with a before-work BJ this morning, so I feel like I'm on an even keel.  Yesterday, however, I was acutely aware that the presenter in a meeting was a very attractive young woman, and I had this internal dialogue going along the lines of ""Yes, she looks good, that doesn't justify you being an asshole and ignoring the presentation!""

4787,"Despite not being one, I can access a heterosexual vanilla young male experience enough to think this is a good analysis.  A very good analysis, if you take the summary points.    The summary is not ""men think about sex all the time"", it's: men feel powerless, think manhood was stolen from them, believe in the promise of getting the hot chick, view women as decoration, think women tempt them to ruin.   

In general this kind of analysis, heavy on the, let's call it women's street sense is I think the right way to understand the current gender system.   A lot of our old institutional 70s feminist academic rhetoric doesn't get at the modern essences.  

Other examples... the good points in and best summary of the scum manifesto are not, e.g. ""women want to kill men"", it's ""men secretly envy the richness of female social experience, and sublimate that into sex"".  I think there's useful street smart analysis like, men are afraid if they aren't slightly vanilla dominant over women they are actually gay.   ""Men create wars because of their penises"" is an underused analytical tool. 

Really, study this article, it's worth understanding.   I was very young and very closeted when I felt some of these ways, but I did at that time, and many of these things are core for understanding patriarchy now.

4792,"To some extent men undergo those same thought processes, but in my experience the sexual inadequacy comes into play quite a bit more. Most of my young (geeky) college friends went through a period where they saw it both as the world lying to them, and as them failing. They tended to go through the entire introspective mess, questioning themselves, and at the same time they'd blame the world. They'd say the world hadn't been fair, that they still deserved a girl, but that the world had raised the bar and added extras. They clinged to the fantasy that they deserved something for working hard, that the world was just and giving. So that bar was raised, and then they'd look harder at themselves and because they live a life flooded with sex and shows of bravado would assume that they were not meeting the standards for sex and masculinity. And to some extent that works. They work on being more confident, more aggressive, which allows them to convince women to give them a chance. But then there's the feeling of being less powerful. Suddenly life is about winning women, being a man to become the knight and be the hero to meet the standards of the world that were raised.

And then you get the jerks. The ones that, even if they're succeeding, can't realize why they feel so compelled to keep chasing the dream. They decide that because they're doing everything right, it must be the other party at fault. So they hate women, because life isn't fair.

Eventually, some men realize that life isn't fair, that they need to be outgoing and confident and so forth, but hopefully they come to the conclusion that if life isn't fair and they still don't get what they want that they need to just be rational and accept it and move on. But others, and these are the ones that set bad examples, cry and attack and blame because they just never see the problem is within themselves and that the world owes them nothing.

Sorry if that was hard to follow. Basically, guys go through the introspection, but latch onto masculinity and sex as their failing so they can continue to believe they're owed someone.",ohgeronimo,2012-03-27 19:15:49,2015-04-09 18:37:43,,t1_c45j3w1,feminisms,7,1,2015-04-09 18:37:43

It was like thinking about Christmas the night before. I knew it wasn't helping, but the smallest curve of the female body would set me off. All I had to do was acknowledge one small thing and my body wouldn't let me relax and act natural. The only way to stifle that was to develop a healthy personal sex life, which unfortunately did make me more aroused mentally. I finally managed to control it by seriously dating and being committed to a relationship. But for so many young men I knew, they weren't ready to take that route and instead just suffered with the awkward way their bodies reacted to an adult environment like University.

If anything, it seems comparable to the ticking biological clock some women tell of.

4816,"&gt; Why is this a false equivalency, and could you give an example of something that isn't a false equivalency?

I don't think there's anything you can use in the place of rape when we're talking about this subject.

The obvious difference is that being punched in the face is a million times more preferable to being raped. So it becomes easier to decide to not legally pursue it. But more importantly, there are different social processes at play in the case of assault. We're at the doorstep of sociology here so I won't go into the details, but while rape victims tend to be vilified and distrusted, female assault victims from male assailants get a greater deal of support from men due to their perceived gender role of fighter.

Yes, that's a major double standard, and there are all sorts of complex reasons for why this occurs, but suffice it to say that different crimes have different sociological backgrounds, which sometimes makes them hard to compare when we're discussing cultural implications. This isn't entirely an accurate description, and I'm completely disregarding other important facts pertaining to violence (which is another very important type of oppression that men carry out against women), but it serves as an illustration.

I should note that not truly understanding what rape is (which a lot of us don't, including myself) doesn't disqualify you from trying to empathize (I think this is the word you mean, instead of ""sympathize"") and educate yourself. There are lots of experiences that we lack but still have to deal with in some capacity. I'll never truly understand racism, either, since I'm not part of an oppressed demographic, but I can still try to suspend my own judgment and hopefully gain some semblance of an understanding of what it is. People are more capable of it than they might think, as long as they're willing to spend some time educating themselves.

&gt; I don't know how you see things, but generally any time that I hear of a sexual assault or rape, the only thing I hear from peers is 'report it, report it, talk to the cops, go to the police, you should talk to someone about it', and never have I heard 'don't report it, suck it up'.

People don't really outright say ""don't report it"", in part because those who actually make a conscious decision to visit the victim are usually those who do so in order to offer their support. This is about a cultural bias towards the assailant's side of the story. We might be talking about someone reading a newspaper article about something that happened on the other side of the country.",dada_,2012-04-06 21:01:33,2015-04-10 12:40:29,,t1_c499ng8,feminisms,1,1,2015-04-10 12:40:29

Why is this a false equivalency, and could you give an example of something that isn't a false equivalency?

4826,"&gt;It's also telling that you don't require him to say yes. Double standards.

No, I don't require him to say yes when he starts the sex. Now I know you're trying to be an idiot.


But for other people reading here later, I'll add that rape isn't about sex, rape is an act of violence, psychologically as much as physically. Rape is also about control, and loss of control.


If you want to talk about stop having been rendered useless, he was the one that did so and took away her control of the situation. He should have stopped, or seeked enthusiastic consent after the very first time she said stop.

He took away a part of her control over the situation, and the rest was taken by what we call 'rape culture'. Rape culture is that which puts the onus on the girl to 'put out' after a few/a single date. Rape culture is where women are simultaneously told to dress nicely for a date or be a horrid unlovable bitch, and that by dressing nicely she was 'asking for it'. Rape culture is the pressure on women not to seem 'cold'. 

Oh, hey, that sounds familiar, almost as if she wants him to stop, but feels societal pressure to continue and make light of the situation, ie: by tickling, even after she's said stop. And last time I heard, tickling wasn't an unambiguous way of saying ""Please fuck me now"", otherwise we have a lot of disturbed moms and toddler tummies out there. 


And then he's already shown her that he doesn't respect her calls to stop. That's not 'breaking down resistance', that's making her feel as though she has no control over the situation. Now what are her options? Being called a stone cold frigid bitch &amp; socially ostracized, or continue. Great. It's not as if calling rape doesn't get her called that, because people still question her about the rape and why she didn't stop it, or conversely, if she stops before the rape, then she's accused of calling rape falsely. She calls rape, she's socially ostracized. She stops the rape in a more friendly manner, she's still ostracized. (Btw, only 2%-8%, setting dependant (average very close to 2%), of claimed rape cases are ever found possibly false). That's also part of rape culture. And again, people, like you, tell her she was 'asking for it'. 

The effect is so drastic, that ~60% of rape cases are never reported by the victim, because they believe the police will not believe or sympathize with them. 


(edit: I felt I should add to this, to make it a bit clearer. *As a psychological assault*, rape diminishes the victim's feelings of control far below what they can actually control. What happens thereafter is the actions of a mentally compromised person.  For example, they will grasp at any method of control they see. So with one story, we have a young girl who was raped by her riding instructor repeatably, but she used that to get free riding lessons. Does that mean she wasn't actually raped? No, that means that mentally she needed some way of justifying or controlling what was happening to her)

So, what about the case where she actually was willing, and didn't really say so? Well it takes about two fucking seconds to ask, and who the hell sexes without dirty talk anyways?

Y'know, gently caressing her belly after tickling a bit, sliding a finger up and down both of sides of her belly, ""Mmm, you have really nice breasts, babe, I'd love to play with them"".

Oh, wait, he did do something kinda to that effect. She said stop. 
&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;


Wanna talk about awkward? It's only awkward if it goes wrong. If, for example, she has assumed yes and doesn't answer, and he's just waiting for her to answer. Without asking, if it goes wrong, it's rape. Now, which of those is more awkward and less likely to lead to a second time?

&gt; Also, I see nothing wrong with this. If I am physically assaulted by another person, say I'm punched in the face, and I prefer to not report this crime because it's easier, is there anything wrong with that?

If we hold that a proper resolution of any valid crime is that the perpetrator gets caught and hopefully prevented from doing it again, then we ought to make sure we make the reporting of a crime as easy and painless as possible.

If something happened to you and you chose not to pursue the matter, that's your choice. Let's not use ""punched in the face"" as a hypothetical because it's a false equivalency.

So when we look at the general instead of the specific, we ought to ask ourselves the question of *why* women generally decide not to report. Well, when you investigate, it turns out they would like nothing more than to see their perpetrator behind bars (or at least dealt with in some capacity to ensure he's less likely to do it again), but they don't want to report due to the likely personal consequences that define rape culture.

Your personal choice to not report any specific crime or occurrence might be valid, I don't know.

Good thing the law doesn't require explicit verbal consent.  The law also requires a mens rea on the part of the perpetrator.

This is actually rather important. This climate of dismissal is seriously holding women back from reporting crimes. They're often reluctant to come forward and take action, in part because they're afraid they're not going to get any support, and talking about their abuse might instigate a reprisal from their assailant.

The American Medical Association states that rape is the most underreported crime of all. This [government report](http://www.hmic.gov.uk/media/without-consent-20061231.pdf) from the UK states that ""between 75 and 95 percent of rape crimes are never reported to the police"". You might be able to imagine how devastating it is to be violently attacked and raped and to have nobody in the world believe you, or even to get called a liar.

4864,"First, 

Great. If you are in an established relationship. Not so great if you want to hold a persons hand or kiss them after a first date. This again is why nobody actually follows the rules on this list. They are not practical for the sort of social situations we face in the real world. 

Second,

I asked because I am a man who dates women. That means that I can only speak to my own experiences as a man who dates women. Perhaps you are in a different situation and a different dating culture  and your experiences were different because of it. I may be ignorant of this. I said it better here, but that is what I meant. 

Third,

Yeah, dirty talk is great. The only problem is that you did not ask permission first. How do you know if she sees what you say as sexy dirty talk or rather as a threatening or offensive:

""Sexually based forms of non-consensual communication, whether verbal, written, electronic, or telecommunication based""

You don't know till you ask. Right? I am sure you understand my point but I will make it clear anyway. Asking a girl if she wants to fuck could easily be interpreted as unwanted sexual activity. By your own rules you must ask first. The same goes for your other lines. Indeed for any line that is in any way sexual. So do you ask permission to engage in sexual communication first? How exactly do you phrase that? Unless of course, she finds that query itself to be unwanted sexual advance. Better ask first if you are allowed to ask if you can sexy talk or you are committing a ""sexual offense""! 

At some point somebody has to risk subjecting the other person to an unwanted sexual advance or sex would never advance. We all know this, lets not pretend we do not. 

This is the problem. These rules can easily be shown to be unwieldy to the point of being absurd by applying them to real life social situations. This is true of most lists that try to regulate horrifically complex social behaviors. 

Lets see this list for what it is, an attempt to quash and control spontaneous displays and communications of human sexuality. The motivation may be admirable, but it is what it is. And it sucks. It is silly and completely unrealistic. People want spontaneity, they want to take risks and triumph. 

You have failed to address my last point however, which was my most important one. I am still waiting to read your explanation about why my first kiss with my wife was so horrible. I mean look at me, my acts are an affront to all you hold dear. My wife and I committed a long string of ""sexual offenses"" by your rules.

It is important that sex be safe and consensual. I would never dispute this. It is also important that sex be sexy and fun. Most of my sexual partners (including the ones who self identify as feminists) would not have had sex with me had I acted even remotely in the way your rules advocate. 

Your sex life must be interesting. What does your spouse of 20 years think when you are afraid of kissing her goodnight without first obtaining unambiguous verbal permission? She thinks she needs a divorce is what she thinks. 

Listen to this:

On the second date with my now wife, I went to kiss her on the cheek (without asking permission of course, because I wanted her to like me and not think I was a social awkward idiot) and she quite sneakily moved her head slightly so I inadvertently kissed her directly on the lips. If you can tell me how this was abusive, or unsafe, or disrespectful, or whatever without sounding like a complete idiot I would love to see it.

Communication is the responsibility of all involved people because it is just as dependent on one party to answer honestly as it is dependent on the other to ask. And, yes, if you're putting the moves on someone you've never slept with, if you are the aggressor, the onus is on you to ascertain consent. How else would that work? Should we all verbalize our level of consent to those around us, sexually involved or not? no.

If playing hard to get is an issue for you with the people you're sleeping with, I would highly recommend considering other partners. In my experience people who are unwilling to give consent when asked directly don't make the best partners.

Therefore men must be ultra careful to make sure they have written permission in triplicate before eye contact is made, or heaven forbid, those crazy women will tell everybody you raped them and you will have no way to prove otherwise.

Do the women you are with not feel comfortable telling you to stop if you do something they do not like? Do you not like women who are capable of being in control of a sexual situation?

After sifting through a lot of that thread, the best comment I came across was by a redditor named montereyo. Here's the entire comment, because it's worthwhile:

*Let me take the exact facts that you've presented in this story and spin them from a different perspective.*

*My name is (say) Jennifer. I texted this guy Joseph that I've been out with a couple times - we had some pizza and a beer and played some Mario Kart lounging on his bed.*

*Later we began kissing a little. It was pretty nice but then he began getting too aggressive and putting his hands up my shirt. I'm not okay with this - I say, ""okay, stop."" He moves to the edge of the bed and looks hurt. He looks like he feels rejected, and I feel bad about that - it's not that I don't like Joseph, it's that I'm not ready to move beyond kissing at this point.*

*I want to lighten the mood and communicate that I'm not rejecting him outright, so I reach over and start tickling his sides. He grins and attacks me with tickles. I'm laughing and squirming and gasping ""Haha, stop, please stop!"" He lets me go, I take a deep breath to try to stop laughing, and he lunges to tickle me again! This happens several times until my stomach is exhausted from laughing.*

*All of a sudden Joseph gets a serious look on his face and crawls on top of me. He gives me a deep kiss and runs his hands up my shirt again. His touch is rough, and he yanks my shirt up to touch my breasts. This is different than our kisses before and I am scared; I feel out of control. I try to say ""stop"" but my terror tightens my throat and it only comes out as a whisper.*

*The rest is history*.

*Edit to clarify. I am not trying to make up details to make the woman more sympathetic. Instead, I am trying to illustrate the following point: what if the guy's perception of the situation is the description laid out in the original post, and the girl's perception of the situation is what I describe here? It's perfectly possible; people experience, perceive, interpret, and remember the same events very differently. What he sees as passion, she sees as forcefulness. What he hears as a mild, not-too-serious ""stop"" is what she hears as a ""stop"" so full of terror that she can barely get it out.*

*What then? What if both situations are ""the truth"" from two different perspectives? I don't have an easy answer.*

As [Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/5900444/ashley-judd-writes-a-kickass-feminist-essay-about-her-puffy-face) said, I don't normally follow celebs so I didn't know/think much about Ashley until now.  I hadn't heard about this ""puffy face"" controversy.  But whoa - she made some really outstanding points, and she did it succinctly and clearly.  

Highlights, IMHO:

&gt;The assault on our body image, the hypersexualization of girls and women and subsequent degradation of our sexuality as we walk through the decades, and the general incessant objectification is what this conversation allegedly about my face is really about. [...]
&gt;

&gt;That women are joining in the ongoing disassembling of my appearance is salient. Patriarchy is not men. Patriarchy is a system in which both women and men participate. It privileges, inter alia, the interests of boys and men over the bodily integrity, autonomy, and dignity of girls and women. It is subtle, insidious, and never more dangerous than when women passionately deny that they themselves are engaging in it. [...]

&gt;If this conversation about me is going to be had, I will do my part to insist that it is a feminist one, because it has been misogynistic from the start. Who makes the fantastic leap from being sick, or gaining some weight over the winter, to a conclusion of plastic surgery? Our culture, that’s who. The insanity has to stop, because as focused on me as it appears to have been, it is about all girls and women. In fact, it’s about boys and men, too, who are equally objectified and ridiculed, according to heteronormative definitions of masculinity that deny the full and dynamic range of their personhood. It affects each and every one of us, in multiple and nefarious ways: our self-image, how we show up in our relationships and at work, our sense of our worth, value, and potential as human beings. Join in—and help change—the Conversation.

Nice way of ignoring the rest of the comment. Please answer the rest of the comment as well. 

&gt;And men have many many many advantages. In general, men can go &gt;anywhere and expect to be treated fairly decently. 

That was not what was being discussed. What was being discussed was ladies night at the bar and your claim that this couldn't be an advantage for women since it was commodification. What is it? Is is an advantage for women or isn't it? 

&gt;Women, on the other hand, well, there's a reason women build &gt;women-only 'safe spaces'. There's a comparison to be made on such &gt;safe-spaces, but I'll note that women's safe spaces don't tend to be &gt;labelled 'hate groups', and there are a hell of a lot more women-only &gt;spaces.
Maybe that is because most of the 'hate group'labeling is done by the very same people that build female only spaces. 

&gt;Because if you admit that privilege exists, then you can call out &gt;others privilege and expect others to call out your own privilege.

Please read the section on female privilege over at finally feminism 101. 

&gt;There aren't many people in SRS for example, who would say that &gt;SRS is perfect. Currently, for example, I'm part of the group in SRS &gt;that is trying to lead SRS away from fat-shaming, virgin-shaming, &gt;and develop a sex-positive attitude that doesn't harm asexuals. 

Good for you. 


&gt;In return, I've learned a lot of things from SRS, such as things about &gt;trans people I hadn't thought of before, (such as including the space), &gt;about rape and rape culture I hadn't considered before and why &gt;enthusiastic consent is necessary, etc. etc.

Good for you. Do you want a cookie on how progressive you are? 

&gt;To be an ally of LGBT/SRS/feminism/other such groups doesn't &gt;necessarily involve agreeing with them on everything, but it does &gt;involve championing your own struggles with privilege.

&gt;I am still wondering if privilege is something that is invisible to the one wielding it: How can women be the judges of both male and female privilege? 

Because if you admit that privilege exists, then you can call out others privilege and expect others to call out your own privilege. There aren't many people in SRS for example, who would say that SRS is perfect. Currently, for example, I'm part of the group in SRS that is trying to lead SRS away from fat-shaming, virgin-shaming, and develop a sex-positive attitude that doesn't harm asexuals.

And if everyone adopts such a position, then a lot of privilege will be laid bare and everyone to have a better idea of their own and others privilege. 

&gt;Can we agree on one model of ethics that is used consistently? I am getting confused about this model where sometimes it is the intent of the action that is to be judged, sometimes the consequence of the action itself is to be judged. 

That sounds to me as though you haven't studied ethics? (That's a question) Any rule system, for example, would consider that if an action could be done with malicious intent, then the consequences of the action should be carefully considered. Also, any system which allows for asymmetry would also consider the perspective of the gestalt and perspectives of the components of the gestalt, thus only being concerned with the consequences, but having to think about the intent/perceived intent/etc. to determine what the consequences would be. And a host of other things that cause intent to annoyingly be relevant, like . The long and short of it is  that if there's a problem with intent or with the perceived intent, this may cause subtle consequences that are troublesome. And if the consequences are bad in the first place, then the action is of course unethical. 


Then also, I'm not sure what in particular you're referring to, but I suspect it may be the typical emotive argument for feminism and related movements.

I have read lots and lots and lots about the theory of privilege. And as it is presented on say finally feminism 101, I am still wondering if privilege is something that is invisible to the one wielding it. How can women be the judges of both male and female privilege? 

&gt;In your complaints you fail to even recognize the social structure, creating a false equivalence between your situations and those presented.

That's not an example of men being oppressed, that's an example of women being treated as a commodity. 

Doesn't change the fact. Women have an advantage. Can we agree on one model of ethics that is used consistently? I am getting confused about this model where sometimes it is the intent of the action that is to be judged, sometimes the consequence of the action itself is to be judged. 

&gt;Of course, business treats everyone as a commodity that they can, so that they &gt;can indicates . . . I digress, if I were to refute particular points I'd be here all day &gt;and you wouldn't be anymore convinced.

Yes, please let us talk about that. Since I happen to hold a master's degree in engineering physics. The amount of scorn and ridicule I received from society while at university tells me mostly that women are pissed that the men they ridiculed and wouldn't be seen dead with are making quite well for themselves now.

But if a straight kid was ""I was bullied in school and I couldn't tell my parents about it because my father would have told me I was weak and I was ashamed""... That's someone who can compare their personal experience to the common experience of what it's like to be a gay kid and bullied.

6619,"&gt;Is it sexist to tell someone they're attractive

I think, mostly, yes. (Assuming you mean ""use this as a conversation opener"", not ""compliment the efforts of your girlfriend"".)

Society puts huge pressure on women to be attractive, forces them to pour constant work into it. If they succeed, it uses their attractiveness to take away their agency. But what use is beauty to a woman? Tell a woman who is beautiful and knows it, that she is beautiful, and she will feel like you just told her that grass is green. Yes, thanks, already knew that. You may be amazed. She is not. (And if you use beauty praise as a way to butter up an insecure woman, then you suck.)

Edit: I don't venture past touching my closest of co-workers on their shoulder and a hug when it's clearly appropriate. A big part of unwanted physical contact, for me, is also what they are subconsciously queuing you to do. From men, I often feel like touches were to toughen me up: rough backhanded pats on the chest or over enveloping and suffocating side hugs. From women, I received a plethora of touches suggesting I back the fuck off. These things are being presented alongside the more routine sexualized contact which sends me into a spiral of self-doubt and rage. Hating all of these, I typically just bow out of physical contact.

Oddly enough, when I used to present as a gay man everyone (seemingly) **loved** my physical contact and would grope *me* inappropriately all the time.

The worst is that I was recently in a situation where I felt like I couldn't speak out at all, because the person giving me unwelcome touching was a friend of mine, and a lesbian trans-woman. I worried that I was being homophobic and transphobic, and I worried about expressing my apprehensions to anyone for fear of coming off as a jerk. She would often pull me in to sit on her lap and hold me there even when I would make it clear that I didn't want to be there. She also frequently kissed me on the cheek and hold my face close to hers, in an extremely intimate way. She did that with many girls, and I felt awful because I know that she wanted to feel accepted and not like a pariah (as she had just recently come out). I talked to her once about it but was afraid of coming off like a jerk, so I sugar-coated it a lot. Eventually I did go to an administrator about it, though my complaint was so laced with apology it must have looked very watered-down.

There's a weird aspect of society - especially for young people - where people now act like everyone just sits on each others' laps and lean on shoulders all the time and it's oh-so-sweet and normal.

And then pay attention to any body language or other nonverbal cues that the person really doesn't want to talk. Put their interests and comfort above your own. This is what polite and civilized people do.


For people you already know in some way (a co-worker, a neighbor), you don't have to be quite so careful, but still be very careful about what I said above about compliments. In this situation, the woman has very little choice about avoiding you in the future, so don't make her feel like you're a creep and she has to watch out.

And for your second comment:

There are other reasons to ""show it"":

* There are no shirts that I can buy, within my budget, that fit well, and *don't* ""show it"" ( either cleavage, or close fitting, etc), due to my body shape.

* I like the way these clothes look on me, and it makes me feel good when I see my reflection in a glass window or mirror.

* This outfit has some emotional significance to me.

* I'm going somewhere that I need to dress like this.

* I grabbed the first thing that I found in my closet because I was short on time this morning.

* I've put on a little weight since I bought this, and don't realize that it's now more revealing than I think it is.

* I'm ""showing off"" for someone else.

... and that's off the top of my head. The bottom line is that men need to stop treating women as though they are on display for them.

6665,"I assume mainly [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor). I.e. that ""raping the enemy"", for example, may have as little to do with literal rape as ""killing time"" has to do with literal murder. (Not a native speaker here, so pardon me if I can't come up with a better comparison.)

Sometimes I hear terms like ""raped"" used figuratively in video games when one side is rendered helpless by another side who is brutally dominating the encounter, especially when there's an element of forceful humiliation involved. Yet there is nothing like a forced (or unenthusiastic, or any other kind) sexual act in any literal way. In some games so-called ""baseraping"", for example, is a quite frowned-upon yet common strategy that involves killing the enemy players as soon as they spawn, leaving them unable to effectively defend themselves, and in the end often feeling very much frustrated, humiliated and even violated. It isn't considered exactly fair play or sportsmanlike, but it ""gets to the goal"", so it's still often the end result of having two unbalanced sides, especially in team-based games where being the good guy effectively just means dropping out of the game and not really helping the opponent in any tangible way.

Best keep in mind though that these are games where the goal is literally *killing other people* -- virtually of course, but generally in as realistic a manner as possible -- so it's not like the ""raping"" is the only or worst atrocity happening, whether literally or figuratively. The goal in these games is *not* to be a civil or a nice guy -- that's what real life is for.

So I can easily see its relevance *as a metaphor*, even if I'd rather avoid the term myself (for reasons that should be pretty clear to anyone reading a thread like this). While I can appreciate the fact that it's a very loaded word that may not be nice to use lightly, I have to admit that I see as a little obtuse anyone who claims they don't see how it can possibly have ""anything to do"" with something that isn't a literal rape, or that the main reason or motivation for using the word in any figurative way must be making light of real rape or rape victims. I don't think the word would be used figuratively at all if it wouldn't immediately raise some very powerful emotional allusions to a very real form of violation that everyone instinctively understands to be wrong and extremely harmful to whoever has to experience it.

(I also assume that any ""trigger warning"" would be pretty moot in a thread titled ""rape"", albeit I think there's a bad pun to be forced in there somewhere when talking about first person shooters. Excuse me, I'm very tired and coming up with the silliest associations.)

6674,"Copied over from my response on her post:

As a White, male, straight, upper-middle class US citizen, I completely agree that my experiences on the receiving end of individual and institutional sexism, racism, classism, heterosexism, &amp; other ""isms,"" don't really amount to an overall experience of oppression.  

I also don't think the frame of ""oppressor"" works very well to describe my experience or my role in society, but I do believe that:
1. I operate within a system of oppressive power dynamics that works to privilege me at the expense of people that aren't like me.
2. My actions can support that system or increase that oppressive dynamic regardless of my beliefs or intents.
3. People oppressed by that system should decide for themselves who their oppressors are, and what that word means, and while I hope to be seen as an ally, if I'm not, then I generally have at least as much if not more power to help change that.

In my conversations with other White people, I hear a lot of confusion about the difference between oppression, discrimination, prejudice, &amp; so on.  I think the messiness of vocabulary &amp; the rarity of good dialogue makes for lots of evasive, sloppy thinking.  I think it's uncomfortable to reconcile my internal sense of myself as a good person with the idea that I am complicit in a system of very bad things.  &amp; it's easy to default to a reductionist position of ""I've struggled too, &amp; I've been judged/discriminated/constrained because of my gender/skin color/sexuality too.""

Struggle isn't the same as oppression; racism isn't the same as prejudice; etc.  

I think, personally, the ""oppressor/oppressed"" distinction isn't very useful when looking at the United States, because we're pretty far removed from the kind of feudalism or stark Marxist class boundaries where that term originates.  &amp;, as I understand our history, most of our social progress has come through intersectional alliances, not through stark revolutionary conflicts.  Again, though, that's the view that currently best fits my knowledge, &amp; I don't have a monopoly on logic or information.  Even working just from what I personally know, I can make an intellectual case for the more binary oppressor/oppressed distinctions in the US.  So, just because I don't see the frame as useful doesn't mean no one can, does, or should.  &amp;, honestly, I do think there's a lot of White men in specific, and US people in general, who have trouble saying, ""I don't think that's the best way of looking at _____, but I can see how you might &amp; I respect your choice.""",wasserperson,2012-02-28 04:42:24,2015-04-07 19:03:19,,t3_q89lk,feminisms,2,0,2015-04-07 19:03:19

She is arguing that insurance be required to provide coverage for contraceptives.  Not that contraceptives be handed out by the government.  Not that they be 100% covered.  But that employers cannot decide to refuse to cover a doctor prescribed medication or procedure based on religious or moral affiliation.  The issue is that Georgetown University, due to its Jesuit affiliation, does not include birth control in the plan they offer.

Insurance is not free, as many Americans who have premiums deducted from their checks and pay steep co-pays can attest to.

The word ""whore"" as a pejorative is completely unacceptable no matter who you are talking about.  Some people find it an acceptable term for sex worker if used respectfully.

At first, people were just focused on the workplace (which has gotten better, but still isn't equal).  But sexism is baked deep inside our culture.  People carry around their sexism in ways they don't often recognize.  They fight the recognition even when it is pointed out to them and patiently explained.  This cultural fight is a slog.

If he is going to take a feminist stance, he could start by not referring to Sandra Fluke as a ""college girl."" Would he call a 30 year old male student at Georgetown law school a ""college boy""?

Also, regarding number 5 (We were told that society owed us a hot girl), I think it would be worthwhile to consider that almost all movies with female protagonists guarantee them a guy (though not necessarily a hot one) at the end. Yet somehow women don't feel entitled to sex from men (at least the author doesn't mention that). Rather than creating a sense of entitlement in women, these representations tend to create a sense of distress around the idea that women might not live up to expectations by ending up with a husband. I guess my point is that these heteronormative representations of romance aren't just teaching men that they deserve women, they are teaching everyone that we belong in a (hetero)sexual relationship, and if we don't end up in one, there is something wrong with us. Perhaps, as the author suggests, men are more likely to react violently to this feeling of inadequacy.

6946,"Sorry in advance how absurdly long this is.

Okay. In that case I guess there are two parts to the reply, one saying why some may consider it justified to break the law, and another to say why this may be justified in an ongoing manner even if the law is not changed. I will also add (and explain in more detail later) that I do recognise that this leads, at best, to murky waters ethically speaking. I will also add that arguing that this is an understandable position does not mean that I support it, but just that I could not completely condemn someone for doing it in an absolute manner.

So firstly, why would I claim that breaking the law could be justified? I imagine you could/have guessed where I am going with this - whether or not something causes harm, how much it causes, what should be done about this and whether it is acceptable are all sliding scales. Certainly, if advertising causes someone to feel so badly about themselves that they develop an eating disorder, it is quite clearly physically harming them. No individual advert will be the sole cause for this, but if all advertising promoting image as being excessively important (obviously subjective, but you can broadly imagine the advertising that would fall under this banner) were removed, cases of eating disorders would certainly decrease. The number that would have to be not put up to stop one case is again not something that you or I can specify, but if someone feels that they are helping to stop the great harm that an eating disorder can cause, then they are using a similar justification (albeit at the other end of the grey scale) as you would to break the law to save someone's life by damaging property. I imagine you might also risk damaging a fence to jump over it if it looked like a young child may break an harm. You might push past someone slightly, thus risking catching and tearing their clothes (their private property), to help someone up who had fallen over, even if it was clear that they were not severely damaged. All of these slide down a grey scale, with an infinite number of possible cases in between. I certainly wouldn't want to say, for certain, at what point on this scale it becomes okay on anything but a case by case basis.

Essentially, I am trying to show that this person viewed damaging this property in a similar light as you would view tearing down a wall to save someone's life - justified, despite being illegal. This doesn't mean that I think you should agree, or that the two actions are equivalent, but merely on the same sliding scale, so that you may perhaps understand them.

Now common etiquette says that you will not get sued or arrested etc, for catching someone's clothes when you brush past them to help someone else,  and it if there was a spate of such legal action, the law would probably be changed to allow for this. Similarly, if my friend believes that these adverts are harmful, she could lobby her council, local Member of Parliament, or the company hosting them. Whilst I think that these routes would certainly be good to pursue, as someone who is highly politically active, I can assure you that she is aware of these options, and knowing her political feelings, I would safely say that she has tried similar actions before and felt, in a general, broad manner, that the govt is corrupt and wouldn't trust them to make any sort of moral judgement - to be specific, she is an anarchist. I am aware that the consequences of this certainly could be, for example, used to justify a revolution to try and take dictatorial control of the country, in a highly unethical and undemocratic means. I agree that this is a justified concern, and to address it fully would, I imagine, go in to quite a lot of political/philosophical detail. To give a brief overview of why it may be justified though, I will first point out that many countries have semblance of democracy, and without acting outside the confines of the law and changing the law by force, no democracy is likely to develop. If one does not even have freedom of speech, it is difficult to hold the discussions that could lead to it being implemented without risking arrest, for example. Similarly, if one believes our govt is corrupt, then it may well be the height of stupidity to try and change it by corrupted legal means. Though this is a belief you may dismiss, if you go across to r/anarchism or any number of other subreddits I am sure you will find people who will argue this point a lot better than I (the point of the govt being corrupt). Many things leaked in the Wikileaks saga, for instance, will testify to the fact that the British govt has lied, directly, to it's people, for subversive and immoral means. This does, without doubt, leave one in a very difficult situation - I have claimed that people acting outside the law can be justified, and as such I would find it difficult to deny someone else the right to act outside the law when I disagree with them. For this reason I would come to the point of view that it is largely (perhaps always) best to act within the law, but that it can be justified not to, and that these cases should be looked on individually, and my young, optimistic side hopes that people in general will act in a way that is morally good (whatever that means).

tl;dr - My friend was acting further along the grey scale of preventing harm than you would be happy to illegally, but you are still on that scale. She didn't trust govt to be honest enough to change the law, and I find this hard to argue against, thought it leads to a morally sticky situation.",reallyreallyanon,2012-04-04 14:51:05,2015-04-10 08:19:15,,t1_c48d24l,feminisms,2,1,2015-04-10 08:19:15

The shaving the armpit example is a perfect illustration. If a certain culture penalizes a woman for not following a social norm (like in regards to appearance), then I do not see how a reasonable person could not consider the associate expenses a ""necessity"".  

In regards to pubic hair, there is a large and likely growing segment of the population for whom pubic is at best undesirable, or at worst disgusting and unhygienic.

&gt;This you know how? 

Well, I don't get called a slut, I get high-fives. I've never been told ""Dick or GTFO"". Hearing back from job interviews never hinges on how attractive I am. My acceptance into an orchestra is not rejected outright, (but will be shortcoming as soon as they hear me play). Lawmakers are not trying to control my sexual organs. Medical insurance pays for viagra, if I would ever need it. I can be pope, if I ever become religious &amp; catholic. I have 10% the chance of being raped than a female, and about 1% of the chance of being forcibly raped. If a girl whistles at me in the street, I can take that as a compliment because it is different from the default, as opposed to a reinforcement of my objectification. The ideal image for a man is based on what men like to see in themselves. . . not what women would like to see in men. If I ever participate in a LARP, I can be sure that no one will say that ""Are you sure a girl like you can handle all that heavy armour?"". I'm not scared off from studying Engineering, Math, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, by well-meaning teachers, recruiters, friends, family, or other. No one ever suspects that my effortless 4.0 GPA is because I can suck a cock really well. If I ever want to just cuddle, I can, in fact, just cuddle. When I say no, in any form, it is understood as 'yes' 10x less often. If I go to a gym, almost all of the training is based around a male body and male hormones. If I go to a bikeshop, I can reasonably expect to have been taught how to use a wrench, and for people to expect me to know how to use a wrench. If I play D&amp;D, people don't grab the book from me and look up stuff for me. If I play boardgames, no one is surprised that when a male wins.

Yes, it is sexist for *society* to treat men &amp; women differently. It would be sexist for you or me to treat men or women *unfairly*.

Vulgarity itself I don't have a problem with; TAA's tone  is just as irritating as possible.  I think this discourages people who might not agree with his message from listening to it.  Without dissenting opinions, no intellectually significant discussion occurs.  Nobody grows as a person.

He describes the women he's discussing as mindless, cackling cunts before he even addresses what they're talking about. He then suggest that because he hasn't seen feminists object to the discussion that took place the entire movement is bankrupt.  Hyperbolic statements are appealing  to some, repellent to others, and rarely invite reasonable discussion.  

I wasn't trying to suggest you were picking on anybody, but if you're actually interested in the opinions of feminists, you may want to write out a post that conveys the same ideas as TAA's video in 30 seconds of reading as his 6.5 minute video does.  By not immediately describing the women in question as cunts, you would probably get much more meaningful dialogue.

7029,"Exactly. Cultural conditioning and the way we automate and accept certain behaviours can mean we're exhibiting harmful actions without being aware that would shock us if we really understood their context or impact. It's about trying to be really patient and critical in examining your own perspectives, and trying not to feel outright attacked when someone has a strong reaction to a way we feel entitled to act.

I was having a discussion with a gay friend in the past about how I'd been completely oblivious to being hit on by another man. She concluded by saying ""maybe you just always assume people are straight."" It was uncomfortable to hear that, but I thought about it for a while. I realized she was right and that I more or less would assume somebody was straight by default until they clearly proved otherwise. Even if this was statistically safe, it can be as oppressive to an individual as any 'statistical' on how somebody should be or should act. I've tried from that moment on to not assume either way with somebody until it's made clear, not to rely on a default assumption. Besides, if you're trying to hit on somebody and they're completely oblivious, it feels like shit. So now since I'm asking the question, I'm better able to realize when someone's doing it to me and send clearer signals in the situation.

7067,"I can commiserate with your difficulties, but I'm not sure your strategy will have an affect on your male students. In fact my first thought was to maybe use [wing-chun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Chun) as an example because I think that you may have some difficulties convincing your students that these women aren't western perversions. If a person has these convictions I think they will find it easy to simply ignore these exceptions... confirmation bias as it were.

It may be more useful to use ask them these questions:

""What does it mean to be strong? Is strength only physical or is there a strength of will?""

""If there is both the strength of will and the strength of the body, is it enough to possess only one type of strength? Is one more useful?""

""What is physical strength. Is there only one type of physical strength?""

Why is it that physical labor is often regarded as inferior or demeaning, and yet possessing much physical strength is esteemed?""

""If women are not, or cannot be brave, then is there no action they might take that could be deemed to be brave?""

Hopefully these questions will help your students to question their gender ideology.",itsasocialconstruct,2012-04-13 01:03:48,2015-04-10 23:55:45,,t3_s6xqz,feminisms,6,1,2015-04-10 23:55:45
