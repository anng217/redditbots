Basically, things like DFD is nice for pointing out what tactics are derails, but it does nothing to debunk them in a way that will win over folks. So I'm asking what evidence or turns of phrase folks find helpful for getting someone to think beyond the derails I cited. For instance, if someone said ""I don't see why women deserve special treatment"", what has worked for you in the past on convincing that person that that mindset is flawed?

What evidence is there that people should stop being selfish when being selfish works perfectly fine *for them*, and the ""because you're being a jerk"" angle doesn't appeal to them(because ""people are jerks to everyone""/""get a thicker skin""/etc)?

rooktakesqueen,,,"I guess the best generalized advice I can give you is this, speaking from my experience as a middle-class white cis male computing professional:

Most of these guys *probably* understand that discrimination happens, but they think it isn't a big deal.  They think that non-privileged people have to deal with it very infrequently, and when they do have to deal with it, there are mechanisms in place for them to do so.  They think racism, classism, sexism, ableism, ageism, and all the other -isms, are mostly a solved problem already.  They do *not* understand the idea of privilege, or if they've been exposed to it, they probably reject it.

So, you're going to have to establish that it's not a solved problem.  That non-privileged people deal with the consequences of their lack of privilege in many ways, on many levels, all the time.  That there usually *aren't* any mechanisms to deal with it.

I think you'll want both statistics and case studies.  Descriptions of people being forced to deal with their lack of privilege, detailed accounts of how it influences them, how it crops up in their everyday life.  Combine with statistical evidence of institutional -isms.  Showing one and not the other won't work.  Show just the case studies, they'll assume you're cherry-picking.  Show them just the statistics, they'll assume it's caused by factors other than privilege and discrimination.  They need to have the stats *and* be able to link them to a concrete example of how inequality could be the causal factor.

A lot of them probably worked very hard to get where they were.  They don't feel like they got any special treatment because they were white or male or middle class.  So it might be helpful to emphasize that privilege isn't *all* that's needed to get ahead.  Good outcomes still take hard work, even for people in privileged groups.  Privilege is just about where you *start* on the playing field.

Expect to hear arguments about how it's not *fair* to penalize this group of people for privilege they never asked for, and would reject if they could.  The only good response I can think of for this is that it isn't about fairness.  If the world were fair, there would be no privilege.  Fundamentally, inclusiveness and accessibility is about being utilitarian: it's about asking one group of people to make a very *small* sacrifice in order that another group of people can reap a very *large* reward.  You take five minutes out of your day to check your website's color scheme, and you can avoid shutting out dozens, hundreds, thousands of colorblind people from the content you're providing.  You take a day to implement button re-mapping, and suddenly disabled players can enjoy your game just like able-bodied players can.  You take a moment just to consider the impact of your words on someone else, and you save your female or minority or LGBT coworkers immeasurable amounts of anxiety and heartbreak.

Lastly: you're not going to win most of them over.  At the end of your talk, I wager at least nine in ten will still be hostile and will dismiss everything you've said as bullshit.

EricTheHalibut,,,"The comments about fathers no longer loving their wives were probably looking at it backwards even then, and almost certainly where I am nowadays. 

Without children, both partners are likely to be working: that should mean that there won't be any alimony or similar payments. The main costs of divorce would be the loss of economies of scale and possibly some of his share of the investment  in the household assets. This means that if he no longer loves his wife, a divorce is entirely sensible.

Conversely, with children there is more pressure to remain married. Apart from concern for the emotional well-being of the children, he would expect to lose much more money. It is much more likely that the mother will have taken off at least a few years (especially back then) so there will be at least temporary spousal support, and the risk (whether perceived or actual) of getting screwed with respect to custody, visitation, and child support. This means that even from a purely selfish point of view, divorce is unlikely to be a good idea.

Since someone who is cheating is going to need to need to meet his (or her) lover(s) away from the places frequented by his own set, whereas someone who  is divorced or unmarried can date in his usual haunts, it seem likely that the older men the source was attracted to were those filtered from their peers by the fact that they were cheating. Combine that with children discouraging divorce and you get the effect that source saw.

EricTheHalibut,,,"&gt;It's considered rude form in many ethics systems to discriminate as a result of intrinsic qualities such as this.

Part of the problem is that, even with the ACA, the US health funding system doesn't work as either a social benefit (priced on the basis of income) nor as an open capitalist system (priced on the combination of market forces and expected payout), because the actual policyholder can't usually shop around. 

If there were an open, competitive market for insurance without anti-discrimination provisions, one would expect to see that, once prices settle, the prices would be based on the specific risks as near as can be estimated for that person: someone who is predisposed to have diabetes will be charged more, a woman will be charged more, a person with vision problems, and so on. If men start going to see doctors more and earlier, their premiums will rise accordingly. That is fair, in an utterly amoral way. 

If all discrimination on the basis of intrinsic differences were banned, insurance pricing would have to ignore most of the key risk factors except diet/exercise, smoking, drinking, and sexual activity (and that would be an absolute minefield). Age could reasonably be permitted too, since once such a system were in place everyone would be both young and old.

You can tweet/post something to your own page (""Hi, I'm tweeting!""), or direct your post *at* someone, especially as a reply (@Mary, @Bob, @SpamBot66).

People use 'hashtags' - topic names with a pound sign in front - to mark a post as belonging to one or more topics (#Feminism, #GiantsPatsGame, #Obama). The topic is often extra description or just a joke (#IrrelevantThoughts, #YouJustGotTold, #winning). When many people post to the same topic in a short time span that topic joins the ""trending"" list on Twitter. That's how CNN can report ""Rick Santorum was really trending on Twitter last night"".

I know it's an extreme example, but imagine a black man coming across a known member of the KKK, and yelling at the member for being a racist piece of shit. If your first reaction is to go ""wow, the member wasn't doing anything and being quite polite. The Black man's point would have been so much better if he treated the KKK member with respect"" you have your priorities messed up. We know the KKK is fucking awful and people have a reason to be passionately offended by them. Likewise to a smaller extent, we know this woman had a concrete reason for being upset with geeklist from the get go. Even if she was rude and made them feel bad, that's a technicality compared to the offense the group she's being mean commits in having a video making the majority of an entire demographic uncomfortable.  

The reason tone argument is important to understand and call out is that it's often used to derail. You can see it clearly in the conversation of the original content for this thread. Rather than actually addressing her concerns, the majority of the conversation was about her seeming aggressive. They didn't want to talk about their sexist video, instead they wanted to paint the person pointing out they had a sexist video as a bad guy. Regardless of your opinion on her tone, the fact that the tone became the topic of conversation rather than the sexist video is really demonstrative of how people try to get minorities to shut up. The next biggest one (and one you could also see in the conversation, meaning it'd probably be their major one if she had been sunshine and sparkles in her approach) is saying that it doesn't bother people they know thus she's imagining any offense or just being oversensitive.

critropolitan,,,"&gt;seems like the solution to this is to simply not have children. Women have that choice. Being a Parent by its nature involves some level of self sacrifice from both mom AND dad.

Being a parent *in the real world* most of the time means *vastly more sacrifice* if you're a mom then if you're a dad.  Dads are the *best dad ever* if they do a fraction of what their female partners do.  

A man can easily be a parent and still have an independent life of his own, losing little or nothing of his personal identity and outside life.  He is not socially defined by being a dad, its just one of the things he does.  He can go to work and expect his partner to take care of his child, and, as an added bonus, since she's not working or working less, she'll usually be expected to do most of the housework and perhaps cooking too!  This is not the case for every family but it is certainly typical and definitely something a man can get if he wants it.

For a woman however, it would be nearly impossible to get that arrangement.  The best she could hope for is some vague equality - one that will never really be equal because equal child care taking would still amount to greater sacrifice on her part since she bore all the physical sacrifice and her partner had none of it.  So to actually be an equal sacrifice, her male partner would have to do *more* than half the childcare - something extraordinarily unlikely.  Most likely however, a mother's life will be somewhat restricted after having a child - she will do most of the care for it and therefore lose work and productivity at work over it - a mother's ability to maintain an independent social life without the kid or her husband is usually sharply curtailed because responsibility, in our patriarchal society, for figuring out what to do with the kid is hers.  It is actually socially **unseemly** for a new mother to be out socializing late while leaving her child with some professional caretaker - not so at all with fathers. Being a mother almost always constitutes a very central part of one's identity if they are a mother, they are no longer [their first name] but [son/daughter's mom].  

No, the solution is to eliminate the privilege men have in this arena and to create a society where women can, like men, choose to have children without having to lose their independent lives and identities.",0,1334186285,,0,c4b64sr,t3_s3sn8,2.0,t1_c4b0ayf,25341,1428702236,0,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1259365445.0,t2_3qt2h,

AnthonyZarat,,,"The executive branch in Brazil is moving towards interpretable law.  The judicial branch is resisting this.  The court has thrown out a number of convictions based on vague criminal statutes (more on this later).

The key-phrase to identify this constitutional tug-of-war is ""não se admite critérios subjetivos"", which means ""subjective factors are not acceptable.""

In this case, the law established an absolute lower limit of 14 years for consent-competency ... BUT in some situations the limit can be more than 14 years.  The court did not like this.  The judges extended the reasoning, stating ""what matters ... is not what is written on the identification document of the child or adolescent, but how they behave themselves.""

In other words, if subjective factors can result in an increase in the 14 year limit, then the justices ruled that subjective factors must also allow a decrease in the 14 year limit.

This whole thing started with dissatisfaction about fast-tracking of ""environmentally friendly"" infrastructure projects.  Specifically, several Amazon dams were approved under a fast-track law that allows reduced scrutiny for projects with small impoundments and large remediation budgets.  The supreme court is unhappy about this, and wants to move away from interpretable ""fuzzy"" law.

Never. You never ask someone to drop trou before you decide which pronoun to use.

Never. You never demand to know what someone's sex chromosomes are before you decide which pronoun to use.

&gt; How often do you consider what gametes they produce?

Never. You never think about what gametes someone produces before you decide which pronoun to use.

So. What's the implication here?

When you talk about any other person in your life, you do not base your pronoun usage for them on

* Their genitals (which you have not seen, in almost all cases)

* Their sex chromosomes (which you do not know)

* Their gamete production (which is a mystery to you)

Ergo, you must base your pronoun use for other people on something else. What might that be? Let me posit a hypothesis: It's gender. It's their gender. It's always gender, and not biological sex. It's not something that's ""the case only in the trans community"": it's true everywhere. It's just that people don't *think* about that except in the context of the trans community, because the trans community is primarily where you find people where one or more of the above-mentioned criteria don't match their gender.

But again, the point is that even for people you presume to be cis, you're not calling a guy ""he"" because you know that he has a penis; you're not calling a woman ""she"" because you know she has two X chromosomes; you're not calling a dude ""him"" because you know he produces sperm. You're not calling a person by a specific set of pronouns because of anything to do with their physiological sex: you're calling them by a specific set of pronouns because of their gender.

Similarly, if I was talking about this conversation I'm having with you to someone else, I would refer to you as ""he"", because you have identified yourself as male. I do not know if you have a penis; I have not seen it. I do not know if you have XY sex chromosomes, or if you produce sperm, because for all I know your daughter is adopted - you haven't specified - and had you been talking about a sibling, and not mentioned you had children, I would still refer to you as ""he"".

Willravel,,,"My understanding is 'creep' has different meanings in different situations all rooted in the same basic concept. What we're talking about here is creepy being used to talk about people in potentially romantic, sexual, or otherwise possibly sex-related situations behaving in a way which is not considered to be normal or healthy, thus triggering concerns about the person's thought process and/or intent, yes? 

This seems like a bit of a minefield. On the one hand, I absolutely (and I mean *abso-fucking-lutely*) believe people should have the right to their personal space, their privacy, their freedom to say 'no', and the right not to be put in a potentially dangerous situation. Let there be no question of that. On the other hand, though, we're in unique time from a sociological and behavioral perspective. The concept of 'forever alone' is not a new one, but considering the rates of things like online dating, it's possible we're seeing a fundamental shift in romantic meeting tendencies. Add to that increasing diagnosis of people who are socially handicapped, and we're in uncharted waters. Personally, I like meeting people in person through friends, school, work, or other traditional social settings., I tried online dating and found it more than a little problematic. The thing is, people like me are more and more rare. A recent study found that approximately 1 in 6 marriages were the result of meeting (or 'meeting') online. This is bound to result in the society-wide degradation of social skills pertaining to meeting people romantically.

nofelix,,,"I see where you're coming from, and understand you want internal consistency in your thoughts. I think people are being a little unkind here, I think because they're mistaking your methodicalness for stubboness. So maybe the following points will help you out:

1. 99% of the time the medical sex of a person is irrelevant in your life as an engineer. So don't worry about it. In the rare situations where it is important, you can just say 'female to male transsexual'; you're never going to be restricted to just male or female.

2. The fact that *some people* use 'male' pronouns to refer to cismen only, ignoring the existence of people born outside the gender binary, doesn't stop those people existing. Isn't it simpler to accept that 'male' has a broard definition, rather than a strict one necessitating whole load of complex terms for people who fall outside it? Medical professionals can deal with the complex definitions, while socially we can use the simple ones. The same way I'm sure there are words lay people use about engineering which make sense in lay conversation but are ambiguous in a professional one.

3. Does someone's gender matter to anyone else? If I want my gender to be 'tomato' or 'rooster' what difference does it make? It's just part of identity, and allowing people to self-identify as pretty much whatever they like is common sense. If someone argued that you weren't a 'rock and roll fan' because of some definition of 'rock and roll fan' they had, you'd think they were an idiot, however reasonable their definition was. Should gender be any different? (I think you already agree with this, it just leads to my next point)

4. And by the same token, shouldn't we allow people to define pretty much anything about themselves how they like? They can call themsevles slim even if we think they're fat. Even if, like in your example, they want to be called 7' when they're only 5'2"", why can't we allow this notion with the understanding that their 7' height is a different kind of height? Their moral height, skateboarding height, or whatever. They're not asking you to agree that their real measured height is anything but 5'2"". They're asking ""when we talk about my height generally, without specifing measured or skateboard, can we use skateboard?"". It might seem slightly absurd or pointless, but you can grant there's no harm in it, because in cases where it *does* matter you're still free to specify 'measured height'.

5. It would mean a lot to him if you called him by the correct pronoun. *A lot*. As the father of his girlfriend, you're in a position of responsibility. Also as a adult. You have the chance to make someone who respects you feel good about a difficult part of their lives. Why waste that over a technicality? Is the lesson that 'logic triumphs over all' (or something similar) really worth more to you? He must notice that you're not using male pronouns, and probably knows that you call him 'her' when he's out of earshot.

&gt; It's not as much of a controversy to her as it is to me and my desire to respect her desires while being able to convince someone else in my state.

I know that feel bro. But it can be self-defeating. Sometimes you need to take the first step and trust that the arguments you're hearing are correct. Yes it's against our nature as logical people, but part of being rational is knowing that not everything can be known in advance. See what it's like believing the other side, and calling him 'him'. If you don't like it you can always go back. But as an engineer, hopefully you can appreciate the value of experimental data to test a hypothesis, right? Even if your mental models predict the hypothesis to be wrong you can still test it.",0,1335032424,,0,c4eylh8,t3_sjqqe,14.0,t1_c4eqyp0,65154,1428768026,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1254443726.0,t2_3nnc7,1.0

""Earnings of Never-Married Men and Women Who Have Never Had Children, are College-Educated, and Work Full-Time (Aged 40-64)""  Listed source is: ""Based on raw data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation, 2001 Panel, Wave 2.  The data is median earnings.  Latest available data as of 2004.""

Oh.  Based on raw data.  I see.  No listing of methodology.  No peer review.  In a book dedicated to the proposition that the wage gap is a myth.  No margin of error, no notion if it's statistically significant.  No explanation for why the restrictions that were chosen, were chosen.  What if you include working women and men of all ages?  What if you include non-college-educated men and women?

Of course, given that all the blogs referring to this book don't accurately represent their source at all, I'm not entirely convinced these numbers would even be borne out by the census data, but I've got no way of doing my own calculation right now.  Guess we'll all just have to trust Dr. Farrell.

**Edit**:  I'm looking at this same data now, and I'll show my work.  I'm using DataFerret to look at census data.  My generated SQL ``where`` clause:

    (EEDUCATE in (41,42,43,44,45,46,47))
     AND ((TBYEAR between 1940 and 1964))
     AND (EMS in (6))
     AND ((RFOWNKID between 0 and 0))
     AND ((EJBHRS1 between 40 and 99))

which corresponds to having attained some degree (associate's or higher), being born between 1940 and 1964 (40-64 years old in 2004), marital status of ""never married,"" 0 of one's own children in the family, and working 40+ hours per week.

The result?

There were 1071 men and 1042 women in the sample matching the criteria.  The men worked an average of 44.6 ± 0.49 hours per week, the women 44.2 ± 0.41.  The men made a monthly income of $4367.10 ± $226.69, the women $4190.00 ± $187.38.  All margins of error are at the 5% confidence range using the standard error given in the census data.  This corresponds to an annual income for men of $52405.20 and for women of $50280.00, and no statistically significant difference (among men and women in their late middle ages who never married, never had children, and are college-educated, narrow set of goalposts).

I attempted to actually replicate the claim that was made here (women make $47k, men make $40k) by fiddling with all the variables I could.  I included people with some college but no degree.  I included people working 35+ hours per week rather than 40+.  I tried a birth year range of 1945-1969, just for the hell of it.  I tried using total household income rather than personal income.  I'm unable to reproduce anything even *remotely* resembling the claim that women in this group make more.  They always make less.  Sometimes the amount less that they make is statistically insignificant, but the mean for men has never been lower than the mean for women.

I decided to go ahead and try this one while I was at it:

&gt;Today, among men and women living alone from the age of 21-35, there is no wage gap.

I went with the 2008 panel, wave 9, the latest data available.  Universe is:

    ((TBYEAR between 1977 and 1991))
     AND ((EHHNUMPP between 1 and 1))

Which means birth year between 1977 and 1991; 1 person in household.

Imagine my surprise!  Of 2,908 men, they made an average of $2,918.90 ± $120.70 per month; of 1,993 women, they made an average of $2,673.40 ± $118.19.  Women in this narrow group still made 91.9 cents on the dollar to what men made and outside the margin of error.  Just barely outside, but outside.

But wait! you say.  Surely if I only look at college-educated men and women...  Nope!  Actually it's a bit worse, 90.9 cents on the dollar, though the margins of error *very slightly* brush each other at 95% confidence (they're well outside each other's margins of error at 90% confidence).",0,1335898026,,0,c4itul0,t3_t1anp,4.0,t1_c4iskbm,5390,1428834932,20,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1254201409.0,t2_3nhcf,1.0

This is an incredibly nerdy discussion, but I disagree.  I think Iron Man, Thor and The Hulk all have practical stances there, given their powers and body types.

I also disagree that ScarJo's boobs would be more emphasized if she arched her butt inward instead of outward, which is a more comfortable defensive posture.  

The idea behind this picture, along with most superheroine pictures, is, let's get as much boobs and butts showing as we can.

Look at her.  She's not even facing us.  That's how imperative it is for that ass to be on display.  That isn't to say such an ass ought to be shamed or covered up.  It's merely to say that that is where viewers' **and** artists' priorities are.  This isn't just the onlooker's fault; there is a complicity in the artist's ways.  

Either way, ScarJo is painted here in a contorted manner so as to arch her back, poise the butt, and proffer some side-boob.  It's ridiculous.  It's not a matter of being unattractive or not.

[deleted],,,"As a writer, this kind of thing terrifies me, especially if I ever do become a a more well-known author. I don't consider myself racist - I am annoyed by everyone equally. :p But living in rural Minnesota, I haven't had the pleasure of befriending people of every different race or ethnicity, and that reflects in the books I write. 
I can manage to write from the point of view of a Native American - I've been educated on their culture for a long time. It's a beautiful culture, and I enjoyed taking classes on it. But to write from the point of view of a black person realistically? That would be hard for me. Even with extensive research, I feel like any effort I made would be laughable, seeing as I've never even gotten to know a black person. 
I've nonetheless attempted to create characters of different races, but I don't think they would be very relatable to people of the same race. Since, like the creator of this show said, every character has a piece of me in them, they're not always submerged in the culture for which they are known. I once wrote about a black character named Naomi Sawyer. Rather than being involved with hip-hop or any other stereotypes, she was a quiet, intelligent, independent, and somewhat aloof woman who functioned as the leader of the group of main characters.

Honestly I do not understand the position of the moderate Christian.  The hard truth here is that much of the bible completely backs this man up.  How do you rectify this with your faith in the Christian god?  If it is simply the teachings of Jesus Christ on which you base your morals, then Thomas Jefferson has a version of the new testament in which I think you'd be interested.  There is no need to continue believing in a jealous, angry, sexist, mass murdering god, and allowing these ancient texts to be confused for fact.  I am almost more upset at the women and men in the crowd who allow him to say this without objection, and the moderate Christians who cherry pick from their bibles, then I am at this sociopath who uses bronze age mythology as a basis for his idiotic misogynist philosophies.

Sad that the child isn't what you expected, as you yet again deal with childish behavior. Sad at how your dreams don't quite fit reality. Anger goes without saying, especially if the child is even a bit hyper.

For me, breastfeeding went a long way towards maintaining my sanity, because I had periodic peaceful and intimate moments with my kids (particularly my son, who was a real handful), where I felt relaxed and could let some of that anger, sadness, and frustration fade away.

King_of_Okay,,,"But FAAB-only gatherings are, by far, not the norm.  You can think that they are detestable, terrible people for wanting an exclusive space to focus on their shared experiences.  Ciswomen, as a class, are not privileged.  No, they do not suffer identical oppressions as Transwomen, though there is some overlap between them.  If they want to focus on the portion of the Venn diagram that is colored cis, they should have that right.  Disagree vehemently with them, that's fine.  But I think it is wrong to bar them from free association, or to threaten those who desire such a space with violence or invasion.  

For example, the Freemasons are, by and large, men in a position of great privilege - usually not only that based on sex, but also usually that of class and race.  You might think it is absolutely shitty that no women are allowed to be into the secret circle.  But the solution isn't to bust down the doors of a meeting, or attempt to prevent their landlord from allowing them to use the space.  They are allowed to have their man-space, to discuss man-issues - and man-issues that don't apply to all men, but to that select group as defined by their membership criteria.

I also think there's more to FAAB-only space than just excluding ""minorities...on the basis of minority status.""  You treated shared ""lived experience"" as a throwaway comment, but I think that shared experience is the crux of the issue - FAAB only spaces exclude both minorities -and- majorities, to focus on one particular, exclusive subsection of the population.  Transmen are FAAB, but are not to be included in the space as they do not have the same experience as Ciswomen.  Cismen are not trans, but they are also not Ciswomen.

Now for feminine business casual, well, are we going to go with a silk blouse and a subtle skirt? Going to wear some trim dress pants? How are we going to accessorize?

Well they get a few points for that at least. The refusal of stuff like Mitchfest to allow transwomen, even as they embrace transmen, has always made my brain hurt.

Duckylicious,,,"In the eating disorder recovery sphere, ""triggers"" are used too, albeit in a somewhat different meaning than the OC explained.

Naming specific weights is generally considered one of them (and is therefore usually banned on pro-recovery oriented forums).

It may sound ridiculous, especially if we're talking about abuse victims and PTSD, but at the core of it it makes sense - to use some clearly fictitious numbers, let's say I'm 2' and weigh 100 pounds, and am struggling with bulimia and I think I'm fat. My therapist is working on convincing me that I'm actually a healthy weight on the Breeblebox index and should instead focus on being healthy. I'm about to buy it, then I see a post by someone who's 3' and weighs 80 pounds, complaining how *they're* uber fat. I realize I must be gargantuan in comparison and resolve to not eat for the next three days. Hence, trigger warning.

Of course, outside of an eating disorder recovery community, it isn't entirely realistic to expect people to think ""trigger"" when talking about their height, weight, or the fact that they've lost/gained XY pounds.

So Artie gave them a shout out.  So what?  Unlike r/MR, radhub hasn't even _done_ anything yet.  They have a conference. Whoa, more talking to each other.  So much more dangerous than a forum, right?

Meanwhile in the past r/MR has doc-dropped dozens of people, which AVFM does regularly.  You yourself have offered cash awards for the doxxing of a few people.  AVFM has in the past asked readers to hire private detectives to dig up dirt to harass an anti-violence speaker named Josh Jasper.  You glorify violence against women when your blog posts pictures of bleeding and bruised women accompanying posts about how you're going to ""fuck their shit up"" (`their` being feminists).. which is what elam said as he created register-her.com. So he actually says he wants the doxxing to fuck people's shit up, which means he wants the data to be used.

The time pn6 lead r/MR in joining glenn sacks in making vile, bigoted, and threatening phone calls to the financiers of a domestic violence shelter b/c you didn't like a bus ad they made.  The irony there being, the shelter helped men equally as women, so you were harming men in order to harm women. 

pn6 applauded the hacking of a blog called ""biting beaver,"" r/MR supported the hackery.

One of your mods frequently calls for violence against women and transsexuals, you ignore it.

You sent harassing and threatening emails to a woman blogger who commented about men going into the bathroom with kids in daycare.

You yourself advocate not helping women being raped even while you witness it personally.

You advocate finding all men accused of rape not-guilty in court, even if you know they're guilty.

Including today in which you said you oppose homophobia, at least against gay male MRAs. And then you linked to bernard chapin being extremely bigoted against lesbians, calling them ""lesbobos"" and stereotyping them and hating on them.  And we all know that this kind of bullying leads to real harm, the disproportionate suicide ratings for gay folk.

what has radhub done to anybody besides rant on their website?  _nothing that compares_.

When anybody does anything like that around a feminist sphere, we call them out.  We do not allow the dialogue to continue in our safe spaces, we disavow them, and we explain exactly why they're wrong.

Personally? I wish *men* would shave! I do. I just think it's kinda icky and gross - the way sweat sticks to the hairs and bacteria can grow and just urgh. (Thank you, biology lessons. And, yes, I know you guys wash) 
And I find my deodorant (I unfortunately suffer from perspiration) works better on smooth skin.

And I like the look. Sure, it could be because I've been socially programmed to think that shaving armpits is desirable - certainly when my wisps of blonde turned darker. But I'm honestly ok with that, because of the benefits it gives me personally - hygiene benefits that were made clear to me not only at school but at home. By a woman who didn't always shave her armpits no less. I know that it's likely that society has told me to see bare pits as the hight of desirability, but frankly, it's not the worst thing that I've been subconsciously told.

FYI: Yes, I do shave my legs on occasion. I like the feel of them when I'm wearing my summer pjs, rather than my hairs tickling me (sensitive skin). I'm blond, so yes, the social ""necessity"" isn't quite there, but I have brunette friends who don't shave that often and I think it looks fine. I don't care if you shave your legs or not - it's up to you and for your own reasons. If you're not comfortable with the social backgrounds, don't shave! If you're aware that you're just ""conforming"" to social's definition of feminine beauty, but you shave anyway, it doesn't negate any of your feminist beliefs in the slightest. 

I don't shave my nether regions, just keep it tidy, but mostly because I like having it shorter - breaths better down there then. Less messy when I'm dripping blood all over the place. 
Reason I don't shave? Itches like fuck. And high maintenance. And I don't personally like the look. I like my hair. I think it's interesting. (It's got like, 3 shades!)

The only relevant experience I have is having been a musician who's actually done a few things (nothing huge just a few albums and touring a bit) I know that the best way to get a hold of most people in the public spotlight is through their PR team. This not only means actors and musicians, but politicians, and anyone successful enough to be famous (including non-entertainers like Niel DeGrasse Tyson). So I'd look up the person, and try to find a contact for their PR team, then send their PR team a proposal and explain how the person might benefit. This is where the AMA requests might come in handy, but only if it's heavily upvoted. Mostly I'd probably just sell it as a session where they could answer unique questions from folks some folks who are fans and some folks who aren't, which could be an opportunity to reach a new audience as well as reach fans on a deeper, more intimate level.

For example, I'm going to guess that /r/feminisms is not made up primarily of death metal fans. So, were I to try to get Angela Gossow on board I might point out that this discussion originated in regards to feminism  meaning it might be a good way to reach out to a whole new demographic (feminist/female) which could lead to higher concert attendance and record sales. Now here's where the AMA requests might come in handy. Let's say someone put up an AMA request for her and everyone active in /r/feminisms went over to that post and upvoted, giving the thread 1000 upvotes. Well now we can link to that thread and say ""look, here's 1000 people who don't even necessarily know your music who all want to talk to you. You might be able to convert them to fans. And being a vocal group, they might be able to spread the word a bit"". 1000 new potential fans is a big deal for any death metal group. Or if we can't get that many votes on an AMA request we just say fuck it and make the same sales pitch without that thread.

Of course most of this is speculation based on limited experience as a wannabe rockstar and redditer.

I think i got caught up in the just words, rather than giving a proper look at at the context. My bad.

I've been thinking that I'm coming to a place where works are simply default bigoted, because it comes from artists formed from bigoted societies. Artists produce art, but societies produce artists. I don't think one can escape producing sexist, racist, etc. works as a result. Right down to the language, we have sexism.

The bigotry can only be negotiated, not erased. As you say the barriers can be challenged, but i think only a change in society could change whether or not a work is bigoted. Also, if you can bump me some papers on the Shakespeare debate, i'd be really happy. Had no idea that this was being examined - the fact that it is wildly comforting.

I know that seems really pessimistic, but i think over time it can be changed by taking an active role in how we produce our media. Going over and getting rid of bigotries in one's short stories, just like looking out for grammar mistakes, for example. I think we can get there. I just hope i'm there to see it.

There's nothing in being a woman that makes them intrinsically bad drivers - ovaries don't block the steering column, vaginas don't fuck up one's vision. There's nothing about being a woman that makes them less likely to be able to drive well.

Easy test - if there's a phrase that can't be reversed in the matter of male/female or applied to other races, it's probably racist. 

I fully agree that the books are more....male-oriented. I think in broad strokes Martin treats women characters as interesting, fully articulated beings, but you're right, there seems to be compromising positions and even humiliation that's squicky at the least, and hard to justify narratively.

It also reinforces the idea that everybody fits into a neat little binary system. They don't. 

Nothing is stopping the change from being made apart from differences our society perceives among men and women. Men's urinals can have doors. Pads and tampons sit on the shelves of stores and supermarkets everywhere, so they really shouldn't be treated as foreign and mysterious objects.

Even from the strictly economic standpoint that the argument is being made, ignoring the other benefits of people having control over when/if they reproduce, it is retarded. 

I'm all for internalising economic externalities (making people pay for the costs their actions cause others or benefit from the benefits their actions cause others) because it leads to socially optimum levels of consumption of the relevant goods. Making polluters pay for the clean up of their pollution is not only fair but, a good thing because it leads to the right amount of the good causing the pollution to be produced. Without measures like this, more than is helpful is produced because the market fails to take into account the cost of clean-up when setting the price so, people buy the good even when they benefit less from it than the cost of cleaning-up after it. 

The problem with the argument that women should pay extra for taking the pill is that there are already positive external benefits for women taking the pill that are not internalised (less unwanted babies that cost society money for example). If anything, the taxpayer should be paying women to take the pill because of the (much greater amount than the cost of cleaning water) money it saves the state in potential adoptions, caring for children and school costs etc. 

Leaving aside the economic arguments, people have a right to decide when they reproduce and shouldn't be stopped from having that right because they can't afford to pay for the pill. It should be free to start with, ignoring any externalities. Also, the fact that there is only a pill for women creates the potential for the cost being unfairly borne only by women. 

I've never read Forbes but, I was under the impression that it was a well respected business magazine. Irrespective of their position on whether women should get the pill free, it's editors should know enough economics and be smart enough that it should be obvious to them that, even when you internalise externalities, the pill should be subsidised, not taxed.

I think it would be interesting for people to hear from a woman working in a male dominated field about how it is working in a field like that. I work in particle physics - it's a pretty male dominated area* - and I found hearing experiences from female colleagues who are friends interesting, surprising and sometimes shocking. I think it's an interesting area for discussion and I think a lot of good could come out of a discussion like that in terms of changing people's attitudes and, possibly getting more women working in traditionally male dominated areas.

I agree that it could also open her up to a lot of unwelcome sexist comments from bone headed redditors which is a real shame. 

I see your point about doing an AMA like that potentially minimising the significance of the person's work. I think really a female rocket scientist/particle physicist etc has two reasons to do an AMA. One is that she is working in an interesting field (especially to a lot of reddit) and one that she is a woman working in a male dominated field. I think the first reason has probably already been covered for most areas so may attract less interest than the second but, I'm not aware of examples of AMAs about the second. 

(if you are aware of something like this that's already been done, please let me know - I'd be interested. I remember one about a man working in a female dominated field). 

I think it makes sense to either make it an AMA about a rocket scientist/particle physicist or whatever (in which case I see no reason why the person should need to disclose their gender) or an AMA about a female rocket scientist/particle physicist etc working in a male dominated field. I would hope that if it was an AMA about the second, people would think a little harder about how stupid their sexist comments are before making them. 

*There is a series of charts about demographics of one of the major particle physics collaborations, on one of their posters, and one of them claims it is 90% men and 10% women.

I think the state is male. Women constitute about 15% (give or take 2-3% points) of government so I don't think it's appropriate for 49% of the citizenship to legislate the other 51% with a roughly 85% majority.

His statement of justification was vague and almost irrelevant at the very best. The ""rape reference"" is just employing her own rhetorical device to draw attention to that fact that forcing motherhood with restrictive laws is another form of male domination over woman through bodily control akin to rape. If you watch c-span you'll see a lot worse behavior than an, albeit poorly stated semantic clusterfuck, that go unpunished, which is really what is so upsetting about this issue. The inequality in the treatment of behaviors of the politicians is what I am pissed off about. The speaker also barred Barb Byrum from speaking on the floor after she tried to discuss her amendment to the bill in question for *no reason* and then gaveled her as well as she tried to gain his acknowledgement to be allowed to speak. He said she ""threw a temper tantrum."" It is her right as a publicly elected official to speak on behalf of her constituents and he straight up ignored her, then punished her for attempting to be heard.

My body developed to function with a certain amount of muscular support, after taking hormones for an extended period of time I can actually have to little muscle to perform as well as my structure could. 

* *Trans women are statistically more likley to be taller*: Height is a big issue in sports, I swam competativly for 10 years and height definitely plays a role in people's abilities. But honestly, any olympic athelete, or hell any good athlete is more likley to be in the upper percentiles of height for their demographic even if they are cis (of course there are exceptions such as gymnastics). Are we going to institute maximum height requirements so that cis women who are statistically taller cant compete?

* *I benefit from muscle memory, experience, etc*: Honestly trans women's bodies change so much during hormone therapy, you have to relearn how to exert your body to it limits.

Okay, that makes sense.

&gt;Unless you want to deny that any forms of benevolent sexism (I misspoke in my earlier comment and called it ""benign sexism"") exist in our society

I would argue that ""benevolent sexism"" does not benefit women. [this] (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111004121314.htm) describes a little bit of what I mean.

&gt;The fact remains that you receive benefits from capitalism.

No. Capitalism does not benefit any but the very rich.  Unlike a sandwich, which is directly made by your friend, capitalism is not the direct cause of any benefits. It didn't even create the climate controlled environment you enjoy.  

&gt;I never said that the concepts of benefit and oppression are so complex that we can't make a judgment on it. We should absolutely make judgments on it.

Perhaps I misunderstood, but it sure sounded like you were trying to downplay the harms of patriarchy.

jdac,,,"&gt; so you dont want a guy to eat you out? 

I'm not into guys, so no. Also, Wong isn't using this as a metaphor for cunnilingus, but for sex in general (well, maybe PiV sex in particular, as per his ""humping"" reference). 

Also, why are you trying to infer my desires from the fact that posing women as consumable makes me uncomfortable?

&gt; umm i think a huge population of women absolutely knows the important relationship between hunger and desire for the other sex as well as romance novelists and the millions who read them. 

You're invoking the bandwagon fallacy here, but in service of what? My objection is to the metaphor of sex with food, particularly of the sexuality of *women* with food, because food is a material product to be consumed and women are not. The number of people who do or don't buy into that construction are immaterial to whether I like it or not.

&gt; hunger, appetite etc are constantly used in relation to sexual desire for a reason. you dont crave that cake or steak from your stomach (unless you are starving). you crave it becuase of how good it will make you feel when it happens and how it will satiate a temporary desire. same with sex.

You have a point. Sex and hunger are very similar drives, as the psychological study of motivation and emotion recognizes. The reward value of sex and the reward value of food in our brains are, if not interchangeable, similar in function. But that's not what I take issue to. What I'm taking issue with is women being metaphorically posed as food.

I don't quite know what you're saying in that second sentence there; we don't crave food from our stomachs any more than we crave sex from our genitalia. Trivially, even when you're starving, you experience that in your brain, and your brain is capable of suppressing hunger pangs. You are also capable of consciously ignoring them. This goes for sex as well.

We acknowledge that hunger influences us (and it had better, lest we starve), but who seriously accuses sandwiches of being out there to tempt them? We may say food near to us is distracting, but we don't argue that the food is self-aware and is willfully using its succulence to distract us from work or conversation. But this is the belief about women that Wong is describing; women know the effect they have on men and they're doing it on purpose, wah. Only a very few people can credibly claim that they are *powerless* over their desire for food. I don't think there's grounds for Wong to claim that men are similarly powerless against their sexual urges.

In any event, Wong stretches the ""cast-away sees fellow cast-away as talking porkchop"" metaphor in service of his contention that attractiveness makes men feel powerless over women (something I don't agree with). Given the cisheterocentrism of the article, a more direct recasting would be ""men so starved for sex they start to see other men as women."" But then, to be played that straight then there would have to be a scarcity of women around.

In Empire, they are both competing for her, but it's pretty clear that she's interested in Solo (even the kiss is a way to piss of Han instead of reflecting any feeling for Luke). Yoda indicating that ""there is another"" (aka Leia is Luke's sister), is also in this movie. The movie ends with the ""I love you"" ""I know"" exchange, establishing the Han/Leia match for good. The notion of Lucas retconning the kiss and Leia's interest in Luke and switching to Solo for Jedi doesn't make any sense, because it all occurs in Empire in the first place.

I mostly agree with Wong's analysis. I definitely got the ""you'll be rewarded with a woman"" message as a kid. Not so much the ""women have so much power over men because men want sex"", though I've got friends who definitely exemplified that stereotype. He failed to mention how much of masculinity is done by men for the benefit of other men. 

But what I really want to say is: I think these conspiracy theories about women (that they're diabolical temptresses who want to destroy masculinity and overpower the male gender, et cetera) only justify, not cause, the hatred of women, as this article seems to imply. In order to convey this idea, I'm going to engage in a little bit of theater.

Gimme a second to set up my tripod and spooky conspiracy background music. Bear with me. Cambot, dim the lights, please.

James W. Prescott in 1975 published a paper called ""Bodily Pleasure and the Origins of Violence"" in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, about a cross-cultural study of child-rearing practices and violence. He claims that deprivation of bodily pleasure (leaving infants to cry instead of holding them, sexually repressing adolescents) correlates with higher levels of adult violence and increased subjugation of women, among other things. He also found that indulging infants and not hampering sexual exploration was correlated with lower levels of the things he measured (which included mutilation of enemies, theft, and belief in supernatural agents along with commitment to female inferiority, apparently).

More recently, George Lakoff and Johnathan Haidt, commenting independently on the psychological and physical basis of morality, identify two large families of moral systems: nurturant ones where goodness is in preventing harm and giving care, and authoritarian (for lack of a better term) ones where goodness is in enforcing justice and fairness (which necessarily includes punishment). Both are present in society today. Lakoff links this back to two broad models of parenting: nurturant parenting, where your parents support and comfort you; and ""strong father"" parenting, where you are obedient to a legitimate authority who knows how to be good and punishes you for being bad.

Combine this with what we hear from the study of motivated reasoning, or of people whose corpus callosum has been severed, who find we humans to be master rationalizers&amp;mdash;we act or decide first and then tell ourselves stories to explain why&amp;mdash;and it starts to seem reasonable that the conspiratorial beliefs about women Wong describes might just be necessary components of justifying the misogyny our society is already committing and committed to.

Okay, you can turn up the lights again.

(Looking at things this way also changes the way you look at the Republican War on Women. Not favorably, but interestingly.)

As for war itself? I'm pretty damn sure war doesn't exist simply to give men a venue for competition over women. As L. F. Richardson [found](http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/statistics-of-deadly-quarrels/1) and as his successors continue to observe, war is a catastrophe whose causes defy easy analysis. The Carlinesqe ""war is men killfucking each other with surrogate dicks over whose godcountryfather has the bigger dick"" hypothesis is a little simplistic, I think.

So many behaviors we have are socially learned. I have a hard time listening to male vs. female stereotypes that are built on this as yet unfounded idea of huge difference in hormone levels.

Another interesting fact is that differences between some individuals of opposite genders can actually be more similar than between another person of the same gender. As humans we have variety of hormonal levels, yet we don't measure each person and then say ""you have _ level of estrogen, so you can be expected to be responsible for only this level of behavior.""

Male privilege has been with us for how long? a thousand years? ten thousand? So having even a bit of chance to talk frank about our sexcapades is pretty freaking cool, and we're aloud to be emotional about it. Including flippant, sarcastic, angry, rude and even resentful. Even all at the same time! If you're so sensitive to men's fee fees than try browsing the rest of the internet. Or watching tv. Or walking outside. 

The patriarchy is what dictates that men are impervious to having feelings, so if some guy happened to get turned into another forgettable sex toy by a woman, you don't get to blame the lady.
If a woman or some women say “All men are sex-crazed beasts” it does not take away the power that men have. They will not be oppressed or made lesser.

Men experiencing individual instances of prejudice is not on the same level as women systematically being portrayed as lesser to the extent that they are kept in a lower social/economical state than the average man.
When you are privileged, “similar” experiences simply do not happen on an equal footing because they do not otherwise reflect marginalisation.

Also, The article ain't sexist. Sexism = prejudice + power. A woman can’t be sexist towards a man because women don’t have the institutional power to do so due to historical oppression.

Oh and you're condescending too!:
""So, don't worry about pleasing everyone. Instead, try to find someone who appreciates you as an individual.""
aw...how kind of you to share this advice that no lady has ever heard before! You are so right, we really should find someone like that! You know what's funny though? No matter how wonderful a guy is, they've internalized some really poisonous crap. So every once in a while they say or do something that really shakes you because you’re no longer totally certain they see you as a human being, and you feel totally disempowered to explain that to them.

It seems that you've missed the point Emily's making here. So you've used the classic case of  ‘I can’t attack your argument, so I’ll have to attack you’. cool. cool cool cool.

I'm not denying the influence of hormones on behavior. But I am saying that cultural messages can amplify those effects. 

When a study is done on alcohol or caffeine, in addition to a control group that gets none of the substance and is told they are not ingesting it, there is often a group that gets a plain drink but is told it is caffeinated or alcoholic - because the expectation that a person is drinking alcohol or caffeine will change their behavior. And researchers want to separate out behavior caused by the *idea* that one is getting buzzed and what the actual effects of the substances are. Of course, caffeine and alcohol can and do change your brain and body chemistry. But those effects are amplified by all of our cultural messages and personal ideas about them. 

A person taking hormones will change - that's the point of taking them. But some of those changes are going to be a result of that person's ideas and expectations of the effects that the hormones will have. Or, in response to those changes. Feeling more secure, confident and attractive because of the physical changes brought on by the testosterone could increase libido - in addition to any changes that the testosterone had directly on the person's sex drive.

Willravel,,,"I agree with the central thesis of this article, that men do not seem as interested in the finer details of women's beautification. I find myself wondering why women wear uncomfortable shoes for hours a day that could potentially lead to messed up toes, blisters, and even back problems. I hope they wouldn't go to all that trouble on 'my' account (my meaning me as a typical dude). The thick make-up, the bleached hair, in some cases even the bleached anus... none of that stuff interests me in any way, shape or form. I hope I've never given the indication to any girl or woman (or boy or man) that I expect them to go to extraordinary measures of changing their appearance or being really uncomfortable in order for me to find them attractive. 

The way it's argued, though, is more than a little problematic. I'm not so sure it's true Ms. Emily could go out and find a guy to 'stick it in'. If she did, imagine the man in that situation. He's an experiment, valued really only as data to support an argument. I ask this with a straight face: what kind of man goes to bed with a woman who doesn't value him? Moreover, what kind of person goes to bed with a person that doesn't value that first person? It makes me wonder if it's an issue of low self-esteem, or perhaps they're just much different from me, sexually, and I have no right to judge them. 

I think the point of the article could have been made without that kind of comment. And the last line, ""Real men don't give a shit if you miss a patch."", is a No True Scottsman if I've ever seen one, and it undermines the argument. Initially the argument isn't about 'real' men, but about men in general. I like the argument that men in general don't care all that much about beautification, but this idea that 'real' men don't care about it seems to shift it from a tendency to an ideal or goal.

majeric,,," I liked a lot of the response up to a point... but then it delves into what I would consider to be commonly accepted but rather heavy handed ideas of misogyny. 

&gt; It's because they feel entitled to have women in a submissive position to them. They want to live in a world where women are considered automatically dumber, where women are expected to clean up after them, wipe their brows, and kiss their asses, all with a smile on our faces and without asking much more in return but an occasional bit of jewelry and a door-opening, which is just as much about the man feeling more powerful as it is about being nice to the woman.

I feel they are heavy handed because I look around at *all* of my straight male friends and I really have a hard time believing that any of them would perpetuate this rather horrific notion. 

So it forces me to ask the question. Is it intentional? Do we do it to ourselves in some rather subtle ways? (It feel like we all probably carry some slightly misogynistic ideas that it's the collective butterflies that creates a tornado.)

And in some sense the cracked article does touch on the hint of an idea (while entirely missing the mark). I have to wonder if Hanlon's razor applies to misogyny. 

&gt; ***Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.***

I was watching some Christopher Hitchens (his comments about the solution to poverty made me think of this subreddit. I will probably post it later) recently and there was a point he made (or quoting another evolutionary biologist perhaps) where he conveyed the idea that we were in essence barely sentient creatures. 

It is the religious among us that would have us believe that we are in full control of our faculties because an over emphasis on freewill. The evolutionary biologist/naturalists among us might recognise that we are more subject to our natures that we give ourselves credit for.

I am not saying that we don't have free will or that our reason doesn't have the ability to override our nature. We are certainly ""civilized"". However, for those who don't spend a great deal of time being self-critical or forced to consider issue that might affect them, the concepts of inequality might never come up. 

So surface ideas that are ultimately wrong may never get challenged. I recently got into a rather lengthy debate with someone who refused to acknowledge trans people because he felt that genetics were always an overriding default to gender regardless of how someone felt. It was a frustrating argument to have but I could see how he came to his incorrect conclusion. It was hard to move him on what he say was overwhelming evidence against gender dysphoria.

I'm not entirely sure what the solution is. Certain the Religious Right seems to play the pathos (emotional) argument over the Logos (rational) argument. I gotta wonder if we shouldn't take different tactics. Australia had a great marriage equality ad because it appealed to emotion. I think it was quite effective. (regardless of the obvious flaws about pretty people only deserving to be happy but I digress).

-The rate of doctor visits for such reasons as annual examinations and preventive services was 100 percent higher for women than for men and medication patterns differed significantly.

If women are filing more medical insurance claims, doesn't it make sense that they would be charged more?   It's the same with men for car insurance.

It's easier to enjoy photographs of people when you learn to not project pieces of yourself into the model, or pieces of the model into your own psyche, but rather just appreciate that the person in the picture, or on the runway, is very photogenic and fits a particular image, and that's why she's a model.

They hate Arabs because they are so secluded from the outside world the only times they really hear about Arabs doing was during the second Intifada so their frame of reference is scewed, and they tend to be a hateful people (when I say they I am only talking about the *most extreme* amongst the religious minority in Israel, which is a minority of a minority, but they're in the news the most.) One common misconception by westerners about Israel (among many) is that it's a left right spectrum of extreme/not extreme where on the left you have the gay rights/women's rights/anti-theist socialists and on the right you have war mongering genocidal religious jews. 

The religious have absolutely no interest in the perpetuation of the state of Israel. The only reason they live on that land is because of it's religious significance (which means very little to the government). I'm having a hard time typing this without grimacing, but essencially they pay fewer taxes, get more welfare, have more children, and thrive off of the securaty of a nation they couldn't give enough of a shit about to stand up and defend. This is also why they live in the West Bank, which is essentially Palestinian territory (Israel owns the land for security reasons, but it's really *for* Palestinians). 

It's also worth noting that even in Ramat Bet Shemesh, which is the even more religious subset of Bet Shemesh, the ""spitters"" are in the minority.

Women dressing in what would be considered extreme levels of modesty by most standards is fine IMO, as long as they do it out of devotion to their religion, and by their own choice. If it is in *any* way out of fear then it is oppression.

However the people spitting on girls in Ramat Bet Shemesh are in the tiniest minority, and even some of the most ""extreme"" rabbis in Israel and throughout the world consider their actions detestable. The Israel/Palestine conflict is what most of the world sees, but the Israeli population has a huge rift between the secular majority and the religious minority. And the religious themselves are diced up into so many sub-sects that it's hard to deal with any problem rationally without a massive cultural overhaul. The reason the religious are allowed to stay so separate is when the state of Israel was founded religious jews seemed to be dying out. An extinction of the [Shtetl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtetl)   era of judaism would have been a victory for the oppressors the early zionists were trying so hard to overcome. David ben Gurion set up many laws and rules (most notably that religious are exempt from military service) in order to keep the religious protected and sustainable. He did his job a little too well, and with an average of over 5 kids a couple (and personally I have seen numbers up from ten) they have expended to become a fairly strong minority in the Israeli population that no one really knows how to deal with.

dada_,,,"&gt; Why is this a false equivalency, and could you give an example of something that isn't a false equivalency?

I don't think there's anything you can use in the place of rape when we're talking about this subject.

The obvious difference is that being punched in the face is a million times more preferable to being raped. So it becomes easier to decide to not legally pursue it. But more importantly, there are different social processes at play in the case of assault. We're at the doorstep of sociology here so I won't go into the details, but while rape victims tend to be vilified and distrusted, female assault victims from male assailants get a greater deal of support from men due to their perceived gender role of fighter.

Yes, that's a major double standard, and there are all sorts of complex reasons for why this occurs, but suffice it to say that different crimes have different sociological backgrounds, which sometimes makes them hard to compare when we're discussing cultural implications. This isn't entirely an accurate description, and I'm completely disregarding other important facts pertaining to violence (which is another very important type of oppression that men carry out against women), but it serves as an illustration.

I should note that not truly understanding what rape is (which a lot of us don't, including myself) doesn't disqualify you from trying to empathize (I think this is the word you mean, instead of ""sympathize"") and educate yourself. There are lots of experiences that we lack but still have to deal with in some capacity. I'll never truly understand racism, either, since I'm not part of an oppressed demographic, but I can still try to suspend my own judgment and hopefully gain some semblance of an understanding of what it is. People are more capable of it than they might think, as long as they're willing to spend some time educating themselves.

&gt; I don't know how you see things, but generally any time that I hear of a sexual assault or rape, the only thing I hear from peers is 'report it, report it, talk to the cops, go to the police, you should talk to someone about it', and never have I heard 'don't report it, suck it up'.

People don't really outright say ""don't report it"", in part because those who actually make a conscious decision to visit the victim are usually those who do so in order to offer their support. This is about a cultural bias towards the assailant's side of the story. We might be talking about someone reading a newspaper article about something that happened on the other side of the country.",0,1333746093,,0,c49akm7,t3_ruog0,13.0,t1_c499ng8,4887,1428669629,1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1294411787.0,t2_4p6lz,

&gt;Let's not use ""punched in the face"" as a hypothetical because it's a false equivalency.

Why is this a false equivalency, and could you give an example of something that isn't a false equivalency? I have a hard time sympathizing with rape or sexual assault, as I haven't ever been bothered by any of the sexual assaults against me, so I try to find a crime similar to rape/sexual assault when thinking about it (Which physical assault seems to have the same mental degradation and physical harm to the person harmed, so I use that).

&gt;But in general women are very strongly held back due to how we, as a society, react to them when they do.

[deleted],,,"&gt;It's also telling that you don't require him to say yes. Double standards.

No, I don't require him to say yes when he starts the sex. Now I know you're trying to be an idiot.


But for other people reading here later, I'll add that rape isn't about sex, rape is an act of violence, psychologically as much as physically. Rape is also about control, and loss of control.


If you want to talk about stop having been rendered useless, he was the one that did so and took away her control of the situation. He should have stopped, or seeked enthusiastic consent after the very first time she said stop.

He took away a part of her control over the situation, and the rest was taken by what we call 'rape culture'. Rape culture is that which puts the onus on the girl to 'put out' after a few/a single date. Rape culture is where women are simultaneously told to dress nicely for a date or be a horrid unlovable bitch, and that by dressing nicely she was 'asking for it'. Rape culture is the pressure on women not to seem 'cold'. 

Oh, hey, that sounds familiar, almost as if she wants him to stop, but feels societal pressure to continue and make light of the situation, ie: by tickling, even after she's said stop. And last time I heard, tickling wasn't an unambiguous way of saying ""Please fuck me now"", otherwise we have a lot of disturbed moms and toddler tummies out there. 


And then he's already shown her that he doesn't respect her calls to stop. That's not 'breaking down resistance', that's making her feel as though she has no control over the situation. Now what are her options? Being called a stone cold frigid bitch &amp; socially ostracized, or continue. Great. It's not as if calling rape doesn't get her called that, because people still question her about the rape and why she didn't stop it, or conversely, if she stops before the rape, then she's accused of calling rape falsely. She calls rape, she's socially ostracized. She stops the rape in a more friendly manner, she's still ostracized. (Btw, only 2%-8%, setting dependant (average very close to 2%), of claimed rape cases are ever found possibly false). That's also part of rape culture. And again, people, like you, tell her she was 'asking for it'. 

The effect is so drastic, that ~60% of rape cases are never reported by the victim, because they believe the police will not believe or sympathize with them. 


(edit: I felt I should add to this, to make it a bit clearer. *As a psychological assault*, rape diminishes the victim's feelings of control far below what they can actually control. What happens thereafter is the actions of a mentally compromised person.  For example, they will grasp at any method of control they see. So with one story, we have a young girl who was raped by her riding instructor repeatably, but she used that to get free riding lessons. Does that mean she wasn't actually raped? No, that means that mentally she needed some way of justifying or controlling what was happening to her)

So, what about the case where she actually was willing, and didn't really say so? Well it takes about two fucking seconds to ask, and who the hell sexes without dirty talk anyways?

Y'know, gently caressing her belly after tickling a bit, sliding a finger up and down both of sides of her belly, ""Mmm, you have really nice breasts, babe, I'd love to play with them"".

Oh, wait, he did do something kinda to that effect. She said stop. 
&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;


Wanna talk about awkward? It's only awkward if it goes wrong. If, for example, she has assumed yes and doesn't answer, and he's just waiting for her to answer. Without asking, if it goes wrong, it's rape. Now, which of those is more awkward and less likely to lead to a second time?

If we hold that a proper resolution of any valid crime is that the perpetrator gets caught and hopefully prevented from doing it again, then we ought to make sure we make the reporting of a crime as easy and painless as possible.

If something happened to you and you chose not to pursue the matter, that's your choice. Let's not use ""punched in the face"" as a hypothetical because it's a false equivalency.

So when we look at the general instead of the specific, we ought to ask ourselves the question of *why* women generally decide not to report. Well, when you investigate, it turns out they would like nothing more than to see their perpetrator behind bars (or at least dealt with in some capacity to ensure he's less likely to do it again), but they don't want to report due to the likely personal consequences that define rape culture.

Your personal choice to not report any specific crime or occurrence might be valid, I don't know.

You also proceed with verbal intimacy the same way you would with physical intimacy, if the date is going well you increase the intimacy, if not, you don't. Mistakes happen but are not considered offensive if honest and made with good faith.

As for your situation with your first kiss with your wife. Was it bad? No. Does that same situation turn out poorly for some people some of the time? Yes. It's such a well known problem of courtship that there's the trope of people getting slapped for kissing someone that didn't want to be kissed. This system tries to prevent that situation from happening. Yes, sometimes it's not needed. Both parties want to kiss not matter what. However, there are many times that this system is needed to prevent a mistake from being made.

Great. If you are in an established relationship. Not so great if you want to hold a persons hand or kiss them after a first date. This again is why nobody actually follows the rules on this list. They are not practical for the sort of social situations we face in the real world. 

Second,

I asked because I am a man who dates women. That means that I can only speak to my own experiences as a man who dates women. Perhaps you are in a different situation and a different dating culture  and your experiences were different because of it. I may be ignorant of this. I said it better here, but that is what I meant. 

Third,

Yeah, dirty talk is great. The only problem is that you did not ask permission first. How do you know if she sees what you say as sexy dirty talk or rather as a threatening or offensive:

""Sexually based forms of non-consensual communication, whether verbal, written, electronic, or telecommunication based""

You don't know till you ask. Right? I am sure you understand my point but I will make it clear anyway. Asking a girl if she wants to fuck could easily be interpreted as unwanted sexual activity. By your own rules you must ask first. The same goes for your other lines. Indeed for any line that is in any way sexual. So do you ask permission to engage in sexual communication first? How exactly do you phrase that? Unless of course, she finds that query itself to be unwanted sexual advance. Better ask first if you are allowed to ask if you can sexy talk or you are committing a ""sexual offense""! 

At some point somebody has to risk subjecting the other person to an unwanted sexual advance or sex would never advance. We all know this, lets not pretend we do not. 

This is the problem. These rules can easily be shown to be unwieldy to the point of being absurd by applying them to real life social situations. This is true of most lists that try to regulate horrifically complex social behaviors. 

Lets see this list for what it is, an attempt to quash and control spontaneous displays and communications of human sexuality. The motivation may be admirable, but it is what it is. And it sucks. It is silly and completely unrealistic. People want spontaneity, they want to take risks and triumph. 

You have failed to address my last point however, which was my most important one. I am still waiting to read your explanation about why my first kiss with my wife was so horrible. I mean look at me, my acts are an affront to all you hold dear. My wife and I committed a long string of ""sexual offenses"" by your rules. At least report us to the sexual regulatory council for reprimand.

I hadn't heard about this ""puffy face"" controversy.  But whoa - she made some really outstanding points, and she did it succinctly and clearly.  

Highlights, IMHO:

&gt;The assault on our body image, the hypersexualization of girls and women and subsequent degradation of our sexuality as we walk through the decades, and the general incessant objectification is what this conversation allegedly about my face is really about. [...]
&gt;

&gt;That women are joining in the ongoing disassembling of my appearance is salient. Patriarchy is not men. Patriarchy is a system in which both women and men participate. It privileges, inter alia, the interests of boys and men over the bodily integrity, autonomy, and dignity of girls and women. It is subtle, insidious, and never more dangerous than when women passionately deny that they themselves are engaging in it. [...]

&gt;If this conversation about me is going to be had, I will do my part to insist that it is a feminist one, because it has been misogynistic from the start. Who makes the fantastic leap from being sick, or gaining some weight over the winter, to a conclusion of plastic surgery? Our culture, that’s who. The insanity has to stop, because as focused on me as it appears to have been, it is about all girls and women. In fact, it’s about boys and men, too, who are equally objectified and ridiculed, according to heteronormative definitions of masculinity that deny the full and dynamic range of their personhood. It affects each and every one of us, in multiple and nefarious ways: our self-image, how we show up in our relationships and at work, our sense of our worth, value, and potential as human beings. Join in—and help change—the Conversation.

&gt;If there is a family that has withstood the test of time, it is the Judds. From the early days of Naomi and Wynonna’s country duo to the individual work of Wynonna and younger sister Ashley, their name has spanned three decades. Even with the success of chart-topping songs and blockbuster films, much of what has been discussed in the course of their careers is body image. Ashley Judd recently (wonderfully) countered People Magazine’s speculations over her appearance due to possible surgery she underwent by calling out the misogyny and image-harm done to all women through such obtrusive and uninformed reportage. Let’s be clear; the point is not whether these publications are false or true in their reporting. We have a problem when any woman needs to defend her appearance for any reason and is forced into a lose-lose situation when told she is either lying about altering her appearance or condemned for admitting to having work done. Sadly, much of this shaming is being done by gay men and fellow women.

&gt;This culture of shame starts at a specific focal point of anatomy. The internet is rife with examples of commentary and memes– linking to what I think is the most respectful discussion of this situation– of how gay men perceive women’s sexual organs, mostly as something repulsive–often a squidlike sea creature.  I’ve seen this posted multiple times on Facebook; fastest way to be defriended if that’s your goal. This is the most literal definition of misogyny, communicating widespread disgust and fear over female reproductive organs.

&gt;I’ve never understood what value it has for someone to be disgusted by something he claims to not even been interested in, so the frequency with which negative language is used by gay men toward ladyparts and how often other women validate these claims for their gay friends by conflating disinterest with disgust is alarming. The clear issue is that these comments are borne out of a lack of education on sexuality, especially female sexuality; the focus is on external appearance, yet discussions are almost exclusively label the whole of female anatomy “the vagina,” an internal structure. There is a complete disassociation of how the whole, very natural system operates. Regardless of the amount of time one has spent in a biology classroom, the important thing for gay men to understand is when they make attacks on women’s genitals, they are making attacks on women.

&gt;So it goes with commentary on the rest of the body, from which men are often protected. Yes, gay men do experience and self-perpetuate body fascism, which ultimately is another response that validates misogyny: building up one’s body to be as manly as possible to avoid any resemblance to femininity. A misogynistic culture that elevates strong male bodies must also denigrate strong female bodies, so constantly questioning women’s bodies–for shape, slenderness, artificiality or any other bullshit reason you want to come up with–has become de rigueur in our society. The Perez Hiltons, D-Listeds and newsstand gossip rags of the world take this very framework, apply it to the most visible women–celebrities–and sit back to let the chaos of body negativity unfold.

&gt;As the broadest consumers of these publications, television shows and more, women and gay men need to question the dialogue taking place for any change to occur. Educating ourselves on our bodies or those of our female friends’ is step one, followed by actively sharing our knowledge with others. When you see friends sharing body-negative articles, memes or videos, call them out on it; help them question their assumptions. Additionally, you can start sharing more body-positive stories by word of mouth, articles you have read or images that strike you. Body positivity is body power, so a sea-change in the type of dialogue we use when discussing ours and others’ bodies can make a big impact

ktoth04,,,"I'm aware of my oversimplication of feminism as a whole, and curious how you would define the movement if not one for equality?

For the viewpoint battle, I understand how girl can be used offensively, but, yes, I admit, I cannot fathom how the mere phrase ""Good Girl Gina"" can be offensively construed on it's own. 

I think what it comes down to is letting the word own you versus owning the word. We were all girls at one point (based on anyone's definition of young female). Being offended by the phrase ""Good Girl Gina"" alone is the same as being offended by girl. Would we be ashamed if the phrase was ""Happy Human"" instead of ""Good Girl""?  Being human, and being girls, is to me, something we undeniably are (because I align the word girl and the word woman closely). It's part of our identity. I would rather own the word than have it own me.

So what it comes down to is, yes, I guess, I cannot see the problem with the ""Good Girl Gina"" meme. I see the problem with the way it is often used (eg ""On her period, BJ week"" or ""Sees me playing games, Makes me a Sammich""), but not with it's inherent existence.

So if I have this right, your argument is then that the phrase ""Good Girl Gina"" is inherently misogynistic because she is old enough to be outside some women's interpretation of ""young woman"" and should be referred to as a woman instead of a girl. Because of this, we should all find it offensive because some subset of women do.

And what I've been expressing is that because she fits in my view of ""young women"" the phrase is not necessarily inherently misogynistic. I think what is really important is the usage. The GGG phrase can be used misogynisticly, and it can be used... not (is there a word for non-misogynisticly?).

If I had to simplify your argument down to a line it would be ""I'm offended so everyone should be offended too"".

I think shaming can get the ball rolling. Both IRL and online, shaming sexism is more for the benefit of other observers rather than the one behaving in a sexist manner. Shaming them tells everyone else, ""Look at how badly this person is behaving. This is unacceptable.""

And the more people who point it out, especially with public figures, the more the public and media are forced to address the issue.

unclegrandpa,,,"This is so not true. You absolutely can shame people into changing their behaviors. I cannot believe somebody would even suggest the contrary. I am not familiar with Brene Brown, but I see she is social worker - NOT a sociologist. A sociologist would never (I would hope anyway) suggest something as naive or as empirically incorrect as the excerpt you have quoted. 

Shame is an important part of the socialization process, this is basic stuff here - like sociology 1000. Shame is not simply something that occurs time to time that we can shrug off or somehow resist. Cultures use shame to enforce various social norms and to regulate people's behavior. It is a sort of informal punishment for transgressions. It is used because it is an effective way of controlling behavior. As a matter of fact, informal social pressure (like shaming) is often far more effective in changing behaviors than more formal methods (like our legal system). 

On another note, to call the use of shame a ""master's tool"" is naive and thoughtless. The use of shame never has been and never will be limited to the enforcement of patriarchy. Furthermore, shame (and other informal social pressures) are often the only forms of social power available to the marginalized, disenfranchised, or otherwise powerless. Look how non-violent protestors have used public shaming to humiliate their oppressors and encourage change.

itsasocialconstruct,,,"I actually agree, 'creep' is an extremely useful term, but it is also frequently used inappropriately as in your example. Saying that it is creepy for a male in business dress to 'flirt' (a nebulous term that instantly relies on characterizations and assumptions about an individual's actions) with a gothic-ly dressed woman is a misuse of the label. The situation relies on stereotyping both individuals and their desires.

I will try to construct an example of creepy behavior that doesn't rely on gender or on tropes. The first that comes to mind is a story that my sister told me about her work. She is a woman, but I think that this could happen to a person of either gender:

My sister is a counselor/supervisor at a half-way house for people with combined substance abuse problems and psychological disorders. She works late at night and if a client articulates suicidal intentions, she has to have a line of sight with them all night (or something like that, I'm not so clear on the regulations of the ward). Sometimes clients will say something like, ""oh, I really feel like slitting my wrists. By the way you look really pretty tonight."" I'm exaggerating, but there's the essential bit. The clients are abusing the fact that my sister cannot 'escape', she is under duress where she cannot avoid their advances or remove herself from the situation because she has an obligation. I would argue this as an appropriate instance to use 'creep.'

 My sister has some sort of punitive power over her clients as a supervisor, yet the clients are able to reverse this and use her responsibilities against her. I point this out because I think it's interesting. Often, I think of creeping as a person abusing the fact that they have power over another individual in order to make advances while that individual is under duress, but here that isn't the case (which is notable).

A cliche example of a creep is the teacher who makes advances at a student. The student is under duress, it is not a 'fair' flirtation for obvious reasons. However, one could also make an argument that if a student makes advances towards a professor (at a university now), then the professor also experiences some sort of duress and that that flirtation is also unfair. It is easy to see how in both cases the individual making the advances could be construed as harasser.",0,1334994710,,0,c4euoh2,t3_skrl3,2.0,t1_c4eu15b,6732,1428766176,14,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1328860039.0,t2_6vy8u,1.0

Additionally, I find it offensive that I can not ask a simple question as a father without someone getting defensive, ignoring the fact that I do respect the pronoun preference if only by not calling her a ""her"" when she is around. Why isn't this question taken seriously?

Finally, there is nothing that I do not accept and embrace about the gay community from your sexual preference to your gender preference. This all makes perfect sense to me. Why the vitriol when an undeniable medical fact is used instead of an anecdotal perspective? My questions are legitimate and deserve a serious, calm and rational response.

From what I understand, back in the 70's and 80's ""outting"" public figures was a big deal in some circles, on the idea that public figures had sacrificed an expectation of privacy and the public needed to know that people they respected were queer. Given the desperate and fledgling nature of the movement at the time, I can sort of understand (if not entirely condone) the motivation behind this.

Now, I don't think many people still think like that, at least not consciously. ""Outting"" someone against their will only seems to get general approval if that person is an active, hypocritical opponent of the rights of other LGBTQ people - the Ted Haggards and George Rekers of the world.

I'm gay and a trans man. Being socially out as gay, and being publicly known as a trans man, are very different things. Being gay is an aspect of my personality and my visible social relationships. Being a trans man is an aspect of my medical history.

because anyone in agreeance with the topics in that link has throughly studied feminism because its precisely that these kind of things that feminism seeks to dismantle.

folk have to understand especially us men folk that feminism is not anti man its anti patriarchy/misogyny/sexism

the double standards you mention Embo (i hope u dont mind me shortening) are results of the toxic restrictive gender roles that we men create and maintain on a daily basis at the expense of women. That archetype that says we have to be these tough stoic bad asses  traps us in to violent harmful means of exists by which violence and power domination and control become defintional  to what it means to be a man rather than just specific choices among a host of options.

You mention that men are seen as horny animals but that narrative is presented and cosigned every day by men who have the institutional power to change it and regular guys like us (mind you im speaking systemically here) that sex is just something that guys are about but its strange u would mention such a thing without recognize that often this masculine hypersexuality women pay the price for in terms of rape and rape culture.

 to speak to your prision comment. a careful reading of that situation shows the toxicity of patriarchy better than anything. Men who are seen as weaker become the sexual furniture of the bigger stronger men and are often refered to as hoes, or the b word which are gendered insults towards women. what this means is in the absence of women (which is the kind of an environment that a male prison is) the men there CREATE WOMEN to have a foil by which they can reflect and prove their dominace control and masculine essense as it has been read into by the static gender roles patriarchy creates and that feminism would see us free from.

&gt; ""I take that criticism very seriously. ... This show isn't supposed to feel exclusionary. It's supposed to feel honest, and it's supposed to feel true to many aspects of my experience. But for me to ignore that criticism and not to take it in would really go against my beliefs and my education in so many things. And I think the liberal-arts student in me really wants to engage in a dialogue about it, but as I learn about engaging with the media, I realize it's not the same as sitting in a seminar talking things through at Oberlin. Every quote is sort of used and misused and placed and misplaced, and I really wanted to make sure I spoke sensitively to this issue. ...

&gt; ""I wrote the first season primarily by myself, and I co-wrote a few episodes. But I am a half-Jew, half-WASP, and I wrote two Jews and two WASPs. Something I wanted to avoid was tokenism in casting. If I had one of the four girls, if, for example, she was African-American, I feel like — not that the experience of an African-American girl and a white girl are drastically different, but there has to be specificity to that experience [that] I wasn't able to speak to. I really wrote the show from a gut-level place, and each character was a piece of me or based on someone close to me. And only later did I realize that it was four white girls. As much as I can say it was an accident, it was only later as the criticism came out, I thought, 'I hear this and I want to respond to it.' And this is a hard issue to speak to because all I want to do is sound sensitive and not say anything that will horrify anyone or make them feel more isolated, but I did write something that was super-specific to my experience, and I always want to avoid rendering an experience I can't speak to accurately.""


So, to summarize:

* she wrote the first season mostly on her own and wrote characters based on her experiences. 

* After the show began, she listened closely to criticism about the lack of racial diversity and felt that it was very important to introduce more diversity in the next season. 

* She also wanted to address the specific experiences that minority women have, which as a Manhattan Jewish/WASP woman she couldn't really. She said the next season would introduce more diverse characters (I assume because the writing team is expanding beyond herself??)

My opinions: This show isn't exactly autobiographical or anything, but isn't it entirely possible that she actually doesn't have any Black, Asian, or Latina friends, and therefore the show is representative of her experiences? I haven't seen the show yet (really want to), but I've heard so much coverage about it already! It sounds like it addresses the concerns of many early-20s women of this generation, and what's so wrong with that? As a writer, she's taken the criticism and will address it in season 2.

The guy doesn't want his young child to dress in a provocative way which may encourage people to make sexual advances. The child, being young may not fully comprehend the possible consequences for their actions. Sure, they may understand that sex can lead to children. But as children themselves, they do not nor can they fully comprehend the weight of that responsibility.

With that in mind, the child, being female would be the one to carry the child to term, bringing yet another child into the family whose nest she is still in. The father of the child, on the other hand has no such responsibilities should he decide to take off.

So, by attempting to suppress their child's sexuality until after they 'move out' so to speak, they are attempting to curb the possibility that they may be drug into a situation where they would possibly become parents of children again.

I know someone like that. His conclusion, however, was that he knows what the oppression and marginalization of women is like because he had a rough childhood, and therefore he has a say in it. That's another common problem: people don't realize that every form of oppression is different. Oppression of women is different from racial oppression or homophobia. Certainly it is different from having had a bad childhood.

Worse yet, his advice was that women simply give up on constantly ""getting angry"" about their oppression and ""use it to make themselves stronger"". Of course, that's what he did in his youth, and because a massive, society-wide system of misogyny is exactly the same as having a rough time as a child, he must be correct.

It's very difficult to make privileged white men even acknowledge that there is a problem at all. And because they think highly of themselves, their first reaction is usually ""well, they should just work hard like me, and then they'll be successful too"".

Because I assure you, that if you were to subject my own comment history to that kind of scrutiny, I wouldn't pass either.  In fact I doubt anybody here would pass.  We have a diversity of views and beliefs.

What I am, in fact, saying here, is that wabi does a good job of being impartial, fair, and keeping his personal beliefs separate from his duties as a mod.

""competently and genuinely present that viewpoint to others"" - I didn't mod him in order for him to speak for feminism.  I modded him to clean the spam filter and handle abusive trolls, as well as help weigh in when the conflict between MRAs and feminists gets a little too heated.  He's quite good at diplomacy and conflict resolution, and his perspective as an MRA helps with that.

Respectful disagreement entails recognizing that the other person has genuine beliefs, even if they are not your beliefs.

Oh I definitely agree - both with your views about how a good discussion should go, and also with your analysis that this is what's wrong with r/AskFeminists.  Part of the issue here, quite honestly, is the limited time in a day.  With my limited time, I've prioritized r/feminism.  I view /r/feminism as my most important responsibility, because so many people looking for feminist discussion on reddit are going to come there first, if for no reason other than the intuitive name.  So when there's issues to solve in both /r/feminism and also r/askfeminists, I've spent my time working on what's going on in r/feminism.  What that's meant is that a lot of problems with /r/askfeminists have not been addressed lately.  The past few months, I've just kind of let that subreddit go, I haven't been paying much attention to it.

A few things have changed lately.  For one, we've gotten rid of a few of our worst and most headache-inducing MRA antagonists in r/feminism, and we've spent the time needed to clarify, announce, and enforce policy at r/feminism.  And even moreso, we've added new mods who are helping take care of things to give me more time to focus elsewhere.  So with new mod help, and with a little more time to spend, we're now finally tackling the issues over at r/askfeminists, so that it can actually serve its intended purpose of providing a feminist perspective to outside inquirers.  demmian is my newest mod and he's volunteered to do most the work in making this happen - he's the one handling our new flair system.  And I think that should address your final concern, which is the willful misrepresentation of feminism.  With the flair in place, readers should be able to see at a glance which comments are the ""official"" answers of the forum, and which members are actual feminists whose answers can be taken credibly as speaking for feminism.

me_jayne,,,"Thanks for your comprehensive response.  This answers all my questions. 
I don't have an opinion (or interest, really) on this person's character.  What I find disgusting is that someone with sexist views would moderate a forum that represents feminist viewpoints.  Some examples: 

-	Calling someone a cunt.  Your response is, “well, the person did something horrible”.  The problem with calling people “cunt”, “nigger”, “faggot”, etc goes beyond the person being addressed; it’s the usage of the term itself that reflects a sexist/racist/homophobic/etc viewpoint.   It doesn’t matter whether the woman’s behavior was reprehensible or not, it’s the assumption that there’s something gendered about reprehensible.  Similarly, if a black person does something awful, calling him a “nigger” is insulting to all black people (and human decency in general) because you’re taking the stance that race and undesirable behavior are related.  
-	The white knight nonsense.  When you use this argument this, you (a) presume the votes and comments are coming exclusively from men (ignoring the presence of women, a sexist fallacy), (b) presume the motivations of the voter/commenters (a logical leap and demeaning to men by accusing them of insincerity), and (c) buy into the gendered stereotypes of men as sex-crazed (demeaning them again) and women as objects to be won.  It’s also just a lazy way to dismiss idea you don’t agree with.  More relevant for our discussion, it’s sexist towards men and women.
-	This comment is just black-and-white sexism: “Translation: my partner needs to have this (x) social status and have things in his life going well or I'm gone.  These type [sic] of posts are only made by women. Guys tend to be more understanding if their girlfriend is having a hard time, as long as she is good to them. I'm generalizing, and I'm sure there are exceptions... but I think my generalization holds with everyone I know and what I've seen on reddit”.  Aside from the logical fallacies here, the conclusion is that, gosh darn it, women are just more superficial than men!  Are you really going to defend this one?
-	Briefly looking at this person’s comments, I see that he is coincidentally the author of a comment I found very annoying just the other day, before I saw this post.  A woman complains that men she’s buying weed from texts her to show her breasts first.  Your co-mod thinks that it’s totally fine that men do this to her, because, after all, he does the same thing to women all the time.  Awesome, so she shouldn’t dislike it because from his perspective (as someone who asks for boob pics) it’s all cool.  I don’t care about what texts he shares with his friends, my only gripe is with how *dismissive* of her discomfort he is.  His women friends are fine with it, so why shouldn’t she be cool with harassment from men she doesn’t know well?  To put it mildly, this show a complete lack of sensitivity to women’s issues.  


So, OK, I think these comments are all sexist.  You say that you don’t agree with all his comments, but that it doesn’t affect his ability to mod.  I don’t understand how someone who clearly doesn’t endorse even a version of a viewpoint – and, indeed, is antithetical to it-- could act as a moderator for a forum that *represents* that viewpoint.  It would be one thing is the sub was advertised as a forum on gender issues in general; but to supposedly be able to *competently and genuinely* present the viewpoint to others?
And this, for me, begs the question: what is the point of your sub?  Thanks for providing an explanation.  I assumed (and got the impression from the sidebar) it was so that people could ask feminists questions about feminism.  This sounded really interesting.  Instead, it’s a forum for people who dislike feminism to tell feminists and people interested in feminism why they dislike it.  Someone asks a question, then the “anti-feminist” (for lack of a better term) gives response that’s sarcastic, antagonistic, and, importantly, *disingenuous*.   It’s one thing to disagree with someone; it’s another to claim, “she takes this stance because she don’t care about logic or reason”.  Respectful disagreement entails recognizing that the other person has *genuine beliefs*, even if they are not your beliefs.  I am pro-choice, for example, but I understand – cognitively-- why some people are not, and I could explain the pro-lifers’ reasoning.  So, next, someone points out that this person doesn’t represent a feminist viewpoint and a spat follows.  For what it’s worth, as an outsider, it seems like a better name might be r/FeministDebate or something, because the content isn’t really reflected in the current name.  It made more sense once you explained that it was intended as a space to funnel feminist:MRA debates.  Of course I don’t presume that your subreddit should cater to me.  I am disappointed, though, that people could get an inaccurate description of feminism… willful misrepresentation is a dirty trick in any debate.

[deleted],,,"In the UK there is no shame in having an abortion. It's not nice, but it's not a deplorable action and most women take measures to avoid being in such a position. My best friend used birth control (the pill) meticulously and it failed. She needed an abortion and she says it was the most traumatic experience of her life, but if her birth control failed her what choice did she have? She had no money to raise a child and she was too young for such a responsibility. Abortion was the best option for her, and she made the best choice.

Even without the stigma and shame of an abortion, women don't do it for fun. They do it because it's  necessary. Those against it are ultimately for a horde of unwanted children with no future, doomed to a life in care. Adoptive parents are not high in population as it is. Why add to the problem?

It's a woman's decision despite the circumstances and I'd rather keep it as such.

But I had one aunt that had 8 kids, didn't want any more, and just went back for an abortion as needed.  She was the only woman in the family that could have children, everyone else either had a c-section for their one and only child, not wanting to go through that again.  We were basically a bloodline that wasn't meant to bear children, and had c-sections not been available, we would have died out.

And a lot of the attitude about it was due to the lack of the religious institution forcing guilt on the people for the whole ""every life is sacred"" train of thought.  The human body spontaneously aborts fetuses all of the time, and we aren't made to wear shame for that.

What would you like to know?

Look, just because you can post a wall of links, that's hardly damning evidence against his character.  Wabi-sabi is an MRA and a feminist.  I've read through the list of quotes you've listed, and none of them are ""disgusting"".  Certainly I may have a different opinion than him in many of these examples, but nothing linked here disqualifies him from modship.  The closest thing you've provided is his use of the c-word, which I thoroughly disapprove of, however you will notice in context he is condemning thoroughly reprehensible behavior.  I do agree that this doesn't justify use of the word.

I've modded him because the userbase of r/AskFeminists is a mix of feminists and MRAs, as it is designed to be a meeting place between the two movements.  I felt it was appropriate for this to be reflected in the moderating team, and with wabi's inclusion, the mods are now also a mix of feminists and MRAs.  

Wabi has been an excellent mod.  His presence as a mod has nothing to do with who we've banned and who we haven't.

I think it might help if I explain the reason for r/AskFeminists.  We created the subreddit because we had a problem in r/feminism with too many MRAs coming to r/feminism to demand explanations from feminists.  MRAs who view feminism as illegitimate would post lots of content trying to disprove or argue against feminism or feminist principles, and wanted to use r/feminism as a space to debate against us.

Obviously this was a problem, it was derailing our ability to maintain a feminist focused discussion.  But I also wanted to maintain our focus as an open discussion, I didn't want to go a heavy handed direction.

So I felt that the best approach was to create a space where this kind of content is allowed.  That way, those who want to debate with feminists can do so legally, without having to come into our space and break our rules.

And it's actually worked very well.  Most of that content has been diverted off r/feminism, so that r/feminism remains on topic and focused.  And when we find people coming to r/feminism to debate with us, we can remove their posts and request that they take it to r/AskFeminists instead.  That way we aren't silencing anybody, we are simply asking everyone to keep it to the correct forums where it is on topic.  

It is true that r/AF has had a big problem with imbalance.  There are far more MRAs than feminists, and the tone of the discussion certainly reflects that.  We have just rolled out a new idea to try to help with that though - we have just started tagging feminists with flair, so that feminist answers will be given more weight and credibility and will be easily identified as the ""official"" answers of the forum.  I'm optimistic that this will restore some balance and sanity to the discussion.",0,1337191218,,0,c4osn1v,t3_tp0ui,2.0,t1_c4okajm,53773,1428938040,-1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1258896529.0,t2_3qhhr,

To suggest that women are locks implies they are barriers of entry. To what though? The only thing that it could imply is pregnancy. ""Keys"" and ""locks"" are pointless analogies if one doesn't ever plan on opening a door.

From the male perspective, there's some naive realist perspective that spreading one's genetics to multiple mates is some how evolutionarily ideal. I mean some animals work like  this. However, that entirely ignores the social consequence of multiple pregnancies in humans. The fact is that, we as a species, have to raise our young for a considerable length of time (our big heads that house big brains means we have tiny useless bodies for a long time). For a male to divide his focus among multiple mates is entirely short sighted.  So how is a someone a ""master"" when he spreads the group resources too thin and minimizes the genetic diversity?

From the female perspective, it assumes that they are *only* for pregnancy. The fact is that sex as an act of pleasure and/or social bonding. In fact *most* (like 99%) of the acts of sex in this world aren't for the purposes of procreation. So, 99% of the time neither party is interested in unlocking the door.

I'd be happy to answer your question from my perspective. I'm certainly not a feminist academic (I'm an engineer!) so please don’t take this as in any way reflecting what others thing/what reality is.

I believe the definition of patriarchy is a system by which males hold power over females by virtue of their gender. I think we can all agree that this isn’t very egalitarian. Where I see this in my own experience as being problematic includes the following:

- Society treating female sexuality as shameful/harmful

- Society treating motherhood as the expected path, and women who choose not to have kids are somehow flawed

- Society treating biological males as lesser if they express themselves in a non-masculine manner

- Society treating headstrong and assertive males as goal oriented, but women who act the same as flawed/evil/bitches

Note how I say society, and not just males? I think the fact that we do live in a patriarchal society causes many people, regardless of gender to hold these (in my opinion harmful) views. I don’t have all the answers, and I don’t think that snapping our fingers and becoming a matriarchy will somehow be better. I just hope that one day we can move a little bit more towards ending gender based discrimination.

MissInterpretation,,,"I actually like the ""cage"" concept - I think it illustrates objectification better than trying to explain how it makes people feel.  The word ""woman"" is a noun, and most of us interpret that as the 'person' portion of a noun; using the symbolism of the cage or shell illustrates how, through objectifying ""woman"", the word now means ""thing"".  

The best example I've ever experienced of objectification was when a neighbor boy 2 years older than I orchestrated a way to get me alone and then tried to feel me up.  When I tried to fight him off, he exclaimed (in a rather offended tone) ""Hey, I just wanna feel your tits!"".  Hindsight leads me to think he was more than a little surprised to experience such resistance; maybe he seemed to be of the opinion that they were public property?  or that his wishes/desires somehow trumped my own?

Mr_Stay_Puft,,,"Hm.

I don't know if I'd call it a right, exactly, because that's one of the most-abused buzzwords in the English language. If we wanted to talk in terms of rights, we'd need a definition for the term that fits the specific instance of going topless. In my jurisdiction, at least, there is legal equality on the issue, so we aren't talking strictly about formal permission to do something. More, we're talking about a duty of others to remain respectful and not react as they currently do when they see a woman topless.

I have a *right* to freedom of speech, but others have a right to react negatively when I say something provocative, as well.

We've got a social convention going that imposes all sorts of meanings on female secondary sexual characteristics. To ignore those meanings would be to pretend to live in a completely different society than the one we have now. You could even think of it as speaking a different language. In the semiotics of clothing as they exist now, female upper nudity has very strong connotations, and the only real way to avoid connoting those things when you pick an outfit is to avoid being female and topless.

Is there a gender dichotomy implicit in all this? Of course there is! Is there a double-standard? Yeah, I think so. Are there large ramifications for people's lives? On balance, probably not. If your goal is to totally deconstruct and eradicate the gender binary, then this is certainly a fair target (albeit as a minor part of a much larger campaign), but if you have more modest aims (at least in the short-term) it seems fair to mostly ignore this one.

Which still doesn't address the purely academic question of whether this is a case of disempowerment, privilege, or some combination of the two. I would reply that I'm not sure a semiotic difference is necessarily hierarchical. While there is obviously no denying that male privilege exists, I have very distinct memories of classmates from my childhood (both male and female) absolutely tearing into a (male) kid because he wore shorts that ended substantially above the knee. Girls in the class, while obviously facing a whole other set of issues, could wear shorter shorts without fear. This may seem trivial, but it meant that we all wore incredibly stupid, long, way-too-heavy shorts even on really hot days.

Now, the semiotics there were relatively specific to a particular part of the broader culture, and I'm in no way seeking to legitimize homophobia, (which was exactly what was going on), but it seems clear to me that that was not an instance of female oppression of males, and they were under no obligation to refrain from wearing comfortable clothing simply because guys couldn't wear it.

tl;dr: I'mma still take my shirt off when it's hot and sticky out.",0,1338109128,,0,c4sveoi,t3_u5yk4,5.0,t1_c4suzzz,4838,1429009166,1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1304832000.0,t2_57feg,

Sure, racism and sexism and homophobia are different... and these examples have **very** different ramifications. But the common thread here is that a member of a majority group refuses something traditionally given to members of that group because ze knows that other people will be denied this privilege for arbitrary and systematically discriminatory reasons.

I humbly submit that when it's stupidly hot, keeping unneeded layers on is pure fashion victimhood.

Obviously, it would be nice if people could get over the whole female shirtlessness thing, but maybe that's more an expression of society taking away from women, rather than giving to men?

If a woman remarries as a means of securing resources for herself and her children, then the father's previous biological children are competition for limited resources. (Snow White deals with royalty, so survival is not at stake in the tale, but biological lineage and who inherits is very much at issue). Maria Tatar says something similar.

AA was lying on her back and Assange was on top of her … AA felt that Assange wanted to insert his penis into her vagina directly, which she did not want since he was not wearing a condom … She did not articulate this. Instead she therefore tried to turn her hips and squeeze her legs together in order to avoid a penetration … AA tried several times to reach for a condom, which Assange had stopped her from doing by holding her arms and bending her legs open and trying to penetrate her with his penis without using a condom. AA says that she felt about to cry since she was held down and could not reach a condom and felt this could end badly.

&gt; As well as adding ladies and changing the bandit code so players don't automatically don a mask when their humanity dips low, patch 1.6.0 adds switchable outfits. You can persuade a player to part with their vestments, perhaps at gunpoint, or go scavenging for your own.

From what she told me, it is definitely a scene that is still very male dominated, and from some mainstream perceptions it could definitely look like there's a lot of ""I'm funny, but unattractive"" spiels in the female acts. 

I think it's easy to draw a parallel from the most recognizable and famous female comedian in Canada to deduce that her act is what has propelled her to where she is now. When you have such a small sample size to draw from, there are only so many conclusions you can come up with.

To be honest, I'd say that a lot of mainstream humor that I know of is self deprecating in some way or another. Also, to be the top of your game in mainstream comedy is a surefire way to know that a lot of that humor has widespread appeal (and therefore, probably pretty stupid in some ways). So to reach that sort of pinnacle and mass appeal, the jokes that resonate most with the most people will probably tend toward more stereotypical or conservative elements.

That is a pretty grim view though, I suppose, when there do also exist a lot of inspiring comedians out there that are fiercely intelligent (and are also appreciated by a fiercely intelligent audience).

Maybe it's just that here in Canada in particular no female has stepped up to be a whirlwind of comedic and inspirational power yet.

But once you start questioning that idea and standing out from it, especially if you're a girl, you're opened up for stalking and harassment that would be unspeakable if in person. It's just not worth it to subject a ""breakout figure"" to that just to get maybe one or two good questions answered.

She clearly stated that she was talking to people who *wanted* to be married, and all her points were pretty good. Maybe not universal, but the ""top 10 list"" genre doesn't have to be universally applicable.

I think it's disingenuous for people to interpret her as saying ""all women are crazy, angry, slutty liars"". She's highlighting some real problems. And she's focused on personal issues, not the wider political or social issues.

* you've got psychological issues you need to deal with, not just ignore

* you're overlooking all the perfectly decent guys out there, and instead are looking for traits that don't matter for a long term relationship, so you never find The One

* you get emotionally involved in casual hookups, which clouds your judgement when thinking about whether a guy is long-term material, and so you're wasting time on guys who aren't The One

* you mislead a guy into thinking that you are only interested in a casual relationship, that you're not serious, and so you're wasting time on guys who aren't The One

* you haven't learned how to be a partner, and aren't learning how

* you don't believe in your own self-worth

Notice that this list overlaps a bit with McMillian's list:

* you have psychological issues

* you have higher standards (this point is more pessimistic than McMillian's implication that if you had higher standards you would have met The One by now)

* You have lots of casual relationships (this point is discussed coming from the opposite angle - that you're ok with only having casual relationships.

cleos,,,"Not to beat a dead horse, but I think it's imperative to understanding this article to differentiate between *conformity* and *identity*.

Adherence to gender role expectations is not a continuum with ""cis"" on one end and ""trans"" on the other. 

Trans people (speaking of MTF and FTM), like people who identify with their assigned gender face the same issues that cis-gender people face.

A person who is identifies as one gender, regardless of whether that gender matches up with their sex or not, is going to be viewed by strangers (society) as either a man or woman. 

A female born man or a male born man is still viewed as as man by passersby. 

But regardless of the biological sex of the person, the man is still going to be judged by the degree to which he adheres to the gender role expectations of men.

If a person that society labels as *man* has the occupation of a nurse, he is viewed as not conforming to gender role expectations. Strangers that see a person who presents as a man doing the grocery shopping in the middle of the day is going to be viewed differently - and less favorably - than a woman grocery shopping in the middle of a day or a man in an office. 

A woman who is biologically female is not inherently conforming to the social male gender role anymore than a woman who is biologically male is, because role adherence relates to the degree to which a person adheres to a social identity - and ""cis"" or ""trans"" refers to a self-identity. 

Another way of thinking about it:

**Note**: The following scenario isn't meant for you (soducked), exactly. It's really a way for *me* to work this out. Please, feel free to comment, but this part is more me explaining it to myself or something than explaining it to you. 

In 2X a few days ago, there was an AMA of a girl with a father who cross-dressed. When he was in the house with the family, he wore women's clothes (make-up, heels, stockings, etc). But he still identified as a man. 

Let's say there are two twin brothers on the street, both are biologically male and physiologically look like males. Neither have shaved their faces in a week. Both of them decided today that they were going to put on a dress, a wig, heels, lipstick, stockings, a skirt, a blouse - and there were doing so in a genuine, non-costumelike way.

Both of these men are going to be treated negatively for wearing clothing that is not typical for their gender. They might be insulted, attacked, or ignored. People might point at them or move away from them. What people see are *men* who are wearing *women's* clothing. Both both of those brothers might identity as men. Or only one might. Maybe neither of them do.

Let's say that both of them jokingly decided to dress up as women, but one of the brothers secretly identified as a woman. Regardless of this self-identification, they're both being treated the same way because they're viewed as men wearing women's clothing.

But, if we fast-forward a year or two:

One of the twins identifies as a man. The other twin once identified as a man, but then began openly identifying as a woman. This twin shaved his beard, adopted a female name and female pronouns, and is undergoing hormone therapy to develop a more feminine body form. In neutral clothing, this twin is viewed as a woman. 

Two years from from their first dress-up day, the twins are walking down the street, both in dresses, makeup, heels, stockings, etc.

But what society sees (strangers see) is a woman with a cross-dressing brother. Unless she explicitly tells anyone of her trans status, nobody knows. Her co-workers and boss treat her like a woman, strangers walking by see her as a woman, etc. Because she's perceived as a woman, she will face all the same crap that women face - regardless of what their chromosomes or genitalia are.

If she decides to become a construction worker, she's going to be judged in the same way that all women in masculine/male dominated roles are going to be judged. If she wears her hair down, wears skirts, lipstick, and a push-up bra, she's going to be treated differently than if she wears a (woman's) pantsuit and wears her hair in a bun. 

To reiterate, the social privilege of conformity to gender isn't tied with self-identity with gender. Whether you *present* as a man or a woman is of greater influence than whether you *identify* as a man or a woman, because theoretically the only person who knows about that identification is you - the self.

Strangers are not making judgments on their gender/sex matchup - rather, they're making judgements on whether they present as men or as women.

The degree to which a person conforms to one's societal gender role expectations is *not* synonymous with the concept of what gender they identify as.  A man who is a nurse will be considered nontraditional though, and he may be penalized and looked on negatively for engaging in a role that is not typical with his gender.

I'm very interested in social psychology - specifically, in social perceptions - more specifically, in gender.

I did an undergraduate thesis and a study on peoples' perceptions of those who do not adhere to traditional roles. I had participants rate men and women who were engaged in traditional and nontraditional occupation and lifestyle behaviors on the factors of Likability, Intelligence, and Attractiveness.

Traditional/nontraditional are terms used to denote whether a person is engaging in a role behavior that is typical or atypical for their gender. In my study, I had nontraditional women would be women who engaged in behaviors such as mechanic work, a pilot, or a police officer. Nontraditional men were men who were hairdressers, doing the grocery shopping, or being a nurse. They were engaging in behaviors that were typical of the other gender. And, in certain instances, they were penalized for failing to conform to their traditional gender role (most significantly, nontraditional men were rated as less attractive than the other groups).

However, ""trans"" isn't the same thing as not conforming. A woman-born-woman can be very masculine and still identify as a woman. 

I think the major thing with the sentence of yours that I quoted is that the first part refers to social identity - the degree to which a person adheres to or does not adhere to the norms of their gender, while the latter half refers to self-identity - whether a person identifies with their assigned gender.

I think they're looking at it through a slightly narrow window. *Compared to male cis privilege,* female cis people are not nearly as exempt from sex-based oppression. But *any* cis person, regardless of their genitalia, is exempt from more oppression than a non-cisgendered person.

So I agree with your first two paragraphs. As for your third, I'm not sure I'd go so far as to accuse the author of being willfully ignorant. Their perspective may just be limited by their experience, or they may have had a very compelling educational experience denying the need to distinguish trans issues from general feminism.

Gender-non-conforming people get penalized to the degree that they don't conform to their socially assigned gender - and trans* people face the most extreme penalties. The article's main argument - that gender identity does not exist and we should do away with the cis/trans* distinction - strikes me as an attempt to erase trans* identities and experiences and to coöpt the trans* movement under feminism.

I consider myself feminist, and I believe wholeheartedly that current constructions of masculinity, femininity, and gender are incorrect and harmful. But I can't help but think that the author of this article must be being willfully ignorant of the way society treats trans* people to write something like this, denying the legitimacy of trans* issues and claiming they don't actually exist separately from feminist issues.

How is distinguishing a male and a female restroom sexist? It's sexist because it's in the general category of ""sequestering women"". It's an adaptation to the assumption that men can't be civil around women. It's an adaptation that doesn't *condemn* men's incivility, but merely works around it by keeping women separate, as if it were a force of nature.

It's also cissexist, because categorizing humans as ""men"" xor ""women"" is erasing of personal identity for many of them and flatly does not apply to some of them.

I'm not better than someone else because I shave, and they're not better than me because they don't. Not every feminist is going to want to have hair in certain places. We're all different people, and that's okay. I've educated myself on the other options, about why I started doing things, and I made an informed decision to do the thing I like best. There's a difference between blindly following societal norms and intentionally following societal norms because you want to.

The idea that we can somehow replace strict or semi-strict social categories with some sort of fuzzy and ambiguous continuum sounds great, but it is a much taller order than advocates seem to acknowledge. MUCH taller imo. This idea has at its heart an overly simplistic view of our world and an exaggerated estimation of our ability to socially engineer it. 

Even if we could somehow eliminate categories like sex (or race, or age, or whatever socially significant characteristic you want), they would simply be replaced with other categories based upon some sexual or biological criteria. 

People like categories. When we see somebody as a male or female we get very important information in regard to how we are supposed to act towards them. Humans are social creatures and we require (hence crave) this sort of information.

We LIKE knowing this stuff about people, we like being able to put them in a comfortable category. When we don't have access to this sort of information we get nervous. This is why we have so many categories for social information. We categorize things and people without even thinking about it. And there is nothing wrong with this, this is how we are supposed to behave as humans.

That's because I wanted to know what *you* meant by it. Your original comment did not seem at all relevant to my comment that you were replying to, so I was curious as to why you wrote it.

&gt;Having a job that pays you well does not mean that you would not have these benefits if you did not live under a capitalist society.

Whether or not you would have these benefits under another system is irrelevant. The fact remains that you receive benefits from capitalism. If you lived in a socialist society, you might receive similar benefits from socialism.

If my friend Peter makes me a sandwich, I am benefiting from Peter's generosity. It doesn't change that fact if Sheila would be just as happy to make me a sandwich. I'm still benefiting from *Peter's* generosity, because he is the one making me the sandwich.

Unless you want to deny that any forms of benevolent sexism (I misspoke in my earlier comment and called it ""benign sexism"") exist in our society, it's difficult to see how you can claim that we do not benefit at all, ever, from patriarchy.

&gt;To me, the kind of equivocation of ""well, it's so complex, we can't really make a judgment on it"" serves only to obfuscate the issue.

Nope.

&gt;If someone receives benefits, they can be said to ""benefit"" from a thing.

No.  I live in a patriarchy.  I benefit from living near the beach, feminism, and having people and cats in my life who I love.  None of these things are a result of a patriarchy, and I have none of these benefits because of patriarchy, or because of capitalism.

Gettingbetter,,,"Since we're sharing our conversion stories, I'll also share mine, although maybe less eloquently.

I was and am a progressively minded person, but like many liberal males, thought of feminism as the militant 2nd wave feminists that are blamed *ad nauseum* (for what?). Martin Luther King, Jr. bemoaned the moderate white male, and I was (and am still probably) pretty typical for that category. I was sympathetic to the idea that women aren't getting paid as well, vaguely aware that women are over-objectified in the media, but I resisted the idea that I was also a sexist because I didn't call girls who had sex ""whores"". All the women in my family are very strong people, and I used them to shore up my case that I wasn't a sexist.

Well I was a sexist after all. I made fun of girly things. I preferred women who acted more like ""one of the guys"". I was hard on teens who liked boy bands and doing their hair and make up. I never insulted them to their face, but I always considered myself above them. I was hard on women who liked romantic comedies, and didn't like guys who acted ""too gay"" or effeminate. 

Much like the OP, it was a friend of mine who pointed out what it meant when I said that a movie was ""for girls"". At first I teased her about it quite a bit, but after a while of thought (days? a week or two? Longer? It's been several years), I realized that I was teasing her to make her feel invalidated by it. That it was a defensive front to both change the course of the conversation where I was not being blamed and where she could feel as self-conscious as I was. Pretty lousy of me, but it got me thinking.

I still don't actively read feminist writings, but I make an effort to not assume things about people. Maybe this girl really knows computers. Or maybe she really knows make-up. One girl I know is getting a fully-funded PhD at Duke University, but she is first in line to see whatever romantic comedy is out. One does not negate the other.

I think the hardest part is actually pulling back the veil and seeing how women are treated by people who I used to stand up for.

I'm not sure where you got the impression that I don't understand how men benefit from patriarchy. I understand how men benefit from the patriarchy; I just think the picture is a lot more complex than you do.

Maybe what you mean to say is that men, on average, receive more benefits than do women under the patriarchy? Or that the tradeoff between benefit and oppression is less onerous for men than women?

&gt;You benefit from the economy.

If someone receives benefits, they can be said to ""benefit"" from a thing.

I live in a capitalist economy. I receive benefits from it, in the form of a comfortable life. Therefore, I benefit from capitalism.

I'm not sure why you bring up a comparison to socialism. This is not an issue that bears comparison. The fact remains that I receive benefits from capitalism while also being oppressed by it.

&gt;Probably like you benefit from capitalism and you're a wage slave?

[Feminism is for Everybody by bell hooks](http://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Is-Everybody-Passionate-Politics/dp/0896086283/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339556225&amp;sr=8-1) - this is a great text to get your started on basic beliefs and history. She generally can be a little difficult to read at times if you don't have the background, but that's not the case with this book. She intended this book to be something most people could read and understand. 

[Womanist Musings](http://www.womanist-musings.com/) - one of my favorite blogs. Womanism tends to center around African American women's experiences, and the writers of this blog don't pull any punches when critiquing a racist, classist or sexist aspect of society. An example of this is a [really great post](http://www.womanist-musings.com/2011/09/open-letter-from-black-women-to.html) about how black women see ""Slut Walks"" which many young white feminists embrace. 

[Feministe](http://www.feministe.us/blog/) - one of the more well known feminist blogs. Super accessible.

[Feministing](http://feministing.com/) - another really popular feminist blog. 

[Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood](http://www.amazon.com/Handmaids-Tale-Everymans-Library/dp/0307264602/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339557129&amp;sr=1-1) - dystopian sci-fi novel which really shows why feminism is important. It shows a world where women basically have no rights at all. 

[More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing by Amartya Sen](http://ucatlas.ucsc.edu/gender/Sen100M.html) - really great essay about how girls all over the world are not treated as well as boys are and what this means for the future. My summary is really basic, and the ideas are pretty complex. The writer is a very influential economist, but he's done a lot of work regarding the elimination of poverty and inequality. 

[The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough](http://frank.mtsu.edu/~phollowa/5sexes.html) and [The Five Sexes, Revisited](http://www.neiu.edu/~lsfuller/5sexesrevisited.htm) by Anne Fausto-Sterling - this person's work is really rooted in undermining the idea of dichotomies in terms gender, sex, and sexuality. Fausto-Sterling is actually a prominent academic in the fields of biology and women's studies, so this work is from a very unique perspective.

alxjrvs,,,"That final quote is *spot on*. I am a guy who, like many, thought feminist meant ""Women over men."" I thought these crazies were out demanding that Men be taken down a peg. And of course, I would roll my eyes. 

*Are you kidding?* I would think to myself. *I would much rather be a girl at this point. Look at how easy it is for them! I've been denied by girls my entire life.* And I would think that that was a valid thought. To clarify; the idea here was that Women had it easier because they were *denying me sexually*. 

This is, of course, the thought process of a pretty stupid 13 year old. The fact that I had self worth squared right over the axis of sexuality should indicate some severe problems to begin with. 

The idea here is that I had *no way of seeing what their lives were like*. I had privilege, I didn't need to. We are at a blind, which is part of what makes privilege so insidious; to recall a great quote from a terrible human, ""There are known knowns, and there are known unknowns, but there are also unknown unknowns; things we don't know we don't know."" 

We're men. We have it the easiest. Doesn't mean everything was great *for you*, just that in the ""gender"" category, we're on easy. We don't need to worry about a whole host of things that we will *never ever learn about*. But there are things we can know, things we can try to understand. It is not our fault. It is not your fault. It is not their fault. In understanding your privilege, you make the world slightly better by realizing another aspect of your actions, and responding accordingly.

cleos,,,"&gt; ""men can't control themselves

Men can't control themselves is not only a bad reason, it's completely untrue.

Men are perfectly capable of controlling themselves. Even when drunk, they cannot ""accidentally"" rape anybody.

I think your statement ultimately reflects the idea that we should continue to oppress women because women are oppressed.

I know this sounds like a loaded, dramatic, and sort of ridiculous phrase, but broken down:

I say ""Women should continue to be oppressed"" because I see gender segregation in bathrooms as a form of oppression because it perpetuates the idea that men and women are different enough that they can't go to the bathroom in the same place. For some reason. In a world where men are seen as superior to women, perpetuating differences serves to widen the superiority/inferiority gap.

I say ""because women are oppressed"" because it reflects the rape culture in our society, where women are prey, men are predators. Where men sometimes ""can't control themselves"" and where a woman ""shouldn't"" have been drinking too much or walking down the street alone. Where a woman's clothing is considered provocation for assault by a man. We live in a culture that consistently women that promotes the restriction of their freedom (don't drink, walk alone, wear certain types of clothing, etc) and men are left unchecked (nobody says to men 'maybe you shouldn't go to the club. You'll be around drunk women in revealing clothing and you might not be able to control yourself).

floweryleatherboy,,,"Despite not being one, I can access a heterosexual vanilla young male experience enough to think this is a good analysis.  A very good analysis, if you take the summary points.    The summary is not ""men think about sex all the time"", it's: men feel powerless, think manhood was stolen from them, believe in the promise of getting the hot chick, view women as decoration, think women tempt them to ruin.   

In general this kind of analysis, heavy on the, let's call it women's street sense is I think the right way to understand the current gender system.   A lot of our old institutional 70s feminist academic rhetoric doesn't get at the modern essences.  

Other examples... the good points in and best summary of the scum manifesto are not, e.g. ""women want to kill men"", it's ""men secretly envy the richness of female social experience, and sublimate that into sex"".  I think there's useful street smart analysis like, men are afraid if they aren't slightly vanilla dominant over women they are actually gay.   ""Men create wars because of their penises"" is an underused analytical tool. 

Really, study this article, it's worth understanding.   I was very young and very closeted when I felt some of these ways, but I did at that time, and many of these things are core for understanding patriarchy now.

ohgeronimo,,,"To some extent men undergo those same thought processes, but in my experience the sexual inadequacy comes into play quite a bit more. Most of my young (geeky) college friends went through a period where they saw it both as the world lying to them, and as them failing. They tended to go through the entire introspective mess, questioning themselves, and at the same time they'd blame the world. They'd say the world hadn't been fair, that they still deserved a girl, but that the world had raised the bar and added extras. They clinged to the fantasy that they deserved something for working hard, that the world was just and giving. So that bar was raised, and then they'd look harder at themselves and because they live a life flooded with sex and shows of bravado would assume that they were not meeting the standards for sex and masculinity. And to some extent that works. They work on being more confident, more aggressive, which allows them to convince women to give them a chance. But then there's the feeling of being less powerful. Suddenly life is about winning women, being a man to become the knight and be the hero to meet the standards of the world that were raised.

And then you get the jerks. The ones that, even if they're succeeding, can't realize why they feel so compelled to keep chasing the dream. They decide that because they're doing everything right, it must be the other party at fault. So they hate women, because life isn't fair.

Eventually, some men realize that life isn't fair, that they need to be outgoing and confident and so forth, but hopefully they come to the conclusion that if life isn't fair and they still don't get what they want that they need to just be rational and accept it and move on. But others, and these are the ones that set bad examples, cry and attack and blame because they just never see the problem is within themselves and that the world owes them nothing.

It was like thinking about Christmas the night before. I knew it wasn't helping, but the smallest curve of the female body would set me off. All I had to do was acknowledge one small thing and my body wouldn't let me relax and act natural. The only way to stifle that was to develop a healthy personal sex life, which unfortunately did make me more aroused mentally. I finally managed to control it by seriously dating and being committed to a relationship. But for so many young men I knew, they weren't ready to take that route and instead just suffered with the awkward way their bodies reacted to an adult environment like University.

If anything, it seems comparable to the ticking biological clock some women tell of.

drakeypoo,,,"&gt; Did you ever watch old cartoons where a character is starving on a desert island, and when another character approaches, he's so hungry that he imagines the other character as a talking piece of food? It's like that for most men, most of the time. We're starving, and all women are various types of food. Only instead of food, it's sex. And we're trying to conduct our everyday business around the fact that we're trying to renew our driver's license with a talking pair of boobs. So, from about age 13 on, around 90 percent of our energy and discipline is devoted to overcoming this, to behave like civilized human beings and not like stray dogs in a meat market. One where instead of eating the meat, they want to hump it.

HiMaintenanceLoClass,,,"Two comments:

If he is going to take a feminist stance, he could start by not referring to Sandra Fluke as a ""college girl."" Would he call a 30 year old male student at Georgetown law school a ""college boy""?

Also, regarding number 5 (We were told that society owed us a hot girl), I think it would be worthwhile to consider that almost all movies with female protagonists guarantee them a guy (though not necessarily a hot one) at the end. Yet somehow women don't feel entitled to sex from men (at least the author doesn't mention that). Rather than creating a sense of entitlement in women, these representations tend to create a sense of distress around the idea that women might not live up to expectations by ending up with a husband. I guess my point is that these heteronormative representations of romance aren't just teaching men that they deserve women, they are teaching everyone that we belong in a (hetero)sexual relationship, and if we don't end up in one, there is something wrong with us. Perhaps, as the author suggests, men are more likely to react violently to this feeling of inadequacy.

Nice way of ignoring the rest of the comment. Please answer the rest of the comment as well. 

&gt;And men have many many many advantages. In general, men can go &gt;anywhere and expect to be treated fairly decently. 

That was not what was being discussed. What was being discussed was ladies night at the bar and your claim that this couldn't be an advantage for women since it was commodification. What is it? Is is an advantage for women or isn't it? 

&gt;Women, on the other hand, well, there's a reason women build &gt;women-only 'safe spaces'. There's a comparison to be made on such &gt;safe-spaces, but I'll note that women's safe spaces don't tend to be &gt;labelled 'hate groups', and there are a hell of a lot more women-only &gt;spaces.
Maybe that is because most of the 'hate group'labeling is done by the very same people that build female only spaces. 

&gt;Because if you admit that privilege exists, then you can call out &gt;others privilege and expect others to call out your own privilege.

Please read the section on female privilege over at finally feminism 101. 

&gt;There aren't many people in SRS for example, who would say that &gt;SRS is perfect. Currently, for example, I'm part of the group in SRS &gt;that is trying to lead SRS away from fat-shaming, virgin-shaming, &gt;and develop a sex-positive attitude that doesn't harm asexuals. 

Good for you. 


&gt;In return, I've learned a lot of things from SRS, such as things about &gt;trans people I hadn't thought of before, (such as including the space), &gt;about rape and rape culture I hadn't considered before and why &gt;enthusiastic consent is necessary, etc. etc.

Good for you. Do you want a cookie on how progressive you are? 

&gt;To be an ally of LGBT/SRS/feminism/other such groups doesn't &gt;necessarily involve agreeing with them on everything, but it does &gt;involve championing your own struggles with privilege. And if &gt;everyone adopts such a position, then a lot of privilege will be laid &gt;bare and everyone to have a better idea of their own and others &gt;privilege.

And I repeat, read the section on female privilege over at finally feminism 101, hint it's existence is not open to discussion. 

&gt; That sounds to me as though you haven't studied ethics? (That's a &gt;question) Any rule system, for example, would consider that if an &gt;action could be done with malicious intent, then the consequences of &gt;the action should be carefully considered

Can we please decide on what kind of ethics should be used?

&gt;Can we agree on one model of ethics that is used consistently? I am getting confused about this model where sometimes it is the intent of the action that is to be judged, sometimes the consequence of the action itself is to be judged. 

That sounds to me as though you haven't studied ethics? (That's a question) Any rule system, for example, would consider that if an action could be done with malicious intent, then the consequences of the action should be carefully considered. Also, any system which allows for asymmetry would also consider the perspective of the gestalt and perspectives of the components of the gestalt, thus only being concerned with the consequences, but having to think about the intent/perceived intent/etc. to determine what the consequences would be. And a host of other things that cause intent to annoyingly be relevant, like . The long and short of it is  that if there's a problem with intent or with the perceived intent, this may cause subtle consequences that are troublesome. And if the consequences are bad in the first place, then the action is of course unethical. 


Then also, I'm not sure what in particular you're referring to, but I suspect it may be the typical emotive argument for feminism and related movements. Emotive arguments, as it happens, are useful tools for feminists because they cause people to reconsider justifications they have made for their behaviour, but they also by nature aren't logical in and of themselves.

Well, I don't get called a slut, I get high-fives. I've never been told ""Dick or GTFO"". Hearing back from job interviews never hinges on how attractive I am. My acceptance into an orchestra is not rejected outright, (but will be shortcoming as soon as they hear me play). Lawmakers are not trying to control my sexual organs. Medical insurance pays for viagra, if I would ever need it. I can be pope, if I ever become religious &amp; catholic. I have 10% the chance of being raped than a female, and about 1% of the chance of being forcibly raped. If a girl whistles at me in the street, I can take that as a compliment because it is different from the default, as opposed to a reinforcement of my objectification. The ideal image for a man is based on what men like to see in themselves. . . not what women would like to see in men. If I ever participate in a LARP, I can be sure that no one will say that ""Are you sure a girl like you can handle all that heavy armour?"". I'm not scared off from studying Engineering, Math, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, by well-meaning teachers, recruiters, friends, family, or other. No one ever suspects that my effortless 4.0 GPA is because I can suck a cock really well. If I ever want to just cuddle, I can, in fact, just cuddle. When I say no, in any form, it is understood as 'yes' 10x less often. If I go to a gym, almost all of the training is based around a male body and male hormones. If I go to a bikeshop, I can reasonably expect to have been taught how to use a wrench, and for people to expect me to know how to use a wrench. If I play D&amp;D, people don't grab the book from me and look up stuff for me. If I play boardgames, no one is surprised that when a male wins.

Vulgarity itself I don't have a problem with; TAA's tone  is just as irritating as possible.  I think this discourages people who might not agree with his message from listening to it.  Without dissenting opinions, no intellectually significant discussion occurs.  Nobody grows as a person.

He describes the women he's discussing as mindless, cackling cunts before he even addresses what they're talking about. He then suggest that because he hasn't seen feminists object to the discussion that took place the entire movement is bankrupt.  Hyperbolic statements are appealing  to some, repellent to others, and rarely invite reasonable discussion.  

I wasn't trying to suggest you were picking on anybody, but if you're actually interested in the opinions of feminists, you may want to write out a post that conveys the same ideas as TAA's video in 30 seconds of reading as his 6.5 minute video does.  By not immediately describing the women in question as cunts, you would probably get much more meaningful dialogue.

Cultural conditioning and the way we automate and accept certain behaviours can mean we're exhibiting harmful actions without being aware that would shock us if we really understood their context or impact. It's about trying to be really patient and critical in examining your own perspectives, and trying not to feel outright attacked when someone has a strong reaction to a way we feel entitled to act.

I was having a discussion with a gay friend in the past about how I'd been completely oblivious to being hit on by another man. She concluded by saying ""maybe you just always assume people are straight."" It was uncomfortable to hear that, but I thought about it for a while. I realized she was right and that I more or less would assume somebody was straight by default until they clearly proved otherwise. Even if this was statistically safe, it can be as oppressive to an individual as any 'statistical' on how somebody should be or should act. I've tried from that moment on to not assume either way with somebody until it's made clear, not to rely on a default assumption. Besides, if you're trying to hit on somebody and they're completely oblivious, it feels like shit. So now since I'm asking the question, I'm better able to realize when someone's doing it to me and send clearer signals in the situation.

Your sex life must be interesting. What does your spouse of 20 years think when you are afraid of kissing her goodnight without first obtaining unambiguous verbal permission? She thinks she needs a divorce is what she thinks. 

Listen to this:

On the second date with my now wife, I went to kiss her on the cheek (without asking permission of course, because I wanted her to like me and not think I was a social awkward idiot) and she quite sneakily moved her head slightly so I inadvertently kissed her directly on the lips. If you can tell me how this was abusive, or unsafe, or disrespectful, or whatever without sounding like a complete idiot I would love to see it.

*Let me take the exact facts that you've presented in this story and spin them from a different perspective.*

*My name is (say) Jennifer. I texted this guy Joseph that I've been out with a couple times - we had some pizza and a beer and played some Mario Kart lounging on his bed.*

*Later we began kissing a little. It was pretty nice but then he began getting too aggressive and putting his hands up my shirt. I'm not okay with this - I say, ""okay, stop."" He moves to the edge of the bed and looks hurt. He looks like he feels rejected, and I feel bad about that - it's not that I don't like Joseph, it's that I'm not ready to move beyond kissing at this point.*

*I want to lighten the mood and communicate that I'm not rejecting him outright, so I reach over and start tickling his sides. He grins and attacks me with tickles. I'm laughing and squirming and gasping ""Haha, stop, please stop!"" He lets me go, I take a deep breath to try to stop laughing, and he lunges to tickle me again! This happens several times until my stomach is exhausted from laughing.*

*All of a sudden Joseph gets a serious look on his face and crawls on top of me. He gives me a deep kiss and runs his hands up my shirt again. His touch is rough, and he yanks my shirt up to touch my breasts. This is different than our kisses before and I am scared; I feel out of control. I try to say ""stop"" but my terror tightens my throat and it only comes out as a whisper.*

*The rest is history*.

*Edit to clarify. I am not trying to make up details to make the woman more sympathetic. Instead, I am trying to illustrate the following point: what if the guy's perception of the situation is the description laid out in the original post, and the girl's perception of the situation is what I describe here? It's perfectly possible; people experience, perceive, interpret, and remember the same events very differently. What he sees as passion, she sees as forcefulness. What he hears as a mild, not-too-serious ""stop"" is what she hears as a ""stop"" so full of terror that she can barely get it out.*

*What then? What if both situations are ""the truth"" from two different perspectives? I don't have an easy answer.*

Okay.

I will also add (and explain in more detail later) that I do recognise that this leads, at best, to murky waters ethically speaking. I will also add that arguing that this is an understandable position does not mean that I support it, but just that I could not completely condemn someone for doing it in an absolute manner.

Certainly, if advertising causes someone to feel so badly about themselves that they develop an eating disorder, it is quite clearly physically harming them. No individual advert will be the sole cause for this, but if all advertising promoting image as being excessively important (obviously subjective, but you can broadly imagine the advertising that would fall under this banner) were removed, cases of eating disorders would certainly decrease. The number that would have to be not put up to stop one case is again not something that you or I can specify, but if someone feels that they are helping to stop the great harm that an eating disorder can cause, then they are using a similar justification (albeit at the other end of the grey scale) as you would to break the law to save someone's life by damaging property. I imagine you might also risk damaging a fence to jump over it if it looked like a young child may break an harm. You might push past someone slightly, thus risking catching and tearing their clothes (their private property), to help someone up who had fallen over, even if it was clear that they were not severely damaged. All of these slide down a grey scale, with an infinite number of possible cases in between. I certainly wouldn't want to say, for certain, at what point on this scale it becomes okay on anything but a case by case basis.

Essentially, I am trying to show that this person viewed damaging this property in a similar light as you would view tearing down a wall to save someone's life - justified, despite being illegal. This doesn't mean that I think you should agree, or that the two actions are equivalent, but merely on the same sliding scale, so that you may perhaps understand them.

Now common etiquette says that you will not get sued or arrested etc, for catching someone's clothes when you brush past them to help someone else,  and it if there was a spate of such legal action, the law would probably be changed to allow for this. Similarly, if my friend believes that these adverts are harmful, she could lobby her council, local Member of Parliament, or the company hosting them. Whilst I think that these routes would certainly be good to pursue, as someone who is highly politically active, I can assure you that she is aware of these options, and knowing her political feelings, I would safely say that she has tried similar actions before and felt, in a general, broad manner, that the govt is corrupt and wouldn't trust them to make any sort of moral judgement - to be specific, she is an anarchist. I am aware that the consequences of this certainly could be, for example, used to justify a revolution to try and take dictatorial control of the country, in a highly unethical and undemocratic means. I agree that this is a justified concern, and to address it fully would, I imagine, go in to quite a lot of political/philosophical detail. To give a brief overview of why it may be justified though, I will first point out that many countries have semblance of democracy, and without acting outside the confines of the law and changing the law by force, no democracy is likely to develop. If one does not even have freedom of speech, it is difficult to hold the discussions that could lead to it being implemented without risking arrest, for example. Similarly, if one believes our govt is corrupt, then it may well be the height of stupidity to try and change it by corrupted legal means. Though this is a belief you may dismiss, if you go across to r/anarchism or any number of other subreddits I am sure you will find people who will argue this point a lot better than I (the point of the govt being corrupt). Many things leaked in the Wikileaks saga, for instance, will testify to the fact that the British govt has lied, directly, to it's people, for subversive and immoral means. This does, without doubt, leave one in a very difficult situation - I have claimed that people acting outside the law can be justified, and as such I would find it difficult to deny someone else the right to act outside the law when I disagree with them. For this reason I would come to the point of view that it is largely (perhaps always) best to act within the law, but that it can be justified not to, and that these cases should be looked on individually, and my young, optimistic side hopes that people in general will act in a way that is morally good (whatever that means).

tl;dr - My friend was acting further along the grey scale of preventing harm than you would be happy to illegally, but you are still on that scale. She didn't trust govt to be honest enough to change the law, and I find this hard to argue against, thought it leads to a morally sticky situation.",0,1333551065,,0,c48dwtl,t3_rr1vo,10.0,t1_c48d24l,4864,1428653955,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1320021824.0,t2_65azm,

That said, you won't see the Church disappear, but instead evolve. People will demand reform, the church will offer it, and a compromise will be reached. The process will likely be dialectical.

The Church is not infallible, but it's not (necessarily) headed by a group of wicked men plotting to steal your tithes and subjugate your daughters. It's a very complex institution made up of an increasingly diverse group of people with their own cultures and beliefs which are then projected onto Catholic dogma, and vice-versa.

reginajose396,,,"And this is why black feminists/womanists refuse to identify themselves with the feminist movement. I mean seriously, like there are hundreds of books that are about how the feminist movement continually ignores women of color in their fight for ""equality"". Like from the suffrage movement, when white suffragists were confused why black men received the right to vote because they were basically animals. Completely ignoring that black people only had the right to vote in name and totally throwing black women under the bus. In the 1960s women were fighting for the right of women to work and break the image that all women should be housewives completely dedicated to their families without any aspirations of their own. But black women have been raising the children of white people since the beginning of slavery. Black women have always been working in a white supremacist heteropatriarchial structure in which they were seen as less then.
You’re response doesn't even baffle me. this country has been built on 400 years of white supremacy from slavery ( in which black women were constantly raped, watching their half white children being raped by slave masters, watching their black husbands  being emasculated and lynched and also sexually abused by slavery masters, constantly compared to animals and denied to their humanity) to Jim crows, to a racist prison system that locks up black men in record numbers (for petty drug laws, despite the fact that most people who drugs are white, and since the 1980s the 500% increase in arrests have been due to drugs, and that all-white juries are more likely to convict to black people and that black people face tougher and longer prison systems for the same crimes white people commit)
so this country has been built on genocide of native americans, slavery, jim crow laws, internment, lynching’s etc. etc. and it wasn’t until 2001 that the last anti miscegenation were removed from all the states. Racism is not over. Why do people assume that racism is not the normative story of this country when it has never been like that? Ever. 
Ask yourself, why is it that minorities are underrepresented in every medium. Ask yourself why don't white audiences want to watch a show with a mostly non white cast that doesn't confirm to racist stereotypes.

linuxlass,,,"First, I'd like to say that this is not attachment parenting, as described by William Sears.

Second, this article describes women who wrap their identities around their kids, hardly a healthy, ""natural"" attitude. It's more characteristic of the middle-class ""my kid is special"" mindset. It contributes to the culture wars.

I breastfed on demand and my kids self-weaned, used a baby sling (and later, a backpack), cooked fresh (not organic, because it was too expensive, though I did buy veggies from the farmer's market), slept with my kids, and gave them wood to play with. They also played with rocks, pvc, string, seashells, Duplos, and dominoes.  It made sense, fit my instincts, and was simply *easier*. 

I could go camping, or end up shopping all day and not have to lug a big diaper bag (oh yeah, I used cloth, too - it was significantly cheaper and produced much less trash) full of stuff, I didn't need a huge stroller, I didn't need bottles and all sorts of baby items. I didn't have to worry about my kid running off since he was in the backpack. I didn't feel trapped at home.  It's just *easier* for me to do things the way I did.

My kids were not expensive, inconvenient, particularly clean (I never managed to get their knees, elbows, and necks completely clean of dirt), or absolutely safe.

When my daughter was barely old enough to walk reliably, she wanted to crawl up the end of the slide. I let her, though I kept a sharp eye on her. Both my kids have learned to trust their instincts about what's safe and what's dangerous.

When my son was 2, he wanted to use the screwdriver and saw wood. We gave him a small drywall saw and clamped a 2x4 to the coffee table for him. Safe? Not really. But he never did more than occasionally scratch his knuckles, and he was so proud when he finally managed to cut off a slice of the wood. A few years later, he presented me with a small shelf he'd made, and colored himself with crayons. I still have it somewhere.

I *want* my kids to be independent. I've always let them decide if they wanted to wear a sweater, jacket, gloves, or hat. When they were little, I let them run off at the park and climb trees, as long as they came back when I called. I encouraged them to walk to school by themselves when we moved to a new neighborhood -- my daughter was 6, my son was 8, and I gave them each a Google maps printout showing the route, and walked them a couple of times to point out street signs, and then left them to manage on their own.

Why would anyone *want* to chase their toddler with a cracker?!? The kid knows where his mother is, and that she has food. He'll come back for a snack or a hug at some point. Me? I'd rather sit on the bench and read a book, and just keep an eye on things.

Shortly after my daughter was born, I had to have my wisdom teeth out. I expressed as much milk as I could and put it in the freezer so she could eat while I was on codeine. I found that preparing a bottle was much more trouble than it was worth, that I decided after a day to accept the pain and just go back to nursing her.

People (mothers and fathers) should just do what works for them, and stop worrying about what other people think. And other people should just let parents do what works for them. We all want our kids to be happy and healthy, so as long as things are working well, why judge?

gmath90,,,"I watched a documentary called The Gender Code the other night, it's easily found on sites that stream documentaries. It takes a look at advertisements and images of femininity and masculinity and explores Western (I'm assuming you two are from Canada or the US or Europe?) cultural meanings regarding gender, especially images of gender. It touches on how female attractiveness and sexuality is rooted in passivity, non-agency and subordination, rooted so much that female attractiveness is in fact an expression of those things, while male attractiveness and sexuality is an expression of celebrated ""male"" traits like confidence, power, assertiveness, control over one's environment, etc. It's really accessible, there isn't much in the way of ""jargony"" language even though it is an explicitly sociological work (it's based off of a work by Erving Goffman, a very influential 20th century sociologist). If she doesn't have much of a background there shouldn't be anything over her head in the doc, and it's just really interesting regardless.

I think you could offer some insight or at least some thinking points for discussion while being male. I'm a guy too, a white, heterosexual one at that.

I'm not attracted to hairy legs or armpits. Hairy arms I don't really mind either way. Makeup is fine as long as I don't deem it ""overdone."" I prefer hair color to be natural but I have a preference for brown. I don't like the idea of a woman being stronger than me, so I'm kind of turned off by muscle tone. I can't really help this - I'm conditioned (as you are too as is your friend) to respond to certain presentations of the female gender. Basically, I'm supposed to be attracted to certain ""looks"" of women. ""The media"" practically tell you who to be attracted to; a relatively narrow band of body types. It seems that men are allotted a pretty specific body ideal to be attracted to, otherwise men's attraction to other bodies, say chubby or fat women must be fetishized in some way or another while women SEEM to be ""allowed"" to find a broad range of men attractive. I put ""seem"" in capital letters very deliberately as that's what I've noticed in my experience.

Some feminist women may respond sexually to traditional, dominant men who exude that kind of controlling sexuality that men are known to have. This kind of flies in the face of what you'd expect, but it's not really her fault if she's attracted to such men as that's a product of social conditioning. I'm a feminist identified man, and I'm attracted (at least somewhat) to weak looking women who I could physically overpower very easily. I wouldn't say I have a domineering personality either, but I'm still attracted to what I'm attracted to - I even find the ""dolled up skank"" type attractive from time to time. Undoing that means unlearning what you've been ""taught"" and reprogramming yourself, which is difficult but not impossible. 

I guess her conflict lies in that what is deemed attractive has been determined by mainstream male heterosexual desires which are rooted in patriarchal values like female passivity - an example being that women must look like infants or children (weak, lack of control) to be attractive, or the degradation of women - reducing their entire worth to what they look like. I see it as a huge problem that society will have to tackle collaboratively, meaning we need input from women, men, queer, lesbian, gay, bi, trans, straight, etc. alike. As of now, straight men basically ""own"" mainstream sexuality, they decide what is hot or not, and society is built around their desires.

I don't want to leave her with a platitude like ""oh don't worry, she'll find somebody who loves her no matter if she wears makeup and tight jeans or not,"" she's got a legitimate concern that is complicated as fuck.

Anyway, check out that documentary, I think at the very least it will help solidify what she already may know, or it might be an additional insight for her.",0,1335401187,,0,c4gndri,t3_sq3r2,1.0,t3_sq3r2,118232,1428797245,1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1329531939.0,t2_6yaum,

majeric,,,"&gt; Just because some people consider him a feminist doesn't make him a feminist to everyone else.

Don't you see how your language is insulting? ""some people"" is more diminutive in emotional language than ""everyone else"". You've just dismissed his contributions out of hand and placed me in a defensive stance for this argument. So, this stops being a conversation and becomes an argument. 

Had you said ""some people  don't consider him a feminist and some people do consider him a feminist"" would place him in a position of neutrality without knowing what the numbers are. 

And is feminism even a popularity contest? Do you have to have enough supporters that agree that you're a feminist before you can claim to be one? Is it tenured like being a prof? Do you have to have approval among your peers?

I just feel like those who don't reasonably respect people's choice to identify as a feminist are using the ""No true Scotsman"" fallacy. Who gets to pass judgement on who's considered a feminist? The goals of feminism are fairly clear, anyone who chooses to work towards those goals should be considered a feminist.

It is erasure to deny someone's choice to claim the label of feminist.

&gt; It's extremely convenient to claim that any problematic aspects of his work aren't actually his work but injected by Fox.

I wasn't saying that in absolute. I wasn't blaming it all on Fox. I was presenting it as *one* of the reasons why his work may be flawed. I noticed you by in large ignored the rest of my points.

&gt; when he barely touches basic standards of human decency. 

That's hyperbole. ""**barely** touches"". Stories are about conflict. If they just represented ""human decency"" then they would be dull. Antagonists have to represent the negative side of conflict. Realistic protagonists have to have character flaws that they learn and out grow. 

Out of curiosity. What TV series do you use to measure the standard  of good feminism? Is there an example?

&gt; It's interesting that his mostly-male fans rush to lionize him

Do you know this as a fact? I kind of feel like you are falling into the traps of confirmation bias. The statement just smacks of it. *Confirmation bias* because I have no doubt you have one or two examples in your head that support your perspective but can you objectively state for a fact that only male fans lionize him?

&gt;The fundamental problem, feminist-wise, is his concept of feminism itself: subverting the trope of the weak woman character with a strong woman character

Being a trope unto itself isn't a bad thing. You have to demonstrate why being this particular trope is bad. To take from the website itself: ""On the whole, tropes are not clichés. The word clichéd means ""stereotyped and trite."" In other words, dull and uninteresting. We are not looking for dull and uninteresting entries.""

There's nothing wrong with having strong female leads. I don't think Buffy falls into the Smurfette trope because the show has an even number of female protagonists and well as female antagonists. Each woman on the show has her strengths and weaknesses. I think Darla is a tragic figure struggles and ultimately fails to find her place in the world which is why she falls back on misogynist behaviour to lash out at the world.

I think Joss Whedon is criticized because he is the only one that falls under scrutiny because he's one of the few writers/directors that's really trying to make a difference. As such, his work is pedantically picked apart... And like any thing that's popular, you're going to have some knee-jerk reactionaries who decide that if something is popular it must be flawed and rationalize a dislike for it. Which will consequently be re-enforced through confirmation bias by the some examples. 

Lastly, I am aware that Whedon isn't perfect. There are moments where in his work, it's uncomfortable. But the effort is there. I think he succeeds more than he fails and on the whole, he makes the TV industry a better place by having his work in it.

majeric,,,"Whedon obviously doesn't have full control over his creative process. Certainly Fox screwed over the creative introductions of Dollhouse and Firefly. The marketing and creative process were probably manipulated by all the players. Certainly the choice of actors were probably chosen for their appearances as much as their ability to act. Joss worked with what he had. The horrible Black Widow TnA Avengers poster is a product of shitty misogynistic marketing and not Whedon's creative decision.

And Whedon was young when he created Buffy. He was telling a charged story. Certainly some of it is going to miss the mark. It's challenging to write about feminism in a way that can be consumed by the mainstream misogynistic society in a way that will be accepted and considered. That was the power of Buffy. Misogyny could be a big rubber monster (as a very superficial example) and the perspective was novel so people accepted it in turn. You see that she's starts off being the person being manipulated and controlled by the people around her. Some for noble but misguided reasons like Angel and Giles and some for horrible reasons... and in the end. She's the leader. She's the person who's empowered herself to defeat the bad guys.

Lastly, I think you have to introduce misogyny in a story to discuss it... and it can't just be the obvious bad guys. It has to be integrated into your friends and your family and even your own behaviours. Giles and Xander and even Buffy herself perpetuates misogyny such that they go through the process of overcoming it. Nothing is more evident than Buffy's relationships. In a lot of ways those are the real ""evils"" that she has to over come... not the weekly rubber monsters. Her choices aren't perfect... and as a result that's *realistic* and for a lot of people really subtle. It's where the real growth of the character lies. 

Her concluding conversation with Angel sums up all that she's learned about relationships. She learned that she doesn't have to go running back to others every time she's hurt or scared. That she doesn't need Angel, Giles or anyone else to feel safe. She recognizes that it's a continuing process of learning and that if she comes back to Angel again in a relationship, she is going to do so as an equal.

You have to consider the over all story to consider if it succeeds or fails to address issues of misogyny. You can't just cherry pick scenes or events or even single story lines label them as examples of his misogyny. The story is a continuous storyline. The characters grow and develop over time. So to misogyny has to exist to be vanquished over time.  The themes are subtle and pervasive. 

In the end, I think Buffy is a story that I would want people to watch. Something that I'd want to show my niece when she's old enough to appreciate the story and the underlying morality tales. Is Whedon perfect? No. He makes mistakes.... but in the end, I think he does far more good than harm.

That's a disgusting statement. It's called ""erasure"". In the gay community, bisexuals are subject to it all the time because people refuse to respect their right to self-identify. 

&gt; nor does it make him incapable of writing misogyny

And nor is he in complete control of his creations. Fox had the most disgusting influences on Firefly and Dollhouse.

I've actually already read some of the examples that you've provided. The fact is that you have to create misogynistic content in story in order to discuss it. In order to present it to be dissected or changed. 

I'll indulge an example. However, [this is an example](http://wondercow.blogspot.ca/2005/05/joss-whedon-is-misogynist-homophobe.html) and I am not really interested in getting into a pedantic dissection of each argument:
*Of course* the Watchers are misogynistic. They are antagonists in the story.  They are perhaps the very definition of underlying background radiation of misogyny that exists in Western Society. They are misogyny that caps the potential of women everywhere. The kind that's perpetuated by an older generation like our parents.

Buffy is subjected to it on a daily basis. The type of misogyny that is wrapped up by Part of her journey is about recognizing that she's grown beyond it. Also the Watchers are a foil for Giles as he learns to grow beyond his own misogyny and let Buffy go and be an independent woman.

Most stories are about conflict resolution. You have to create the conflict in the first place. Whedon does this. The monsters he creates in his stores are just a vehicle for the real evil that he talks about. About abuse. About how sex is used in controlling and shaming us. 

Go back and read those articles again. You'll find that they never discuss the resolution of these issues but simply present their introduction and label them ""misogyny"".

For example, if we, as feminists, get into the business of telling people what gender they are based on the way society puts people into groups - for example, by excluding male-bodied male-gender-expressive persons from feminist spaces, which are we doing? Are we identifying a cohort for analysis, or are we reinforcing social construction of gender?

What if the bro-y-est bro that ever did bro showed up for a women-only feminist conference and insisted that though he (she?) was of male sex - possessing, in fact, a full beard, that he (she?) was female-identified and had a right to be there.

This is an extreme example, and our first reaction would probably be to exclude him (her?) from the conference.

If we do that, we are (in my eyes) doing both of the things you mention at once. We're differentiating this person from a group of people with similar experiences, because it's very unlikely that this person has had similar gender-based experiences to most women.

But on what are we making that judgment? On external gender indicators, such as the beard, or this person's manner of speaking, or this person's way of carrying themselves through the world. And then we are saying the inverse: Women can't have beards. Women can't speak aggressively. Women can't walk like a muscle-bound buffoon.

&gt;Ellis and Ames (1987) have proposed a very comprehensive gestational neurohormonal theory of human sexual orientation, which deals with the genesis of heterosexuality as well as homosexuality. They propose that sexual orientation is primarily determined by the degree to which the nervous system is exposed to testosterone, estradiol, and to certain other sex hormones while neuro-organization is taking place, predominantly between the middle of the second and the end of the fifth month of gestation. According to this theory, ""complex combinations of genetic, hormonal, neurological, and environmental factors operating prior to birth largely determine what an individual's (adult) sexual orientation will be."" 

This makes a lot of sense, given that one of the chief effects of prophylactic provision of an artificial estrogen during pregnancy, DES, was to increase the prevalence of female identification in CAMAB children (and thus we can reasonably expect, neurology) by a factor of 100 over the current estimated prevalence of social transition of 1 in 300. DES also served to increase gynophillic sexual orientations, (lesbian, bisexual, pansexual) in CAFAB children of mothers who took DES during pregnancy.

Further, trans women are more likely to be attracted to women than cis women are to be attracted to women, by roughly a factor of 10 http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf which makes a great deal of sense, given the correlation of atypically high gestational estrogen counts with both.

Just as people are born hard-wired with a certain sexual orientation, which can be expressed as an attraction to a range of individuals, or sometimes none, neurological sex is the same way. People may well be comfortable with a range of gender presentations, may, just as many people with attractions to more than one sex feel discomfort at being unable to express the full range of those attractions, feel a sense of discomfort at being unable to express their particular gender.

It doesn't argue against self-determination any more than accepting that sexual orientation is largely hard-wired, but heteronormativity and to a lesser extent homonormativity (really need to come up with a less pejorative word for biphobic... one that doesn't erase pansexual, asexual, and other non-binary orientations, but that's for another discussion) is not.

There is a unique process of self-discovery that one has to undergo when rejecting ones Coercively Assigned Sex At Birth, a bit more involved than rejecting the orientation that is presumed with one's CASAB, one must admit, but that doesn't mean someone's sexuality changes... the foundation was always there.

One other kind of interesting fact: It's a lot easier to prophylactically ensure queer orientations and neurological sexes than normative ones. ^^",0,1337673613,,0,c4qwgff,t3_tvswc,4.0,t1_c4qn45e,46446,1428974935,0,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1330319170.0,t2_711h0,

Objectification is when you remove personality from the equation. Human beings are sentient, self-aware, opinionated, creative things, so in order to objectify, one needs to discount or ignore all the things that make us individuals and simply think of the physical and the functional. An example of objectification is thinking of someone purely as a way to fulfill sexual needs, thinking of another human being as the equivalent of a vibrator or fleshlight. At its core, objectification is about a person's inability to recognize that other people are just as important and worthy of respect and understanding as they are. They can't handle the idea that other people have thoughts and dreams and feelings, too, so they choose to ignore all of the parts of other people that challenge their narrow, fearful view of the world.

IMO, part of being a feminist is understanding that there are all sorts of different women out there, and that our choices and opinions are just as valid as anyone else's.

sotonohito,,,"&gt;So... the opposite of a safe space? 

Yeah, pretty much.

I suppose it could be argued that we should give them credit for at least trying, but I'm not really inclined to do so.  A lot of gamer culture has misogyny built in, and there are an unfortunate number of (mostly male) gamers who defend that misogyny as essential, necessary, and altogether good.  

See, for example, the dust up when it was suggested that the fighting game community could stand to be less misogynist.  The PA Report has a [good writeup](http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/sexual-harassment-as-ethical-imperative-the-ugly-side-of-fighting-games).

We have there a person explicitly defending the idea that the entire fighting game community is inexorably rooted in racism and sexism, and that to try and get rid of the racism and sexism would be to kill the fighting game community.

I'm a gamer, and there are times that my fellow gamers make me want to bash my head against the wall.

Reddit has a similar demographic and in many ways a similar culture.  It says something that /r/MRA has around 36,000 members, while /r/feminism has a bit less than 8,000.  Yet the MRA's feel threatened by the existence of the feminists to the point where MRA invasions of feminist subreddits are a common occurrence.

I think, in part, it's the fact that some men really get into the idea of boys clubs and feel genuinely threatened by the idea that women exist.  I'm a man and I've never understood that attitude in the slightest, but a lot of other men do seem to really hate the idea that women might talk to them and/or have opinions.",0,1338470383,,0,c4ui507,t3_uc43v,3.0,t1_c4ui0r3,801,1429037555,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1217627737.0,t2_37jm9,

beef_swellington,,,"&gt;I antagonized? What? 

Based on your statement:
&gt;No, I said, I was not. I had [argued in good faith] at first, but they acted like shit. 

The implication is that you were no longer doing so. That's how the statement came across anyway.

&gt;Why should definitions ever be ""so far outside of the accepted lexicon""? I think I consider that a defect of dictionaries. In logic, axioms and definitions (and rules of inference) are everything. As with semantics, logic doesn't turn off. You're being logical or you aren't, you raving pan-like armchair. Your argument is valid or it isn't (therefore you must be a tree, elsewise you're eating a turnip).

What are you even talking about. I linked to a bunch of resources that explained classism in terms that directly contradicted your imagined requirement of conscious intent. This isn't other people ""turning off logic"", this is you ""making shit up and expecting people to accept it"".

&gt;It doesn't matter how wrong I was, it's supposed to be a fucking discussion.

And if you're arguing using entirely different and unaccepted meanings for words, you're not going to have a very productive discussion. You could get banned if you won't shut up about how affirmative action is ""reverse-racism"" too, because that's also meaningless language. There's no discussion to be had when you insist that your unique definition of a previously-defined concept is what everybody should be using now.

Why should definitions ever be ""so far outside of the accepted lexicon""? I think I consider that a defect of dictionaries. In logic, axioms and definitions (and rules of inference) are everything. As with semantics, logic doesn't turn off. You're being logical or you aren't, you raving pan-like armchair. Your argument is valid or it isn't (therefore you must be a tree, elsewise you're eating a turnip).

It doesn't *matter* how wrong I was, it's supposed to be a fucking discussion. ""SRSDiscussion"". (By the way, I hold that ""classist"" necessarily implies classism. Nobody was mentioning a different definition of ""classism"". They actively said ""classism"" was irrelevant.)

I'd screencap, but in your argument you insist that you want no argument, so let's not. No, it didn't go that way. The mod was arguing with me, saying ""you don't get it"" over and over again (and I would ask for it to be explained, given -- answered with shit like ""you really don't get it""), and eventually his answer was ""This doesn't look like arguing in good faith to me"" and I said ""Nope, people aren't listening, they're just insisting"" (repetition of the same arguments over and over), and he said ""Rule VI. **BANNED.**""",0,1338442546,,0,c4uf3rw,t3_uc43v,8.0,t1_c4uetuh,1598,1429036135,-2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1303083703.0,t2_54ah9,

CatFiggy,,,"Well, yes. The thing is, first and foremost, that the Brawny Man as a ""character"" of commercials is on a completely different level than the person using the product.

The *vast* majority of the time, it's a woman shown using the detergent/soap/mop/whatever. I actually can't think of one time that it was paper towels and it was a man using it. There was a Resolve commercial recently, and its angle^1 was that cleaning products were terrible and Resolve was enacting a revolution. ""Women all over the world/country are standing up and saying, 'No more!'"" Of course, women are the only ones concerned with the cleaning product. The fact that the narrator says ""women"" rather than ""people"" (or ""homeowners"", ""parents"", etc. ...) goes right over everybody's heads.

So while in all the paper towel commercials it's *women* wiping up messes (often after kids, a dog, a husband, or some combination thereof) with paper towels, and when the paper towel turns out to suck she gets this horrible robbed look on her face. Then the Brawny Man turns up to save the day! These paper towels are *strong* and *hardy* and -- well, we dare say they're darn *brawny*! Like this lumberjack, in his flannel shirt posing in front of a forest!

Not that I expected them to have undergone that entire thought process; just that any thought process concluding in ""the Brawny Man is an example contrary to sexist commercials"" strikes me as ridiculous. (The Brawny Man as a symbol of strength, of course, is also sexist towards men. These commercials are sexist towards everybody. Men don't clean! Men are manly lumberjacks!)

[Google Images search results for ""brawny"".](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1304&amp;bih=706&amp;q=brawny&amp;gbv=2&amp;oq=brawny&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=1&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.509.1210.0.1306.6.4.0.0.0.0.84.201.3.3.0.ekh.1.0.0.bNyoHpPsCWo) The design has since changed to no longer include the forest, for some mysterious reason.

dada_,,,"&gt; Free speech is a fundamentally important aspect of a healthy society, and thus I support it 100%.

So do I, but there's an important qualification that we should keep in mind: the constitutionally defined freedom of speech, as outlined in the First Amendment, is a statute meant to prevent the government from censoring specific opinions (among other things) that it does not like. It's the same in every Western society, at least that I've studied. Private institutions do not have to abide by such a statute.

MHiroko,,,"Thanks for the thoughtful answer! You've articulated what I was feeling (isn't it great when that happens!). A part of me was like ""Who does she think she is to cover this song like this?"" I didn't interpret it as an homage, either, partly for the fact that the only thing she kept from the original is the lyrics, and seems to have no tribute to the style of the music. As if she didn't care for any of it except for the lyrics, and why....?? Why do those lyrics speak to her.... when they seem highly unlikely to represent anything in her life? But then, maybe that is just me jumping to conclusions. =/

I almost feel this is similar to people who aren't Chinese or Japanese getting tattoos of Chinese or Japanese symbols on themselves. But somehow that doesn't bother me like this did. 

I guess the privilege of being in the dominant group (in this case, the white race) is having the luxury of picking and choosing which aspects of a minority culture you like and are entertained by, and then being able to walk away from it. NWA rapped from their experiences, like you said, their music was an expression of their reality... and it just seems so privileged to be in a position where this artist can go in and decide to use their music as ... a way to be ""edgy"" (??) and then just go on living her life. The privilege, I guess, is being able to pick the appealing parts and ignore the less appealing parts... because somehow I think if she did see the less appealing parts of NWA's experience of being black males in America, she wouldn't have so easily taken claim to their music. 

EDIT: I just read your other comment and you just firther articulated how I feel (much better than I could lol). Your point about how a the particular cover of ""Bitches Ain't Shit"" is supposed to be comedic rings true with the cover in my post, as well. Except, I don't know if the artists attempt was to be comedic; in this case it seems more like she is trying to be... edgy and cool, like ""hey I'm down with the black folk!"" Which.. is just as bad.

Not all, but many.

Weakening patriarchy in any way helps men too.  In the case of anti-homosexuality and anti-woman attitudes one of the major benefits is that the social pressures and tools that are used to force men into patriarchal gender roles are weakened.  If being gay is no big deal, your manhood isn't threatened by people saying you are.  Which gives you more options.

In the end, from my viewpoint, the ultimate goal is the destruction of patriarchy and the extant gender roles.  That's the origin of most of the problems men face.  Patriarchal gender roles say that men are to be cannon fodder, same as they say women are to be baby machines.  Anything that weakens those gender roles, and the underlying thinking that causes them, can't really avoid helping men.

sotonohito,,,"&gt;So does anyone have any ideas?

Yeah, feminists.  We've kind of been fighting against patriarchy since feminism existed.   With a pretty good degree of success too.

One thing that is happening is the stigmatization of same sex relationships and the normalization of same sex marriage.  This, I argue, is actually a very big deal though it may not seem like it at first.

Marriage has traditionally been defined as a relationship between unequals.  We see it explicitly both in the European past and the third world present in the form of dowry, the notion that women are a burden and men must be paid to marry them.  

We still see it today in the West in attitudes towards marriage, the idea that a husband and a wife aren't really equal partners, but rather that ""wife"" is a term implying a subservient position. We don't see that made explicit too often, but it's there.   It becomes explicit in jokes and questions about same sex relationships where lesbians are asked which of them is the man, or gay men are asked which of them is the woman.

Same sex marriage changes that, and it'll have a ripple effect into straight marriage.  The notion that straight  marriage is a partnership of equals will get a real boost from same sex marriage.

Similarly destigmatizing male homosexuality will have the effect of weakening patriarchal male gender roles in general.",0,1339442145,,0,c4z762z,t3_uw23n,2.0,t1_c4z4sfk,9741,1429118917,7,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1217627737.0,t2_37jm9,

I'm not suggesting we discard the word - i don't know - but we sort of forget that the patriarchy is merely a framework for our society.

We live in a world were we have to create public policy that reflects the PRACTICAL reality of the world we live in. If we made all public restrooms unisex the real result would be that a very large number of women would no longer feel safe or comfortable using public washrooms. This is reality.

But the time frame the story is set in (fantasy though it is) is a world where a lesbian romance would not really be viable or realistic. Also, there are only a handful of characters, so even if some women were lesbian they wouldn't necessarily be the women who get pov sections. The women here are shown in more realistic situations, they are married off for power and money, some are raped or held captive by the families of their husbands, and their husbands direct their lives. The stories are in some ways historical fiction, there's a lot that goes on that is more about portraying a realistic world. I am female and found the books satisfying in terms of the women's thoughts and feelings. None are too masculine, some are just angry mothers, or protective or damaged from years of being treated like a bartering tool.

rooktakesqueen,,,"I've never encountered a group of people more dedicated to diversity and radical inclusiveness than feminists.  I've never seen a feminist community that didn't ban discussion that could be considered racist, ableist, homophobic, or any other sort of bigotry.  I've heard many feminists say that the cause of all underprivileged groups is aligned with the cause of feminism, and I've never in my life heard a feminist say the opposite.

""Feminism exists within society, which those -isms originate from"" does not in *any way* implicate feminism or feminists in supporting or perpetuating those issues.  Misogyny originates from society too, feminism certainly can't be implicated in that!

Feminism does not stand in contradiction with activism in favor of racial equality, sexual orientation equality, ability equality, or any other struggle of an underprivileged group.

If you or OP want to provide concrete examples of, say, feminists hurting the cause of racial equality, I'd love to see some.

**Edit**:  I guess my point is this: if you ask a middle-class straight white feminist whether she has privilege, most would probably admit to it freely.  The fact that they're focusing their efforts against male privilege doesn't mean they can't recognize other kinds of privilege exist.  In fact, I bet most people who consider themselves feminists *also* consider themselves anti-racism, anti-homophobia, anti-transphobia, etc. and actively oppose those privilege structures too.  To attack a feminist for *having privilege* is counterproductive derailment.  Everyone has privilege.

I put up a poster on the Facebook page wherein I said that I needed feminism because I was helped by feminists during a dark time, and their introduction to feminism lead me to acknowledge my privilege, etc., but eventually I eschewed the feminist label because of the white cis middle class centrality.

What I do agree with is that the Who Needs Feminism project is lacking, and I'm not sure if that's due to its organizers or its subjects. You're taking people from Duke, which implies that they have a fairly high amount of privilege (my partner is a Duke grad and I go to UNC, so I've experienced the campus), and what you're getting in return is people saying they need feminism so that they can get gender neutral Legos and stop shaving and wearing bras.

I think the project aims high and hits low because you are primarily getting white cis voices talking about what they think feminism is all about, which amounts mostly to having freedom over your appearance and equal wages.

Does that mean that they ""can't write""? It seems that you (""as an editor"") are invested in spending a lot of time reading 'drivel,' perhaps a re-evaluation of your own life is in order.

I could follow your logic further. If authors make mistakes, and editors catch mistakes, and only pieces with error-free prose are legitimate writing, then only authors that can afford to compensate an editor are actually writers. That's outrageously classist, congratulations.

JulianMorrison,,,"Actually I meant penis length exactly and specifically.

Intersex babies with intermediate genitals and a long phalloclitoris are coercively assigned male, with a short one, assigned female. This is standard medical practise. Often these assignments turn out to have been the wrong one.

Girls with clearly female arrangements and clitorises in the male length range quite often get them cut down (CUT DOWN, how the fuck barbaric is that?) to fit the ""biological"" definition of sex. Boys with clearly male arrangements but short penises are ""diagnosed"" with the medical condition ""micropenis"". Because this is obviously a flaw, not just diversity, right?

Human biology, even of the external markers of sex, is intricate and individual.

Human cultural *coercively assigned* sex is overly simplified. It would be literally true to say that *physical sex* (as most people think of it, rather than the reality of the meat) is socially constructed. Sometimes it is even *surgically* constructed, without consent.

This is the essence of biological essentialism: ""sex is simple! if it isn't, we'll ignore or cut it down until it is!""",0,1337554981,,0,c4qc3at,t3_tvswc,10.0,t1_c4qb3tg,5657,1428965047,6,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1153260242.0,t2_afom,
BowlingisnotNam,,,"I understand that it is often stifling to be around men in a society that practically runs on male-centric values.  Do you think that a social movement like feminism works best when it purposefully creates divisions in who gets to discuss what, with whom, and where? Can you envision how that would make for equality?  

I don't understand how you could think that a reaction to male-centric values is the same as a proper refutation?  The message comes across as ""women and only women (born women) for equality in action, speech, assembly, potential and representation!""  Do you see the disconnect between equality and exclusive representation?  The internal struggle in feminist theory is about whether we represent equality through women's voices, or if we represent women's voices through equality.  You had better see the difference.

Think about this, too:  Which is do you think informs people's positions most, their gender, their experiences, or their values?  If their values flow from their experiences, which are often in relation to their gender, does feminism that excludes men/trans-women further support the idea that gender-centric values in a person are products of their own gender?  I think it does, and I can't see how exclusive representation in any sense allows for equality.

I don't think the exclusion of men is done for equality, I think that its done because our culture makes it easy to guess someone's positions on gender based on their gender.  This caters to the patriarchal norm of the privileged man over the marginalized woman.  To challenge that dynamic takes a balance between asserting equality and patience to those who don't value it.  It doesn't mean challenging privileged status with a different privileged status.

(And hating pink, loving math, and swaggering while you talk football doesn't make you a man, either.  Of course, funnily enough, up until the 1940s, pink was the ""boy"" color, and in Japan, mathematical inclination and logic are considered to be feminine traits, while men are defined as having deeper emotions and more prowess at literature.

TheRealmsOfGold,,,"[Warning: this is a kind of ramble from a learning feminist. It's long and probably not too insightful, but if you're interested, I'd love to hear your comments.]

I stopped for a minute while reading this article to reflect on my growth as a feminist. Some time ago I would have responded negatively to the claim that on Disney packaging, none of the princesses look at each other. "" 'Who is the fairest of them all, bitches?' Yeah right, they're trying to force meaning where there is none.""

Now I give time to fairly consider this sort of claim. There are people, even feminists, who will force meaning where there is none, surely. But the real problem was my willingness to look into such a claim seriously. On lots of packaging, the interaction of the pictured characters helps sell the product (on diapers, for example, the parents are usually smiling at each other, or at the baby). And here, it is true, the lack of eye contact among the princesses is kind of scary, when you consider that that lack is consistent.

The final stage in my thought process was this: years ago, I would have thought it was forcing meaning to say the princesses don't know how to interact with other women, because each of those princesses is in a separate story. But now, I think of it in more postmodern terms. If they teach us by their example to not look at other women, then that teaching is part of their experience.

SovTempest,,,"To use an analogy with the agreed upon point of passive females in Fairy Tales: it's sexist because even if you want to expose your child to something different, it's very difficult to do so. Few options are out there, and parents don't have time to police and design all the media a child receives. And even if they do, there's a social aspect to this media that means if your kid isn't watching to the same things as their friends, it affects how they can interact which although managable means more work, effort or stress for both parent and child.

It's racist because it's a key example of a widespread media problem. Racism is widespread, and systemic, sometimes visible and sometimes subtle.

Well racism as I know it, isn't really about a specific attack or instance of prejudice. It's about a legacy and a culture that combines many things over a hundred years of history. As is mentioned in OP's link, I think it's part of a media culture that just leaves non-white people out of things. 


I consider classic Disney movies kind of fucked up anyways, euro-centric culture and rarely any positive or progressive values, so I wouldn't particularly pick on Snow White. But it's a weirdo movie, a super passive incredibly white female lead projects values of domesticity, victimhood and being cared for.

Of course, none of this is supposed to mean it's not okay to enjoy a movie like Snow White. It just means to be aware of and supportive of the feelings and concerns of other people, even if we don't understand their perspective.

I think the choice in Tropic Thunder was precisely meant to MOCK the idea that it's okay for a white person to do something that racist.

sotonohito,,,"&gt;It's like r/atheism.

No, it isn't.  r/atheism has its problems, but mods who crack down on dissent Kim Jong Il style are not among the problems of /r/atheism. 

For me any SRS branded subreddit is pretty much the antithesis of a safe space.  Their position is clear: disagreement will result in an instaban.  I find that position highly objectionable and I would not feel safe or comfortable posting in any subreddit with SRS in its name.  I don't like looking over my shoulder nervously constantly expecting a ban to come out of nowhere and always questioning myself wondering if maybe I steped over some bizarre, arbitrary, and stupid line.  

In general I'm doubtful that the idea of an official troll/circlejerk subreddit is a good idea.  It might sound like one, but rather than blowing off steam I think it trains people to go into troll mode in other subreddits. I'm doubtful about the whole ""blowing off steam"" concept anyway.  Studies show it doesn't work for violence, training people to hit walls or pillows or whatever actually increases their propensity for violence rather than the reverse, and while I'm unaware of any studies on the matter I can see how the same could apply to SRS style trolling.

I absolutely do not trust the mods of SRS, people who spend their whole day gleefully banning the slightest dissent, to suddenly be able to drop the trolling and behave in a civilized manner in other subreddits they mod.  They've been trained to crack down on dissent and rewarded for doing so.  Look at the way the SRS mods imported to mod to /r/LGBT started doing exactly the same thing there that they did in SRS.  Train people to behave in a particular way and, unsurprisingly, they act in that way. Train mods to act like powertripping banhappy types and they will act that way everywhere else.

&gt;It would be like trying to advocate for creationism in r/science by telling everyone there that they're godless heathens. Like breaking in line at the DMV because you're a special case.

No, it wouldn't.  I said something along the lines of ""wait, atheism isn't misogynist.  How did you come to that conclusion?"" That's pretty much the polar opposite of your examples.  I'm politely requesting that you not strawman me, or insult me by comparing me to Creationists.

At any rate, it wasn't my intention to derail this thread into a discusison of SRS. 

I simply felt, and continue to feel, that posts advertising SRS as a great place need a truth check.  I should have put it in a more concise, polite, form and then shut TFU so as to avoid derailment.  That'll be my approach in the future.  

I feel burned because I went there expecting what was advertised here, a nifty place to talk to like minded people, and I found a North Korean style modding environment where the most polite disagreement results in an instaban.  The sharp difference between what was advertised and the reality shocked me, and the ban pissed me off more than it otherwise would have because I expected something radically different based on how the SRS fans advertised their family of subreddits.

I didn't feel similarly hurt by my ban from MRA because I expect that sort of crap from MRA's.  I didn't expect people who had been advertised as nice and frindly and a people modding a great place for good discussion to be similarly banhappy.   Thus my disagreement with the SRS advertisers.  I'm still feeling bitter so I posted my objections badly and used language I shouldn't have.  I'll be changing that for the future.  But I intend to continue my policy of posting warnings about the true nature of SRS when I see SRS branded subreddits advertised in glowing terms.

A lot of Reddit basks in the intellectual glow of certain perspectives (""atheism = reason"" and so on), but there are few channels that I've found live up to my initially rosy expectations. At first sight, the whole site looks like a community of deep intellectualism, but progressive politics are lacking in many places, and for me, that no longer counts as deep or intellectual.

Now the only subreddits I frequent are /r/feminisms, /r/feminism, /r/depthhub, a few of the big news channels, and couple of classical music subreddits. I learned within a week to stay as far away as I can from /r/atheism; many people there are not just bigoted, they're caustic, even vindictive. I don't even read much of the SRS stuff unless somebody has linked it within one of the feminism channels.

It's hard to enact social change through Internet comments—when a bigot can hide behind a screen thousands of miles away, he or she is unlikely to listen to a plea for fair treatment (especially if that plea asks for the level of introspection that feminist thought asks for!). So I use Reddit for a few certain things, and then turn to the people around me in real life for the rest of my day.

*Obviously, I recognize that it's much easier for me to ignore bigotry on the Internet than it is for someone who suffers as a target of that bigotry.* But I just thought I'd share my thoughts: a deliberately narrow usage of Reddit screens out that garbage, which even a mid-twenties, white, cis-gendered, privileged male finds hurtful.

I was banned from SRSDiscussion, and I thought they were being completely unreasonable. It's another circlejerk with fewer rules. 

The question was ""Are laws which would benefit people of higher classes more, classist?"" (or something). I mean, say, ordering everybody to be vegeterian, while some people, due to location or poverty, have only access to meat.

I insisted that it was not classist because it was not fueled by and had never taken into account *classism* -- or, it doesn't necessarily, so the answer to the question is still ""no"". Is it classist? Well, there's no classism, so I don't see how it could be classist.

I was eventually banned for breaking, I believe, rule IV, which states that one must assume others are arguing ""in good faith"". Well, people had been giving me sarcastic one-word answers to which I would reply with well-thought-out, paragraphs-long, logical and polite comments. I was unaware of the rule and a mod, who'd been arguing on the other side (as was everybody; how is that a discussion?), asked me if I was arguing in good faith. No, I said, I was not.

 I did complain to them that rule IV -- or whichever rule the mod cited -- did not require anyone to *themselves* argue in good faith. That'd hold up in a court of law, but not in that serious, serious discussion sub.

And why should some apologies rid them of guilt, when they could simply not act shitty in the first place? (Not that I ever heard from them again. Still banned, as far as I know.)

You most likely got banned from the main /r/ShitRedditSays subreddit because it's a circlejerk only. In the sidebar, the rules state that if you disrupt the circlejerk (especially with dissent), you're likely to get banned. The mods are very understanding about unbanning people who deserve it, though, so if you're really that upset about being banned, you should message them and explain what happened.

I'm an atheist woman, and I tend to avoid going to atheist spaces because they're just plain hostile towards women. Especially /r/atheism here on Reddit.

sotonohito,,,"Well, to be fair, there's no doubt that the prosecution and extradition is entirely politically motivated.  INTERPOL doesn't usually track down and seek the extradition of a people accused of rape and sexual misconduct under Sweden's laws.

Assange is a scumbag, and his lawyer admitted in a court in England that he did, in fact, force intercourse on a woman who was crying and trying to avoid being penetrated.  That sounds like rape to me.  And I think Sweden's unusually broad rape laws should be enacted in other nations.

I shed not a single tear for Assange and I hope he rots.

But at the same time I recognize that he never would have been prosecuted, and certainly not with INTERPOL involvement, if he hadn't embarrassed the powerful by exposing their secrets.  If he had any decency or real dedication to the cause Wikileaks theoretically stands for he'd resign his post and disassociate himself from the organization.

I don't think that's what most redditors think, unfortunately; but I do think that's what they'll haul out to justify their misogyny.  I have yet to see many who are willing to admit that what Assange did was actually wrong, they're very much into victim blaming and slut shaming territory.  

&gt;Now I feel like it's a boys' club. Just wondering if I'm alone in this?

Nope.  Reddit has always had that vibe.  I'm male, as it happens, so I only see it secondhand, but it's been there at least since I joined up.  I'm told that women who have visibly female usernames tend to get harassed pretty badly if they dare to participate in most subreddits.  We've got a long way to go.

Minor, piddling, example.  There is a reddit guild in the MMO EVE.  It has new ""safe space"" rules that explicitly permit use of the term ""fag"", as long as you specify that you mean it in a ""non-sexual"" sense, and the use of racist stereotypes as long as they're positive (their example of ""good"" racist terms was ""Bob is a great player because he's Asian"", cuz that's perfectly fine....)
