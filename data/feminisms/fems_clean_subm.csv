“Visionary feminism is a wise and loving politics. It is rooted in the love of male and female being, refusing to privilege one over the other. The soul of feminist politics is the commitment to ending patriarchal domination of women and men, girls and boys. Love cannot exist in any relationship that is based on domination and coercion. Males cannot love themselves in patriarchal culture if their very self-definition relies on submission to patriarchal rules. When men embrace feminist thinking and practice, which emphasizes the value of mutual growth and self-actualization in all relationships, their emotional well-being will be enhanced. A genuine feminist politics always brings us from bondage to freedom, from lovelessness to loving.”

But then, I had a very affirming thought..

My story *IS* common; so common that even those of us who have similar experiences almost never seem to realize the significance.

I was born into a world obsessed with technology. When I was born, we were on the verge of the internet. Quite a few kids had gaming systems, the rest had an almost constant stream of television and/or movies, and soon we would all have our own computers. Even in those days, I was aware that I was transsexual. 

I remember how excited I felt when I turned on Mario 2 for the very first time and saw that I could play as Princess Peach. It was such a silly little thing, but getting to be her meant so much to me. Before that I had been Mario, Luigi, Megaman, Link, and a slew of other male characters (plus Samus who I had no idea was female), but I felt no connection with any of them. I didn't want to save princesses, I wanted to be one.

I didn't have a lot of friends, but those I did make tended to be female. We grew up together with similar experiences, reveling in our imaginations together, while almost no adults were watching. I would play the male roles when I needed to, letting the cis girls be the princesses, but when I could, I was just one of the girls.

My entire childhood was that way, I have nothing but happy memories of it. But then, as childhoods tend to do, mine began to end. I was thrown into a moderated world, where children were put into a sifter and the girls were sprinkled onto one side of the playground and the boys were dumped on the other. I wasn't allowed to play that way anymore, I was only allowed to be friends with the boys, I had to play with imaginary guns, trucks, and a bunch of turtles who somehow had become ninjas. I couldn't be a princess anymore; if I were, I would be ridiculed for it.

So, I continued on, grew up, and became more and more displaced. Going into puberty, I was disgusted with myself and what was happening to me. I was quiet, completely disconnected, and by that time, had no friends whatsoever. I was completely ridiculed by other kids on a regular basis, which was easy to do because I *never* filled the roles they expected me to. My grades dropped off to nothing, I shut down, and completely stopped caring about myself. I wasn't even a teenager yet and I was already waiting to die.

My mom, who thankfully was perceptive enough to notice what was happening to me (though she had no idea the actual cause) pulled me out of school. I was lucky enough to be home-schooled through most of Jr. High/High School. It was during that time I was home-schooled that the internet boom happened, and all of our lives were changed forever, but perhaps none more than my own. I had a space where I could, finally, be myself again. I think I was only online for about a week before I began creating a female persona and presenting myself as one across the entire internet. I barely ever existed on the internet as anything at all but female.

I still struggled with it, mostly internally, because the voices of my moderated development were still screaming at me to be male, but I continually rejected them. I pushed through, continued to develop my persona, and made so many friends again. My friends only existed digitally to me, as did I to them, and not one ever knew what I really was or treated me any differently than a real girl. It was perfect, I had never been so content.

Eventually I went back to school, but by then most everyone had grown up. Our socializations had sunk in so well, and everyone just became so busy and found so many other things to worry about that no one openly ridiculed anyone anymore, but the split was still there; it was still just as hard to have female friends. I fell in with the nerds, the largely male, yet generally gender-neutral social rejects. I got into reading and writing, D&amp;D, anime, etc. I was male with those friends, but carried on with my female life online, where I would dump all of my day's experiences (pre-facebook/twitter even) and bring my female persona to life. My real life became a feeding tube for my internet life. It was odd, and a lot like living a life for someone else, but it kept me feeling alive.

The internet continued to develop, so did I, and eventually I met someone who would change everything. She quickly became my best friend, and eventually the love of my life. At first, she thought I was male, but when I recognized how in love we were, I couldn't keep my double-life a secret. When I told her the truth, she taught me the single most important thing I've ever learned: It's okay to be what I am. 

As she accepted and even lifted me up, I began to accept myself, and my two lives finally began to finally merge into one. I became happy, I was finally able to start being myself with someone. And from there, I grew. I told all of my friends, most of whom accepted me; I told my family, who had a little trouble at first, but then began to understand what they had been seeing my entire life and how this had affected me, and they accepted me too.

Today, no one needs to know at all that I ever led a double-life. I am the woman I was always meant to be. My body, mind, and soul are, for the first time in my life, completely united.

I'm a fairly typical modern-day transsexual. Looking back on my life, I recognize that it was easy. Apart from a few teachers and a handful of cruel kids, I never had any real hardships that existed outside of my own mind and body. 

So, my story might not be that interesting, but there is something very significant I've found in it. I, like a vast majority of transsexuals, was socialized to be female from the very beginning. Outside of narrow-minded moderated societal influence based entirely on who had a penis and who had a vagina in elementary school, which I rejected as completely as I could, there was a vast, open, technological world that I clung to, which lifted me above that tiny filtered elementary school world.

I am far from an anthropological expert, I only have my own experiences and perceptions, but I believe that with a little bit of study, we transsexuals are going to one day prove conclusively what feminists have been pushing for for decades. **TL;DR: Sex (the body) and gender (the socialized mind) are completely separate entities.**",,How I Became Me: The Story of One Woman's Socialization [x-post from r/lgbt],,,,,0

I am a member of a band in a Texas university. It is severely patriarchal. For decades, it only admitted men, and when it started to allow women, it was only as twirlers, though a few decades ago, women started to be allowed to play instruments. Things are pretty okay now. We have about even gender representation, but after being male-dominated for so long, practically all of our traditions are male normative. The uniforms are made to fit males and to disguise feminine body types. Old stories, inside jokes, and songs are all performed from a male perspective. Alumni are constantly complaining that women are even allowed. One incredibly rich alumnus has actually offered our band several million dollars a year to kick out all of the women and restrict membership to males, which we've denied out of legality and decency.

Now that we have an understanding of the band's culture, let's talk about the issue I'm having. Every year as part of our tradition, we sing decades old versions of fight songs from rival universities. The problem is that every other word is a sexist, homophobic, or transphobic slur. We're talking ""[blank university] is full of dykes and fags."" This is a typical line from nearly a dozen several minute long songs. I won't give too much because I want to keep the band anonymous, but it doesn't get any better from that.

Now, I've already approached the band director about it, and he has blatantly lied about the songs and said that they simply don't use that kind of language. And somehow, all of the seniors found out about our discussion and have hidden all of the evidence of the existence of the songs. Normally, I'd just report a complaint to the university, but I love the band and don't want to create a controversy, for several reasons. Firstly, I'm trans and I don't want to give the band any more reasons to hate me than I have to. Secondly, we are currently raising funds for some big projects, and I'm worried a controversy would erase years of work with courting school officials and gathering donations.

I'm lost on what to do. Please help!

However, in my readings (I'm now about halfway through the 5th book), I became disturbingly aware of one fatal flaw in Martin's writing. Though his books do not lack sexual promiscuity between any combination of peoples, there is not a single meaningful lesbian relationship. There are gay (male) lovers and there are heterosexual lovers, but all lesbian sex in the series is simply an otherwise empowered female character having sex with another female character in a desperate attempt (resulting in failure) to derive sexual pleasure in the absence of the penis they're imagining. As a woman and someone who has had sex with women (not for lack of available penises), this has made me very distraught. I kept waiting for Martin to introduce the meaningful lesbian relationship, hoping he wouldn't let me down, but it seems that in this instance he has. And as loathe as I am to admit it, the lack of women's sexuality independent of the penis makes him seem incredibly misogynistic and male-centric. I would love to write to him on this matter but I can't seem to find an email address for him. What are your thoughts on this? If anyone has or can find contact info for him, I would greatly appreciate it. I am planning on writing to him about this matter.",,Why are there no lesbian relationships in A Song of Ice and Fire?,,,,,1

I've just set up a new subreddit and I'm currently only on 30 members. Trying to expand it at the moment, hopefully to people who are interested in the sort of issues surrounding global development processes. I think its particularly important to get some input from those interested in gender in development, as much research done shows the centrality of gender equality in the development project - for example greater female literacy is linked to lower fertility and infant mortality rates, lowering which is part of the Millennium Development Goals - and these issues are only just entering the mainstream now despite decades of feminist criticism. So whether you are an expert, someone with a general interest, or someone who knows nothing at all about development, please come and check out r/worlddevelopment (subscribe), and let me know what you think - suggestions, ideas etc...

He says, here (http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q9qzn/iama_former_nasa_space_shuttle_engineer_created/c3vz0j8)
:

&gt;A man who tries to solve a woman's problems typically ends up with no money, no relationship and a severe drinking problem. He also reveals that he just doesn't understand women.
The perfect response to hearing a woman start talking about her problems is to sit down and listen -- fully and sincerely, and offering no solutions. Brew some coffee. Take the phone off the hook. Cancel your appointments. And it can't hurt to say ""Life is so unfair!"" from time to time. But a man who ""takes it to the next level,"" who offers to solve a woman's problems, simply doesn't get it.
To me personally, women represent the greatest waste of human potential ever -- people who should be scientists, leaders, thinkers, Nobel Prizewinners, and who are more than fully qualified to do all those things, but who instead complain about how unfair life is, and how it's all the fault of men.

Her rationalization is admittedly HILARIOUS,but she is trying to figure it out with her own measurements.

Another guy posted "" One does not simply make it past the age of 15 without knowing the meaning of MPH. She is not ignorant, she is dumb as fuck."" So I posted ""Just because she doesn't know that, doesn't mean she is dumb, stop laughing at people's ignorance (and it IS ignorance and not dumbness), it makes people not want to ask questions because they become afraid to appear dumb.

In two panels it shows the stages of getting ready in the morning as performed by a man vs by a woman, cleverly mimicking the evolutionary progression.  The ""hilarious"" bit is that the man takes 10 minutes while the woman takes 2.5 hours.      

Yeah.  Sure.  You know, this type of bullshit irritates the hell out of me when used by men (or anyone, really) to feel superior to women. Seriously? Why do you think it takes women so long to get ready? Is it because we are stupid, slow, shallow creatures? No. It's because YOU are. Social convention demands a hell of a lot more from a woman than it does from a man to reach even minimal standards of attractiveness. Anything a guy has to do, a woman probably has to do twice as much of. Shave? You do your face, I'll do my arm pits, legs, and bikini zone. Hair? You go ahead and run a bit of gel through, I'll shampoo, condition, mousse, blow dry, curl, pin, spray. Getting dressed? I'll carefully pull on the stockings so they don't rip, then select the perfect underwear combination/spanks so that I can look flawless in that ridiculous little dress, all the while wondering if I look too ""slutty"" to be seen as a professional in the workplace.  Or else I'll put on twice as many articles as men generally have to because women's clothing is often made thinner and more transparent, still wondering if I look too slutty.  And God forbid I neglect to put on makeup before I leave the house!  And never mind that women do, despite popular belief, have bodily functions that require the use of a toilet!  

Fact: women who wear makeup are trusted more than women who don't.  
Sad Fact: looks matter out there and if we don't conform to bullshit social standards, then we lose. 

Fact: if you think that you are better than any woman who bends to these demands, you can fuck right the fuck off.

Not really a big age difference. I guess we're both part of the same generation, but it doesn't feel like it.

She's taking a gender studies class in college now, but not because she cares about it. I lent her my copy of ""The Handmaid's Tale"" (one of my favs) which was required reading for the course, but I don't think she's read it, nor do I think she cares.

What upsets me the most is how apathetic she, and seemingly all her friends her age, are about their rights as human beings! They have no interest in what's going on around them!

She's never lived in a pre-Roe v Wade world. (Nor have I, but I at least appreciate the difference) She's able to walk into any walgreens and buy contraceptive. She's able to walk into an abortion clinic and get an abortion if it comes to that. She doesn't seem to realize that this might not be possible in the vary near future.

She doesn't seem to realize that in politics, women aren't human beings with rights, rather, they are an assembly of parts to be regulated and controlled. 

I've tried to get through to her, but whenever I bring up feminism I get weird looks from her and everyone else I know. (Because clearly, a man can't be a feminist since all feminists are raging dykes who burn their bras)

What distracts me is that she had apparently gained a significant ) amount of weight just before I met her. (i.e now she is 5' 2'' and 170ish lbs.

I've been in three long-term relationships (i.e 2+ years), and have dated many women. The majority of them have been very petite. Additionally, I train in a very demanding sport, and am in pretty good shape, personally. The shape of her body makes me less inclined to marvel at her, in the way that I marvel at her intelligence or creativity. I'm afraid that she'll catch wind of my apprehension, and harm herself to satisfy me. A very selfish part of me would like it if she lost weight.

I understand that the fact that I focus on her physical body- and that I compare it to a misogynistic standard of beauty- means that I'm totally supporting the patriarchy, and more importantly, could be harming her. I don't want to be an asshole. So, feminisms

- Where is the line between preference and patriarchy?
- If I've been conditioned to measure women up to a certain standard, how do I 'uncondition' myself?

Sen. Reed is not a woman.  He is not capable of childbirth.  He seems to find it difficult to understand the concept of a fetus forming inside a person.

It just seems to me a lot of these anti-women bills are created on the insecurity of male congresspeople, projecting their own inability to understand an issue onto those it actually affects.
