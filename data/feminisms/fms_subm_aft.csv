I happen to know that this audience is hostile as it is the reason this is topic is being raised. 

Now, this sort of speaking is something I do a lot of. However, I typically have at worst a *neutral* audience. So I'm looking for your help on how to get through this. My comfort in front of groups isn't an issue; I have 20 years of being in front of an audience under my belt. What I'm looking for is:

* Facts with citation
* Advice or rhetorical jujutsu for derailing tactics (Yes, I'm very familiar with DFD, but that's not the most effective strategy)

Now, the problem I face is that I usually have an audience at least partially made up of women who can sometimes offer backup when I open it up for questions. I don't have that. This is an exclusively male audience. 

Specific derailments likely to come up:

* Marginalized groups want ""equality"" but ask for special treatment
* Whites/men/able bodied people are oppressed too because of prison and child support
* Those are edge cases we can't be expected to consider (specifically in reference to disability, race, and transgender people)

I'm posting this from a throwaway because some of the target audience know who I am on reddit.

I am a member of a band in a Texas university. It is severely patriarchal. For decades, it only admitted men, and when it started to allow women, it was only as twirlers, though a few decades ago, women started to be allowed to play instruments. Things are pretty okay now. We have about even gender representation, but after being male-dominated for so long, practically all of our traditions are male normative. The uniforms are made to fit males and to disguise feminine body types. Old stories, inside jokes, and songs are all performed from a male perspective. Alumni are constantly complaining that women are even allowed. One incredibly rich alumnus has actually offered our band several million dollars a year to kick out all of the women and restrict membership to males, which we've denied out of legality and decency.

Now that we have an understanding of the band's culture, let's talk about the issue I'm having. Every year as part of our tradition, we sing decades old versions of fight songs from rival universities. The problem is that every other word is a sexist, homophobic, or transphobic slur. We're talking ""[blank university] is full of dykes and fags."" This is a typical line from nearly a dozen several minute long songs. I won't give too much because I want to keep the band anonymous, but it doesn't get any better from that.

Now, I've already approached the band director about it, and he has blatantly lied about the songs and said that they simply don't use that kind of language. And somehow, all of the seniors found out about our discussion and have hidden all of the evidence of the existence of the songs. Normally, I'd just report a complaint to the university, but I love the band and don't want to create a controversy, for several reasons. Firstly, I'm trans and I don't want to give the band any more reasons to hate me than I have to. Secondly, we are currently raising funds for some big projects, and I'm worried a controversy would erase years of work with courting school officials and gathering donations.

I'm lost on what to do. Please help!

**tl;dr** My marching band has discriminatory traditions, but both the leadership and individual members fight efforts to change them internally. Going ""public"" would hurt the band tremendously because it is currently raising funds.

He would often compare me to women and would make sexist and crude jokes, and that would usually be his excuse, it's just a joke. When it came to being sexual he would want to try out things he saw, or what I should do according to some porn. This would ruin any mood that I had and would completely shut down. He would talk about other women he like and fantasized about, and was an avidly masturbate/ look at pornography most of the time. Our relationship ended among other things, the reason I stuck so long was because of him being my best friend growing up and knowing each other all our lives. Though the damage was deep for a long while, resulting in me not being interested in dating for more than a year. I never had issues with my body though I was self conscious about it after that, the way I saw myself and ended up disliking what I saw was really the sad part. College came around and I met an amazing guy, we became friends and after about 8 months began to date. It was amazing. I remember the first time I became uncomfortable around him was when I saw he was subscribed to NSFW, which if you know is just a bunch of pictures and gifs of nude women. I did not have a Reddit account at the time, though I knew because I had asked a friend who was a Redditor what NSFW was and what it showed. It made me really sick to my stomach, though I tried to ignore it along with all the repressed memories of my ex. Just recently I found out he had been on a site that was centered around two things that men supposedly love, ""tits and bacon"". Upon seeing that I broke down really hard, because just before that I was listening to Yellow by Coldplay, the song that played the day he asked me out and that he plays and sings for me. I love him, but it changed the way I look at him. The thing that hurts the most is him telling me he loves me, then looking at other women on the internet. I felt sick, sad and I cried. 

I'm trying to look past it now, I guess there isn't much I could do anyways, I just really needed to vent for a bit and hear if others have gone through something similar, as in pornography effecting you and or a relationship of yours.

Sorry for the wall of text but I hope some of you can hear me out. Let me give you a bit of background. I am a 20 year old male. My female best friend and I have been on again/off-again friends since 2008, but we became really close friends when she moved from Germany (she lives on a military base) to Boston to go to school. Since that time, she has changed to a very active and passionate feminist. That irked me. It irked me because it seemed like every possible moment we talked, she had to get on a soap-box and tell me about how poor women had it. When I would try to engage her in discussion, she would get really angry or I would (or the most common result, both of us would) and we would cease to talk for a few days. Part of my anger came from defensiveness (not all guys are like this or that!) and some of my anger came from the fact that she wasn't the same person that she used to be.



However, just today I believe I used the straw that broke the camel's back or however that idiom goes. We slipped into that familiar routine however I believe today I overstepped my bounds. I pretty much contradicted every thing she had to say, questioned every fact, and pretty much exhibited sexist behavior whether I knew it or not (""surprisingly there are a lot of pretty girls in Engineering at my school"" being an example). She was very hurt, and took the time to give me my facts that I wanted however ended with this:



""Don't treat this lightly, please. Even now, I am forced not to scream at you, because you would stop listening to me. this is even more privilege, to cast me off as a crazy feminist because I am angry and saying things you don't want to hear. I am not the best at arguing this and the most I can say to you is to read more eloquent arguments of other feminists. But I do know this. The things you said to me, the things that I regurgitated to you made me very uncomfortable, and very angry and very disappointed. I do not feel safe talking to you right now please understand that I am not being ""dramatic"" and I am not ""exaggerating"". this is legitimately how your words made me feel and my feelings cannot be wrong. Please take the time to review the things I sent you. I just want you to understand that the things I say are valid whether I support them with facts or not– my voice is valid. I argued that women aren't taken seriously during rape cases and you responded by not taking me seriously. 'Without the facts'

thank you for listening.""

I felt like crying, and the more I think about it now that I cooled down and surfed some of those links she sent me: my behavior was abhorable. I realized that indeed my defensiveness was my privilege showing and I had no right to get defensive or angry. So this is my plea:

Can you guys please bombard me with as much feminist things you can possibly think of? Anything that I can use to educate myself on this topic. Even if she and I never become friends again, I would like to be educated on this topic that I so clearly misunderstand and have offended. Links, articles, books, movies/clips, blogs, etc. Anything that can help me learn about feminism/GenderWomen'sStudies. Thank you.

**TL;DR= Please give me any feminist literature/articles/blogs/stats that can educate an ignorant guy like myself.**

""“…That really kind of angry defensive feeling you got in your gut while you read this post where you felt attacked? That was your privilege kicking.”
— Brendan from a blog my friend showed me. 

**EDIT: Thank you everyone for sharing information with me! I appreciate it whole-heartedly, and I can't wait to read all of the links or books that you all have posted. I don't expect to be a changed man in one day, or a week. But I have to start now, and I hope that soon I can be aware of all these privileges and biases that I commit in daily life and start sharing this information with other people.**",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,"/r/feminisms, I need your help please.

However, a while back, I decided to take some random summer classes at my college and I got ""indoctrinated"" by one of the best professors I've ever had the privilege to accidently learn under.

The indoctrination mostly consisted of being forced to read various theory, finding relevant real-world examples on our own, and lots of discussion. It didn't tell me how to think, but provided a new way of thinking. It was one of the most engaging and thought-provoking periods of my life and gave me a push to stop being vaguely sad/meh about life and to start getting angry (which is way more productive it turns out). There's always something more to learn and someone else who wants me to speak for the entire movement but I'm really glad that I have a group of people in a similar boat.

There are legitimate criticisms out there too of course. Especially when it comes to other avenues of discrimination like race and sexuality. Feminism can sweep some women under the rug for other women's benefit and that's incredibly important to talk about, but without the initial exposure to feminism, I may have not paid due attention to those issues either (which scares me). I think it's similar to how a lot of male atheists on reddit began tip-toeing into social justice.

I was having a conversation with a friend of mine this past weekend, who told me that she was having somewhat of an existential crisis. At 19 years old, she said she's feeling conflicted over, basically, her wanting to look good and be desirable to men while, at the same time, not wanting to reinforce patriarchy. She feels that there is a fundamental conflict at play and doesn't quite know what to do. She said she likes to look good but believes that the only reason she likes it is because she has been conditioned by a patriarchal society to do so. She feels the only reason she does so is because she wants to look good for men, which she thinks is directly at odds with her desire to fight patriarchal culture. 

While I tried to help her as well as I could, I told her at the beginning of the conversation that, as a guy, I didn't think I was entirely qualified to talk credibly on this topic because I could only speak from my own experience and that anything I say would be coming from a position of privilege. I generally don't have to think about why I dress the way I dress and so it's not an issue I often think about from my own personal experience. 

So, r/feminisms, I was wondering whether you might be able to direct me to links to essays, books, articles and the like, preferably but not necessarily from an anarcha-feminist perspective (we are both anarchists), that explore this topic which I would then be able to forward to my friend.

I'm working on a semi-mini project seeking to explain the recent US anti-contraception/abortion craziness to Japanese students and make some sense of the Japanese contraception/abortion situation. There's a variety of selfish economic interests to support Japan's massive delay in approving oral BC (finally approved in 1999!!), but it's more complicated than just that, and misogyny definitely does play a part, and I'm trying to make sense of both the cultural basis for misogyny (in particular denial of female sexual agency) in both the US and Japan, but it occurred to me, I can't adequately explain even the US case. I can explain roughly ""how it is"" in both US in Japan, but I get lost quickly if asked ""why?""

Can anyone here recommend some good books or something on the origins of institutional misogyny? I get that there's there's a strong culturally institutionalized system, and I know that cultural institutions can be quite compelling and self-perpetuating, but given that this is such a common cross-cultural trend, somebody must have written some psychological/evolutionary-psychology kind of analysis looking for some common basis for this seemingly convergent evolution.",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,Psychological basis for anti-contraception misogyny?,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/spx52/psychological_basis_for_anticontraception_misogyny/,,,,

I've got about four months and I'm planning on starting with 'A Vindication on the Rights of Women' but I'm having a hard time figuring where to go from there. Would anyone have any suggestions? :) I'm also really interested in the intersectionality of oppression, but I don't know much about it or where to start.

I was thinking, imagine if this instead was a joke saying ""this is why women shouldn't try and fix their cars"" or ""this is why women nag so much"". I would find it totally offensive! I think this kind of joke on men is just as much a perpetuating stereotyping and as women and feminists it shouldn't be encouraged. Not sure if I should say something to the conservative women I work with...but it got me thinking. 

As feminists we always stand up for women's rights and making sure women are treated fairly but it's stuff like this that makes people think it's ok to make fun of gender as long as we aren't making fun of women, and I don't think that's ok at all.

The girl doesn't know what MPH (miles per hour means) and the guy is trying to explain the concept to her. Meanwhile the girl is trying to understand and rationalizes it using distances she'd run on a track and using tire rotation. Her rationalization is admittedly HILARIOUS,but she is trying to figure it out with her own measurements.


The guy who posted it on facebook said ""She is fuggin dumb"". 


Another guy posted "" One does not simply make it past the age of 15 without knowing the meaning of MPH. She is not ignorant, she is dumb as fuck."" So I posted ""Just because she doesn't know that, doesn't mean she is dumb, stop laughing at people's ignorance (and it IS ignorance and not dumbness), it makes people not want to ask questions because they become afraid to appear dumb. Then, people don't learn anything because they're too afraid to ask.""


Then a guy posted saying that because she obviously had the priviledge to get an education that there is no excuse for her not to know. (Sorry that people don't know everything in the world, guy and you sound half-jealous of her supposed economic priviledge which you gleaned from one youtube video. )


It just pissed me off (i'm not s ure why it pissed me off, was this misogynistic of them?), how they handled it and their attitude towards the girl. 

Here is the video. It IS pretty funny, i'll admit that much.

In two panels it shows the stages of getting ready in the morning as performed by a man vs by a woman, cleverly mimicking the evolutionary progression.  The ""hilarious"" bit is that the man takes 10 minutes while the woman takes 2.5 hours.      

Yeah.  Sure.  You know, this type of bullshit irritates the hell out of me when used by men (or anyone, really) to feel superior to women. Seriously? Why do you think it takes women so long to get ready? Is it because we are stupid, slow, shallow creatures? No. It's because YOU are. Social convention demands a hell of a lot more from a woman than it does from a man to reach even minimal standards of attractiveness. Anything a guy has to do, a woman probably has to do twice as much of. Shave? You do your face, I'll do my arm pits, legs, and bikini zone. Hair? You go ahead and run a bit of gel through, I'll shampoo, condition, mousse, blow dry, curl, pin, spray. Getting dressed? I'll carefully pull on the stockings so they don't rip, then select the perfect underwear combination/spanks so that I can look flawless in that ridiculous little dress, all the while wondering if I look too ""slutty"" to be seen as a professional in the workplace.  Or else I'll put on twice as many articles as men generally have to because women's clothing is often made thinner and more transparent, still wondering if I look too slutty.  And God forbid I neglect to put on makeup before I leave the house!  And never mind that women do, despite popular belief, have bodily functions that require the use of a toilet!  

Fact: women who wear makeup are trusted more than women who don't.  
Sad Fact: looks matter out there and if we don't conform to bullshit social standards, then we lose. 

Fact: if you think that you are better than any woman who bends to these demands, you can fuck right the fuck off.

I don't want to make direct quotes because ~who knows~ but I know you'd understand my rant and nobody I know will grasp what I want to say (I'm also in high school, for context). I seriously lost all my respect for this guy from reading this. But this is not uncommon. 

His points:
1. Stop labeling guys. We are not douchebags. 
2. After making a ~gRrRlS are AlWaYs PrEtTy~ remark, he spoke of how UgLy girls look with the ""duckface"" and explained various ""female photo poses"" girls look UgLy in. (sorry about the annoying typography; I'm not a duckface fan either, but that's not my fucking problem)
3. ~Your short tight skirt will show how shitty your personality in because showing a lot of skin makes you an immature slut oooh~
4. OH HEY! IT'S NOT GOOD TO JUDGE PEOPLE! But I'll keep doing it!
5. Don't wear makeup!
6. Don't wear heels!
7. ~GUYS HAVE FEEEEELINGS TOO~
8. And my personal favorite: Stop complaining about your period! Getting hit in the balls hurts! ...Guess who's getting hit in the balls now?
9. [related bullshit]

Anyways, very sad to see the heaps of positive response, especially from my same gender counterparts. I don't have any beyond I will talk to you for two minutes at a time kind of platonic relations at school anyways, but it's sad to see some occasionally half decent people lost to shameless patriarchy. 

Here's what I have to say to you, facebook boy:
Go put that hypocritical tongue back in your mouth, and I for one will be happy to be judged by you. Your ignorant ass humors me. If your call to arms to shame women was an invitation to resistance, I hope one day you will realize how much diarrhea you have just typed up with those bigoted fingers of yours. I'm glad to see I have probably made your blood boil at some point, or thinking thought of pity that I don't know better. And to think I thought you knew better. Next time you walk into a door and hurt your balls, know it was me in thought.

They are more likely to receive as well as give oral sex, to use a greater variety of sexual positions and to experience orgasm regularly.
Certainly, some guys are still threatened by a woman’s achievements. But scaring these types off might be a good thing. The men most likely to feel emotional and physical distress when their wives have a higher status or income tend to be those who are more invested in their identity as breadwinners than as partners and who define success in materialistic ways. Both these traits are associated with lower marital quality. Few women really want to marry a man whose penis rises and falls in tandem with the size of his paycheck or the prestige of his diploma.”

I'm unsure how I feel about it.... if a white artist did a cover for Rihanna, I wouldn't think anything of it. But then covers like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG2EGOB9-lc) are kind of ridiculous to me. Not to mention how she says the word ""nigger"" like 50 times.

I have seen trigger warnings around different parts of the internet. I understand that it is meant to warn the reader that the discussion could have triggering content. However, wouldn't just seeing the words ""trigger warning"" make you think about or remember what happened?

It looks like now at least some people are giving a little more detail [Trigger warning: abuse] which seems helpful. Overall it just seems almost like when someone says ""Don't look down"" often times you look down.

Apparently being the victim of rape is the same thing as taking too many shots and not drinking enough water. Yeah, the author thinks those things are comparable.

The part in question, but you should read it in its entire context:

""Be careful where you go and who you go out with, and always monitor your drinks. Never leave your drink unattended—it only takes a second for a sleezeball to put something in it. Your girls might say they are watching your drink, but don't trust them. They're too busy looking at boys. And besides, they might try to mess with you and slip something in your drink too, just like a dude. If you get passed a Mickey, the next guy who walks up to you could be your baby's daddy. That's scary, so be smart.""",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,Vice casually sneaks in victim-blaming in an artlicle on how to drink safely.,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/ttypw/vice_casually_sneaks_in_victimblaming_in_an/,,,,

Aside from sounding irksome and frankly a bit childish, these popular terms are potentially harmful to the way women are perceived, especially on Reddit. Do you ""girlmasturbate?"" What about lesbians, do they go to the bathroom and ""gaypee?"" Does a man of color ""blackdrive"" his car to the store? Do Chinese Americans wear ""asianclothes?"" Think about the implications of these terms and how strange and othering it seems to add a specific race, sexuality, or gender to these everyday nouns and verbs.

I love, love, LOVE how sex positive and pro-healthy body image we are over here on TwoX and in no way do I intend to silence the talk of our vaginas and arousal. However, I can't help but cringe each time I read the obligatory female prefix on each body part. When you talk about your ""ladyparts,"" you are making a very distinct separation between yours and ""manparts,"" or worse, a difference between ""ladyparts"" and ""parts."" After all, we are not a species comprised of people with ""manhands"" and ""womanhands,"" we all just have HANDS, like we all have bits or parts. I understand the awkward predicament of our language choice - vulva may sound too technical, while pussy harkens dirty talk, but at the very least, folks would it be so awful to just say ""parts?"" I promise, I'll know what you're talking about.

I've been meaning to make this post for awhile, but what really set me off was this awesome image - indeed an important and wonderful reminder- but for pete's sake, we're looking at fifteen VERY anatomical depictions of vulvas! If there was ever a time for proper language, this is it!

""Ladybean"" is another unfavorite of mine, because within context, there's no way ""bean"" could refer to anything other than a clitoris. ""womanjuice"" though not as popular, sounds equally silly to me: again, it's not as if ""juice"" is in any way ambiguous.

""Ladyboner,"" to be honest, makes my head spin. You're WET. You're HOT, you wanna have sex with that person, but for the love of god, you don't have a penis. This term suggests that no one will understand what you mean by being aroused unless you put it in familiar, default male-centric terms. Imagine how odd it would be if a man posted a sex story about his ""manparts"" being ""dudewet."" (Okay, noted that dicks can get wet during arousal, but not really the same way a vag does.)

It is not my intention to criticize people or force everyone to use grownup language, but to urge folks, before posting one of these slang words, to think about the implications of the language you use.
I would also love to hear any other viewpoints people have, as I know TwoX to be excellent and respectful debaters.

Recently she asked me to sit with her in the cafe while she works so that the manager won't hit on her. 

For a couple of weeks he's been talking about not having a girlfriend, then asking her to be his girlfriend, adding on facebook... Then last week he said to her ""If you don't go out with me I'll smash you with a hammer."" And waved the spoon he was washing so that the foam splashed onto her. After that was when she asked me to come into the cafe.

I've made a point of looking the guy in the eye while I'm there. He hasn't repeated his comments, apparently. I'm very angry about it but she's asked me not to say anything to him directly while she's still working there. 

We're looking for another job for her as this one isn't sufficient hours anyway. I'm planning on reporting it to the Workplace peeps. It will boil down to his word against hers as there's no other witnesses and no other employees willing to make statements, but at the very least they'll contact the place and he'll be made aware that a. there is a system of reporting for people who are harassed and b. it's out of line.

The free software movement IMHO is inherently feminist (even if currently many people in it are not feminist), because it is about autonomy. ""Crippleware"" descibes software entices people to use it, but contians anti-features or malicious code that profits the software owner. 

Alternative terms:

Malware is an existing term but specifically refers to software that nobody wants any part of. Photoshop is crippleware because it locks down features that come with the software until you enter a serial number, where as a virus is malware because it does nothing that makes a user want it. 

""Feature limited"" sounds like a business friendly watered-down version of the term, like Digital Rights Management (sounds maybe good) instead of Digital Restrictions Management (sounds definitely bad). 

Damaged good is pretty good, but i'd like to find something more specific to software. Restrictware, damageware, limitware, don't do a good job of conveying that the software both damaged and intentionally so. 

And as I was writing this I just found an [even worse term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamer). le sigh",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,Non-ableist language for the free software movement?,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/sdket/nonableist_language_for_the_free_software_movement/,,,,

Certainly it has been used historically as an ""Othering"" device to keep minorities and women down.

However at the same time it is frustrating to see male politicians trying to control the female body.  To me, sometimes it seems that calling out someone for blatantly being sexist is the same shaming device they use on us.

R. Martin's best-selling novels. I love the strong heroines, the fact that there is no clear good or bad guy, and really just the gritty honesty which Martin pours into every page of these books. However, in my readings (I'm now about halfway through the 5th book), I became disturbingly aware of one fatal flaw in Martin's writing. Though his books do not lack sexual promiscuity between any combination of peoples, there is not a single meaningful lesbian relationship. There are gay (male) lovers and there are heterosexual lovers, but all lesbian sex in the series is simply an otherwise empowered female character having sex with another female character in a desperate attempt (resulting in failure) to derive sexual pleasure in the absence of the penis they're imagining. As a woman and someone who has had sex with women (not for lack of available penises), this has made me very distraught. I kept waiting for Martin to introduce the meaningful lesbian relationship, hoping he wouldn't let me down, but it seems that in this instance he has. And as loathe as I am to admit it, the lack of women's sexuality independent of the penis makes him seem incredibly misogynistic and male-centric. I would love to write to him on this matter but I can't seem to find an email address for him. What are your thoughts on this?

I've just set up a new subreddit and I'm currently only on 30 members. Trying to expand it at the moment, hopefully to people who are interested in the sort of issues surrounding global development processes. I think its particularly important to get some input from those interested in gender in development, as much research done shows the centrality of gender equality in the development project - for example greater female literacy is linked to lower fertility and infant mortality rates, lowering which is part of the Millennium Development Goals - and these issues are only just entering the mainstream now despite decades of feminist criticism. So whether you are an expert, someone with a general interest, or someone who knows nothing at all about development, please come and check out r/worlddevelopment (subscribe), and let me know what you think - suggestions, ideas etc...

Cheers.",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,Just set up r/worlddevelopment for interesting stories and debate about global development. Would really appreciate some input on gender issues.,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/s9dxk/just_set_up_rworlddevelopment_for_interesting/,,,,
