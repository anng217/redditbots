Although she has had two full panel STD tests since then that have come back negative for everything, she is obsessed with the idea that she contracted something as a result of the rape. She believes that if she does turn out to have a chronic and/or fatal STD (HIV, hepatitis, herpes, etc.) she will have no choice but to commit suicide. There are deeper pre-existing clinical issues involved her than ""just"" the rape. If she wasn't obsessive, anxious, or suicidal about the rape it would be about something else, and I'm working with her on that. Lots of specific background stuff I cannot get into. However, she has expressed that hearing how other rape survivors who contracted an STD as a result of their rape/assault have managed to not only survive but to live and thrive would really help her. She really cannot imagine living with a chronic and/or fatal STD, so seeing how others can do so might make a difference with her.

I have Googled the heck out of this, and have come up with nada. If anyone can share a link or two with me I would really appreciate it. Or if you can share your own story if this scenario applies to you. Books or things I would have to go out and buy won't really work for my purposes as I need things I can print out from the computer at work. Again, I'm looking for stories from rape/assault survivors who contracted an STD as a result of the incident and have gone on to live healthy &amp; productive lives. Anything would help - long stories, short stories, autobiographical, biographical, formal, casual, male, female, whatever.

Thanks in advance!

Btw, just to cover my bases - yes, I've already done lots of psychoeducation with her on sexual violence, gender issues/feminism, and found her a local sexual violence survivor support group she can go to once she's left our facility. I am a doctor, after all :-) And I'm also aware that the odds that she has an STD at this point that didn't show up on the tests she's gotten thus far is slim to none.

2. Do you/have you ever veiled? Why/why not?

3. Can fundamentalist Muslim women live peacefully with Western feminists, or would accommodating each other cost us both our principles?

“Visionary feminism is a wise and loving politics. It is rooted in the love of male and female being, refusing to privilege one over the other. The soul of feminist politics is the commitment to ending patriarchal domination of women and men, girls and boys. Love cannot exist in any relationship that is based on domination and coercion. Males cannot love themselves in patriarchal culture if their very self-definition relies on submission to patriarchal rules. When men embrace feminist thinking and practice, which emphasizes the value of mutual growth and self-actualization in all relationships, their emotional well-being will be enhanced. A genuine feminist politics always brings us from bondage to freedom, from lovelessness to loving.”

I have heard this a couple times from women who seem to think that being a feminist means that you aren't supposed to give men oral sex or do the ""doggy style"" position. 

I am a feminist. I know that I should have complete control over my body, and the things that I choose to do with it.I believe that I should make just as much money as a man would after I graduate from college. To me being feminist is about standing up for our rights and KEEPING our rights that we have, and fighting for the ones we don't.

I know that feminism means different things to different women, but come on. This just irks my nerves when I hear women say this! 

Therefore, it is my RIGHT to give my boyfriend oral sex. He isn't forcing me to do it, he doesn't make me feel bad if I don't do it, and he reciprocates.

Here is what I added on the sidebar if anyone else is interested in joining or contributing:

This subreddit is meant to be an aggregator for all news articles pertaining to the current war on women or the removal of reproductive rights. The goal is to have a quick reference for articles as well as a community space specifically to discuss strategies for organizing and protesting, as well as donation drives for candidates who support women's rights.

Please keep self-posts productive and remember that complaining is preaching to the choir - we're all here because we know the situation is bad.

But then, I had a very affirming thought..

My story *IS* common; so common that even those of us who have similar experiences almost never seem to realize the significance.

I was born into a world obsessed with technology. When I was born, we were on the verge of the internet. Quite a few kids had gaming systems, the rest had an almost constant stream of television and/or movies, and soon we would all have our own computers. Even in those days, I was aware that I was transsexual. 

I remember how excited I felt when I turned on Mario 2 for the very first time and saw that I could play as Princess Peach. It was such a silly little thing, but getting to be her meant so much to me. Before that I had been Mario, Luigi, Megaman, Link, and a slew of other male characters (plus Samus who I had no idea was female), but I felt no connection with any of them. I didn't want to save princesses, I wanted to be one.

I didn't have a lot of friends, but those I did make tended to be female. We grew up together with similar experiences, reveling in our imaginations together, while almost no adults were watching. I would play the male roles when I needed to, letting the cis girls be the princesses, but when I could, I was just one of the girls.

My entire childhood was that way, I have nothing but happy memories of it. But then, as childhoods tend to do, mine began to end. I was thrown into a moderated world, where children were put into a sifter and the girls were sprinkled onto one side of the playground and the boys were dumped on the other. I wasn't allowed to play that way anymore, I was only allowed to be friends with the boys, I had to play with imaginary guns, trucks, and a bunch of turtles who somehow had become ninjas. I couldn't be a princess anymore; if I were, I would be ridiculed for it.

So, I continued on, grew up, and became more and more displaced. Going into puberty, I was disgusted with myself and what was happening to me. I was quiet, completely disconnected, and by that time, had no friends whatsoever. I was completely ridiculed by other kids on a regular basis, which was easy to do because I *never* filled the roles they expected me to. My grades dropped off to nothing, I shut down, and completely stopped caring about myself. I wasn't even a teenager yet and I was already waiting to die.

My mom, who thankfully was perceptive enough to notice what was happening to me (though she had no idea the actual cause) pulled me out of school. I was lucky enough to be home-schooled through most of Jr. High/High School. It was during that time I was home-schooled that the internet boom happened, and all of our lives were changed forever, but perhaps none more than my own. I had a space where I could, finally, be myself again. I think I was only online for about a week before I began creating a female persona and presenting myself as one across the entire internet. I barely ever existed on the internet as anything at all but female.

I still struggled with it, mostly internally, because the voices of my moderated development were still screaming at me to be male, but I continually rejected them. I pushed through, continued to develop my persona, and made so many friends again. My friends only existed digitally to me, as did I to them, and not one ever knew what I really was or treated me any differently than a real girl. It was perfect, I had never been so content.

Eventually I went back to school, but by then most everyone had grown up. Our socializations had sunk in so well, and everyone just became so busy and found so many other things to worry about that no one openly ridiculed anyone anymore, but the split was still there; it was still just as hard to have female friends. I fell in with the nerds, the largely male, yet generally gender-neutral social rejects. I got into reading and writing, D&amp;D, anime, etc. I was male with those friends, but carried on with my female life online, where I would dump all of my day's experiences (pre-facebook/twitter even) and bring my female persona to life. My real life became a feeding tube for my internet life. It was odd, and a lot like living a life for someone else, but it kept me feeling alive.

The internet continued to develop, so did I, and eventually I met someone who would change everything. She quickly became my best friend, and eventually the love of my life. At first, she thought I was male, but when I recognized how in love we were, I couldn't keep my double-life a secret. When I told her the truth, she taught me the single most important thing I've ever learned: It's okay to be what I am. 

As she accepted and even lifted me up, I began to accept myself, and my two lives finally began to finally merge into one. I became happy, I was finally able to start being myself with someone. And from there, I grew. I told all of my friends, most of whom accepted me; I told my family, who had a little trouble at first, but then began to understand what they had been seeing my entire life and how this had affected me, and they accepted me too.

Today, no one needs to know at all that I ever led a double-life. I am the woman I was always meant to be. My body, mind, and soul are, for the first time in my life, completely united.

I'm a fairly typical modern-day transsexual. Looking back on my life, I recognize that it was easy. Apart from a few teachers and a handful of cruel kids, I never had any real hardships that existed outside of my own mind and body. 

So, my story might not be that interesting, but there is something very significant I've found in it. I, like a vast majority of transsexuals, was socialized to be female from the very beginning. Outside of narrow-minded moderated societal influence based entirely on who had a penis and who had a vagina in elementary school, which I rejected as completely as I could, there was a vast, open, technological world that I clung to, which lifted me above that tiny filtered elementary school world.

I am far from an anthropological expert, I only have my own experiences and perceptions, but I believe that with a little bit of study, we transsexuals are going to one day prove conclusively what feminists have been pushing for for decades. **TL;DR: Sex (the body) and gender (the socialized mind) are completely separate entities.**",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,How I Became Me: The Story of One Woman's Socialization [x-post from r/lgbt],http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/qwfhh/how_i_became_me_the_story_of_one_womans/,,,,,0

Here is my problem - and please, bear with me, this is my first foray into feminism - I am struggling to deconstruct the poem separate from its AIDS context, and place it in more of a lesbian continuum/sisterhood feminism argument.

If this is better suited to the literary forums I apologize, as I am just studying feminism for the first time, I am hoping for some feminist input not limited to exclusively literary studies.

In this hostile corridor by Cheryl Clarke

A quickening nostalgia suffuses

me, this late evening fin de siecle

between two endangered sites.

The marvelous

have been blighted by

a blood borne scourge.

Flamboyantly frail, good looking,

still marvelous

you nourish these failing geographies.

As I face your graceful soliticitous-

ness over the counter

of this nasty KFC

and am dazzled by your articulated brows,

applied mascara

discrete texture of  facial skin.

Cultivated nails.

You recognize me too—

my precise haircut.

I happen to know that this audience is hostile as it is the reason this is topic is being raised. 

Now, this sort of speaking is something I do a lot of. However, I typically have at worst a *neutral* audience. So I'm looking for your help on how to get through this. My comfort in front of groups isn't an issue; I have 20 years of being in front of an audience under my belt. What I'm looking for is:

* Facts with citation
* Advice or rhetorical jujutsu for derailing tactics (Yes, I'm very familiar with DFD, but that's not the most effective strategy)

Now, the problem I face is that I usually have an audience at least partially made up of women who can sometimes offer backup when I open it up for questions. I don't have that. This is an exclusively male audience. 

Specific derailments likely to come up:

* Marginalized groups want ""equality"" but ask for special treatment
* Whites/men/able bodied people are oppressed too because of prison and child support
* Those are edge cases we can't be expected to consider (specifically in reference to disability, race, and transgender people)

I'm posting this from a throwaway because some of the target audience know who I am on reddit.

I am a member of a band in a Texas university. It is severely patriarchal. For decades, it only admitted men, and when it started to allow women, it was only as twirlers, though a few decades ago, women started to be allowed to play instruments. Things are pretty okay now. We have about even gender representation, but after being male-dominated for so long, practically all of our traditions are male normative. The uniforms are made to fit males and to disguise feminine body types. Old stories, inside jokes, and songs are all performed from a male perspective. Alumni are constantly complaining that women are even allowed. One incredibly rich alumnus has actually offered our band several million dollars a year to kick out all of the women and restrict membership to males, which we've denied out of legality and decency.

Now that we have an understanding of the band's culture, let's talk about the issue I'm having. Every year as part of our tradition, we sing decades old versions of fight songs from rival universities. The problem is that every other word is a sexist, homophobic, or transphobic slur. We're talking ""[blank university] is full of dykes and fags."" This is a typical line from nearly a dozen several minute long songs. I won't give too much because I want to keep the band anonymous, but it doesn't get any better from that.

Now, I've already approached the band director about it, and he has blatantly lied about the songs and said that they simply don't use that kind of language. And somehow, all of the seniors found out about our discussion and have hidden all of the evidence of the existence of the songs. Normally, I'd just report a complaint to the university, but I love the band and don't want to create a controversy, for several reasons. Firstly, I'm trans and I don't want to give the band any more reasons to hate me than I have to. Secondly, we are currently raising funds for some big projects, and I'm worried a controversy would erase years of work with courting school officials and gathering donations.

I'm lost on what to do. Please help!

**tl;dr** My marching band has discriminatory traditions, but both the leadership and individual members fight efforts to change them internally. Going ""public"" would hurt the band tremendously because it is currently raising funds.

I mean, I get the joke, obviously. It's quip about how men don't listen blah blah blah. But I think this kind of reinforces gender stereotypes in the same way women are often stereotyped and it bothers me. I was thinking, imagine if this instead was a joke saying ""this is why women shouldn't try and fix their cars"" or ""this is why women nag so much"". I would find it totally offensive! I think this kind of joke on men is just as much a perpetuating stereotyping and as women and feminists it shouldn't be encouraged. Not sure if I should say something to the conservative women I work with...but it got me thinking. 

As feminists we always stand up for women's rights and making sure women are treated fairly but it's stuff like this that makes people think it's ok to make fun of gender as long as we aren't making fun of women, and I don't think that's ok at all.

Recently she asked me to sit with her in the cafe while she works so that the manager won't hit on her. 

For a couple of weeks he's been talking about not having a girlfriend, then asking her to be his girlfriend, adding on facebook... Then last week he said to her ""If you don't go out with me I'll smash you with a hammer."" And waved the spoon he was washing so that the foam splashed onto her. After that was when she asked me to come into the cafe.

I've made a point of looking the guy in the eye while I'm there. He hasn't repeated his comments, apparently. I'm very angry about it but she's asked me not to say anything to him directly while she's still working there. 

We're looking for another job for her as this one isn't sufficient hours anyway. I'm planning on reporting it to the Workplace peeps. It will boil down to his word against hers as there's no other witnesses and no other employees willing to make statements, but at the very least they'll contact the place and he'll be made aware that a. there is a system of reporting for people who are harassed and b. it's out of line. 

Just needed to vent. I'd like to take a hammer in there and ask him, how about if you hit on my daughter again I'll smash you...

The free software movement IMHO is inherently feminist (even if currently many people in it are not feminist), because it is about autonomy. ""Crippleware"" descibes software entices people to use it, but contians anti-features or malicious code that profits the software owner. 

Alternative terms:

Malware is an existing term but specifically refers to software that nobody wants any part of. Photoshop is crippleware because it locks down features that come with the software until you enter a serial number, where as a virus is malware because it does nothing that makes a user want it. 

""Feature limited"" sounds like a business friendly watered-down version of the term, like Digital Rights Management (sounds maybe good) instead of Digital Restrictions Management (sounds definitely bad). 

Damaged good is pretty good, but i'd like to find something more specific to software. Restrictware, damageware, limitware, don't do a good job of conveying that the software both damaged and intentionally so. 

And as I was writing this I just found an [even worse term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamer). le sigh",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,Non-ableist language for the free software movement?,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/sdket/nonableist_language_for_the_free_software_movement/,,,,,1

Certainly it has been used historically as an ""Othering"" device to keep minorities and women down.

However at the same time it is frustrating to see male politicians trying to control the female body.  To me, sometimes it seems that calling out someone for blatantly being sexist is the same shaming device they use on us.

R. Martin's best-selling novels. I love the strong heroines, the fact that there is no clear good or bad guy, and really just the gritty honesty which Martin pours into every page of these books. However, in my readings (I'm now about halfway through the 5th book), I became disturbingly aware of one fatal flaw in Martin's writing. Though his books do not lack sexual promiscuity between any combination of peoples, there is not a single meaningful lesbian relationship. There are gay (male) lovers and there are heterosexual lovers, but all lesbian sex in the series is simply an otherwise empowered female character having sex with another female character in a desperate attempt (resulting in failure) to derive sexual pleasure in the absence of the penis they're imagining. As a woman and someone who has had sex with women (not for lack of available penises), this has made me very distraught. I kept waiting for Martin to introduce the meaningful lesbian relationship, hoping he wouldn't let me down, but it seems that in this instance he has. And as loathe as I am to admit it, the lack of women's sexuality independent of the penis makes him seem incredibly misogynistic and male-centric. I would love to write to him on this matter but I can't seem to find an email address for him. What are your thoughts on this? If anyone has or can find contact info for him, I would greatly appreciate it.

I've just set up a new subreddit and I'm currently only on 30 members. Trying to expand it at the moment, hopefully to people who are interested in the sort of issues surrounding global development processes. I think its particularly important to get some input from those interested in gender in development, as much research done shows the centrality of gender equality in the development project - for example greater female literacy is linked to lower fertility and infant mortality rates, lowering which is part of the Millennium Development Goals - and these issues are only just entering the mainstream now despite decades of feminist criticism. So whether you are an expert, someone with a general interest, or someone who knows nothing at all about development, please come and check out r/worlddevelopment (subscribe), and let me know what you think - suggestions, ideas etc...

I was having a conversation with a friend of mine this past weekend, who told me that she was having somewhat of an existential crisis. At 19 years old, she said she's feeling conflicted over, basically, her wanting to look good and be desirable to men while, at the same time, not wanting to reinforce patriarchy. She feels that there is a fundamental conflict at play and doesn't quite know what to do. She said she likes to look good but believes that the only reason she likes it is because she has been conditioned by a patriarchal society to do so. She feels the only reason she does so is because she wants to look good for men, which she thinks is directly at odds with her desire to fight patriarchal culture. 

While I tried to help her as well as I could, I told her at the beginning of the conversation that, as a guy, I didn't think I was entirely qualified to talk credibly on this topic because I could only speak from my own experience and that anything I say would be coming from a position of privilege. I generally don't have to think about why I dress the way I dress and so it's not an issue I often think about from my own personal experience. 

So, r/feminisms, I was wondering whether you might be able to direct me to links to essays, books, articles and the like, preferably but not necessarily from an anarcha-feminist perspective (we are both anarchists), that explore this topic which I would then be able to forward to my friend.

I'm working on a semi-mini project seeking to explain the recent US anti-contraception/abortion craziness to Japanese students and make some sense of the Japanese contraception/abortion situation. There's a variety of selfish economic interests to support Japan's massive delay in approving oral BC (finally approved in 1999!!), but it's more complicated than just that, and misogyny definitely does play a part, and I'm trying to make sense of both the cultural basis for misogyny (in particular denial of female sexual agency) in both the US and Japan, but it occurred to me, I can't adequately explain even the US case. I can explain roughly ""how it is"" in both US in Japan, but I get lost quickly if asked ""why?""

Can anyone here recommend some good books or something on the origins of institutional misogyny? I get that there's there's a strong culturally institutionalized system, and I know that cultural institutions can be quite compelling and self-perpetuating, but given that this is such a common cross-cultural trend, somebody must have written some psychological/evolutionary-psychology kind of analysis looking for some common basis for this seemingly convergent evolution.",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,Psychological basis for anti-contraception misogyny?,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/spx52/psychological_basis_for_anticontraception_misogyny/,,,,,1

Apparently being the victim of rape is the same thing as taking too many shots and not drinking enough water. Yeah, the author thinks those things are comparable.

The part in question, but you should read it in its entire context:

""Be careful where you go and who you go out with, and always monitor your drinks. Never leave your drink unattended—it only takes a second for a sleezeball to put something in it. Your girls might say they are watching your drink, but don't trust them. They're too busy looking at boys. And besides, they might try to mess with you and slip something in your drink too, just like a dude. If you get passed a Mickey, the next guy who walks up to you could be your baby's daddy. That's scary, so be smart.""",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,Vice casually sneaks in victim-blaming in an artlicle on how to drink safely.,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/ttypw/vice_casually_sneaks_in_victimblaming_in_an/,,,,,1

He would often compare me to women and would make sexist and crude jokes, and that would usually be his excuse, it's just a joke. When it came to being sexual he would want to try out things he saw, or what I should do according to some porn. This would ruin any mood that I had and would completely shut down. He would talk about other women he like and fantasized about, and was an avidly masturbate/ look at pornography most of the time. Our relationship ended among other things, the reason I stuck so long was because of him being my best friend growing up and knowing each other all our lives. Though the damage was deep for a long while, resulting in me not being interested in dating for more than a year. I never had issues with my body though I was self conscious about it after that, the way I saw myself and ended up disliking what I saw was really the sad part. College came around and I met an amazing guy, we became friends and after about 8 months began to date. It was amazing. I remember the first time I became uncomfortable around him was when I saw he was subscribed to NSFW, which if you know is just a bunch of pictures and gifs of nude women. I did not have a Reddit account at the time, though I knew because I had asked a friend who was a Redditor what NSFW was and what it showed. It made me really sick to my stomach, though I tried to ignore it along with all the repressed memories of my ex. Just recently I found out he had been on a site that was centered around two things that men supposedly love, ""tits and bacon"". Upon seeing that I broke down really hard, because just before that I was listening to Yellow by Coldplay, the song that played the day he asked me out and that he plays and sings for me. I love him, but it changed the way I look at him. The thing that hurts the most is him telling me he loves me, then looking at other women on the internet. I felt sick, sad and I cried. 

I'm trying to look past it now, I guess there isn't much I could do anyways, I just really needed to vent for a bit and hear if others have gone through something similar, as in pornography effecting you and or a relationship of yours.

Sorry for the wall of text but I hope some of you can hear me out. Let me give you a bit of background. I am a 20 year old male. My female best friend and I have been on again/off-again friends since 2008, but we became really close friends when she moved from Germany (she lives on a military base) to Boston to go to school. Since that time, she has changed to a very active and passionate feminist. That irked me. It irked me because it seemed like every possible moment we talked, she had to get on a soap-box and tell me about how poor women had it. When I would try to engage her in discussion, she would get really angry or I would (or the most common result, both of us would) and we would cease to talk for a few days. Part of my anger came from defensiveness (not all guys are like this or that!) and some of my anger came from the fact that she wasn't the same person that she used to be.



However, just today I believe I used the straw that broke the camel's back or however that idiom goes. We slipped into that familiar routine however I believe today I overstepped my bounds. I pretty much contradicted every thing she had to say, questioned every fact, and pretty much exhibited sexist behavior whether I knew it or not (""surprisingly there are a lot of pretty girls in Engineering at my school"" being an example). She was very hurt, and took the time to give me my facts that I wanted however ended with this:



""Don't treat this lightly, please. Even now, I am forced not to scream at you, because you would stop listening to me. this is even more privilege, to cast me off as a crazy feminist because I am angry and saying things you don't want to hear. I am not the best at arguing this and the most I can say to you is to read more eloquent arguments of other feminists. But I do know this. The things you said to me, the things that I regurgitated to you made me very uncomfortable, and very angry and very disappointed. I do not feel safe talking to you right now please understand that I am not being ""dramatic"" and I am not ""exaggerating"". this is legitimately how your words made me feel and my feelings cannot be wrong. Please take the time to review the things I sent you. I just want you to understand that the things I say are valid whether I support them with facts or not– my voice is valid. I argued that women aren't taken seriously during rape cases and you responded by not taking me seriously. 'Without the facts'

thank you for listening.""

I felt like crying, and the more I think about it now that I cooled down and surfed some of those links she sent me: my behavior was abhorable. I realized that indeed my defensiveness was my privilege showing and I had no right to get defensive or angry. So this is my plea:

Can you guys please bombard me with as much feminist things you can possibly think of? Anything that I can use to educate myself on this topic. Even if she and I never become friends again, I would like to be educated on this topic that I so clearly misunderstand and have offended. Links, articles, books, movies/clips, blogs, etc. Anything that can help me learn about feminism/GenderWomen'sStudies. Thank you.

**TL;DR= Please give me any feminist literature/articles/blogs/stats that can educate an ignorant guy like myself.**

""“…That really kind of angry defensive feeling you got in your gut while you read this post where you felt attacked? That was your privilege kicking.”

However, a while back, I decided to take some random summer classes at my college and I got ""indoctrinated"" by one of the best professors I've ever had the privilege to accidently learn under.

The indoctrination mostly consisted of being forced to read various theory, finding relevant real-world examples on our own, and lots of discussion. It didn't tell me how to think, but provided a new way of thinking. It was one of the most engaging and thought-provoking periods of my life and gave me a push to stop being vaguely sad/meh about life and to start getting angry (which is way more productive it turns out). There's always something more to learn and someone else who wants me to speak for the entire movement but I'm really glad that I have a group of people in a similar boat.

There are legitimate criticisms out there too of course. Especially when it comes to other avenues of discrimination like race and sexuality. Feminism can sweep some women under the rug for other women's benefit and that's incredibly important to talk about, but without the initial exposure to feminism, I may have not paid due attention to those issues either (which scares me). I think it's similar to how a lot of male atheists on reddit began tip-toeing into social justice.

I don't want to make direct quotes because ~who knows~ but I know you'd understand my rant and nobody I know will grasp what I want to say (I'm also in high school, for context). I seriously lost all my respect for this guy from reading this. But this is not uncommon. 

His points:
1. Stop labeling guys. We are not douchebags. 
2. After making a ~gRrRlS are AlWaYs PrEtTy~ remark, he spoke of how UgLy girls look with the ""duckface"" and explained various ""female photo poses"" girls look UgLy in. (sorry about the annoying typography; I'm not a duckface fan either, but that's not my fucking problem)
3. ~Your short tight skirt will show how shitty your personality in because showing a lot of skin makes you an immature slut oooh~
4. OH HEY! IT'S NOT GOOD TO JUDGE PEOPLE! But I'll keep doing it!
5. Don't wear makeup!
6. Don't wear heels!
7. ~GUYS HAVE FEEEEELINGS TOO~
8. And my personal favorite: Stop complaining about your period! Getting hit in the balls hurts! ...Guess who's getting hit in the balls now?
9. [related bullshit]

Anyways, very sad to see the heaps of positive response, especially from my same gender counterparts. I don't have any beyond I will talk to you for two minutes at a time kind of platonic relations at school anyways, but it's sad to see some occasionally half decent people lost to shameless patriarchy. 

Here's what I have to say to you, facebook boy:
Go put that hypocritical tongue back in your mouth, and I for one will be happy to be judged by you. Your ignorant ass humors me. If your call to arms to shame women was an invitation to resistance, I hope one day you will realize how much diarrhea you have just typed up with those bigoted fingers of yours. I'm glad to see I have probably made your blood boil at some point, or thinking thought of pity that I don't know better. And to think I thought you knew better. Next time you walk into a door and hurt your balls, know it was me in thought.

They are more likely to receive as well as give oral sex, to use a greater variety of sexual positions and to experience orgasm regularly.
Certainly, some guys are still threatened by a woman’s achievements. But scaring these types off might be a good thing. The men most likely to feel emotional and physical distress when their wives have a higher status or income tend to be those who are more invested in their identity as breadwinners than as partners and who define success in materialistic ways. Both these traits are associated with lower marital quality. Few women really want to marry a man whose penis rises and falls in tandem with the size of his paycheck or the prestige of his diploma.”

Entertainment would be unrecognizable, as commercials would sell products based on merit instead of insisting that moms should buy a Swiffer and dads should buy charcoal. The more I thought about it, the more sad I felt at the long road ahead, but I also felt proud because it reminded me what it is I'm fighting for.

The article mentioned how covers of rap music (presumably by white artists) is a form of hipster racism. 

I'm unsure how I feel about it.... if a white artist did a cover for Rihanna, I wouldn't think anything of it. But then covers like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG2EGOB9-lc) are kind of ridiculous to me. Not to mention how she says the word ""nigger"" like 50 times. There is also the popular cover of Lil Wayne's [Lollipop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbUR0SRceD0) which isn't completely bad and also features zero black people, if any people of color. (But then, I guess it isn't the artists' responsibility to have a diverse music video.... even though the original is written by a black man). Those are just a few examples of what I think the author was referring to.

Girls are not born less angry and more anxious, they’re rewarded for being less angry and more anxious. So, it should come as no surprise to anyone that large groups of stressed out girls and women collectively facing the dissolution of a cohesive social structure might be more disposed to fall prey to mass psychosis. It is arguable that men and boys experience similarly jarring episodes of anger and anxiety-channelling mass psychosis, but we call it male aggression and fund military industrial complexes to deal with it.”

My mom had her back turned towards us, but was just listening to our conversation.  

My niece grabbed my college ring off my hand and put it on her own finger.  
me: ""well one day you'll have one of those too!"", 
my mom without turning around:""only if she wants one"".  
me: ""oh, she is just playing with my college ring,"" 
my mom: ""Oh!  Yes you'll have one of those sweetie... but you don't have to get married unless you want to""

It made me smile so much because when I was a kid in the 80's I was told by this same lady that normal women get married, and go to college only if they want to, but wasn't expected to get a career.  I'm just so proud of how far my mom's views have changed.  She of course WANTED me to go to college and have a career, but didn't expect it, but she did certainly seem to expect me to get married... which I did towards the end of my 20's to a guy that I dated for 8 years (and have been best friends with since we were kids), though even our marriage would have been considered a big deal 50 years ago since we are of mixed ethnicity.

Sometimes I just like to step back and marvel at our progress... that is all.

I'm only trying to acquire a better understand of feminism and male rights and egalitarianism and how they all fit together.

Are there currently any efforts within feminist groups to repeal patriarchal laws which are benignly sexist, but which appear to the layperson as being 'female privilege'? 

E.g. - Selective Service in the US. To the ignorant (no menace intended) it appears that this is 'female privilege'. However, of course it's obviously actually a form of patriarchal institutionalized benign sexism. 

So what is being done about it? Whether feminist or not, we can probably all agree from an egalitarian position that selective service in the US should be both female and male, or neither. However, when I was searching for efforts to repeal selective service, the only person I could find who has actually been trying to repeal it is Ron Paul (and I don't think it's necessary for me to elaborate on why feminists have a problem with Paul.)

I admit that I'm not the most well versed in feminism nor male-rights, but from trying to learn the arguments of the male rights perspective and of the female rights perspective and of the human rights perspective, it seems to me that the polarization between groups  (outright misogyny and misandry excluded) often comes down statements along the lines of ""why don't you care about my grievances"" and ""why don't you think my concerns are important."" So going back to my original question, are there rights campaigns trying to do this?

I would appreciate any discussion or insight to this :)",feminisms,t5_2qhba,default,Repealing benign sexism laws?,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/ozirb/repealing_benign_sexism_laws/,,,,,0

My definition, based largely on online discussions:

Privilege is some ""thing"" that 

1) makes your life easier, or more frictionless, 

2) due to your membership in a specific group,

3) relative to another group

So the common example of not getting harassed by the police is part of your privilege only if you live in a society where there is racial or age-based profiling.  If everyone has that kind of freedom, then it's just status quo, not privilege.

Am I right? Or is the concept more complicated than that?

A few interesting questions came up:

1) Why the word ""privilege"" instead of ""disadvantage"" or ""inequity""? Is it just rhetoric, or is there a deeper reason for the word? After all, most examples of the word seem to be pointing to things that we think should be universal but aren't, so the idea that being free is somehow a ""privilege"" is a little strange.  

2) Am I right that privilege is only meaningful when making comparisons between groups? Example: If everyone in the world were able to walk around alone at night without fear, then would it no longer be considered part of one's privilege? 

3) Is it feminism's goal to remove all privilege (is privilege necessarily something ""bad"" that we want to eradicate)? In that case, doesn't that mean that feminism is working towards removal of group identity? What exactly is the point of talking about privilege?

4) Is privilege necessarily bound with ideas of power and dominance, or are they separate (though related) issues?

5) Has the concept changed over the years? I know that feminist discourse has evolved a lot over the last 30 years or so. And in general feminists used to be more on the offensive because things were much more imbalanced than they are now.

I've been a ""fan"" of Planned Parenthood and the services it offers to women for a long time. I consider myself a Pro-Choice feminist and I think that all women deserve a place where they can access contraception, sex education material, and other services. I'm going to school to be a social worker and I've told many people that I'd like to work at a place like Planned Parenthood in the future, and advocate for the kind of sex education and access to info and services that everyone deserves.

That said, I hadn't had any first hand experiences with Planned Parenthood until today. Maybe I was wrong to expect it to be a place where people truly cared about the people walking through the door, or maybe they do and I'm just expecting too much. However, I felt really let down. What do you guys make of my experience, and what have your experiences been?

Here's what happened today:
I saw on the website that Planned Parenthood takes walk-ins on Mondays and Wednesdays until 4:30. I called several times (probably 9 or 10 times) over a couple of hours trying to talk to someone in the office to see if they could see me and ask questions about testing prices. No one answered, and on two of those 9 or 10 calls I stayed on hold for over 30 minutes hoping someone would pick up the phone. No one ever did, so I drove up there.

It was a 45 minute drive and I had to pay for parking. The person in the clinic turned both me and the woman in front of me away for walk-in appointments. I wasn't that upset about that, after all it was about 2:30 and I know how doctor's offices can get. But I was upset that no one answered my phone calls, and when I asked the woman at the desk about it she said there were no phones in the office, I'd have to talk to the call center. She gave me the number for the call center, which was the same number I called earlier. The woman in line in front of me also said no one had answered her calls.

So I walked across the hall to the door marked ""administration."" I talked to the woman there about my concerns and she said she couldn't help me, I needed to talk to the call center. She said she'd get me someone to talk to, and proceeded to call a bunch of people on her phone at her desk. None of them answered, and she said the manager was in a meeting and couldn't talk to me. She couldn't give me any kind of explanation. So I left...

I was upset, but I made sure to be very polite and understanding with everyone I talked to. I wasn't rude. Am I just expecting too much of a busy doctor's office, or do I have a right to be upset? Have other people had experiences like mine?",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,What kind of experiences have you had with Planned Parenthood?,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/o9v1b/what_kind_of_experiences_have_you_had_with/,,,,,0

Girls are all different of course. Instead of making broad assumptions about females as a whole, [I went and asked them how they felt about this sort of thing](http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/general-discussion/how-does-it-make-you-feel-when-you-post-a-picture-on-the-net/t.76820799_recent/).

Pretty much every response has been different:

* so go0o0o0d [sarcasm?]
* it's funny
* [a gif of a girl shrugging her shoulders]
* flattered but uncomfortable
* Objectified
* Pissed off
* i get a headache 
* It just shows how immature they are
* A little flattered
* I'd be flattered
* It doesn't phase me. I just ignore them. I've been on the internet way too long for it to still affect me.
* Awkward, and nervous, but interested.

The sample of girls that posted in this thread clearly doesn't represent the female population as a whole, but it does a good job of demonstrating that there's a diversity of opinions out there.

The moral of the story? The polite thing to do is to get to know what sort of remarks a woman is and is not comfortable with hearing, probably by asking her, before considering making a sexual remark about one of her photos.

So now I'm wondering, when [threads like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/nquef/fapfapfapfapfapfapfap_potentially_nsfw/) are at +700 is it that redditors have no interest in being polite?

Fast forward and the kid rolls up to the dollhouse representing ""home"", and who is his wife, but none other than Lara Croft? The camera hilariously focuses on her bare stomach and large breasts. Then the man-sized version of this asshole comes home, whereupon the kid runs right up to him (past his mom) and loses his shit.

It's nice to see everyone again.

I was eating dinner with my family tonight, wearing my old karate pants. I've had them for upwards of 5 years so they're kind of small-- when I sit they go up to just below my knees.

Now, I don't shave my legs. I have made the decision that I personally do not want to do it, and that I think that others can do what they please but I think no one should feel the need to. There are many more reasons to shave than not to shave, in my opinion, or at least an equal amount, and the reasons to shave are more artificial. And more importantly, when I was very young I always thought, ""I can't wait to have body hair, it'll mean I'm grown up"" and then when I grew up that ended up not being something to aspire to-- women're supposed to shave it all so they don't look like ~~adult women~~ men. Enough! Women have enough to be self conscious about, and I'm a self-conscious, anxious type of person. I'm self conscious about the way I think, write, speak, and look, just as much as anyone else and more in some cases. I have enough to be nervous about in my life. 

The problem? I'm one of those women, of all women, who ""*needs""* to shave. Oh *yes,* I have extremely pale skin, and extremely dark, thick hair. I do not have fair, thin, light brown hair. I am not blonde. I am not a red-head. I am not someone ~~whose hair is impossible to see~~ *looks good* unshaved.


And to make matters a bit more unfortunate, while I was away from home I got an incredible quantity of mosquito bites, which I scratched like a madman. Normally I wouldn't, but I would wake up in the night and go wild half-asleep, and in the morning I would have to wear rubber boots every day because I was doing an ecology project in the rivers, which caused chafing even when I wasn't scratching. So now I have a lot of really visible blemishes, and they're not pretty.


So I'm eating my dinner, and my dad gets one look at my legs and gets completely shocked. Yes, he pointed out the blemishes, and I agreed that they look bad and I shouldn't have scratched as much as I did. But then he says more or less:

&gt;Jesus Christ! You practically have more hair than I do! What if you ever wanted to go out and wear a dress, you know, *look nice*, or wear a swim suit? You should go shave it right away, although from the looks of it, it may take you about a year!

First of all, I do not wear dresses. This is simply a matter of personal preference that I've had forever. I've never liked them, I simply prefer other clothing, and it doesn't even suit me (the last time I wore a dress my best friends laughed at me and I laughed at myself because I truly look ridiculous in one). Anyway, I protested to dad that it is winter so no one will see my leg hair (although in truth I don't shave in the summer, either.) His response was the kicker for me:

&gt;It doesn't matter! If anyone were to see it, think what they'd *think of you*? They'd be disgusted!

After washing my plate I promptly left the room (and started crying eventually, I admit), and he sincerely apologized... for... what he said about the bug bites. And he kept on repeating, ""Aw. Don't be so sensitive about what I said, don't be sensitive and let what I say offend you. It's not so bad, you'll just put on the cream and it'll get better.""

I wasn't being overly sensitive... I don't like it when people insult me like that. That wasn't just criticism, it was ridicule. My dad's a funny guy, he's great at ridicule, and it's hilarious to be on the receiving end sometimes, especially when he has a good point or valid opinion. But this time I felt it was really offensive. I don't feel I need to justify why I do what I do to anyone. That's my business. If you are actually curious about why someone does something, ask them a question about it. Feel free to disagree. But my dad, as much as I love him, doesn't exactly think that way about this type of thing-- the fact that I may be doing something out of opinion, or that there is an opinion to be had on the matter, so I can't exactly expect that type of critical thinking. He's smart, and a critical thinker, but just not about this, I guess. I guess I expected a member of my own family to at least not be judgmental about what I do with my body if it's something as benign as shaving.

------
Interesting other feminism-related observation: I wore a blazer, pants, and tie to prom for fun. People repeatedly referred to the outfit as ""smart"" as in ""a smart choice,"" one specific reason being that I would have comfy feet during prom. Does that make people who wear dresses-- and therefore practically *need* dressy shoes, heels, sandals, or slippers-- are considered un-smart in peoples' minds?

The other 50% of the time I'm pretty ambivalent about it. Even in life, I'm not the kind of person who is tied to the idea of getting married or even finding a partner who will be ""the love of my life"". I completely believe that as humans, we want to find passion in something. I just never wanted my passion to come from or be dependent on someone else. I still don't and most probably never will. I think that's why this particular scene just got me.


Margaret: I will never be one of those women who can stay silent on the arm of her husband. One's own life must matter, Dennis.

Denis Thatcher: That's why I want to marry you, my dear.


It was just incredibly moving that the thing that Margaret Thatcher's husband loved most about her was the fact that she was her own person and not just your typical ""feminine"" woman. He loved that she was independent minded and wanted her life's work to matter. If in the future I am every lucky enough to meet a guy who was honestly and truly that respectful and supportive of who I am as a PERSON rather than as a woman, I would marry him in a heartbeat. At the same time, if it doesn't happen I won't be heartbroken.

I got into it with him there, and then later I saw this.

In this AMA:
http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q9qzn/iama_former_nasa_space_shuttle_engineer_created/

He says, here (http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q9qzn/iama_former_nasa_space_shuttle_engineer_created/c3vz0j8)
:

&gt;A man who tries to solve a woman's problems typically ends up with no money, no relationship and a severe drinking problem. He also reveals that he just doesn't understand women.
The perfect response to hearing a woman start talking about her problems is to sit down and listen -- fully and sincerely, and offering no solutions. Brew some coffee. Take the phone off the hook. Cancel your appointments. And it can't hurt to say ""Life is so unfair!"" from time to time. But a man who ""takes it to the next level,"" who offers to solve a woman's problems, simply doesn't get it.
To me personally, women represent the greatest waste of human potential ever -- people who should be scientists, leaders, thinkers, Nobel Prizewinners, and who are more than fully qualified to do all those things, but who instead complain about how unfair life is, and how it's all the fault of men.

Between his bizzare anti-psychology stuff, and this crap, why does this stuff get upvoted on reddit?

The girl doesn't know what MPH (miles per hour means) and the guy is trying to explain the concept to her. Meanwhile the girl is trying to understand and rationalizes it using distances she'd run on a track and using tire rotation. Her rationalization is admittedly HILARIOUS,but she is trying to figure it out with her own measurements.


The guy who posted it on facebook said ""She is fuggin dumb"". 


Another guy posted "" One does not simply make it past the age of 15 without knowing the meaning of MPH. She is not ignorant, she is dumb as fuck."" So I posted ""Just because she doesn't know that, doesn't mean she is dumb, stop laughing at people's ignorance (and it IS ignorance and not dumbness), it makes people not want to ask questions because they become afraid to appear dumb. Then, people don't learn anything because they're too afraid to ask.""


Then a guy posted saying that because she obviously had the priviledge to get an education that there is no excuse for her not to know. (Sorry that people don't know everything in the world, guy and you sound half-jealous of her supposed economic priviledge which you gleaned from one youtube video. )


It just pissed me off (i'm not s ure why it pissed me off, was this misogynistic of them?), how they handled it and their attitude towards the girl. 

Here is the video. It IS pretty funny, i'll admit that much.

In two panels it shows the stages of getting ready in the morning as performed by a man vs by a woman, cleverly mimicking the evolutionary progression.  The ""hilarious"" bit is that the man takes 10 minutes while the woman takes 2.5 hours.      

Yeah.  Sure.  You know, this type of bullshit irritates the hell out of me when used by men (or anyone, really) to feel superior to women. Seriously? Why do you think it takes women so long to get ready? Is it because we are stupid, slow, shallow creatures? No. It's because YOU are. Social convention demands a hell of a lot more from a woman than it does from a man to reach even minimal standards of attractiveness. Anything a guy has to do, a woman probably has to do twice as much of. Shave? You do your face, I'll do my arm pits, legs, and bikini zone. Hair? You go ahead and run a bit of gel through, I'll shampoo, condition, mousse, blow dry, curl, pin, spray. Getting dressed? I'll carefully pull on the stockings so they don't rip, then select the perfect underwear combination/spanks so that I can look flawless in that ridiculous little dress, all the while wondering if I look too ""slutty"" to be seen as a professional in the workplace.  Or else I'll put on twice as many articles as men generally have to because women's clothing is often made thinner and more transparent, still wondering if I look too slutty.  And God forbid I neglect to put on makeup before I leave the house!  And never mind that women do, despite popular belief, have bodily functions that require the use of a toilet!  

Fact: women who wear makeup are trusted more than women who don't.  
Sad Fact: looks matter out there and if we don't conform to bullshit social standards, then we lose.

Aside from sounding irksome and frankly a bit childish, these popular terms are potentially harmful to the way women are perceived, especially on Reddit. Do you ""girlmasturbate?"" What about lesbians, do they go to the bathroom and ""gaypee?"" Does a man of color ""blackdrive"" his car to the store? Do Chinese Americans wear ""asianclothes?"" Think about the implications of these terms and how strange and othering it seems to add a specific race, sexuality, or gender to these everyday nouns and verbs.

I love, love, LOVE how sex positive and pro-healthy body image we are over here on TwoX and in no way do I intend to silence the talk of our vaginas and arousal. However, I can't help but cringe each time I read the obligatory female prefix on each body part. When you talk about your ""ladyparts,"" you are making a very distinct separation between yours and ""manparts,"" or worse, a difference between ""ladyparts"" and ""parts."" After all, we are not a species comprised of people with ""manhands"" and ""womanhands,"" we all just have HANDS, like we all have bits or parts. I understand the awkward predicament of our language choice - vulva may sound too technical, while pussy harkens dirty talk, but at the very least, folks would it be so awful to just say ""parts?"" I promise, I'll know what you're talking about.

I've been meaning to make this post for awhile, but what really set me off was this awesome image - indeed an important and wonderful reminder- but for pete's sake, we're looking at fifteen VERY anatomical depictions of vulvas! If there was ever a time for proper language, this is it!

""Ladybean"" is another unfavorite of mine, because within context, there's no way ""bean"" could refer to anything other than a clitoris. ""womanjuice"" though not as popular, sounds equally silly to me: again, it's not as if ""juice"" is in any way ambiguous.

""Ladyboner,"" to be honest, makes my head spin. You're WET. You're HOT, you wanna have sex with that person, but for the love of god, you don't have a penis. This term suggests that no one will understand what you mean by being aroused unless you put it in familiar, default male-centric terms. Imagine how odd it would be if a man posted a sex story about his ""manparts"" being ""dudewet."" (Okay, noted that dicks can get wet during arousal, but not really the same way a vag does.)

It is not my intention to criticize people or force everyone to use grownup language, but to urge folks, before posting one of these slang words, to think about the implications of the language you use.
I would also love to hear any other viewpoints people have, as I know TwoX to be excellent and respectful debaters.

Not really a big age difference. I guess we're both part of the same generation, but it doesn't feel like it.

She's taking a gender studies class in college now, but not because she cares about it. I lent her my copy of ""The Handmaid's Tale"" (one of my favs) which was required reading for the course, but I don't think she's read it, nor do I think she cares.

I've tried to send her interesting articles on stuff relating to feminism and the conservative war on reproductive rights in America, but she never responds or says anything about it.

I was hoping her class would teach her some things, but she once mentioned what they were doing and it really made me worry. It was a while ago so the details are fuzzy, but I remember her saying how they weren't going to be discussing theory or anything, and that the professor was putting all these artificial restrictions on debate.

What upsets me the most is how apathetic she, and seemingly all her friends her age, are about their rights as human beings! They have no interest in what's going on around them!

She's never lived in a pre-Roe v Wade world. (Nor have I, but I at least appreciate the difference) She's able to walk into any walgreens and buy contraceptive. She's able to walk into an abortion clinic and get an abortion if it comes to that. She doesn't seem to realize that this might not be possible in the vary near future.

She doesn't seem to realize that in politics, women aren't human beings with rights, rather, they are an assembly of parts to be regulated and controlled. 

I've tried to get through to her, but whenever I bring up feminism I get weird looks from her and everyone else I know. (Because clearly, a man can't be a feminist since all feminists are raging dykes who burn their bras)

She's incredibly intelligent, we share a sense of humor, a drive to succeed, and have the same social proclivities. Being with her is a constant learning experience, and it's broadening my horizons. Not to mention that she takes amazing care of me. Also, the sex is fantastic.

What distracts me is that she had apparently gained a significant ) amount of weight just before I met her. (i.e now she is 5' 2'' and 170ish lbs. When we were getting ready for a party, none of her dresses fit) When we were looking through her facebook photos together, when I see her from about a year or two ago, I said ""Wow, you look GREAT."" It turns out that at that time, she had an eating disorder.

I've been in three long-term relationships (i.e 2+ years), and have dated many women. The majority of them have been very petite. Additionally, I train in a very demanding sport, and am in pretty good shape, personally. The shape of her body makes me less inclined to marvel at her, in the way that I marvel at her intelligence or creativity. I'm afraid that she'll catch wind of my apprehension, and harm herself to satisfy me. A very selfish part of me would like it if she lost weight.

I understand that the fact that I focus on her physical body- and that I compare it to a misogynistic standard of beauty- means that I'm totally supporting the patriarchy, and more importantly, could be harming her. I don't want to be an asshole. So, feminisms

- Where is the line between preference and patriarchy?
- If I've been conditioned to measure women up to a certain standard, how do I 'uncondition' myself?

Thanks for hearing me out. I don't mean to turn this into /relationshipadvice, but this problem has a lot more to do (or I'd like to think) with a broader pattern than just myself.

""Sen. Greg Reed, R-Jasper, voted to move Senate Bill 12 out of committee last week because he said it’s a good bill that would help “a mother to understand that a live baby is inside her body.”""

Sen. Reed is not a woman.  He is not capable of childbirth.  He seems to find it difficult to understand the concept of a fetus forming inside a person.  I get the impression that just because HE can't understand that he assumes women also can't.  Except, a pregnant woman would be a better authority of what's going on inside her.  She's the one in the situation, she would know better the gravity.   

It just seems to me a lot of these anti-women bills are created on the insecurity of male congresspeople, projecting their own inability to understand an issue onto those it actually affects.   It almost even seems that these congressmen assume women can't know better than they, demonstrating extreme arrogance and a further need for diversity in political representation.",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,is it just me or do Congressmen in support of the state-sanctioned rape bill seem to think because they can't comprehend a womens issue than neither can a woman?,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/q9wi5/is_it_just_me_or_do_congressmen_in_support_of_the/,,,,,0
