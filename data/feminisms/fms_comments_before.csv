crosscanyon,,,"&gt;This riveting brochure explains that “women move differently than men.” This differentude, implies the brochure, is because of a deformity afflicting the entire sex class: “wider hips and a lower center of gravity.” Or, in clinical terms, “cooties.”

Just wow. Didn't the writer knowingly buy shoes from a company that separates women's styles from men's styles? She bought a pair of WOMEN'S hiking boots and then was outraged when it came with a pitter-patter pamphlet explaining why the specific style caters to women.

Until the last twenty years or so, biomechanical research focused on the male foot and gait. Now the kinesiologists that work with shoe companies are trying to develop designs outside of the old male-centric paradigms. It's going to take women's footwear a few years to catch up and normalize, and until then, the onus lies with differentiating women's shoes from men.

What is the author trying to say? That the product is fine but the ""layman's explanation"" marketing materials are not? That female physiology isn't different enough from male physiology to require different footwear? That all shoes should be unisex? (I wouldn't want that, my heels don't fit in men's shoes. They chafe too much. Who do I blame? Damn my sexist heels and/or the sexist designers of shoe heels!)

The truth of the matter is that not all children are welcome in this world.

This is about controlling women's bodies and forcing conformity.

thismachine,,,"I only skim read this, but I agree - this cis man shouldn't be pushing for his child to use the word ""cunt"". Not that there's a problem with people who *do* have cunts using the word themselves, because they're reclaiming it, but it's touchier when someone who doesn't have one, and especially a cis man, to decide to use it and push it on others.

Personally, I think that using the word ""cunt"" in a context of reclaiming and all is awesome. I use it sometimes. It does, however, depend on the context - I wouldn't use it with a doctor, and I wouldn't use it in front of, say, elderly relatives. Not just because of the word ""cunt"" in a misogynistic context, but actually because it *is* slang that carries impolite connotation. I wouldn't use words like ""cock"", ""arse"", or ""shit"" with people who might feel uncomfortable with them or where it might be out of place.

I'm personally in favour of simply using terms like ""vulva"", ""penis"", ""clitoris"", ""testicles"", ""vagina"", ""labia"". Those are terms used if they see a doctor or if they crack open an encyclopedia. They're usually appropriate in most contexts. It also sounds much less subjective to me. In a discussion about sexuality, I'd use these. I find that even slang words can be similar to euphemisms, in that they're not as precise, and ultimately, they're less ""scientific"". In explaining sex to my kids, or discussing sex with fellow adults, these are words I'd use. ""Cunt"", like about half a ton of euphemisms, can refer to any part of the vulva. Using the actual words is more precise and sounds less like we're making sex a huge deal, if this makes sense. It also makes it easier to answer kids' questions, and for them to be able to compare a textbook diagram with their own parts and have a name for everything. It makes up for a better understanding of our own anatomy without any particular connotation. 

I'm all for that little girl choosing that word for herself eventually. But for now, really, teaching her words like ""vulva"" would be much more logical and similar to the reason why her brothers were taught to say penis. 

I apologise if I'm rambling, I haven't had any coffee today yet so my wording of this might be a little terrible. My point is that using more scientific terminology is more precise (and that can be helpful when explaining things, reading on their own, etc) and it's far more neutral. I'd want my kids to think of sex as something that is neither good nor bad - if they like it and they're partners are consenting and safe, etc then it's fine, but it's also ok if they don't like it and they shouldn't feel pressured to. Of course, the fact that in several contexts the connotations of sex do change is something I'd discuss with them in their own time, and I'd obviously explain ""cunt"" and reclaiming, and all that, but whether they wanted to use ""cunt"" or some random euphemism is something that would be up to them.

Finally, I wanted to point out that I take some issue with the title. I understand if it's got to do exclusively with the little girl mentioned in the article (though I'm not sure how much of it is her own identification and how much is her father identifying her as a woman/girl/whatever) but in general I'd hardly assume that a child with a vulva is a ""her"". There's plenty of people with vulvas who prefer other pronouns and have other gender identities. Again, if I had a child who was old enough to speak I'd simply use the pronouns according to what they preferred, even if their choices changed according to their understanding of what it all means.

Suggesting I'm too dim to understand subtlety is a totally condescending move, and I'm not going to let get away with that. Thanks for posting that so that I know to make this my final comment. Final word is yours if you want it. I don't care, you've completely turned me off of this debate. Mission Accomplished.

The tone of your comments over all is that you are *concerned* that in some way, shape or form the model, because of her age, is being exploited for financial gain by adults, right? And the vehicle of the (supposed, assumed, made up) exploitation is child sexualization which further commodifies the child and female form. Am I close? I'm going to assume so. Moving on:

&gt;Nobody is saying that she's being molested on-set or sold into slavery. 

You're totally right. No one has explicitly said that, however you've mentioned time and time again that she is being sexualized and exploited. When I hear that I think of cases where young girls *are* sexually abused and exploited. I then compare the two examples and see that they are not similar. In one, the model is doing this on her own free will (I won't assume that she's forced into this because an assumption based on zero evidence doesn't hold any water) the other is not doing on their own free will which is a huge problem. Okay? Cool. 

My point is this: the logical escalation of worry is that we assume that because there are girls who are, or have been, sexually exploited this one will be too, hence my references to pedophiles. Everyone is concerned that this type of sexualization of a child will only ""endanger,"" or make her a target, to perverts and pedophiles. In this **particular** case, I disagree that this is happening here. I don't believe her controversial picture is inherently sexualized, I don't believe that she is being coerced.

I made some parallels that you ignored, but one that I just thought of is Tavi of Style Rookie. She began taking pictures of herself for her blog at 12. Now, I don't believe her shots to be sexualized, and she does have full creative control of the content is produces but she was a child posting pictures of herself onto the internet. Was she too young to know what she was doing? Was she just old enough that she thought she knew what she was doing? Were her parents encouraging her or exploiting her in the hopes that she'd make it big?

Where do we draw the line? Should models be 18+ like porn actresses? Then what would that say about the fashion industry as a whole? You suggest that the fashion industry is built on, and is driven by sex, but the model also posed in children's fashion magazines. Are children's fashion magazines exempt from scrutiny? 

Fashion and fashion photography drive commerce. But they are inherently works of art. At what point do we begin to censor art work? The nude-portrait of the Australian girl was in protest of that. That's my biggest problem with this whole situation. This is where I exit the conversation. If you choose to reply I'll read it but I've invested a bit too much time on this and I have some errands I have to do. Wish I could say it was a pleasure.

Really? Because I made it abundantly clear that the industry is problematic for models of **all** ages, but when you're a child, you additionally have no legal autonomy and lack the decision-making skills of an adult, making them even more susceptible to exploitation.

&gt;Who's the largest buying demographic of fashion magazines? Women.

I...don't understand. I have absolutely no idea why you felt the need to point this out. Women are people too...

&gt;This model isn't being coerced into this because there's waaayy too much publicity on her.

You're joking, right? Coercion isn't a black-and-white matter that comes with a bright red warning light, and publicity has certainly never gotten in the way of all manners of corruption in politics, the entertainment industry, fashion, the film industry, etc. It's more that this model probably thinks she really wants to do this, because it's exciting and grown-up, and the adults around her are enthusiastically supporting her, but she has no idea and won't understand for a long time what she was actually involved in.

&gt;But implying that a photo of a kid with messy, tousled hair, a blank expression, and an open mouth will suddenly launch the ships of a thousand pedos

Literally nobody said that. You're going buck-wild with hyperbole and exaggeration, ain't ya?

**Finally, I think you kind of missed the point entirely.** The point isn't that A. This model is being held at gunpoint or B. These photographs will instantaneously transform model citizens into pedophiles. I see that subtlety isn't exactly your strong suit here, but try to follow along.

It's problematic that adults are demanding, adults are paying for, adults are arranging situations in which this child is shown in a sexualized way. It's problematic that this is a general trend in the fashion industry. It's problematic that people are using ""But! Art! Artistic intent! Saying it's art makes it infallible!"" as an excuse, because it's doesn't--real people are involved, people who are **too young to know what they're doing, but just old enough that they *think* they know what they're doing**.

I do agree that Tina Fey is not ugly, of course she's not. But that's a reflection on completely screwy beauty standards in media. a la, Christina Hendricks can't get dresses to wear to awards shows because no one wants someone above a size two wearing their clothes.

As to your defense of an offense against Kwanzaa:

Creating a space specifically for a non-privileged group is not discriminatory against the privileged group.  Especially not when WE started and enforced the segregation.

Yeah, he sounds like an ass.  But so do early members of any religion.  Christians were some pretty misogynistic, racist, torturing asshats in their day, too.  Some of them still are.  Denouncing the entire populace who celebrate it is sorta like denouncing all Muslims cause some of them went a little woo-hoo in the head.

&gt; During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas, that Jesus was psychotic, and that Christianity was a white religion that black people should shun.

&gt;So let's recap: the guy who invented this holiday was a racist and misogynist who has actually been convicted of torturing people? And the holiday was specifically conceived with a racist intent in mind?

ThroAwayTransvisions,,,"&gt;We gave the Saudi's the go ahead to suppress that uprising in return for Saudi Arabia's blessing in Libya.

I agree, thats a bunch of bs. It doesnt change the fact that his conduct with Libyia, Tunisia, Egypt, and Syria, are counter to that of previous administrations. Its a pitfall of a realistic foreign policy. This goes back throughout us history: Jefferson, Polk, McKinley, T Roosevelt. 

&gt;I believe that the Neo cons retort to what you've said here would be ""well ofcourse...this is what we thought would happen. We'd push the first domino (Hussein) and the rest will fall on their own"".

And i disagree with that, i have debated this with several people. The toppling of Saddam was a major influence on the uprisings, but not in the way neo cons make it out to be.  The Middle East was tired of being *controlled* by the US in the way we *controlled* Iraq through Saddam and the invasion. They are happy with US *support* and friendship, but want to be independent and equals, not puppets. Which the US has so far essentially agreed to as long as we dont turn Libya into Cuba post War of 1898.

&gt;I just see this incredible double standard. Bush tortures Sheik Muhammed and everyone wants war crimes charges but Obama assassinates a 16 year old american citizen and all I here are crickets. Its frightening. 

Im on the fence of saying Bush committed ""war crimes."" I think ""war crimes"" should be reserved for things like genocide. He did do a lot of things worthy of investigation and definitely unconstitutional and immoral, unfortunately Obama has continued some of these, and yes it is a double standard. I think the reason he gets off with it, is because in the end he has gotten more done on foreign policy without committing ground troops or long term engagements. I know its horrifying, but its a numbers game. Obama get the same objective ~~without~~ while killing fewer people. Not saying its right or we should not be upset about it, just saying why he gets away with it.

&gt;I knew he was pulling a fast one on all of you during the campaign and I wrote at length about it but over the last few years as he was obviously all bullshit I've been astonished at how he's so completely pulled the wool over his followers eyes. Its scary. I'm sorry you seem like a very intelligent kind person but this is insanity.

I hope you dont think i am ""follower"" of Obama. Because his administration has gone about as well as i expected, *averagely*. I didnt know specifically what he would do wrong, but i knew his shit wasn't made of gold. People often ask me if i am disapointed by the overall outcome. No, i knew he wasnt a messiah who would bring forth some type of revolution and that he would end up falling a certain amount to the status quo just as much as anyone else would. I'm sorry, you too are incredibly intelligent, but if you think Ron Paul wont have his pitfalls as well, you are making the same mistake you accuse Obama's followers of doing. That of demagoguery and worship.

As to the Arab Spring. This is apart of the change to foreign relations. 

&gt;Libya was a fucking train wreck. Qhaddafi gave up is WMD program and then some western nations got together and bombed the fuck out of him and now his son is being tortured and he was executed like a dog in the street. 

Train wreck really? What is important to note about the arab spring is that it was started by the people of those countries, it was not started by western nations. Unlike in Iraq where the US forced something upon a people, the citizens of those countries rose up on their own accord in opposition to pro-western tyrants such as Gaddafi, Mubarak, and Ben Ali, because they were essentially puppets of the US; western nations merely decided to support those democratic efforts. This is a huge change for the US, rather than protecting tyrannical regimes just because they do what we want, we supported a democratic cause rooted in the beliefs of the people themselves. There would have been massively more killing if the west had not gotten involved. Also, Obama chose to have a true coalition, not like Bush's ""Coalition of the willing"" that was essentially unilateral US leadership. The western group that provided air support was not primarily US led either, this was a big change toward international cooperation, something the gop criticized him for and would have rather had an iraq style invasion. Also good to point out the US and the west didnt act until asked by the Lybians and the Arab League both. 

&gt;his son is being tortured and he was executed like a dog in the street.

You are going to hold him accountable for the actions of revolutionaries not under his control? He is being tortured [really?](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8969560/Saif-al-Islam-Gaddafi-held-in-isolation-but-is-in-good-physical-condition.html) Even if he was, he is being held by Lyban authorities. You cannot hold Obama responsible for the actions of a sovereign government. Ill give you that it is wrong he hasnt seen a lawyer or his family, but once again, cant judge Obama on actions of the Libyans. 

&gt;Did you see the women getting beaten in dragged through the streets in Cairo the other day?

Once again, cant hold him accountable for the actions of foreign government.

ThroAwayTransvisions,,,"By honesty i mean what i said about Ron Paul as well. Its a belief in what he is saying while also thoroughly understanding why they believe it, whether or not it is right or wrong. You dont get that from a lot of polititians. Ex, every time you ask a republican why they want to lower taxes, why they oppose glbt rights, why they support isreal, they can never explain why they view it that way past just a talking point. I feel Obama (not on every issue) can, but that doesnt mean i agree with him all the time.

&gt;Other than repealing don't ask don't tell he's been an abject failure on every major aspect of his Presidency.

DADT, handling of the arab spring (although a few initial fumbles) i agree with him on mostly, getting out of iraq and hopefully afganistan, his overall approach to diplomacy is a BIG change from previous decades (this sounds silly but it actualy is important), his energy policies, and on a personal note as a trans woman i appreciate being able to change my gender on my passport (something i cant do on my dl in tx) and his recent focus on glbt issue internationally. I find these successes, and he did at least try for a public option, although as you pointed out, he did fail.

But at the same time, yes, he has failures. Healthcare, his handling of isreal, certain womens issues, some economic issues, NASA, etc. On the whole, i would say he has done an *average* job. But at least he has done an average job working for ends that i mostly agree with, instead of the opposite direction.

&gt; you're not going to get anything different out of Romney or Newt that you'll get out of Obama.

Do you really believe that? I agree that both the dems and the gop are shitty choices, but with the gop we would be getting major tax cuts to the rich, more ""cowboy"" diplomacy, increased military spending, more deregulation (same deregulation that got us in this economic mess). They would also curtail women's, minorities, and glbt rights along with the general civil liberties MORE than Obama has (for clarification he has not curtailed minority or glbt rights). Just look at the gop's views on anti-discrimination laws, unions, healthcare, corporate law, or ANY foreign policy matter and you will see that they are worse than Obama.

Im fine with Obama being criticized from the left, hell i do myself. But when given the choice between him or any of the gop candidates, ill choose Obama anyday. At least with Obama you get attempts at progress on most issues, whereas the gop is mostly regressive, obstructionist, and dogmatic.

Many argue that prudence suggests that women wear longer skirts and not walk alone at night, etc. Others argue that 'prudence' in those cases is nothing more than victim-blaming in disguise. I don't think the issue is a black-and-white case. I think women should alter their behavior in order to minimize their chances of being raped in the same way I think homeowners should lock their doors in order to minimize their chances of being robbed. But I don't think we should live in a society in which we have to change our behavior in order to avoid rape or robbery or whatever crime you choose. But since we do, charging one side with victim-blaming and the other side with stupidity doesn't help. We need a way to consider these questions in a productive manner. I think we can do that by recognizing the difference between binding and non-binding responsibilities.",0,1327166682,,,0,c3j6zv9,t3_onnem,3.0,t1_c3j6oaz,2327,1428214733,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,,

mike918,,,"This is a good post and an important flipside to the idea that women should behave in certain ways to minimize their chances of being raped. The idea of shuffling seems to me to be a good way to share the burden of prudence in a rape culture.

I think it comes down to types of responsibilities. We are obviously obligated not to rape another person. We probably are not obligated to shuffle our feet in dark alleys or wear longer skirts in bars; however, we should do those things, in the former because it decreases social tension and in the latter because it decreases rape targeting.

But, and this is an important but, the responsibilities are different in kind. The responsibility not to rape is an obligation that is binding and, as such, carries legitimate repercussions if violated. The responsibility (suggestion?) to shuffle or wear longer skirts is prudent but not binding and carries no attendant culpability if violated.",0,1327160010,,,0,c3j65n9,t3_onnem,1.0,t3_onnem,159634,1428214338,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,,

I do think it is unfair to guys, especially black guys to be so often viewed as potential rapists -- especially when rape statistics point to people you know more likely to be culprits than strangers walking behind you on public roads. And all women certainly aren't angels who'd never hurt anyone ever. But a lot of women have been sexually assaulted or know someone who has been and it's no wonder that most of us are easily fearful.

Yet, I can't help but think that a lot of people's reactions are overreactions given what is and isn't actually high-risk (though those vary by area), or that they should at least be more equal in their treatment if they really do think that the risks are high enough to warrant changing their behavior.

http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/03/11/faq-what-is-male-privilege/

It's very difficult to see one's own privilege. This is exactly why those with privilege must learn about it through the experiences of people without it. We learn about the damage white privilege does by listening to the experiences of people of color- if we didn't listen to them and accept what they're telling us as the truth, life would continue business as usual, including the damage done every day. 

People with privilege don't *mean* to have it, and don't *mean* to use it- it's the water they swim in as fish. It's so omnipresent and so colors their world that they can't see it. That's why we need birds outside the water to point at the fish and say, ""You're swimming in water.""

Also, while I absolutely loathe when people use, ""people won't care about STI prevention as much with pregnancy as a lower risk,"" as an argument for not providing other forms of contraception, it is naive to completely discount these worries. There are a significant amount of heterosexual people who have pregnancy as the primary concern, with concern over STI's as only incidental to this. We should always move towards increasing reproductive freedom and choice, but we also have the responsibility to exercise due diligence in public health awareness, which sometimes seems to be forgotten, or ignored when gainsaying those who would withhold Plan B and similar contraception on this fetid justification.

Once more, the whole mentality of ""we need to protect people from themselves and not give them something that they might use to justify poor decisions"" is troublesome, but it does have some basis in reality.

Iris uses ChaCha.
Chacha is a human search engine, which from my understanding means it is like google, except every person can rate the results which then affect what results are returned by future questions.

This means that people can manipulate the results through no fault of the technology itself.  If the majority of people with technical know how enough to edit something like ChaCha's results have some political ideology, the results will eventually start reflecting it.

As such, I doubt the creators meant for this to happen and I doubt any employee along the way tried to get this to happen.  It is a result of using popular opinion to answer certain questions.

The very important point to realize is that while popular opinion may lean one way, the popular opinion of people who are interested in some question may be different.  While most people might say abortion isn't wrong, those who are interested in doing a search for the question ""why is abortion wrong"" may have a different popular opinion.

While it seems in the case of ChaCha the problem is quickly revealed, even more well known search engines do this to some extent.  For example, Google will look at the past searches you have done, compare it to people who have done similar searches, and then use the searches they seemed to like to effect what your own search is.  They are also biased based upon where you are located (which is why someone like myself, who has their internet set up to always report different locations) ends up getting completely different results for the same search.

The Jewish Anti-Defamation League disapproved of Comfort's use of the Holocaust to further his anti-choice agenda. I dislike using loaded terms like ""anti-choice,"" but his views on justice and the nature of humanity and all creatures is anything but ""pro-life.""  The worst part is that Comfort's parents are Jewish.

Comfort prides himself on being an average American making an average wage. However, he runs Living Waters Publication / Ministry and pulls a six figure income.

shallah,,,"&gt;Lloyd, whose heritage is Anglo and Roma, eloquently describes the role that race and class play in the popular understanding of sex trafficking. Girls who are trafficked across borders are thought of as victims, and so are white, middle-class American girls. But the black and Latina girls with whom Lloyd works are thought to have chosen their life, to be oversexed or scheming or too lazy to do anything but sell themselves. They are referred to as young adults, even when they are far under 15, and cops call their rapes “theft of services.” Even though federal law says that anyone under the age of 18 who is sold for sex is a victim of severe trafficking, with no need to prove coercion or force, if the girl is an American and of color, she will too often be arrested, charged with prostitution and jailed.

&gt;In a particularly striking section of “Girls Like Us,” Lloyd notes that media attention related to exploited and missing girls matters:

&gt;&gt;    It makes a difference in whether your disappearance gets copters and dogs or flyers. It makes a difference in how you’re treated by a jury of “your peers.” It makes a difference in whether your family members are believed or taken seriously. In over a decade of working with thousands of girls, most of whom have been missing at some point, many of whom were literally kidnapped and held by force, I have never seen a GEMS case that has gotten an Amber Alert.

JulianMorrison,,,"&gt;Is it sexist to tell someone they're attractive

I think, mostly, yes. (Assuming you mean ""use this as a conversation opener"", not ""compliment the efforts of your girlfriend"".)

Society puts huge pressure on women to be attractive, forces them to pour constant work into it. If they succeed, it uses their attractiveness to take away their agency. But what use is beauty to a woman? Tell a woman who is beautiful and knows it, that she is beautiful, and she will feel like you just told her that grass is green. Yes, thanks, already knew that. You may be amazed. She is not. (And if you use beauty praise as a way to butter up an insecure woman, then you suck.)

Edit: I don't venture past touching my closest of co-workers on their shoulder and a hug when it's clearly appropriate. A big part of unwanted physical contact, for me, is also what they are subconsciously queuing you to do. From men, I often feel like touches were to toughen me up: rough backhanded pats on the chest or over enveloping and suffocating side hugs. From women, I received a plethora of touches suggesting I back the fuck off. These things are being presented alongside the more routine sexualized contact which sends me into a spiral of self-doubt and rage. Hating all of these, I typically just bow out of physical contact.

Oddly enough, when I used to present as a gay man everyone (seemingly) **loved** my physical contact and would grope *me* inappropriately all the time. It was a dynamic I could never understand and it drove me insane.

The worst is that I was recently in a situation where I felt like I couldn't speak out at all, because the person giving me unwelcome touching was a friend of mine, and a lesbian trans-woman. I worried that I was being homophobic and transphobic, and I worried about expressing my apprehensions to anyone for fear of coming off as a jerk. She would often pull me in to sit on her lap and hold me there even when I would make it clear that I didn't want to be there. She also frequently kissed me on the cheek and hold my face close to hers, in an extremely intimate way. She did that with many girls, and I felt awful because I know that she wanted to feel accepted and not like a pariah (as she had just recently come out). I talked to her once about it but was afraid of coming off like a jerk, so I sugar-coated it a lot. Eventually I did go to an administrator about it, though my complaint was so laced with apology it must have looked very watered-down.

There's a weird aspect of society - especially for young people - where people now act like everyone just sits on each others' laps and lean on shoulders all the time and it's oh-so-sweet and normal.

I read both the article and grospoliner's response and I respect that they both have unwanted physical contact that has affected them deeply.

I would say that both experiences are born of a culture that is poorly educated in the ways of negotiating physical contact.

linuxlass,,,"Don't give random people compliments (or make negative comments, either):

* about things they have no control over: their name, anything genetic (eyes, etc)

* about things that it is *possible* they have no control over: their voice, their size/shape, their hair.

* about things that are really none of your business: the book they're reading, the expression on their faces. (positive comments about books, music, and tech are ok, but not compliments per se. I give an example below.)


Don't tell someone they're attractive if they have no reason to care what you think. You're imposing on them, and you're also creating an awkward situation where they have to make a decision about whether to respond politely and possibly swallow their feelings of discomfort, or else respond honestly and feel bad about being rude. It's a no-win situation, and very selfish on the man's part to do this.

If you see a random person who you find attractive, and want to talk to, be polite, and say something of substance and with meaning. ""Excuse me, I couldn't help noticing the interesting pattern on your sweater. Is it hand-knit?"";  ""I'm sorry for interrupting you, but I noticed the book you're reading is one on my own queue. Is it any good? What do you like about it?""

And then pay attention to any body language or other nonverbal cues that the person really doesn't want to talk. Put their interests and comfort above your own. This is what polite and civilized people do.


For people you already know in some way (a co-worker, a neighbor), you don't have to be quite so careful, but still be very careful about what I said above about compliments. In this situation, the woman has very little choice about avoiding you in the future, so don't make her feel like you're a creep and she has to watch out.

While ""abortion wars"" may immediately bring to mind the very real threat of antiabortion violence, sociologist Carole Joffe shows how a pervasive stigma operates less dramatically but just as effectively to maintain cultural, political, and economic barriers to access.

Real-life stories include those of poverty-stricken rape victims scrambling—and sometimes failing—to cover the cost of abortions that should be covered by Medicaid; a doctor having to beg her superior for permission to perform in-hospital a medical abortion too dangerous to handle at a clinic; and a woman whose miscarriage is causing septic shock refused care and bundled off to another hospital.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the odds of getting jumped at the bar I like to go to. 

True. I venture only to coffee bars, I do not imbibe alcohol, and I cannot afford legal fees associated with violent confrontation. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about “vote fraud” theater showing up at my poll station. 

A single vote makes no difference from an economic perspective, and I do not vote. Were I to vote, I would expect to respect the independently verified and verifiable paper-trail left by all other voters. Electronic voting machines do not afford this test. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about turning on the news to see people planning to burn my holy book.

True. I am an atheist. However, when I was a libertarian I was appalled by the dismissal of the United States Constitution by those who swore to uphold it.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about others demanding I apologize for hateful people who have nothing to do with me. 

That really depends on the what happens following this post. I am a male.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about my child being seen as a detriment to my career. 

I do not have children, nor a career.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the irony of people thinking I’m lucky because I can park close to the door. 

I am honestly aghast that any would consider legally handicapped (I presume) people as ""lucky"" for their conditions.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about memories of being bullied in high school. 

That is correct, and I choose not to think about such things.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about being told to relax, it was just a joke.

Today, I am less militant in my response to those who proclaim (presumably) teasing to be, ""just a joke."" I do, however, calmly talk to these people to discover why they said what they did, and help them understand it as well. This creates many awkward moments, but *occasionally* someone will gain perspective, for their own benefit, as to why they felt it was advantageous to tease another person.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether someone thinks I’m in this country illegally. 

True, nor do I think that of others since those who permit people beyond an imaginary line on the ground have nothing to do with me.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about those who believe that freedom of religion ends with mine. 

I am concerned of such things, though mildly.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how a half-starved 23-year-old being a cultural ideal affects my life. 

And I wish that I never allowed it to impede my life, but I still think about it.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how much my life is circumscribed by my body. 

Yet, I do. Even though it is a choice I make every day, I do this.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about people wanting me cured of loving who I love.

But I do think of them, for they are perpetuating evil in the world and a crime on humanity.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about those who view me an unfit parent because of who I love. 

I am not a parent, nor do I expect to be within the next decade.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about being told my kind don’t assimilate.
 
I do not understand what that means. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about people blind to the intolerance of their belief lecturing me about my own. 

And I never should have. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about my body as a political football. 

I take it this ""political football"" is that of a woman's right to choose to abort an organism gestating inside of her. I don't have to worry about that. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how much my own needs wear on those I love.

Why would I not think about how my needs affect the ones I love? If I love them, then of course I am going to think about their welfare. If I not concerned about their welfare, I don't think it can be say that I actually love them.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about explaining to others “what happened to me.” 

This is always a choice. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about politicians saying bigoted things about me to win votes. 

This is true, and it is one of the reasons I stepped away from investing personal time and money in politics. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about those worried that one day people like me will be the majority. 

That statement says a great deal. I cannot change the minds of everyone, and I can barely affect the minds of a few. It is very sad, but many people repeat rhetoric rather than think. I have not found conversation in that type of instance productive.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about someone using the name of my religion as a slur. 

That is true. I do not have to think about it. Doing so is a choice.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about so many of the words for me controlling my own life being negatives.

I am at a loss, here. I do not know what these words are other than ""slut."" 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about still not being equal. 

That is true. I do not have to think about it, but I sometimes allow myself to think about whether or not equal opportunity employment laws affect my ability to achieve employment.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about what it takes to keep going. 

I do think about this.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how much I still have to hide. 

I do think about this, often to my own detriment. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how much prejudice keeps hold. 

Prejudice is not limited to any single ethnic or social group, as pointed out above. I do try to not let i affect me.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how I’m meant to be grateful that people tolerate my kind.

And I do not think about that. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about all the things I don’t have to think about. 

Yet I have taken some time to think about them be addressing each in this post.

&gt;But today I will.

-

And I ask, do you see the points mentioned herein as addressing privilege? If so, I ask for who the supposed privileges apply, and how they do. I do not see how each matter is exclusive to any gender, or ethnicity, or socio-economic group.

I take it the point of [this entry](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/10/18/things-i-dont-have-to-think-about-today/) is to point out that those who do not think about these topics do so because of the ""privilege"" indicated in OP's image of the Omaha Beach (Normandy, France 6 June 1944) landing. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about those who hear “terrorist” when I speak my faith.

Correct. I am an atheist. This does not mean that others do not ostracize me for speaking openly and honestly about atheist or philosophy, or that I am not concerned about what other people think.
 &gt;Today I don’t have to think about men who don’t believe no means no.

That depends on what part of what town I am traveling through. A request for spare change can easily turn into a mugging. 
 &gt;Today I don’t have to think about how the world is made for people who move differently than I do.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the phrase, ""move differently,"" refers to either one's gait or inability to walk. As such, I refute this claim. I am concerned about such matters.
 &gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether I’m married, depending on what state I’m in. 
Not to claim I am immune to marriage, or the consideration thereof, but I would be concerned with such things were I to enter into the legal contract of marriage.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about how I’m going to hail a cab past midnight.

Reasonable precautions must always be taken - by all involved parties - when criminal activity is more statistically likely.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether store security is tailing me. 
No one is above suspicion. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the look on the face of the person about to sit next to me on a plane.

Please tell me what, ""the look on the face of the person…"" is supposed to mean. A person can have uncomfortable feelings but conduct themselves rationally. Lawyers frequently do this when interacting potential clients, and when running court cases. 
 &gt;Today I don’t have to think about eyes going to my chest first. 
Body-consciousness is not gender specific.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about what people might think if they knew the medicines I took. 
True. Some medications bear a social stigma. Thankfully much legislation and business practices exist to ensure the confidentiality of clients' and patient's medical records. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about getting kicked out of a mall when I kiss my beloved hello.

I am unfamiliar with this occurrence. However, malls are private property. If business owners feel that such displays drive more customers and revenue away from their businesses than the revenue the ""offenders"" provide, they are free to ask the affectionate parties to vacate their property. The community may choose to support or boycott those businesses as consequence. Baselessly bigoted business will undergo revenue-loss and be displaced by the market. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about [whether it is] safe to hold my beloved’s hand. 
Thankfully I live in an area of the world where this is not an issue. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether I’m being pulled over for anything other than speeding. 
This depends on the community I am traveling through, but is correct since I neither drive nor smoke.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about being classified as one of “those people.” 
Every - I repeat - every stratified community or society will categorize an obviously different group. ""Oh, her bag was *so* 2009.""

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about making less than someone else for the same job at the same place. 
No, I actually do think about this. The economy is in a downturn. Women in my profession, in my geographic location make an average of 8% more than men of my profession in my geography location, and it is easier for women to receive federal assistance if their bills fall behind.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the people who stare, or the people who pretend I don’t exist.

Why would I concern myself with people who pretend I do not exist? I am genuinely honest and curious on this matter. The majority of the planet's population is not concerned with my welfare or existence, just as I am not concerned with those aspect of most individuals on this planet.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about managing pain that never goes away. 
That is not so. I have concerns that I must face every day that I actually want to *do* something. Depression, physiological, and psychological concerns are not exclusive to any group. Everyone has their own concerns. I say this not to dismiss the author's pain, but to shed light that everyone, *everyone,* has pain.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether a stranger’s opinion of me would change if I showed them a picture of who I love. 
Then the problem is not with the author, but with those who the author surrounds him or herself with.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the chance a store salesmen will ignore me to help someone else. 
True. No one has to think about this. However, thinking about it may help some of us think about personal hygiene. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about the people who’d consider torching my house of prayer a patriotic act. 
True. I am an atheist. This does not make me free of persecution by those willing to commit violent acts.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about a pharmacist telling me his conscience keeps him from filling my prescription.

True. However, I would locate an alternate pharmacist were I so concerned. Not all are so privileged to live near such a robust market. 

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about being asked if I’m bleeding when I’m just having a bad day. 
That, I must say, is true. I am a male. I find that language rather grating.

&gt;Today I don’t have to think about whether the one drug that lets me live my life will be taken off the market. 
When I get old, I will likely have this concern. The current pharmacological research, development, testing, and distribution methods are antiquated, restrictive, and cost lives every year by preventing life saving drugs from getting onto the market.

If it were strictly a matter of ""masculinity = strength,"" wouldn't Joe America, father of a tomboy, be especially proud, rather than at best uncomfortable and at worst ashamed?

He simply lacked the class power to be able to personally decide how to spend his time, and were a shift in class to occur, the very same man would find himself in a very different situation.

limeade17,,,"It's shortsighted to view unpaid work simply as a relationship between the two partners of a household. Unpaid work (done primarily by women) goes ignored in economic analysis and thus the power of the work and the worker is ignored, even though it adds value to the economy (getting fed is nice, as is not catching diseases because you are clean, or being raised from birth). You, of course, are a shining example of the how the system ignores the contributions made by unpaid work to the family and to society. Amartya Sen pointed out that women’s contribution to the family livelihood is perceived to be smaller 
than it actually is, due to stereotypes of men as the chief or sole breadwinner. This gap between real and perceived contribution perpetuates inequality between women and men, because it fundamentally weakens women’s bargaining power in marriage and the family.

If you read about it in the scholarly literature you get lots of paragraphs like this:

&gt;All this has huge implications for international development policy, as well as women’s rights. During 
the ‘lost decade’ of the 1980s, feminist economists argued that the blindness of conventional 
economists to women’s unpaid work was very convenient. It enabled the international institutions 
that imposed structural adjustment policies on developing countries to ignore the true suffering of 
women, men and families due to cutbacks in state provision of essential services. Backs to the wall, 
women struggled – and just about succeeded – in replacing these services and keeping families afloat.

The devaluation of women's home work also allows for systematic devaluation of women's labor economy work- the result of which is lower wages in the workforce. To say that unpaid work is ""never relevant to the topic"" requires an extraordinary level of cognitive dissonance.

I don't even really understand what argument you are trying to make with your last couple paragraphs- you are honestly trying to say that Congress is not an institution run by men? When we literally just had a week where an all male panel testified about birth control? If any argument is bullshit it is surely your argument that all women vote in their own interest and thus congress cannot be sexist. Many women are happy for a pat on the head from the existing power structure, and who can blame them, and thus obviously not all of them will vote for what would truly be in their best interest. When you exist under an already functioning institution of power like patriarchy you are not free to exercise in your self-interest the way you would in a vacuum free of power.

No one is trying to say that women are claiming to have a patent on systematic discrimination. The new waves of feminism have given structure and voice to many many forms of oppression (race, gender, class, able bodied, etc.). If you want to honestly critique a basic idea like unpaid work you should spend two seconds reading one of the many many scholarly resources on the subject, instead of setting up a straw man and watching it burn and giving yourself a pat on the back.",0,1330367232,,,0,c3vjrzc,t3_q89lk,2.0,t1_c3vjb8g,2454,1435737475,8,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1289316546.0,t2_4i8nx

grandmasrodeo,,,"I had a long, intense conversation with my boyfriend about the American Apparel ads. He believes that they are better than ""normal"" ads because of the lack of touch-ups, thus showing more natural looking women. He also thinks that it's better for the CEO, Don Charney, to be open about sexuality in the ads rather than pretending to be naive about it.  
My argument is that the touch-ups are not the problem. The problem is the type of photography itself, where it is extremely voyeuristic, and the girls are posed in very passive, one might even same susceptible poses. I also have a huge problem with his argument about being open about sexuality. Let's remember who that is: an older, white male who's subjects are young, innocent-looking females.   
Frankly, I find these ads more disgusting than a normal Cosmo ad.

The rapper talks with dream hampton about his now-infamous XXL video and what he has learned from the backlash 
http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/too-short-interview

&gt;Too $hort: ...when I taped the XXL video, my goal was that this was some kind of comedy piece. So I am sitting there and the thing that I am saying is actually reminiscent of when we as little boys were being bad and (what) we were doing something or learning or practicing. But know I'm understanding that it's actually it’s a form of sexual assault. And it's crazy that I'm just now understanding this.

&gt;I’m not going to lie to you…my eyes are opening just from reading the comments, the stuff that is coming from people. They say stuff like, “Does he get it?” I’m reading it and I am starting to get it. I am looking at this and I am looking at all the stuff that they put out, completely from the entertainment industry, from the movies I watched when I was a kid. A rape scene in a movie was pretty normal. They don’t really do it that much anymore, (but) back then a guy would take it and the girl would enjoy it. They put those images out there over and over again and it’s like so much society is ok with the images of aggressive male and female sexuality. I’m just reading this and I’m reading that, and I’m like I am so much a part of that whole “man” thing.

&gt;…in my mind, I’m not a rude guy who just goes around calling women “b*tch” but at this point, this is not just a wake up call to let go and do something good. I have been doing good, I have a track record. I have been doing good in the community with the kids around the Bay Area. Just being involved with the programs around here. The message that is missing (for me) is about this whole aggressive sexual thing. It is entertainment to me. I have been saying that for a long time. I have been making money off of it. I could have spoke about what I really believed in, I could have been a Tribe Called Quest or KRS-One type artist, but I knew if I just write these little curses, people would want to hear that.

Stating that a 5-year old may have GID does nothing in terms of altering that childs life, especially if the parents are already allowing the child to express their gender.  No decisions about actually changing the child physically would be brought up until they near puberty, at which point you will have had 7+ years to view and further assess the desires of the child.  

The only change that would come from a diagnosis such as that, is possibly convincing parents to let their child explore their identity.  It sounds like in the case of this article, the parents were already allowing their child to do that.  Really it feels like the diagnosis is more for the parents so they are aware of what they could be dealing with, and less for the child in question.

But then, I've often wondered about how effective advertising that doesn't convey really new information really is.

For example, does advertising for Coke or Pepsi really affect sales in any way at all?  Most people who drink soda have a strong preference for one brand or another, I doubt strongly that a person who prefers Coke will try Pepsi due to an ad.  And people who have no preference generally take whatever is available.

From an abortion standpoint there are, basically, three groups.

1) People who are, or lean, pro-choice.

2) People who are, or lean anti-choice.

3) People who have not formed any particular opinion.

Group 2 might, possibly, become a bit more involved if they see a dismembered fetus, but they may also get irked at the thought of kids seeing the ad and being squicked.

It seems unlikely to me that even the more wavering members of group one would be pushed to neutrality or anti-choice positions by a gross out ad.

Which leaves group three.  Are they more grossed out than anything, and thus pushed away from the anti-choice position, or do the dismembered feti engage their empathy and drag them to the anti-choice position?

Yes, they are. It's being marketed that way. That's what pisses me off. Women are often being told by the people marketing this surgery that it IS for men. As a man, from a man's perspective, I would like for women to know--don't undertake this surgery on my account. That was kinda my whole point. I'll continue to broadcast that opinion to anyone who will listen. 

Many interviews that I have seen have young, sometimes *very* young adolescent women concerned that men see them as ugly, unclean, or any number of things that largely just aren't true. These women are being preyed upon by those exploiting a teen's often fragile self-image.

letsgocrazy,,,"&gt; Personally it is hard for me to understand how some people need such a reminder

It's not that I needed a reminder - like most people I internalise feelings into thoughts without having to emotionally relive them every time I recall the memory.

I am still more than capable of feeling compassionate towards people - however, this way of presenting an idea, I feel, was particularly strong - remember, these ideas have to reach people who have clearly not internalised that kind of feeling.

In particular I was thinking of how uncomfortable I felt recently when I visited a doctor for a urinary blockage - the waiting, the ""I'm going to just have to shove a finger up your arse"" (unexpectedly, but what are you going to do? rebook?), having to talk about personal aspects of my life etc.

Even when you go for your occasional STD screening, you're sitting answering personal questions to a stranger - no matter how nice they are.

Even with the best staff and the nicest environment it's not nice. 

It doesn't even have to be about abuse at all - it's just, like, well, that kind of thing isn't top of everyone's fun-time list.

So coercing people into having worse stuff done at a particularly vulnerable time is shitty.

&gt; When I read another article about this ""debate"" I feel it in my bones, the wrong that the politicians and affiliated organizations are doing to women - my friends and my family. 

I really sympathise. You know, I can't say I've been as close to that kind of suffering - but trust me, even with my limited experience I can tell you that the laws disgust me too, and I can feel their wrongness in my bones as well.

It honestly breaks my heart that in a country that thinks it's number one, it really is stuck in the dark ages and there are so many people that willfully march lock-step with this institutional perversion.

I'm actually a bit amazed that it's even possibly to suggest shit like this.

Anyway, back on topic.

I certainly hope the actions of of the female politicians that came up with this counter proposal hit home with a lot of men who might not have been reached another way.

[deleted],,,"Yeah I completely understand your reaction and I am glad that the bill has gotten at least one person to really *feel* what it is like to have your body scrutinized and told you don't know what's best for yourself.

Personally it is hard for me to understand how some people need such a reminder, but I also have A LOT of personal bias that many don't.  Most of my young friends and older family friends (as well as members of my immediate family) have been raped, assaulted or molested in their lifetime and so I have always had a present reminder of how it feels to have undergone such an assault on the self.  I have also always kept in mind that it would only take one rapist without a condom to leave a friend or family member with something much worse than an emotional scar - a living breathing person brought into the world at the hands of a criminal and a political system that would force a victim to live with a reminder of that horrific event for the rest of her life.  

Now, I know people say there's adoption, or that some people do love their children borne out of such terrible circumstances, but not all people are able to do it.  This argument often doesn't cover women terminating due to birth defects, dangerous pregnancies, results from incest or other youth molestations, or an underage or ill-prepared woman.

This also doesn't even include women that *need* BC in order to curb severe cycles, hormonal imbalances, or other medical problems.  For myself I take it in order to calm my PCOS symptoms and without it I would be having 2 months without a period, then a month-long heavy flow.  Not to mention the cramps so bad that I wanted to die and migraines that would last for days.  My symptoms without BC are so bad that there is no way I would have been able to do half of what I've accomplished today. 

I'm sorry for the rant.  I guess my point is that familiarity with people that could have had their futures ~~jeopardized~~ destroyed because of such laws makes me a lot more angry and upset than someone that maybe hasn't been as close to such a large amount of wronged women (and men as well if we are talking generally about abuse and molestation).  When I read another article about this ""debate"" I feel it in my bones, the wrong that the politicians and affiliated organizations are doing to women - my friends and my family.  

I think it's because I've felt their pain when talking to me about their experiences, I've seen their triggers because of the events, and I've cried with them as they expressed their thankfulness for the people that were able to end the unplanned pregnancies caused by those atrocities.

The growing collaboration between the U.S. religious Right and conservative Christians internationally benefits each, and both threaten the pursuit of human rights.

&gt;We urge you to study the presence of anti-human rights forces in your country, so that you and your allies closely monitor and regularly challenge their work.

&gt;During 30 years of studying the U.S. Right, we have developed some rules of the road for activists challenging the Right that can apply as well to the Right internationally:

&gt;&gt;Do not imagine Christianity or any other religion to be monolithic. Try to examine each situation with a researcher’s dispassionate eye.

&gt;&gt;Do not generalize and demonize the followers of right-wing leaders. Their motives are complex and it will do no good to denigrate or insult them.

&gt;&gt;Remember that, while not all money is dirty money, enriching oneself with public funds should be exposed, even when the corrupt individual supports human rights goals.

&gt;&gt;It can be enlightening and educational for people to learn the theological, ideological, financial, and valid critiques of the organizations that have attracted them. That may be new information for them.28

&gt;We believe that democracy thrives where people defend human rights and honor justice as a collective goal of society. ",0,1330921308,,,0,c3xrr0l,t3_qi3u1,1.0,t3_qi3u1,172,1435734196,1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1220919695.0,t2_38lau

While the legal stuff definitely should be addressed, I couldn't get passed the extraordinary amount of hate that tainted almost every thread I dared read. Even a man who seemed well spoken and reasonable in other respects suggested that r/mensrights should stop attacking r/feminisms because they were ""the enemy"" and therefore a lost cause. 

Not because it was wrong, not because it further enforced the notion that they are a hate group, but because WE (women or feminists to be exact) were the enemy somehow. 

Both I and my husband are shocked. I read him some of the things I read on r/mensrights to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding the point of the men who spoke. He was possibly more outrage then I was, but then again, he's never been through a divorce or custody battle, so he has no reason to hate women. 

I do not understand how men, in this day and age, when in some countries women are actually forced to wear head-to-toe coverings and are forbidden to drive under penalty of DEATH, can actually view women as a force that is somehow oppressing them.  My mind is boggled. 

As for the leader of this men's movement, I wonder if he even thought about how setting himself on fire would effect his 4 year old daughter. Even if he couldn't ever see her again she's going to hear about how her father died and probably blame herself. It saddens me greatly to think that ultimately the children will suffer because their Dad decided an unfortunate accident leading to the loss of custody was actually a precursor to war, proving (to me anyways) that he truly was a completely unfit parent.

I just have a few concerns:

I'm not exactly sure of the process here, but what would one have to do to prove sexual assault that they wouldn't have to do to prove verbal assault or physical assault (that didn't leave a wound, or left a wound that already healed)?

&gt; If you can imagine what it would feel like to be seen as a sexual object rather than a subject ...

Yeah, this mainly is the problem here.  Because of our socialization, women are taught from almost every angle that they are objects and men are taught from almost every angle that they are subjects.  This causes problems when subjective people don't try and empathize with the objective crowd, and the other way around.  It leads to too-simple 'solutions' like ""Well don't wear attractive clothing"" and ""Well don't hit on a drunk person"" that are hardly helpful.

It raises even more issues when you realize that while that may be the majority, there are objective males and subjective females, and they do go together.  At the same time, there are male-male relationships, and female-female relationships where the stereotypes either become more defined or just can't keep up.  When you bring in transgender, genderqueer, and other complications, it all becomes a bit much.

While some people think that these fringe groups don't matter because they are too hard to help, I know that this is where the worst damage is being done.  These people simply have nowhere to turn for protection, advice, or if they are aggressing, punishment and correction.

I *completely* understand where feminists are coming from on the issue, and very many MRAs would agree.

JohnAdamZiolkowski,,,"&gt; When we imagine a rape accusation on a campus or in a workplace setting, we generally imagine a woman accusing a man.

This could accurately represent the state of affairs, but the numbers are at least a little bit affected by the sexist definitions of rape and sexual harassment, the sexist handling practices when males come forward, and most importantly society's notion that only females do get raped.  Who is more likely to be a victim is not absolutely important.  The protections should be gender-neutral and serve everyone.

While I can't imagine the torture it must be to prove that you didn't want to be raped to the judge, the jury, and everyone paying attention, saying that they shouldn't have to deal with that is a recipe for disaster.  In any sort of crime, you have to be proven guilty.  You can not be put away for something that you didn't do.  If power is given to those to change the entire judicial system to ""guilty until proven innocent"", then that gives a free pass to inflict great amount of societal harm to anyone who would be willing to use it.

In the context of our ""only women can be victims"" and ""only men can be perps"" society, *that* is going to result in absolute sexism.  The difference between your claim and my claim is that the innocent don't get punished in my idealistic world, and the guilty are adequately punished.  In yours, the innocent can be put away for nothing, the accusers are encouraged to do so by law, and the actual victims of rape are bunched together with the liars and discredited as a whole.",0,1331750885,,,0,c410h1v,t3_qvh2g,8.0,t1_c410b01,814,1428525393,0,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,,

When we imagine a rape accusation on a campus or in a workplace setting, we generally imagine a woman accusing a man.

I am a big advocate for being honest when the data supports a similar picture for both genders. For example, I get shit from some feminists I know because I stick to my guns that non-sexual domestic abuse is almost as common for men as it is for women. That's what the data says. But the data also says that women are victims of sexual crimes in far greater numbers than men. (my source is the British Crime Survey, the Scottish Crime Survey (over several years) and the recent American CDC study)

I don't think we can just ignore that context. Nor the context that rapes are rarely reported, and that those who report rape have to go through a horrendous process of being questioned and disbelieved. It is from the perspective of seeing that process and how it can tear a person up that adding the possibility of legal action if the cops decide they can ""prove"" you were lying seems simply horrific, unthinkable.

This is a perspective that women, being more often the victims of sexual crimes, are more likely to develop than men, just as men are more likely to have a fear of false accusation and develop a perspective from there. But we cannot simply dismiss the experiences of women like that.

Keep in mind most of the ones who support the claim make the distinction between guilty and not guilty.  It isn't one-or-the-other.  If the court can't prove either is guilty, then neither are punished.

* False rape claims hurt the accused, who go to jail, lose their jobs, get placed on a registry list, and way too often kill themselves.
* False rape claims hurt the actual raped, for their claims get looked down upon as a whole.

carolinax,,,"&gt;The fact that many 12 year olds are pressured by their families and agents to enter the industry, or are poached from problematic situations in economically suffering countries, compounds these problems.

The same can be said of 18 year old models from around the world/Eastern Europe, in addition to tweenage girls who go into modeling with the support of their parents and healthy mentoring within the industry. I'm not sure where you were going with that. I brought tweenage models because somehow 10 year olds shouldn't be photographed, and yet Karlie Kloss can become a sensation at 13.

&gt; Fashion photography is a very different animal from portraiture/fine art, however artful the photography may be. 

That nude model was on the cover of an publicly-funded, and publicly available art magazine. Sure, it was in protest to other censorship, but is using a child's body to convey your message of protest any more ""pure"" than using a child's body to sell a product? You can bullshit yourself, but you can't bullshit me.

&gt;The industry is based on enhancing sex appeal and buyability of a product.

Also, art is it's own product. I wouldn't be surprised if some of those portraits were for sale at the gallery. 

&gt;Even if the photographer's intent were 100% ""pure,"" you have to be aware of the audience you're releasing your work into.

Who's the largest buying demographic of fashion magazines? Women. 

&gt;Legitimizing imagery that sexualizes children because the photographer ""didn't mean it"" makes it more okay for other instances where the child was coerced, abused, exploited.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold your speedy horses. In no way shape or form am I [legitimizing](http://feministactivism.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/creepy-sexualization-of-children1.jpg?w=490) anything that blatantly [sexualizes](http://www.feministfatale.com/tag/sexualizing-children/) children. 

I agree with you when you say that the work we do doesn't exist in a vacuum. However, we can't go about blowing things so dramatically out of the water that you lose perspective of what we're actually dealing with here. This model isn't being coerced into this because there's waaayy too much publicity on her. If she was really doing these things against her will, she wouldn't be doing them for long. Everything else you describe is CP. I don't think **anything** legitimizes CP. 

&gt;You can't look at these photographs like they magically exist on their own and ignore who they were made for, who will see them, and how it relates to everything else on the market.

I'm curious to know who you believe will be the primary viewers of these images? They're made to be viewed by the target market, women if the images are published in a women's fashion magazine. In her glamorous photo shoot the underlying message was fashion's obsession with youth. Placing a child in adult's clothes only shows how ridiculous the situation is getting in the industry. 

I get it. I do. It's fucked up when little girls are made to look and act like they're much older. There's plenty of time for that later. But implying that a photo of a kid with messy, tousled hair, a blank expression, and an open mouth will suddenly launch the ships of a thousand pedos (because this is what *everyone* is concerned about, even me to a small degree) is so remarkably hilarious **because pedophiles will salivate over any attractive child.** Weird huh? We're all concerned. But let's be a bit more reasonable about this *particular* situation.

You can't draw a perfect analogy between a septuagenarian and a child, as senior citizens are desexualized in our culture and seen as sexually inert. Seeing a child in a grown up woman's clothing, hinting at nudity, is seen as sexually suggestive and taboo.

You can't just ignore cultural context and say ""I don't see it."" Even if you don't see it, cultural precedent exists.

I personally see the very first photo of the model as the most sexualized, with a woman's blown-out ""sex hair"" hairdo and smoldering eyes, etc. The rest are debatable.

OK, so, most Orthodox Jew--men and women--cover their collarbones, elbows, and knees. Women wear skirts and men where pants. Colours etc. are fine. (There's one infamously crazy, but not quite Haredi, text that places strict limits of what colour hearts may be on clothing, if red is inherently wrong, etc.) After marriage, Orthodox women cover their hair, either with wigs or with tichels (scarves) or snoods. (Men cover their heads at all times with a kippah or with a hat). 

Most Haredi groups severely disapprove of colour--it attract the eye--which is part of the reason Haredi men are big fans of the black-n-white, and why women tend to stick to blues and greys and blacks. (Satmar is the most extreme example for women, with solid black stockings at all times, solid black shawls to help hide their figure, long LONG black skirts, and black caps to hide their bald heads--they shave their heads rather than let one strand show. Other Haredi groups see the black stockings as immodest because they draw attention to the leg. I am not kidding. Haredi fashion, man!).

Haredi groups also have very very strict neckline requirements for women (not so much for men, which is bull, modesty requirements are almost equal for men and women) and sleeve length requirements (often going to the wrist). 

So that school is perfectly modest by 90% of Jews' opinions, the problem being that the crazy ultra-Orthodox Jews are giving those women crap just for being out of the house and in their line of sight.

This is especially despicable because there's a principle in Jewish law that you shouldn't embarrass people publicly. Most Orthodox Jews won't shake hands with someone of the opposite sex, but there's a few important responza that say it is better to shake the hand and avoid embarrassing the other person than to make any sort of big deal out of it. The idea that people would go out of their way to embarrass and humiliate people is shameful. But then again, Haredim also violate the Shabbat by stoning cars that drive through their neighbourhoods, so my respect for them is as low as possible.

Kikar HaShabbat, where the protests took place, is in a heavily ULTRA-Orthodox (hereafter Haredi) neighbourhood of Jerusalem. It's very close to Meah Shearim, a neighbourhood where tourists (including some friends of mine) can have rocks thrown at them, have glue poured over them, etc. It's also close to Geulah, a more moderate Haredi/right-leaning Orthodox neighbourhood, There are semi-regular 'modesty patrols' of Haredi Jews (often from Mea Shearim) asking people to dress modestly. (Geulah is still popular for religious shoppers). 

In short, it's the Crazy Pants capital of Jerusalem. Pretty much any Jew who isn't Haredi thinks they're absolutely nuts. (Of course, Rabbis saying that [this is insanity](http://www.aish.com/jw/s/An_Open_Letter_to_the_Beit_Shemesh_Spitter.html?mobile=yes&amp;c=y) don't get as much press).

Maristic,,,"I'm fairly mistrustful of the author on this.

First, lego has targeted girls before, with their [Belville line](http://belville.lego.com), so Lego isn't really trailblazing new ground in saying “Let's target girls”. Better journalism would have been to see how successful that line has been and/or to talk about what's new this time around.

Second, the article cites a pretty dubious/flawed study. Rebecca Jordan hits it pretty hard in her book [_Brain Storm: The Flaws in the Science of Sex Differences_](http://www.amazon.com/No-I-Dont-Want-A-Goddam-Kindle-Amazon-But-Thanks-For-Asking-For-The-Thousandth-Time/dp/0674057309). I'm doing this from memory, but if I remember correctly, first, the study isn't blind, so it's problematic for that reason since it's prone to observer bias. Second, their classification of toys into girls/boys/neutral is very bizarre and seems to be done exactly to show a sex difference. 

Incidentally, Rebecca Jordan's book is pretty eye opening, but it's a bit of a slog. Cordelia Fine's [_Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference_](http://www.cordeliafine.com/delusions_of_gender.html) is a bit more readable. Both will outrage you at how bad science can be eagerly swallowed by people (scientist and non-scientist alike) only to happy to have their prejudices confirmed.

linuxlass,,,"&gt;They may enjoy building, but they favor role play. So it’s bye-bye Bionicles, hello princesses. 

How does this even follow?  My daughter does role play, but she has a collection of realistic hard rubber animals, as well as a wooden pirate ship with wooden people. She sometimes used her stuffed animals (mostly beanie babies) in her stories, but usually not.  I recall hearing lots of exclamations and growls eminating from her room when she was 4-6 years old.  

She's 11 now, and likes dragons. She's tried several times to make dragons that can glide, and she's writing a ""book"" involving dragons - her friends enjoy reading each chapter as she finishes it. This Christmas, we gave her a couple of hard rubber dragons to add to her animals. :)

Furthermore, my son, who is definitely more stereotypically ""boy"", nevertheless loved sparkly, shiny, and soft things as a kid. More often than not, he used his legos to build houses with elaborate gardens (he bought a bunch of flowers and trees and vines from ebay with his allowance), and used the translucent colored blocks to build elaborate structures that he could then put a light inside. These days, he's really into computer programming with pygame, but also spends a lot of time creating graphics and 3D models for his games.

We limited our kids' exposure to plastic and commercialized toys, and encouraged open-ended play.  The shiny sparkly stones my son liked as a little kid became ""gems"" in a shopkeeper game he played with his sister when he was a little older. The Christmas lights in his room became parts for electrical circuits he would build with batteries. My daughter loved playing ""slave catcher"" (a Redwall-inspired game) and sword fighting with sticks, and building a house with a ""thatched roof"" in the backyard with her brother, and when he outgrew these games, she became best friends with a boy and they ride bikes and wander in the ""woods"" near our house and explore the creek.

She's never worn a dress or skirt in her life, but when she had to wear something black for her band concert and I said she could have either pants or a skirt, she chose a skirt.

Probably not as well as it would have if he just kept going for the jobs he really wanted. If you talk to tons of girls, sure, you're more likely to get a ""yes"", but the chance of meeting someone you really click with is diminished because of the bigger ""net"" you're putting out. 

Clearly this is not the best analogy ever, and in no way am I trying to suggest that talking to a woman is the same as putting in a job application, but as far as numbers go it about evens out to the same basic principle. 

I genuinely don't believe that every guy that interrupts a woman reading is a total ass/jerk/whatever, but I also think the point has to be raised that sometimes women occupy themselves specifically not be approached.

And I'm being pretty hypothetical, I never ride trains or buses, or even elevators. I'm rarely ever in situations where people are ""stuck"" with me. 

I was just brainstorming a numbers game type thing. Like, I've heard that those guys that have lot's of success with girls, get shot down by 100 for every girl they have success with. That kind of method having great success, means that they are actually rewarded for bothering you, in the long run. That's all I was saying.

As a single guy, I should hit on every single girl I see in some way. I personally don't have the type of personality for that kind of thing. And that 100 gets you 1 thing isn't a guarantee. 100 could get you nothing. 1,000 can get you nothing too.

sonnyclips,,,"Certainly, I think the implication though that ""atheists believe x"" though is a logically flawed premise given that the defining characteristic of atheists is that they do not believe in god. That they/we would have anything in common is illogical. It would be like saying that women are a group because they lack penises, which I think we can agree is unacceptable.

Having said that I would reiterate a point that got me kicked out of r/manhoodacademy. Sexism, internalized in the case of these young men that victimized this young woman, is a problem for us all. It is  difficult to lead a successful life carrying such attitudes. But sexism has always been crippling for men as well as women. 

Indeed seeing it as such is a much more honest and persuasive means of moving past it. The psychological isolation that comes with these attitudes perverts adherents, whether they are men or women. You can see it in the colonized minds of Concerned Women of America as much as you see it in the leadership of the Catholic Church.

.... Let me put the shoe on the other foot, for a moment. Let's suppose you had been abused as a child. Statistically, the largest amount of child abuse happens at the hands of women. It would be *entirely* inappropriate for there to be a campaign stating that ""Women can prevent child abuse"" because it would be directed at ALL women, not just the scumbags who are abusers.

Maybe now stories like mine will start showing up on those big, national studies about rape and assault. Maybe police and people on the street will start taking victims of rape more seriously, regardless of their gender. Maybe what happened to me will stop being ""funny"" to society at large.

letsgocrazy,,,"&gt; If the immediate reaction to seeing a female is ""flirt at her"", then that's a sign that the community has a problem

I think it's a sign that the individual has a problem. It's frowned upon in real life, it's frowned upon in the community, it's frowned upon anywhere - and realistically, who think they are likely to pull after making some comment about a woman in a Reddit?

No one except an utterly immature person.

But immaturity is the problem - and I bet their immaturity manifests in many other ways as well. 

Think of all the other non gender politics based issues that Reddit has with members of it's own community - for example:

A while ago someone posted a page of reddit from xa mount of years ago - remarking how clean it was, no puns, rage comics etc.

So halfway through some comments someone said something that sounded like a quote from a  film, then someone quoted the film, then someone else did - and they were all upvoted.

As serious discussion about conduct within the community gradually being eroded by pointless junk idiotic behaviour.

I pointed out that it was *this* kind of thing that was ruining Reddit - making the signal to noise ratio too low.

Of course, I was told I didn;t know how to have fun, what else was the internet for etc.?

So my point is this - the immature idiots who have no sense of community or respect for others are like that in all aspects of life.

Think of the kind of idiots you might have gone to college with: Play loud music, keep the place a mess, not really interested in studying, quick to anger, friendly, stupid, casually racist, casually sexist, late on rent blah blah blah.

These are the people who can sit there and ignorantly make comments to women in forums... and you know what - they probably don't ""hate"" women for being women, the are just immature.

It makes me wonder if they thought that I was going to be like ""Sure! Have a grope! She'll never know!"". 

I guess that's the shit that goes on pretty regularly, that no one involved wants to talk about. People should talk about it more though. It's really hard for those of us who are not that way to know when someone else is going to be that way. I feel like I got to see a glimpse of a really ugly part of humanity that night. It was pretty shocking, and it shouldn't be. People in a given situation who are capable of action, be it telling someone to knock it off, keeping someone who is vulnerable company, calling the cops, whatever it may be should know more about this dark undercurrent of the world. Because if we don't understand the problem it's really hard to be part of the solution.

People who have the drive and will to through themselves out of closet are also more willing to be risky in general than those that have not, so these results are probably skewed because all the timid, careful LGBT teens who don't get pregnant are also not openly gay yet, perhaps even to themselves.

As an aside, almost all the gay women I happen to know socially have children from relationships they had with men from before they settled into who they really where, whom they really loved, and none of them were teen moms, yet not all of them really choose to have children, and often they get divorced and out of the closet while their children are still young.

egypturnash,,,"&gt; People are able to insert themselves into the stories as Bella because she isn't a character so much as a template.

Have you ever read McCloud's ""Understanding Comics""? There's a whole chapter on the power of this same technique in a visual form - having simply drawn main characters to enable reader identification is one of the major things McCloud cited as a hallmark of Japanese comics compared to American ones. (This was back before the generation of kids raised on Pokemon were old enough to be pro creators.) And this is in one of *the* books on comics-as-an-art-form. There is *definitely* some worth in being aware of the power of having your lead character be a shallow template for readers to project themselves into - ie, a ""Mary Sue"" or a ""Gary Stu"".

I am not saying it's necessarily a *good* thing that Twilight (or Harry Potter, which I found to be nigh-unreadable) is so damn popular. But what's there to learn? What *is* going right in these books? What are they doing that transcends crude prose and plotting so handily, and how can I as a creator bring some of that to my theoretically-better-crafted work?

(We will ignore the fact that one of the things these works have going for them is a GARGANTUAN MARKETING CAMPAIGN. What do they have that made them into something someone was WILLING to put one of those together for?)

Crap, I think I just talked myself into reading Twilight. TO THE TORRENTS.

And honestly the more I think about it the more I am coming to think that the two main things that make a Mary Sue are (1) being badly-written and (2) being a female self-insert character. Thus, about half of the list of ""crimes"" committed by a Mary Sue are mostly ""the things a young woman would be interested in writing about"" without the all-important caveat that these are also the things a COMPETENT female writer might be interested in, except a good writer would be able to write them better, and remember to give her character some flaws that come back to bite her on the ass. And the other half of a Sue's ""crimes"" are to be *super-awesome* and to have various signifiers of her *super-awesomeness* - again, all executed poorly and without any restraint. Which is a crime that TONS of beginning authors perpetrate - but when boys do this, we just tell them that their writing sucks and maybe offer suggestions on how to suck less, we don't tell them that their writing sucks in part because *they're writing about what they're programmed to be interested in by some combination of nature and/or nurture*, and suggest that part of how they can suck less is to *not write about that*. Which is kinda what the whole concept of ""Mary Sue"" has ended up saying.

And let's be honest, if you write a story about characters who have NONE of the ""traits"" of being a Mary/Gary Sue/Stu in any amount... you've written one of those short stories that shows up in the *New Yorker*. And given that the context of the original post is talking about COMICS and using BATMAN as an example, well, fuck a whole bunch of that tedium, bring on the superpowers/dramatic pasts/angsty presents/dark destinies/world-saving/etc, let me briefly fantasize about *having enough power to actually change the world* before I get back to worrying about my job/divorce/kids/mortgage/etc.

egypturnash,,,"This is a really, really interesting piece. I need to think about ""Mary Sue"" for a while.

(Though as a tool for making Interesting Stories, Mary/Gary is still worth using - if everything is going too easy for your character, it's time to throw in some conflict, whether it be due to the consequences of their own actions, or external events. And let them fail now and then. It's worth running down things like [the Mary Sue test](http://www.ponylandpress.com/ms-test.html) as well, to see how many clichés you're using, and think about which ones you might want to turn inside-out... but on the other hand, the minute you begin saying ""this character is more awesome than a normal person and it would be totally awesome to meet/be them"" you start getting major ""sueness""; I for one LIKE reading and writing about larger-than-life characters who I would like to either hang out with or be if they were real - I don't want to spend time in my imagination with a mundane person I don't like!)

Honestly I feel like the main thing that distinguishes a Mary Sue from a ""good character"", besides the ""it's a female lead"" that the article is about, is that a Sue is poorly written and doesn't have any flaws. That's it. Write her well, give her a few flaws that actually have consequences, and she's not a ""Sue"" any more. Bad writing is bad writing; people love to mock Rob Liefield's nineties comics creations and man those guys would score high on the Sue test - but some of them have been picked up by people who can actually WRITE, and have found personality beyond ""roid rage with a big gun and/or katanas"". And guess what? Teen boys ate up the original super-Sueworthy stuff when Liefield was doing it.

Which I guess is a roundabout way of saying, yeah, why the fuck DO we need a special term for ""badly written female self-insertion characters"" when (a) a badly written self-insertion character can RAKE IN THE BUCKAROOS sometimes (Liefield, Twilight, Harry Potter, James Bond...) and (b) people who have developed some skill in critiquing narrative can recognize a badly written self-insertion character regardless of gender?

BowlingisnotNam,,,"I don't get this one.  She is reduced, because in this little tidbit of her life, she supposedly thinks that looking healthy (good in lycra) is a positive point in being healthy (which is what the commercial is about.  Not necessarily true, but thats a different matter).

Why would you disrespect her by calling this focused point in her life (her diet) as her defining characteristic?  I assume thats what whoever wrote the review was meaning, that this dumb little commercial somehow disregards anything and everything she has ever accomplished because it focuses on what she eats and why.  

She wants to be healthy and look good.  Are we supposed to punish her, or even the ad, because it makes a simplified point about a simplified aspect of her life?  Its not a biography, it isn't trying to be exhaustive of every aspect/characteristic of her life. 

Why would this be reductionary?  The problem isn't that things don't always (read: almost never) make a full and honest depiction of someone as a person, its that you've decided that unless it does, it somehow is disrespectful to someone as a person.  I just don't see anyone at fault here except the kind of person who disregards a person's life because one simple little (possibly arbitrary) piece of someone's life is portrayed and you decide that ""reduction"" is happening, because nobody cares about her other characteristics, else they would portray those too.

If I did a commercial this exact same way, in these exact same circumstances, with the exact same background, and you came up and told me that my life was being reduced to a ""woman-on-a-diet,"" I'd tell you to go fuck yourself.  You don't get to decide what defines me and what doesn't, and you certainly don't get to decide for me whether or not to have disdain for a simple fact that sometimes people like to be healthy and look good too. 

EDIT:  I don't understand the downvotes.  Do they mean that I was wrong?  Did the commercial somehow forget to mention that she was a gold medalist?  Or did we see different commercials where the one you saw said ""she may be a gold medal winning athlete, but that doesn't matter because we are going to ignore everything about her because she is what we are going to refer to as ""woman-on-a-diet, because this commercial defines her.""?

I held my breath. I wasn't surprised, but I was saddened to hear such a statement. I wondered what my daughter would say.

She shrugged and said, ""Oh, well I like boy stuff too."" I'm sorry she accepted the ""boy stuff"" categorization her friend made, but delighted that she didn't give one single fuck that her friend thought it wasn't the ""right"" choice based on their sex.

Let's take a look at minimum wage. Let's say a state has a minimum wage set at $8 per hour. Let's say that state decides, based on the cost of living, that minimum wage should be increased to $8.60 per hour. Great for people who make minimum wage. They just received a 7.5% wage increase (I remember the last time I got such a hefty raise, it was nearly 5 years ago now...).

Obviously, all of those people who are working minimum wage jobs are now costing their employers 7.5% more. To recoup these losses, costs go up.

While all of this is going on, let's take a look at someone who is earning $15 per hour in the same state. Do you think they are going to get a 7.5% 'cost of living' increase? Hell no they aren't. In a good year, companies will give a cost of living increase of 2-3%, and in recent economic times, it isn't uncommon to see no cost of living increase. This person just saw their 'real wages' fall.

While all of this is going on, the owner of the company gives them self a nice bonus, netting 20% more than they did last year, their pay goes from $100,000 to $120,000. The increase reflects more than what their lowest paid worker earns in a year, and about 75% of what their 'average' $15/hour employee is earning in a year.

It's perfectly fine to enjoy Doctor Who as adventure sci-fi, AND recognize that the show might benefit from a slightly more feminist viewpoint.

Science fiction and fantasy have always been a rather male dominated subculture.

[deleted],,,"&gt; ""I'm a kissogramme,"" Amy revealed, dramatically, ""I go to parties and I kiss people, it's a laugh."" The Doctor just looked on in horror. 

Of course he did. He still considers her a child, because he just finished getting to know her as a child. He's also got a bit of an asexual streak running through him, so it all makes him uncomfortable (see the conversation about pregnancy in A Good Man Goes to War).

&gt;I had thought she was an inspiring police woman. 

Then you're a laughable idiot, author. Real policewomen don't wear short skirts and fishnets as a part of their uniform. Further, admirable, strong characters aren't built with cookie cutters. Personal strength and virtuousness come from places other than one's face-value societal role.

&gt;From the Doctor's disbelief at Amy's job to the knowing looks of the old lady

It's taboo. Amy's home life just crossed into her work life. Awkward/funny!

&gt;The shot placed her firmly in the category of 'sex object': just a pair of legs and a sexy uniform. [...] On one hand, clearly Amy and her uniform were there to be sexualised. 

Right, because if someone is physically sexy, that whole person is a sex object and nothing more, right? Never mind that Amy's sexuality was *immediately* made only a *section* of her character *by* the addition of the ""kissogram""-job dividing line, as the fact that she gets paid to be treated as a bit of an object means there's more to her; and of course, never mind that she is also a sexual objectifier, shown when the Doctor changes clothes later in the same episode. 

&gt; In Doctor Who there is often a lack of direction in life for the female leads. It's very disappointing to see character after character not have any aspirations. The female characters are portrayed as strong women; they're brave and often save the day, but wouldn't it would be better if they had careers or at least some aspirations in life to accompany this?

It works sometimes (as said, with Martha), but to give all the characters careers and direction would immediately downplay the Doctor's dramatic influence. The lack of direction is so we can watch the Doctor help those who need it *find* direction. The 'companion' role is usually filled by a female to create a gender balance with the Doctor. Companions are *not* directionless because they are female.

&gt;Unfortunately the writers chose to make Martha fall in love with the Doctor. This unrequited love eventually caused Martha to leave the show. Making her ultimately defined by her relationship to a man. 

How the hell does this work? Do you really think it's this simple? The stress of travelling through space and time AS a doctor (someone who chose a career path of *helping people* which means an increased sense of responsibility for others), of having her family *tortured* for a year that no one remembers, on top of just wanting a normal life for herself and happening to be heterosexual, led her to leave the TARDIS. Everyone leaves at some point. That Martha had a crush on the Doctor does not mean she is ""defined by her relationship to a man."" She's defined by her *strength* and *intelligence.* She also fell in love. That's *fine.*

Do you remember when Martha's fish friend died in *The Doctor's Daugher*? She practically had a contained nervous breakdown. *No more TARDIS for Martha. Martha has PTSD now.*

And hey, what about Jack? That man pined obsessively over the Doctor for *hundreds* of years. He joined Torchwood *to find the Doctor,* after having his directionless life as a career criminal upended by the Doctor's influence. Jack's later 'career' was *defined by* his submissive, romantic (at least on his side) relationship with a man. But that doesn't fit this feminist schema.  I'm not really surprised it was completely left out. But my point is this: **The Doctor severely affects every life he touches, male or female, human or alien.** He's the last of the Time Lords. It's his job. Narratively, he's a sort of demi-god. 

I don't know if I have the energy to keep going with this. I'd be capable of refuting every single point in the piece, I can see that now. But I don't really feel like writing a novel, and I don't really feel like experiencing the full fury that comes with watching someone vivisect the best show on TV to use the useful pieces for misguided sociopolitical gain.

EDIT: Nope, can't even stop here --

&gt; The ultimate achievement of Amy, Donna and Rose was getting a man: married to Rory, engaged to Shaun and fobbed off with the alternate version of the tenth Doctor, respectively. 

So many times, **NO.** The denouement (hero/heroine gets the guy/girl) happens *after* the climax, which is what makes the heroes heroes and the heroines heroines. *Saving the world during the climax* is the ultimate achievement, FFS, just like in any other traditional action/drama narrative, and the women of Doctor Who do a fantastic job of it.

I agree the Dr.'s companions have always had their stereotypical pitfalls. But i feel this article is a bit harsh at times, especially on Amy.

Amy was incredibly strong. I always loved the way she handled rory, and i never felt she was defined by her relationship. If anything Rory was defined by their relationship, why else was he there? except for Amy.

As for River:

&gt;But her life and actions were defined by the Doctor. Her education, the fact that she became an archaeologist, her whole career path was driven by him, she wanted to track him through time. Ultimately, when she knew she'd never see him again, she sacrificed herself to save his life.

This is just a result of Dr. Who being INCREDIBLY escapist, which in all honesty is its appeal. Its just fun. Also lets not forget that her life was defined by her birth, she was created by the Silence To Revolve around the Doctor. If anything she overcame her socialization to make her own choice, what is stronger than that? 

Now i know the whole true love aspect of it is pretty stereotypical and unfortunately is brought up as deus ex machina to tie off story lines. but like I said, Doctor Who is probably the most escapist show on tv.

ThePerdmeister,,,"&gt;an over abundance of these sorts of images have a negative effect on women and men

See, I took that into consideration when I said ""these sorts of images,"" as the images I was referring to were depictions of *current cultural norms*. Also, I have no idea why most r/MR users I speak with seem to assume that I don't have a problem with media depictions of men; to clarify, I *am* sexed male. Also, I've been engaged with critical cultural studies and media theory for the past few years, so while I appreciate your summary of how media works, I'm much more interested in the social influence of the media.

With regards to the bumbling father archetype, yes, I do think it's harmful in that it steers men away from traditionally feminine roles, but I would not make the claim that these depictions have somehow tainted the cultural view of men, making them seem grossly inept. There are enough alternate depictions of empowered men that males everywhere haven't felt any sort of marked drop in competence, and men are still largely employed in traditionally male jobs (that is to say, the high-paying/dangerous/mechanical jobs), and following traditional male roles. In any case, I'd argue the commercial we're discussing has a similar impact to the bumbling father archetype, in that it places the young boy in a position which precludes ""feminine"" traits. When interpellated in the ""manly man"" model, as in truck commercials, again young boys are actively steered away from more passive, traditionally feminine roles. You see, I'm offended by this ad not just as a feminist, but as a man and as an individual in support of gender-equality. These depictions are just as bad, if not *worse* than the bumbling father archetype; since these images aren't portrayed in a comedic light, they appear more edifying, and slip unnoticed into the back of a person's mind. These images actively preclude true human agency in both men and women, so instead of derailing the conversation and bombing the post and comments with downvotes, why don't you try to add a constructive male perspective instead?

And now honestly, I don't even know why an attack was called on this post, since many of my views coincide with yours (or at least, I'd hope they do, since I'm fighting for men too here). Yes, I called out an r/MR user who obviously wasn't critically engaged enough to interpret this video; that doesn't mean I was attacking all of r/mensrights, and in fact, if it wasn't for the rampant and mindless anti-feminist sentiments on the subreddit, I'd have subscribed a long time ago. See, it's not the goal of r/MR that I have a problem with, it's the users' resistance to *all* feminist theory, even those aspects which are relevant to men's rights. If r/MR users would stop commenting on posts like this for the sole purpose of derailing conversations (conversations which would be beneficial for women *and* men), I would not have a problem with them.

*[Also, to avoid any further shitstorm, whenever it seems that I'm speaking in absolutes, I'm only speaking that way for clarity's sake so I don't get bogged down in deconstructive clarification. Yes, I know there are some r/MR users who appreciate feminism, don't bother correcting me. As well, whenever I speak of feminine and masculine traits, I'm speaking from a cultural perspective; I don't actually believe that there are many inherent masculine and feminine traits outside of biology and outside of what we've constructed.]*",0,1324601794,,1.0,0,c3afe2v,t3_nhyhg,6.0,t1_c3aap5s,29211,1428062862,1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1269322788.0,t2_3yei7

Unfortunately that is not likely to be how these laws will be enforced, and limiting liability to third parties ( i.e not the mother ) would still get doctors and abortion practitioners harassed under it.  

The saddest thing about all this is that it means you cannot have sane rules. If you look at Norway or Sweden, we have strict time-limits on abortion ( 12 and 24 weeks in respective countries ) , but it is not a major problem in practice because women here can access a clinic without being harassed, healthcare ( including abortions ) is tax funded, so they can afford it, and hormonal contraceptives are heavily subsidised and available to anybody who doesn't have medical contraindications ( high blood pressure, history of blood clots ... )

geminimindtricks,,,"the thing is, in almost every society here on earth, our hegemony is patriarchal. Meaning that our rulers, thinkers, movers, and shakers are predominantly male (even god is a he). This probably stems from men actually being inferior sexual beings--females are the true rulers of the human race, multiple orgasms, forever sexually potent whereas men have one job, they come and then they're essentially useless. 

  Well imagine how insecure that would make you as a gender group. 

  So it's no surprise that society is now shaped around men, it's one giant global circle-jerk of men trying to make each other feel better about not truly being the superior sex. So now, thousands of years later, this is that manifestation.  The ""I"" of society is a 21-55 year old middle class white male (unless you live somewhere where being white is the ""other"" but for all intents and purposes the ""I"" is white), everybody else is the ""other"", minority, ""special"" but not in a good way, as the title of this post describes.  
  
  I think ""other"" is more fitting though.  That's why the lead character of every movie is a guy. If the main character is a girl, the movie is a ""chick flick"" (practically a special interest), intended specifically for that minority and not for the mainstream audience. 

  Unfortunately, that's the way life is. If you're a woman, you're fucked. Especially if you realize how fucked up it all is. And if you try and explain these concepts anywhere other than in r/feminism or somewhere else where the ""other"" is the ""I"", you get called a feminist as if it's a bad thing and told how ""wrong"" you are for seeing the truth of the matter.  

  I know I got a slight bit off-topic but the bottom line is that, as John Lennon said so eloquently, ""Woman is the nigger of the world"".

It is a holdover for when women could not control their fertility. Society had a division of labor: Women carried and reared children, Men worked often dangerous jobs to support the family, including being the military arm of the state to protect the state and its citizens. Women were protected from subjecting themselves from danger by virtue of men that did the work. This goes all the way back to caveman days. Women are the limiting factor in reproduction, but society still needs some dangerous shit to get done. It was impractical to send just as many women out as men to hunt the mastodon, as the risk of losing a woman had further reaching implications to the future of the tribe. It is an example of a female privilege:not being obligated to danger, yet still reaping the benefits of said protection.

Qender,,,"I'll start by warning you that while I feel like feminists here should be allowed to discuss what is and isn't sexist, and talk about why, it's not a very welcome behavior due to it's similarity with the anti-feminist people who come here to argue. So be careful with the questions.

I think it's ok for men and women to be sexualized. But I think the issue here is that there's an undue amount of pressure on women to be sexualized, insulting them if they're not. These shirts are asserting that the value of a woman is in how openly sexualized they are, and that being modest is an insult. It's not accepting of women being just normal people in that sense.

If there's just a picture of outgoingly sexy woman in public, I don't have a problem with that specific picture, but it's part of a larger trend where there's a lack of modest or normally dressed women represented in media, and also a lack of men.

The end result is that people expect women to dress and behave in an over sexualized manner, and women who don't are mistreated for it.

That being said, I think there's a time and place for women to be sexualized, just like the men. It's not that it's inherently sexist by itself, it's more due to how often it occurs. Kind of like a movie starring a male lead shouldn't be sexist, since men should be able to be stars, but when no movies star women, the trend itself becomes sexist, thereby making each movie a bit of an accomplice",0,1327013149,,,0,c3io5ba,t3_on8yv,2.0,t1_c3ija1a,29657,1428205722,6,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1295573645.0,t2_4r0f9

Firstly, there would not be a seduction community if the manipulative, misogynistic, and cynical attitudes and strategies outlined by PUAs didn't work. If there was absolutely no truth to it, then PUAs would not be PUAs, because no woman would touch them.

Dating and meeting women is scary. Rejection hurts, and is a daily part of life for a man attempting to meet a woman for long term relationship or even a short term fling. Working up the courage to approach a woman (interestingly, I've never been approached by a woman, but this does show an example of a gender role: men are expected to initiate, maybe its because men are wired to want sex more? who knows) then deal with rejection is pretty painful.

tl;dr: I'm not for ""seduction"", but there are a LOT of socially awkward men out there who may never meet a woman, and harmful gender roles have created a society in which it is very difficult for men, particularly less attractive ones, to form a healthy sexual relationship with a woman.

 Women of color and poor women will be hurt most by the foundation&amp;#039;s decision.

 Donating to places like the African American Breast Cancer Alliance or Black Women&amp;#039;s Health Imperative will help these women get the medical attention they need.

Support for *voluntary* euthanasia could easily be combined with opposition to abortion, if one considers life to begin at some point before birth and that there should be some procedures which parents should not be able to consent to on behalf of their children (both fairly normal positions to hold). Voluntary euthanasia is a person's free choice to end his life, abortion contains no choice for the person whose life is ending.

Involuntary euthanasia could also be supported, on the basis that an unborn baby (that is, one which has reached whatever threshold one is using for life) has its whole life ahead of it, whereas an incurably incapacitated person cannot hope for improvement (and, perhaps, cannot even think) and so is losing nothing by dying.",0,1328486923,,,0,c3o8xtz,t3_pb6gv,2.0,t1_c3o1326,68216,1428302145,0,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1313674608.0,t2_5ot0c

 The outpouring of support online for Planned Parenthood and women in need of breast cancer screenings has been nothing short of astonishing, and because of it, the Planned Parenthood Breast Health Fund has received more than $3 million from thousands of people across the country in only three days.

 After facing pressure from anti-women&amp;#039;s health political organizations, the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation announced that it was ending future funding for lifesaving breast cancer screenings and breast health education at Planned Parenthood health centers.

 Many of these patients have contacted us to share their stories about how Planned Parenthood has provided much-needed breast health care and education - care that has improved or saved their lives.

While not all feel this strongly, that some do should show that there is something deeper than protecting life driving these individuals.  Also notice how many pro-life individuals want to shut down all of Planned Parenthood's services, even though that are unrelated to abortion and only have to do with saving lives.

I also tend to find pro-life individuals to be strongly opposed to the teaching of safe sex and insistent on forcing abstinence only education, even though multiple studies have shown such tactics end up increasing abortions.

I also notice that most pro-life individuals ascribe to conservatism, the same political ideology that is against socialized health care.

On one side, capital punishment, as it currently exist, is applied very unfairly and can be considered 'corrupted' by both racism and sexism.  Then there is the problem that no guilty verdict is 100% sure.  This last part, especially, is why I am against the death penalty being practiced.

But as a theory, it isn't like the rest.  War, poverty, homelessness, lack of medical care, hunger, ect. kills innocent people in both practice and in theory.  But capital punishment, in theory, deals with people who have not only committed a horrible act showing disrespect for the freedom and lives of others, but who are also beyond ability to be reintegrated with society.  Killing (or letting die) someone who is 'innocent', be it a child starving to death, a civilian caught in the cross fire, or a poor individual not able to afford a life saving operation, seem to be inherently different than killing someone who is, by no means of the word, innocent.

Obviously, and as I have already said, in reality the death penalty is imperfect and thus should be avoided.  But in theory... it doesn't seem to belong on the list.

Willravel,,,"&gt;Hmm... interesting. I'm not sure what defines an MRA troll yet, but I'm curious.

If we're having a lively discussion about, say, rates of income being unequal based on gender and someone decides to bring up the entirely unrelated topic of how often men are raped or how the courts favor the mother in custody cases, that would be a perfect example of an MRA troll. 

The issue is that some MRAers derail conversation by threadjacking, attempting to change the topic of discussion to one they would prefer discussing, which is not only incredibly rude and presumptuous, but worse it prevents an important discussion from being had. In truth, it's a form of censorship, and can often be motivated by anti-feminism. As a frequent poster on [[/r/Feminism](/r/Feminism), I can tell you that this tactic is often used as a method of preventing free speech about feminist issues. 

Both [/r/Feminism](/r/Feminism) and [/r/Feminisms](/r/Feminisms) exist as spaces for people to discuss feminist issues, concepts, news, etc., anything related to feminsim. When a topic clearly becomes MRA-related (check the MRA subreddit's sidebar for a good introductory list of MRA pet causes) and has no real connection to feminism, the discussion is taking place in the wrong subreddit, like when people talk about how great Captain Picard is on [/r/StarWars](/r/StarWars), but with more malicious intent. 

At least that's my take on it. I don't frequent [/r/Feminisms](/r/Feminisms) as often because I would like to take back [/r/Feminism](/r/Feminism) instead of falling back. That said, it's good to know [[/r/Feminisms](/r/Feminisms) is here when I need a safer place to discuss something.

Not really. Adrenaline helps you kill mammoths, not necessarily anger. My point about pop psychology was that you can come up with evolutionary reasons for anything including anxiety but no one really knows where any of this stuff comes from. Likewise, there's a lot of evidence that anxiety has beneficial effects, so it doesn't make sense to write it of as being a purely social construct. 

&gt;they're not repressed in a way that leads to this type of anxiety or ""perversion of anger"" as you put it.

I would argue that there's just as much evidence for the idea that men are socialized to deal with problems through anger as there is that women are socialized to internalize it, and considering the amount of violent crime committed by men I would say we would be better off if everyone were socialized to express themselves in the stereotypically feminine way, even if it did make us all neurotic. 

And I don't think men are any more free than women in how they express themselves, consider being a man who expresses himself in a stereotypically feminine way as opposed to a woman who expresses herself in a typically masculine way.

The issue with transgendered individuals is a bit complex. There's the federal definition of sex, the certain areas where sex is segregated such as restrooms/showers/locker rooms, etc. Most people don't care, or at least are ambivalent as long as it's not brought to their attention, but when it comes to legal recognition of sex in the context of the transgendered, there isn't much consistency at the levels of government, and it doesn't always comport with one's identity anyways.

While the clinical treatment of transgendered individuals is fairly well understood, the causes surrounding their for lack of a better term condition isn't. I think that has made governments reluctant to make large, swift changes all at once, and while it may be difficult to swallow, I think that's a prudent if inconvenient path.

groops,,,"I can't speak for everyone obviously, but a lot of the hesitance that I have felt about speaking up on rape issues in the past has pretty much been a combination of general discomfort with the subject area with a feeling that I cannot legitimately comment on it.  This has been especially true in situations where the people I am speaking against are not men - which happens a lot more than I would've expected it to.  

One of the first times I aggressively called people out on victim blaming bullshit involved a comment thread on another site (that should have been a safe space) where I knew irl a large number of the people posting.  Someone had written an article elsewhere talking about her experiences being sexually assaulted in a particular community years earlier, and broader problems she thought her experiences were indications of. Someone else crossposted it, and the first ~90 comments were one of the biggest clusterfucks I have ever seen - people were picking apart her actions to try to find things she had done 'wrong', and were joking around about how she must just enjoy being raped. A large number of the comments - and almost all of the most offensive ones - were from women.

The thread was horrific to me, but I wasn't sure how to respond.  It was beyond the point where anything subtle/not confrontational would've been productive, but I felt utterly uncomfortable appropriately (aggressively) calling out a bunch of people that I knew, and felt especially extra utterly uncomfortable doing so to women that I knew when it was a rape related issue.  

I ended up talking to another one of my friend's about it, and eventually posting a pretty scathing reply, because even though it was uncomfortable to do it was more uncomfortable to let it slide.  Almost as soon as I replied, tons of other people replied in the same vein - and by the end of the thread, some of the people who participated in the initial clusterfuck realized the problems with what they had done - and the ones who didn't probably will still hesitate to bring their bullshit in to public in the future.  

The reaction I got was comforting - I think I was the only person who thought my response was inappropriate.  I ended up getting a lot of PM's thanking me for speaking out from people saying that they had wanted to speak out as well but were reluctant to be the first person to go dramaz.  It's allowed me to feel a little bit more sure in speaking out about related issues since then, and I'm better at regularly doing so than I used to be.  But it's still a really uncomfortable thing to do, and I still have to actively convince myself each time that it's something I can legitimately speak out about.

When guys don't respond to things like this, I'm sure sometimes it really is because they just don't give a crap.  But a lot of the time, it's not because they don't give a crap - it's because they're sitting back in their chairs shaking their heads feeling utterly uncomfortable with the situation but also feeling utterly uncomfortable speaking up about it.  That doesn't mean that they shouldn't be speaking up and certainly doesn't exculpate their silence, but I do think it's an important and noteworthy difference from simply not speaking up because they don't care.

jacobman,,,"tl,dr: too much to summarize. Ignore if you don't want to read. 

I really appreciate this article as it includes the source of all the analysis. It should be required that all articles like this provide things as clearly as this one does. 

Here are possible issues I see with the study and conclusion: 

1) 8th grade and below is the main population for the data. If math specifically is being used for the tests, do the skills needed for the simple math at that age represent the same skill set that is needed for high level math later on? If math isn't specifically used for the testing, what types of questions are asked? 

2) While the study does show that the cultural noise makes obtaining a good estimate of the actual distribution of innate mathematical skill hard, that does not prove that some of the populations are not fairly close to the true distribution of abilities. This is important because any population without significant cultural influences that does not differ much from the natural distribution may see differences in gender representations in math intensive fields due solely to differing standard deviations in the gender populations. The fact that cultural influences are present does not mean that natural distribution influences are not also present. 

3) The data of the difference in test score averages to ratio of the test score variance for men to women shows a strong negative correlation. If this data is fit and the fit is assumed to represent the expected distribution properties for any of those two parameters, two things can be noticed. When it is assumed that this line represents the expected distribution for any of those two parameters, we know that the true distribution would lie somewhere on that line. If the true distribution were to be located at the point where there was no difference in variance of the skill between men and women the mean for the mathematical skill parameter for men would be 0.12 higher than that of the female population. If the true distribution was located at any other point, such as where there was no difference in the mean skill between men and women, there would be a difference in the variances of the two genders. In particular, at the point where the mean skills were equivalent, men would have an approximately 1.08 times larger standard deviation. In general the fit does not suggest an equality between the skill distribution of men and women with the confines of the test that was administered for this study. 

However, I do admit that the noise in the data points is quite high and therefore defining the precise line that the true distribution lies on from such an analysis is likely prone to much error. It could be that the true distribution lies on a line that has a smaller slope, in which case it is possible that the true distribution lies on the point where the difference in mean scores is zero and the ratio of variances is one. This would be the case in an ideal world where men and women had the exact same potential, but I would say that the data is at best inconclusive on if the world truly is ideal. 

4) The study points out that by increasing womens pay both boys and girls test scores increase. However, they then only suggest trying to equalize pay differences as an option. 

First of all, it is mentioned in the article that ""eliminating gender discrimination in pay and employment opportunities could be part of a win-win formula for producing an adequate supply of future workers with high-level competence in mathematics."" This implies that the differences in employment and pay are due to discrimination, which was not shown in this study. Furthermore the entire purpose of the study was to study what the reasons for the employment differences could be. The fact that the conclusion assumes discrimination calls the entire study and approach into question, as it implies that the person conducting the study had already arrived at a conclusion without data. 

Second of all the study does not attempt to think of any other possible reasons for the increase in achievement with higher equality in womens pay. This could be due to the fact that the researchers had went into the study already convinced of what the truth was, as I indicated earlier. I can easily think of another possibility that was not mentioned. 

It is possible that there is widespread discrimination against men with regards to their ability to raise their children. This would mean that the mothers education and income would make more of a difference in influencing childrens education. It would also mean that giving unequal treatment to women's education and income would result in better educated children, even if this practice was discriminatory towards men. If this hypothesis were true, the data would represent discrimination against men, and the best approach would be to eliminate these inequalities with regard to raising children. Overall, the data is simply inconclusive, but the different possibilities represent vastly different situations that require vastly different approaches. 

I appreciate these studies and I hope that each one is approached without jumping to conclusions before hand or before the data fully supports those conclusions. As long as studies like this continue to be done, these unanswered questions should be able to be answered, but impartiality must be stressed, especially with such a controversial topic.

jacobman,,,"&gt; This nonsense is so elementary that even fifth graders can quickly point out to Ms. Trotta that there is no expectation of rape from close contact with males elsewhere, for instance, with coworkers, colleagues and in social settings.

False. It is expected, as pretty much no-one expects that among all people working there is not a single rapist. There are rapists, and until there are not, it would be illogical not to expect some number of incidents. What is not expected is that the victims will not be supported, which is part of the point Liz is making. 

She's saying that it's costly to mingle women and men, because the woman who are unjustly assaulted do have to be supported, just like in the workplace and in social settings. I don't know where she's going from there, but if she's suggesting that the cost of mingling men and women might outweigh the gains from having both sex's at the military's disposal, then without further information, that seems like a reasonable question to look into if you're interested in the efficiency of the military.

I WAS in the navy (submarines) and I am retired. I don't know when you served, but things were not like you describe them... not at all... when I was in. 

I DID work with Marines, of course. NO ONE wants to willingly fight and die. Would a Marine shoot someone if necessary? Absolutely. It's their job. Do they run around shooting people indiscriminately? No. Do they WANT to kill? No, I don't think so. 

And I did NOT have my 'head in the sand'. You DO enforce peace through superior firepower. That is the way of the world works, whether you like it or not (and I don't). But I am a realist. 

I, too, can be very critical of the military; the same as I can be (and am) very critical of politicians or corporations. Nothing, and no one, is perfect. I, too, can be disgruntled at life's situation. But I don't make overall generalizations of people, though I have a tendency to think that way at times.

Kari Lydersen does that kind of writing too; she's one of the most widely published contemporary journalists covering organized labor and various working class social movements.

Do you disagree that ""all women have the right to capitalize on looks or sexuality to make a living""?  If so, why?

IMHO there are some reasonable arguments for banning sex/sexualized work; they tend to be centered on ideals of equality.  There are also some rather illogical arguments for banning sex work; such arguments usually are based on religion or traditional morality.

Lydersen criticized coerced and unwanted physical interactions between management/customers and employees.  I think she would argue that both low wages and abusive conditions are forms of capitalist exploitation (the latter also being a form of patriarchal exploitation).

camelhorse,,,"This is exactly correct.  

Language, not just ours but all languages, is based on *metaphor*.
This means we'll use a word to capture *some* of the aspects of its original meaning,
but not *all*.

Simple example: Walking down the path of life.  We don't *walk* down life, life is not a *path* guiding
one along a simple direction from point A to point B, but there are more than enough aspects of walking
down a path that we *do* understand our own lives in these terms.

But the author of this quote would object to that.  

So if I object to murder I would want to eliminate the phrase ""murder""
from language when not discussing killing.  ""My team was murdered"" is now an evil sentence.

Killing.  ""Hey, kill the engine a second while I check your tire pressure.""
That's now an evil sentence.

We can go further!  What about the *millions and millions* of people worldwide who are starving to death?  So now we can't use phrases like ""She was starved for attention"".  

Or what about torture, of which rape is a subsection.  ""Tortured by guilt, he confessed.""  This is now an evil sentence.  

Language is infinitely expressive and ANY TIME anyone submits a word or phrase should not be used,
then THEY are the ones who become evil.

We also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions.

GoodGrades,,,"Keeping it rare is actually a good point imo, and for two reasons. One, most women who get an abortion are not in a great position. They may have just been raped, they may be facing terrible financial or emotional difficulties, so I think we can mostly agree that having better access to good sex education, rape prevention programs, and contraceptives which would prevent many potential abortions would be a good thing for many women. The second, and potentially more important reason relates to the pro-life side. Before abortion was legal in the U.S., an estimated 1 million illegal abortions occurred annually, right on par with the number of annual abortions post-*Roe*. So what we can say to pro-lifers is that we're happy to work with them to potentially reduce the number of abortions occurring per year, but that criminalizing abortion is very clearly **not** the best solution, no matter what your opinion on abortion may be.",0,1329802144,,,0,c3tbvyf,t3_py905,1.0,t3_py905,31933,1428391363,-1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1319584869.0,t2_648km

I'll give you an example from my classroom to explain my concern.  
A student (we’ll call him Joel) expressed at the beginning of this semester that he did not understand why the term ""Indian Giver"" was offensive, since he said it lightly and had not intended it to give offense.  I know that he is a genuinely nice guy who had no malicious intentions. Me just telling him it was ‘offensive’ just meant he wouldn’t do it around me anymore, not that he actually understood why it was offensive. 

We spent a few weeks in the course learning about the brutal realities of Residential Schooling and the history of aboriginal peoples in North America, which many of them did not really know a lot about.  After that, Joel shared a story with me last week.  When Joel was in highschool an aboriginal classmate had dressed for their graduation ceremony in full traditional dress.  Joel and other students had snickered under their breath and made degrading comments about it.  He told me that it was not until this day that he realized why what he had participated in was contributing to oppression, and he would never do something like that again.  At that moment I knew he would never use the term “Indian Giver” again either.  His new knowledge led to a deeper understanding, and ultimately respect. 
Maybe saying “Indian Giver”, or using the word ""rape"" in isolation does not seem like a big deal, it is connected to a narrative of real violence and oppression. You only need to look at bullying and suicide rates for aboriginal students in white-dominant classrooms, or statistics which have been detailed in this thread about the vast occurence of rape.  It is indicative of a greater social problem; in the case of the ""rape"" word, trivializing it indicates more about the society that tolerates that kind of attitude than anything about the personal character or benign intentions of the gamers talking about ""baseraping"".

INxP,,,"I assume mainly [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor). I.e. that ""raping the enemy"", for example, may have as little to do with literal rape as ""killing time"" has to do with literal murder. (Not a native speaker here, so pardon me if I can't come up with a better comparison.)

Sometimes I hear terms like ""raped"" used figuratively in video games when one side is rendered helpless by another side who is brutally dominating the encounter, especially when there's an element of forceful humiliation involved. Yet there is nothing like a forced (or unenthusiastic, or any other kind) sexual act in any literal way. In some games so-called ""baseraping"", for example, is a quite frowned-upon yet common strategy that involves killing the enemy players as soon as they spawn, leaving them unable to effectively defend themselves, and in the end often feeling very much frustrated, humiliated and even violated. It isn't considered exactly fair play or sportsmanlike, but it ""gets to the goal"", so it's still often the end result of having two unbalanced sides, especially in team-based games where being the good guy effectively just means dropping out of the game and not really helping the opponent in any tangible way.

Best keep in mind though that these are games where the goal is literally *killing other people* -- virtually of course, but generally in as realistic a manner as possible -- so it's not like the ""raping"" is the only or worst atrocity happening, whether literally or figuratively. The goal in these games is *not* to be a civil or a nice guy -- that's what real life is for.

So I can easily see its relevance *as a metaphor*, even if I'd rather avoid the term myself (for reasons that should be pretty clear to anyone reading a thread like this). While I can appreciate the fact that it's a very loaded word that may not be nice to use lightly, I have to admit that I see as a little obtuse anyone who claims they don't see how it can possibly have ""anything to do"" with something that isn't a literal rape, or that the main reason or motivation for using the word in any figurative way must be making light of real rape or rape victims. I don't think the word would be used figuratively at all if it wouldn't immediately raise some very powerful emotional allusions to a very real form of violation that everyone instinctively understands to be wrong and extremely harmful to whoever has to experience it.

(I also assume that any ""trigger warning"" would be pretty moot in a thread titled ""rape"", albeit I think there's a bad pun to be forced in there somewhere when talking about first person shooters. Excuse me, I'm very tired and coming up with the silliest associations.)

gglife,,,"&gt; I think it's already treated rather like a physical condition - how many mental disorders do you know that surgeons can cure?

My point exactly.  It's not a mental condition, it is a physical one.  To ""cure"" GID, you do not take drugs to alter the brain and the way it thinks, you take drugs to alter the body so it matches the brain.  

&gt; It is heavily policed, however, by psychiatrists because other conditions need to be ruled out and there can be a lot of illnesses that go along with it. 41% of trans people attempt suicide, which I can't help feeling is largely because of the prejudices of society.

It is heavily policed for now.  True, other conditions can lead to feelings of GID, but they are rare and usually severe in nature to begin with (sociopath is the prominent one I have heard of).  Informed consent is becoming more readily available for things like hormones.  

Psychiatrists will most likely retain control over the irreversible decisions (SRS) but for all of the steps that can be reversed, like hormone treatment, we're going to start to see them lose their control.  

I don't think it's fair to claim that since there is a high suicide-rate (caused by the prejudices of society) that a psychiatrist is mandatory.  Nobody's transition is the same, and not everyone faces the same hardships.  Not every therapist is concerned with strictly your well being, and some can outright be gatekeepers.  I don't think it's fair to force a person who is handling their transition fine to pay money to an unnecessary professional.  

That being said a good therapist can do wonders and for some is absolutely necessary.  I feel like that is a decision that should be left to the patient though, and not enforced - and in fact, this is exactly the type of thinking we're seeing with the new WPATH and the rise of informed consent clinics.

But I'll just skip the rest of these ad hominems and stick closer to the subject.

""Indian giver"" as a term inherently carries some negative connotations about a social (ethnic) group. ""Rape"" does not.

And to escape from the inevitable subjectivity of both of our interpretations, I'll just refer to some less biased third party sources to see if there's anyone else willing to accept this ""special meaning only I understand"":

First, of course, the origins of the word: [Online Etymology Dictionary](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=rape&amp;searchmode=none)


And then some modern day (free online) dictionaries:
[Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rape), [TheFreeDictionary](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/rape)


And one with four separate entries: *The Cambridge Dictionary*: [1 (verb)](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/rape_1),
[2 (noun, sex crime)](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/rape_2),
[3 (noun, destruction)](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/rape_3),
[4 (noun, plant)](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/rape_4)

HappyGiraffe,,,"The article is wildly problematic and diminishes the experience of thousands of transgender individuals, but beneath all the bullshit is a sentiment worth discussing. 

It has been the history of diagnosing GID that boys are more heavily policed than girls. I believe (correct me if I am wrong) that diagnostic criteria for GID have been revised since the days when, in order for a boy to be diagnosed with GID, he merely had to display a preference for so-called ""feminine"" activities or clothes, but a girl had to display the belief that she needed or would grow a penis. 

Even with the adjustments, it still remains that males are more frequently pathologized when it comes to displaying non-cis behavior, and I feel this is largely due to our social preference for the masculine over the feminine, the idea that we, socially, are more likely to accept a ""boyish girl"" than a ""girlish boy."" Some may pitch this as misandry, but I see it still as a symptom of socialized misogyny that devalues the feminine. 

As the mother of a boy, I am torn on this. On one hand, I hate to think that a preference for pink would warrant a trip to a psychiatrist among some circles, but on the other I would never want him to think that, should he ever feel wrongly-bodied, that I would downplay and make him stuff it aside as ""merely some childhood thing.""

On one hand, they are clearly atypical or abnormal.  Much like homosexuality is abnormal in that the majority of the people, the mean, don't do it.  But then again, having a college degree is abnormal, as is a life long monogamous marriage (either gay or straight).

It makes sense, but it also ignores that Big Business isn't a spectator. Sexism is maintained via an interaction between popular culture, advertisement and local culture. Big Business plays a leading role in the advertisement department and while I will concede that it is not the prime cause for sexism, it does have an important hand in maintaining and furthering it. 

For example, there is little doubt that many women face a lack of self-confidence due to the projection of an unreasonable image primarily by the fashion and make-up industry (fashion and make-up models usually look far more 'perfect' that movie stars for example). Those same industries claim to have the answer to these self-confidence problems. It's in their interest to further sexist stereotypes and they really love doing that (see also labiaplasty and the diet industry).

I was not able to have any kind of prenatal or birth coverage without opting in and paying an extra 700 a month. However, even though I have eliminated that risk for myself, my rates still go into a pool that will pay out to someone who paid for that coverage. Although I will never have prostate issues, and my plan would probably deny any billing for prostate issues (I did not have to opt out of this, my status as a female does the opting out for me), my premium still goes into the pool that pays out for prostate issues. If they were to do their insurance magic and factor in the lowered monetary risk a person was taking by eliminating birth control from their coverage, I'd be willing to bet its pennies, because technically at the very least half the insurance population is already not at risk for BC. The issue lies with implying that you get any say in what your premiums go to in the end. If you use the flood insurance example, you are only eliminating yourself and your risk from the end payout. If there is a major flood, you can bet part of the money you paid for regular house insurance will still be used to cover the insurance companies losses.
If you get a group plan (ie employee based) that option of adjusting rates is moot, because the point of that is the ""bulk"" discount. The insurance companies already know not everyone will use every service, and have a calculated risk with a price tag on it. Im not even going to get into the religious exemption, because again, unless they are self insured, they will still go into the ""pool"" with other people who are covered for BC.

First, you realize that the ['wrong' gender is actually female,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISme5-9orR0) right? That's a historical and global reality.  Thinking women or others see you as wrong-gendered is a reality only within the confines of your own self-perception. 


Given the above, it seems to me that you have brought some baggage to this conversation that we need to unpack.  Absolutely no one here is demeaning the male experience.  No one is accusing men of being 'chauvinist pigs' or anything of the sort.  Women also use the word rape.  No one is saying they see phalluses everywhere.  You are infusing this conversation with your own perceived notions of how women see and talk about rape.  

Your 'feelings' are certainly a valid channel of analysis, but perhaps in this case you also need to step out of yourself for a moment and look at the bigger picture.  Although you may *feel* as though your words are spoken in a vaccuum, with a special meaning only you understand, there is a greater likelihood that your thoughts, actions, desires, and yes, the words you speak, are a product of your context.  What you ""believe in and stand for"" are not really about you, but your parents, community, etc.  

In terms of your belief that these words have no greater implications, please see my [example](http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/pwtfl/rape/c3t5r3a) about a student, a story which attests to the connection between word and action.

itsasocialconstruct,,,"I am not Muslim or from the Middle East, but I will share some of my thoughts on European countries that ban the burqa and face covering. The law represents one end on a spectrum that I will call the Totalitarian-Relitivist spectrum. Totalitarian here would refer to myths about a culture that assume some sort of essentialist knowledge of it. When the French government banned the burqa they are doing so because their observations of Islamic culture lead them to believe that the burqa is without exception a means of oppressing women, and that it has no cultural value beyond that. In doing so it is implied that Muslim culture is oppressive of women. So from this it can be abstracted that the French government is deciding that Western culture is a) not oppressive to women and b) that it is preferable that people assimilate to Western culture if they live in France. In many ways it can be said that the law is a manifestation of West vs. East mentality and a manifestation of a Colonialist outlook: the French government is 'civilizing' Muslims, bringing the 'light of Judeo-Christian freedom to the barbarians.' (Sound familiar, India?)

Now it would be just as bad to say something like, ""Well, if Muslim women are being honor-killed and their political and economic freedoms are non-existent, well... that is *just their culture.*"" Because lets face it, women are being killed, they *are* oppressed, we can't just *do nothing,* that would be the Relativist attitude. This attituude *also* (like Totalitarianism) assumes that their is an essential *difference* between the West and the East. By that logic the law still makes sense: French society? Too different to allow for Muslim culture.

So then what can be taken from this. Both view points are... the word I will choose is 'useless.' Rather I would say that we need a balance, where we recognize that a) parts of Islam are oppressive to some women and b) parts of Western culture are oppressive to some women. We must work with the conflicts between extreme relativism and totalitarianism to find an answer that doesn't reify difference. The paradox presented is a not a place to give up at, but rather to think about problems in new way. 'Resistance is fertile' as they say.

Also be weary of privileging people based on identity...

INxP,,,"&gt;rape is a gendered, power-based crime, and using the word as a metaphor plays right into the same oppressive gendered narrative as the act it came from

Hair-splitting time, then. 

I have to admit that it seems that any discussion on this particular subject always gets, sooner or later, distorted and diffused by forcibly tying it to these ideologically loaded concepts that people just insist on reading into any and every thing that is being said about it, or, as is the case with these metaphors, about anything completely unrelated using just some of the same terminology.  Let's give it a go anyway, and see if I manage to get my stance more clear.

Sometimes a cigar *is* just a cigar, not a thinly veiled symbol of phallic male dominance that the brotherhood of patriarchy wants to shove down your throat. And sometimes a metaphor *is* just a metaphor, not an attempt to trivialize, oppress, or participate in a gendered narrative.

For just one very concrete example of using the term ""wrong"": [a certain very popular local band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMMP), led by two female singers (who have also done a song for the local branch of Amnesty International for their campaign against violence against women, FWIW), have in one of their more popular songs a somewhat poorly translatable line about how ""the frost rapes this land"". *To me* that's just a poetic line using the term as a metaphor -- and I can't quite think of any alternative term to replace it without losing some of the expressive power and accuracy of that line -- which is essentially about (not actual rape, but something as unrelated as) living under the harsh climate of Northern Europe. 

But you want me to believe that what the song is *really* about is the band *playing into the same oppressive gender narrative as the act it came from*? That what these women are *really* doing is trivializing the act of rape and contributing to the oppression of women?

I'm truly sorry if this makes impossible my peaceful coexistence with anyone, but I simply don't know how to force myself into seeing it that way. What I see in the whole debate is more akin to an attempt by some people to monopolize a commonly used word with expressive power far beyond it's most strict and literal meaning, for what I can only see as political purposes -- the intentions are of course good, but the methods I just can't really approve of. It's my language too.

I understand that rape *can be* by definition a gendered crime *if* we choose to define it as such, as some institutions have done (which I'd claim to be a pretty clear case of institutionalized misandry, but that's another discussion). I also understand that even when including non-penile sexual violations and/or those that have a male as a victim (penile or not), it may in practice be a predominantly male-on-female violation, *if* we choose to exclude prison environments, as we often do (for reasons that aren't entirely acceptable to me), and so on and so forth. If we however accept that one does not need a vagina to be raped, and that people convicted of crimes are people too, and that a rape can also be an act of violation that does not involve inserting a penis into something (or just being a man), then we're not really talking about a gendered crime anymore.

Likewise we could conveniently just *define* oppression as ""all the bad stuff that men do to women"" and conclude that women are oppressed because they're women, and men aren't because they're men, but I hope this is not the level of the discussion we're supposed to have. Or anyone is.

Power-based I could easily agree with, but even that gets a bit blurry the further away we sway from the ""conventional"" definition of a forceful act while using or threatening with violence. I'm sure there have been cases of men being retroactively accused of rape (not of being irresponsible, or inconsiderate, or assholes, but of *rape*) for having mutually consenting sex with an intoxicated partner, when any power aspect was never a real motivation, although I'm not sure if this is (yet) a very common scenario. Anyway, I believe for most cases the power aspect does, at least to a degree, apply.

What I simply don't understand is that how does the use of a term as a metaphor constitute an act of oppression when the term itself isn't derogatory towards any group or gendered -- any particular act of violation may or may not be gendered, of course, depending on the case, but that does not cover the full meaning and applicability of the term. (If anything, even the field of its *literal* applicability seems to be expanding as we speak, largely due to Women's Rights activists wanting it to include scenarios that traditionally wouldn't have been included -- not necessarily a bad thing, but something to keep in mind when accusing others of misusing the term as if there even exists one universally accepted definition for its literal meaning.)

I also do understand that just hearing the word can be an unwanted reminder of traumatic events, for which exact reason I often hesitate to use it even if it seems to be the most descriptive term in any particular context. But that's because I don't want to be an insensitive asshole, not because I'd be trivializing, oppressing or participating in a gendered narrative if I would in fact use it. 

Most of the time these assumed implications just seem awkwardly forced and glued-on in order to gain significance for issues that just aren't there -- they're *somewhere*, but not there. It's this ""Everything is about Me and My Womanhood"" attitude that most bothers me here -- some things simply aren't. Sometimes it's just other people talking about other things that have nothing to do with you or your socio-political interpretations, using words that you want to claim ownership to, meaning things with them that you don't mean with them, and being accused of all kinds of things by you, simply because you refuse to see that they come from a totally different place and are not the boogeyman you need them to be in order to give you a stronger sense of meaningfulness for your struggles.

I hope that doesn't sound too harsh, but it's not the first time I get to hear from other people what I *really* mean when I say what I say, and what I *really* do when I do what I do, and it does get old after a while. And I hope you can appreciate the irony if it feels to me like someone is trying to trivialize my own feelings and thoughts about myself and the world I live in, oppress my freedom of determining myself what I believe in and stand for, and narrating me as the bad guy based on nothing but my ""wrong"" gender (you know, the one that does nothing but rapes and approves of all kinds raping, because male chauvinist pig).",0,1329941289,,,0,c3twh0q,t3_pwtfl,7.0,t1_c3tr6ts,38314,1428401263,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1287854245.0,t2_4gem9

There's nothing in the ""it gets better"" project that suggests that ""it"" is the world. ""It"" has always been the context of a person that gets better.

They realize that their life isn't as shitty. They get to choose the environments in which they hang out. They have more control over their own lives and thus, life gets better because they have context... a different environment... more choices... All things that makes one life better.

I mean I agree with the sentiment that the author expresses but I think it's a needless attack on a project born of a really simple and elegant idea where Dan Savage after hearing about another gay kid who committed suicide wanted to tell them that life gets better if they just hold out long enough. Because he knows the stories of so many LGBT people where their lives did get better.

Then he realized he *could* tell these youth... through the internet.

""It Gets Better"" isn't a solution. It's not the end of bullying. It's just a collection of stories. It a part of the process so that LGBT kids know they aren't alone. That they can imagine their lives living free from bullying. 

One should never use it as an excuse not to try and fix it for queer teens now... but criticizing the project seems erroneous.

I think that historical context is interesting and important in that it informs our understanding of the present, but that it complicates and confuses the usefulness of the terms.  I'll use racism to explain, as it is easier to show.

Under my understanding of the definition, if someone sees someone, and attacks them because of their race, that is racism.

If the attacker faces less or no punishment from the institutions that are supposed to protect everyone, that is institutional racism.

If the attacker's race only gained control of the institutions 50 years ago, I do not think that it changes the attack being racist.

I prefer this for two reasons, the first is that that past has very little utility compared to the present for predicting the future (This would take a long time to explain so you are welcome to either reject it or file it under 'interesting things to try to learn more about later'.  Basically, everything from the past that can affect the future is encoded in the present), and the second is that we can create cost functions for the amount of bigotry in a group (e.g. University campus, workplace, city or country) and try different ways of minimizing it.

It's also a much simpler thing to look at (Okay, maybe this is a third reason).  Who is historically oppressed between Portogie and Filipino?  A Scot and a Greek?

shallah,,,"&gt;All true, but **there’s just one thing opponents have left out, or don’t seem fully aware of: Alabama has actually required ultrasounds for abortion patients since 2002. Since the majority of abortions in Alabama, as in other states, take place before eight weeks — when a transvaginal ultrasound is customarily used for a clearer picture — thousands of women may already have been subject to this form of state-mandated “rape” for over a decade.** That legislation, the 2002 “Woman’s Right to Know” act, was challenged in court for other reasons, mostly related to the First Amendment, but eventually upheld. Forced vaginal penetration does not appear to have entered the conversation until the recent uproar in Virginia, using that language, struck a chord. The imagery and subsequent outcry, says Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, was “able to shed light on it in a way a thousand legal arguments can’t.”

&gt;In fact, the relatively novel part of the Alabama legislation rests in the “See” part. As it stands now, the bill, which is expected to go before the state Senate sometime this week, requires not only that an ultrasound be performed before an abortion, but also that the technician or doctor “provide a simultaneous verbal explanation of what the ultrasound is depicting, which shall include the presence and location of the unborn child,” and to “display the ultrasound images so that the pregnant woman may view them.” If the bill becomes law, Alabama will join Texas in having one of the most extreme ultrasound laws in the country — not because of a forced transvaginal ultrasound, which is actually already commonplace in several states. The latest “pro-life” innovation is the state is forcing a woman to look at an image and, where applicable, listen to a fetal heartbeat with the express aim of dissuading her from her choice.

&gt;The pro-choice movement’s legal arm, including the Center for Reproductive Rights, couldn’t get the earlier Alabama law overturned, though it tried. It has, however, been challenging the Texas law sinc",0,1330464107,,,0,c3vz339,t3_qa8bf,1.0,t3_qa8bf,35,1428437188,1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1220919695.0,t2_38lau

The assumption or denial of agency really colors people's reactions, and thus those reactions reflect the societal expectation of agency.

Said adult's agency is recognized societally.

When women challenge the gender paradigm it's considered cute, frivolous, or harmless because of the societal perception which does not recognize women's agency.  When men challenge the gender paradigm it's considered a threat because the actions of men are, societally, given weight and power; their agency is recognized.

What she got in response was a lot of loud, brash indignation that turned into drama that was eventually turned around into loud, brash indignation and drama that she herself was somehow responsible for. 

Let me just reiterate--your point is that she is responsible for the stink made over her somewhat innocuous request.

So really, whether or not the guy did anything wrong isn't even the question. The question is whether or not women have the right to set their own personal boundaries, or dictate the terms under which they are romantically propositioned.

The movement's opinion of that request seems to be a resounding FUCK NO. Which is really disappointing, because a tenet of atheism seems to be ""I have the right not to be preached to against my will.

Also, pointing out that the cost of the contraception is not the only important point is not an argument for why BC pills should be completely covered .

It's an easy decision for you. You go ""oh sweet, my contraception won't cost me anything anymore"", but as it has been mentioned in the past, there are also men involved. Even if men weren't the vast majority, you still would have to frame your argument on why BC pills should be covered at all in a way that takes into consideration the comparative effectiveness, cost, and current support of other contraception methods. In addition to this overall economics should be considered. 

Just because BC pills are good, doesn't necessarily mean that completely covering them is something the government should be mandating, and honestly, I haven't seen much actual discussion on the issue yet. All I've seen on reddit so far has been finger pointing on sexism of some sort. While there may be sexism in this situation, that is not an argument for why the measure should be in effect.

But TFA specifically stated that behavior outside of traditional gender roles is *not* atypicl or abnormal for young children.

She is arguing that insurance be required to provide coverage for contraceptives.  Not that contraceptives be handed out by the government.  Not that they be 100% covered.  But that employers cannot decide to refuse to cover a doctor prescribed medication or procedure based on religious or moral affiliation.  The issue is that Georgetown University, due to its Jesuit affiliation, does not include birth control in the plan they offer.

Insurance is not free, as many Americans who have premiums deducted from their checks and pay steep co-pays can attest to.

brightifrit,,,"Say someone needed to go read up on their history and current events before making comments about men working harder for their cookies. Women do most of the world's labor and earn the least pay for it. They make up 50% of the wold's population, yet they account for 70% of the world's poor. Women in places like the Congo get raped so frequently that it becomes a fact of life for them, and you're saying that they have to work harder to ""earn the cookie"" of being able to fetch water for their families without worrying about getting assaulted? 

And until you have experienced what it is like, even in our pampered Western world, to stay at home and raise small children--to give up dreams, careers, hobbies, and time to yourself so that you can clean up poop and listen to small people scream at you all day--you are in no place to say that men work harder. I suffered so much sleep deprivation with my first child that I started hallucinating from it, and had postpartum depression on top of that. For nine whole months after I had the kid. With my second, I experienced a rare hormonal disorder where every time I nursed her, I felt depressed enough to kill myself. Yet, since I gave up the job where I actually earn money when three months pregnant with my second, because it was the best thing to do for my family, that somehow means I've earned less cookies? 

Let me tell you how life went for me the other evening: after a day of screaming, tantrums, diaper changes, grocery shopping, errand-running, vacuuming, scrubbing, and mopping, then making dinner while my kids bugged me and cried for attention the whole time, I finally got them fed and into the bath. After taking out my one year old and setting her down for 60 seconds, she pooped all over a chair, the kitchen floor, and my shoe. After I put her back in the bath to wash her off, she started drinking the poopy water. And after taking her out again, I got distracted and didn't remember the mess in the kitchen until I was in a different part of the house and started wondering why it smelled like poop. So I cleaned it all up and got some spices simmering on the stove so my husband wouldn't have to smell poop when he got home, before putting the baby to bed and cleaning up after dinner. May I ask what *you* do for a living, that is so much more difficult and makes you so much more deserving than I?

I get up an hour before everyone else, put my own needs last for most of the day, and work weekends when everyone else is taking a break. And yet when I want something simple, like the ability to go to a party or walk home at night without being told that I should expect to be raped and it's my fault if it happens, or to chose my own method of birth control, or to have people see me as something other than a uterus and some boobs--woah there! You haven't worked hard enough to earn those cookies. Those men over there, they've *earned* the right to control their own reproductive system and get drunk at a party without expecting people to blame it on them if they get raped. What, because they can lift more than me? Because having a child doesn't absorb their health and their time the way it does with me?

I don't know what the dynamics of your family are, but I'm assuming your mother led, or leads, a life similar to mine. Possibly harder, depending on your age and income bracket. After all, most US mothers who spend just as much time working for pay as their husbands still do the majority of the childcare and housework. You are telling me that your mother hasn't worked hard enough to earn as many ""cookies"" as you? As much dignity, safety, and say over her body and her future as you?  For shame.

That's the sort of attitude he's run into when frequenting r/mensrights, which I subscribed to eagerly when I first came to Reddit, thinking it was going to be something awesome.

One of my guy friends, who I met in a Philosophy of Feminism class, has dedicated his life to the subject. He's explained a lot to me, and I agreed with all of it. Problem is, I don't see the sorts of things he talked about on r/mensrights. I see rants about female privilege. What about the fact that men are raised believing they can't show any emotion but anger? Now there's a place where you have solid ground to get some real work done. We're surprised when men end up in jail for hitting their wives, but we continue to teach our sons to bottle their emotions instead of expressing them in a healthy way. Instead of complaining about greedy entitled women who expect to have dinners bought and doors opened, why not approach the issue by calmly explaining how such practices are detrimental to both sexes? The idea of a men's rights movement is a good one. Right now, the movement is being defined by anger and misogyny.

No, you just have to be pretty morally defunct to think that you should focus on the minor problems of the privileged while ignoring the *massive* discrimination that women have to face.

If you really wanted equality of the genders, you'd be a feminist. That's what feminism is about. And more male feminists means more focus on what few male gender equality issues exist—and there aren't very many.

You may personally have the best intentions, I don't know, but /r/mensrights exists to revile women. I've seen what gets posted there and it has very little to do with equality. I'm about as contemptuous of it as I am of /r/beatingwomen.

HertzaHaeon,,,"/r/athiesm isn't that bad. I've seen several posts where a christian comes in and denounces some negative part of the church, shows appreciation for secularism, or some such. They're usually treated respectfully and fairly.

I have three rules for tolerating religion — don't use religion as an excuse for hate and bigotry, don't use it against science, and don't push it on non-believers through politics. These rules are also generally agreed on in /r/atheism.

If your family doesn't hate homosexuals or think atheists will burn in hell, then I don't think a majority of atheists would have any problem with them.

In my experience there are several parallells between atheism and feminism. Sexism also makes people angry. Feminism also lashes out at the people, structures and organizations that perpetuate the bigotry and myths that they oppose. The passion a feminist with conviction feels can easily be mistaken for hate, especially when you hear the internal discussions of the group. But it's not that simplistic, and I'd say the same goes for atheism in general.

To me, this is like an article starting off saying ""why feminists make me hate all women"" then explaining disagreements with feminism.

People have a hard time dividing self-caused pain apart from pain that is caused by others, when attributing blame.

Unless it's clear self-defense or temporary insanity caused by being victimized in some way, there is probably no clear case where someone should be blamed for being hurt by others (in my opinion). I'm sure some hypothetical obscure example may be found, but I haven't thought of one yet.

With respect to domestic abuse, the number one cause of domestic abuse is actually domestic abuse. The end result of an instance of abuse, and who the perpetrator is, dictates whether or not the police get involved.

Rhianna did not deserve to get attacked, but, as members of the public, we still have no idea why Chris attacked her... but there was a reason, no matter how shallow or deluded it may be. So when people look at the incident, they have to think that there may have been a good reason (to them), if they have the perpetrator's interests at heart. So once they are able to come up with a scenario that the attack was possibly retribution, they can attribute blame to the victim (Rhianna) in the same way their parents attributed blame to them when they fell off a tree or called someone fat (and got hit for it).

It would be far easier to make the point with regards to victim blaming if you make that distinction...

syrinkitty,,,"&gt;I still can't shake the notion that Pinkie isn't just singing about scary monsters...

But she is. You're over-thinking it. Sometimes scary monsters are just scary monsters, and not a clear allegory to rape and abuse. And even if you aren't, the point is that you don't have to let fear control your actions - and laugh at them, because they can't hurt you - not that you should serenade your attacker with kindness.

&gt;Are we supposed to accept that he's completely oblivious to Applejack's suffering?

He was probably lying down, and Applejack would refuse to let him get up, telling him only that it was ""going well"" and she could ""easily handle it."" What's more in line with Applejack's character: being too proud to admit she's in over her head, or letting people push her around? The former seems more likely, especially given the context of the episode.

&gt;Good girls smile and work hard; bad girls are crazy and should be shunned.

But then there's the Luna episode, where Luna is portrayed as a ""bad girl."" People misinterpret her motivations, pre-judge her, and she feels rejected. Twilight helps her and the other ponies overcome those prejudices.

The main six are hardly princesses, either. They make mistakes all the time, and sometimes even lose their minds from the stress (Party of One, Applebuck Season, Lesson Zero, Sonic Rainbow, etc) and have to be reigned in by their friends.

This seems like it could only make sense in the context of an interpersonal relationship. And, like, why should the monsters be defeated through pure positivity, rather than cautious understanding, and loving support with good communication? I know I'm harping on this incident, but it really stuck out, just because of the severity of what it might mean. Even if there's a 90% chance that I'm wrong, that's still a 10% chance that MLP is telling girls to win over their attackers with kindness. (How many young viewers actually live with their assailants?)
 
I'm also not so eager to forgive Applejack's brother... I dunno. Part of it might be that the main characters are all girls, so the girls will be the ones who step up and help. But, the brother didn't notice, and he didn't respond. Don't they live together? Are we supposed to accept that he's completely oblivious to Applejack's suffering? I may be wrong, but I don't recall him apologizing either.

I agree that the two stupid pony boys weren't behaving lustfully. It still seems to support a theme of ""don't pay attention to boastful, narcissistic bitches."" And that's an attitude towards femininity that lets ""good"" girls dismiss the mental issues of ""bad"" girls. And that, I guess, is the underlying moral message that bothers me about shows where being a ""princess"" is celebrated: Good girls smile and work hard; bad girls are crazy and should be shunned.

I totally admit that I may be applying personal situations to a kid's show inappropriately; but this is a theme that has a long tradition in media. Although I admit my sensitivity in this issue: One of my female friends has been using this sort of attitude against a friend with severe issues, and that's way more important to me and less important to y'all than a discussion about a dang kids' show. X-P 

Man, sorry for being a bitchy ole man. I totally agree that this is by far the best show for girls that I've seen, and I'm totally thrilled that the characters are not weak or one-dimensional.

If those people can't see Reddit as a community, and the people here as real how are they going to take on board the accusation that they are inherently misogynistic?

People will argue and stick up for themselves *even when they know they are in the wrong* - so how do you think they are likely to react if you are labelling them as misogynistic when they may not see themselves in that way - and don't consider you to be an authority on the subject?

At the end of the day, it's not misogynistic to be interested in women and its not misogynistic to be judged by you as creepy.

syrinkitty,,,"&gt;Pinkie Pie's song

In context of the show, we're talking about scary monsters, not rapists - her song was about how you shouldn't let fear stop you from doing what you need to do. I can't talk about sexual abuse as it is (fortunately) not within my life experience. I can talk about emotional abuse, and the hardest part over the years was overcoming the fear, and being able to say the words, ""You don't scare me."" In that context, Pinkie's song made perfect sense to me.

&gt;was he oblivious to the extent to which Applejack was depleting herself?

She probably sugar-coated her exhaustion to him as much as she did to the rest of the friends. (""No, I can handle it! I don't need any help!"") In the end, she learns that asking for help is a good idea if you find yourself burning out due to over-working yourself - don't get hurt over mis-placed pride. That ends up being the lesson of the story.

&gt;But, she doesn't seem to voice her objections, and her exasperation suggests that she thinks it's hopeless. ... Did Spike in his crush learn anything about Rarity other than her name?

No, but finding someone physically attractive is a common way people get to know each other. I don't see it as such a big deal. Spike and Rarity also develop a healthy relationship over time.

What I did find funny was the episode *Diamond Dogs* where Spike has fantasies of rescuing Rarity, completely buff and god-moding his way through a horde of enemy minions like a hero rescuing a princess, only to find that Rarity rescued herself in the meantime. (You could make the argument that Rarity's 'lesson' glorified sociopathic behaviour by turning it into a survival technique against her captors, though. I'll give you that.)

I also didn't find Twilight's reaction all that amiss. She was clearly frustrated by them, and didn't condone their behaviour. They were essentially just being groupies wanting to get in on some of their leader's fame. I don't really see that as lustful behaviour.

&gt;I just worry about how media packages femininity.

I completely understand, but honestly... this is as good as it gets. A lot of your complaints are nitpicks, although I will concede the fact that the show doesn't really give any time to the male characters. But then again, it's supposed be a show about girls, because there are already oodles of shows that focus on boys and relegate the females to eye-candy. But the characters are diverse, and they are accepted for who they are, without being forced to be someone else at their own expense. 

Moreover, in the MLP universe, women having the ability to be capable and independent (without being the hostile-to-men-butch-stereotype) is taken as a *matter of fact.* Women running small businesses and being intellectual, athletic or entrepreneurs are considered *normal,* even if they're married to someone (Mr. and Ms. Cake work together to run the business at Sugar Cube Corner).

Walking_Punchline,,,"&gt; I'm still somewhat disturbed with the notion of dealing with assailants by being positive: Pinkie Pie's reactions to the assailants seem to be pleasant disarmament, and I really doubt whether that's actually an effective tactic.

Because that's not really the point.  The message is about irrational fears of the dark and that kind of thing; it's a message for children, with childish fears, not for adults.

&gt; The beginning of the episode involved the brother challenging Applejack's ability to work. Applejack obviously takes this as a challenge, and her brother does nothing. Does he not know her well enough to know that she would respond in this way?

I honestly never saw it as a challenge, just as concern.

syrinkitty,,,"&gt;I'm worried about what's going on especially around 1:00. ""Laugh at your assailant, ha ha ha!"" Pinkie pie even gets tears in her fucking eyes.

She's crying in laughter. Look at the context again. Her lesson is that you're better than your assailant, and that you don't have to let your fear of them control your actions. How is that a bad message?

&gt;Also, there's that episode where Applejack's brother coldly cajoles her into working herself beyond the point of injury, and his behavior is never called out as abusive. (The episode ""Applebuck Season"")

It's actually Applejack that convinces Big Mac to take some time off so he doesn't get even more hurt than he is originally, much to his dismay. The moral story of the episode is how you should ask your friends for help when you're in over your head. How is that pressuring her?

&gt;And then, there are those two ""dumb boys"" who summon the giant bear into the town in ""Boast Busters"": I guess you have to be stupid to fall for a conniving bitch. 

&gt;And then there's the time in the first episode, where Spike basically eye-humps Rarity, and Twilight basically says ""boys will be boys."" 

What? It's been proven time and time again throughout the series that Spike's love for Rarity is an innocent boyish crush, and that people can get very silly when in love. Nowhere does Twilight say ""boys will be boys"" - if you can provide a citation from the show, I'd like to see it. 

&gt;There's probably something similar going on with how Rainbow Dash relates to that ""punk"" griffon, since she seems to be the more traditionally masculine; but I feel less comfortable making that direct association.

The point of that episode was that you shouldn't let one friend abuse and invalidate your other friends. How is that a bad message?

&gt;I guess what bothers me the most is, it's a princess-wins story made around an explicitly gendered toy franchise.

How? The ones who ""win"" are the main six characters, who use their special abilities to overcome adversity. Twilight Sparkle uses intellect, Rainbow Dash uses her athletic ability, Applejack uses her common-sense know-how, and so on. How does that translate to a ""princess-wins"" story?

And that article you linked is the most contrived thing I've read in a long time as well. If we go by ""fur colour = skin colour"" racism logic, then does that mean Fluttershy is representative of asians due to being yellow? Or how about Big Mac and Native Americans, due to being red? What does that make Twilight Sparkle, being violet? 

&gt;P.S. There's some HUGE class issues in the show as well.

Yes, primarily that being a high-socialite comes with its price, and that people in the ""upper crust"" of society can be fair-weather, judgemental and cruel. Have you not seen ANY of the episodes surrounding Rarity? This is practically the basis of her character development - having to deal with judgemental socialites who attempt to discredit or snipe at her self-confidence while still being true to herself. 

If you want to use the two princess's as examples, for one, Princess Celestia tries to be as hands-off as possible and let Twilight Sparkle figure it out for herself, and Princess Luna is so borderline-crazy that people are terrified of her presence. The entire society of MLP is based on neo-paganism with living immortal goddesses. They don't so much ""win"" as they do ""exist.""

It feels like you're taking little snippets from the show completely out of context, and basing your entire idea of the show on them.

Mary Sues are derogatory, yes. They are not necessarily sexist, IMO. The term came about because of a particular character named, you guessed it, Mary Sue (it needs to be pointed out that Mary Sue was written in parody). Mary Sue could easily have been male, but at the time Mary Sue was written, author wish-fulfillment Star Trek fanfic almost always had *female* lead characters that got it on with Kirk. Or Spock. Or both. Or both at the same time, depending on whatever fantasies the author was wanting to explore. Although a few Mary Sues were written by men, most were written by female sci-fi/fantasy fans who who wanted to explore their own fantasies. 

That's why the blog author's premise is hard for me to swallow. Mary Sues started out representing wish fulfillment of women. How is that sexist? 

If anything, the author should take offense at the *label* Mary Sue being derogatory. Women should be allowed to have fantasies and explore them through artistic expression, including fanfic.

I am a feminist not because I care uniquely about other women but because I care about people generally and want to fight all forms of oppression, patriarchal oppression included...but when men are being oppressed in other ways I'm not going to tell them to shut up because I can only be loyal to one liberation project and I've already picked a team.  That doesn't make any sense.  These are not mutually exclusive projects and male circumcision should legitimately be a serious political issue and not one confined to sexist men's rights activists.

It is not the fault of feminism that not all feminists concentrate all their time on every single thing that happens to every individual who happens to be a black woman.  The purpose of feminism is to struggle for gender equality and against patriarchal subordination of women generally, it isn't to direct media attention towards every indignity any woman suffered anywhere.  

Unfortunately most voices in contemporary feminism have fallen so far away from the original focus on dismantling patriarchal power structures, to the less scary to the political mainstream focus of celebrating identity politics, that even suggesting this is likely to be slammed as now unfeminist or racist or otherwise reactionary.

It is remarkable and often painful to see just how people return to violent relationships.  There are as many reasons as stars in the sky and I have come to see that a support person can only give the right tools for protection and direction to a safe place.  The individual must decide her-or himself when to quit the relationship.  Obviously abusers know their partner well and no doubt there's love to some extent in all of them.

HertzaHaeon,,,"I think you have a very blck and white view of people, kind of a George Bush logic of with-us-or-against-us. People aren't that simplistic. There is a distinction between being a hater of women (which is what misogyny is) and having old-fashioned ideas.

You don't have to like Dawkins, but this absolute dismissal of him and everything he's done is very much like how anti-feminists dismiss feminists by digging up some controversial statement. If you've been around here you know how it works — mention any feminist blogger, for example, and you'll get links to some post they've made that can be interpreted as hateful of men, trans people or some such. And boom, everything they ever say can be easily dismissed.

Evangelical atheism is obnoxius to those who pefer status quo, who think religious people deserve automatic respect, or those who have never suffered under religion or superstition. After millenia of religious dominance, *any* criticism will easily be seen as angry, militant or ""evangelical"".

I've met very few atheists who think all religous people are evil and that all religion is evil. That's just prejudiced. 

We don't have to promote religion. We don't have to respect it, only tolerate it. You can be as religious you want, or support them, but in a society with religious freedom I should be able to be completely free from anything religious.

I'd like to compare this to sexism. A lot of sexist people aren't evil. Many of them are decent. In fact, they find meaning and solace in rigid, conservative norms and roles. You evangelical feminists are so obnoxious with your preachy ways. Attacking people's dearest ideas of how society should be arranged isn't the way to do it — it only makes them more insular.

I'd like to see the science that shows there's a one-way correlation between wealth and secularism. It's perfectly plausible that secularism promotes wealth as well. We have plenty of deconversions and success stories to justify our outreach. But regardless of that, our fight isn't just about affecting religious people, it's about ourselves, our freedoms and our community. Not everything we do is about deconverting those pesky religious people. That's just another prejudice.

Women aren't so much afraid that unruly mobs of atheist men will rape them at meetings, but that they'll be dolts who trivialize legitimate and common concerns of women…and this incident has definitely shown that to be the case.

Even when it comes to his expertise, Dawkins is an idiot. Evangelical atheism is obnoxious, just like evangelical anything. To think that religion is the most evil thing in the world is plainly to have your head up your ass. There are obviously decent religious people and indecent ones. We have to identify what kinds of religion are good and how to encourage and promote those. Attacking people's faith in God isn't the way to do it - that only makes them more insular.

The petition is actually asking the FTC to require that surgeons give patients more information. 

My personal experience is that there really are women out there who have no clue what is normal about their own bodies. I have a friend, and at the time this incident happened she was 30. She's beautiful, has an MBA and is really into fashion. We were watching television and during the commercial break I showed her [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYhCn0jf46U) on my laptop - just as in ""hey check this out, isn't it neat?"" She got really quiet. And said, while holding back tears, ""I didn't know."" This wonderful adult woman that is one of the coolest most well put together people I know had no freaking clue that the fashion magazines she spends so much time on are Photoshopped. She thought the reason he face and body didn't look that perfect was because of her own failure. 

So yes, I think that there are women, who seeing that their genitals don't look like the ones their husbands and boyfriends masturbate to in pornography will go get this surgery because they think they are deformed. If they knew their bodies were in the normal range and did it anyway - I don't care.

critropolitan,,,"This is a cosmetic procedure, so there isn't really such a thing as ""efficacy"" - and like any surgical intervention, surgeons already must obtain informed consent from patients which entails disclosure of known risks.  In fact cosmetic surgery normally requires more stringent disclosure to obtain informed consent because there are no medical benefits to balance against medical risks.

If modifying someone's body makes them feel more confident or whatever, the (apparent) fact that you wish they didn't feel that way, that society didn't make them feel that way, or that it simply grosses you out - seems to be to be insufficient reason to try to throw up any obstacles to people making *informed*, free choices for themselves.  Cosmetic surgery especially cosmetic surgery on sex organs is sometimes treated by liberals and feminists the way that premarital sex and homosexuality are treated by the rightwing evangelicals: issues where they offer psudo-rational explanations for paternalism when really the issue is an unjustified 'moral' impulse rooted in personal disgust more than an internally consistent ethical code.

4yrs2l8,,,"First of all, I would like to point out that I'm not the OP. I'm only linking to these pieces here.
Especially, for the second piece I decided to put the link to the infographic in the title and the posting in comments because for me the former gives more opportunity for a critical discussion as it has way more clarity than the text.

I think the text treats the issue you are bringing up in two points:
1. there is the assumption that the acting person/man is not willing to *maybe* rape someone, i.e. he is not willing to do anything that might possibly be rape. I think you are correct that from a philosophical point of view we get in a lot of trouble if we start asking if we can take anything regarding our actions for granted.
2. This quote:
&gt; Saying that consent is not 100% is not the same as saying you, personally, have no agency or ability to consent; whatever your circumstances, you make the best-seeming possible choice at the time

It seems to me that we can approach the problem from this point. 
“consent is not (never) 100%” transforms the degree of consent into a quantity. In my opinion we can not perform this transformation, but there is a lot of room for philosophical debate, again.
But I think we can be quite sure now that “consent” is used with two different meanings here. The first one being derived from the way society treats people (that is the aggregation of a lot of cases) and the second one being the result of our own personal ability to consent (that can never be absolutely reliably communicated).

Both have limitations and they are often nearly bound to end up in ideals (which one might, from a philosophical point of view, call stupid). I personally think OP understands this, as may be indicated in the two points I brought up and in the infographic as well. The latter, it seems to me, paints a quite absurd picture.


Additionally, I would like to add that your examples might not really fit in. If a daughter asks a father for money it is very likely that the father is the one having power over the daughter and not the other way around. 
Perhaps you didn't take the assumption in thought that society has built a culture that makes the consequences severe for the marginalized group.

HertzaHaeon,,,"Exactly, *most* men aren't rapists. But you can't tell which ones by looking at them. So you devise strategies to handle that insecurity. Hence Schrödinger's rapist.

There's a difference between calling a man a known rapist based on prejudice, and saying you're not absolutely sure he isn't based on being careful. One is sexist, the other isn't.

What's your alternative solution? How can women solve the dilemma of knowing that few men are rapists, but you can't tell by looking at them? 

It's a weak anology because if you're mugged it's not nearly as likely to be by a black man, as it is that you're raped by a man.",0,1327411960,,,0,c3k42v2,t3_onnem,14.0,t1_c3jyyko,42554,1428230664,1,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1300575514.0,t2_4zf7m

No, it's not relevant at all. It isn't wrong for someone to say that most muggers are African American because they'd then be missing Mexican/Asian/white mugging threats. It's wrong because MOST African Americans are not muggers, and arguing that it is appropriate to see all of them as potential muggers is a bad argument.

The EXACT same reasoning applies to Schrodinger's rapist. The fact is, even though almost all rapists are men, that still MOST men are not rapists!

And no, I'm NOT saying that women should stop feeling subjective fears, because I recognize that's not in your control most of the time. However, it IS in your control to not make arguments that are clearly faulty and promote the type of logical mistakes that lead to racist thinking.

Like I said, there are plenty of other arguments you can make to justify concern about sexual abuse that DON'T make this mistake. So why on Earth do you go out of your way to save this ONE silly argument that is clearly analogous to racist-types of thinking that you'd immediately discard? You're not being reasonable or consistent here.

And how can you say it's a WEAK analogy to racism? It's the EXACT SAME ARGUMENT, just with the variables changed.

HertzaHaeon,,,"The argument made here is that racism is wrong, but the reality is that people are colored by it and any realistic approach takes this into consideration. That's why people's reaction to a big black guy are understandable, even if they're based on racism. The black guy in this example understands it and modifies his behavior a little to ease people's reactions. It's still shitty for him, but so is it for the people he scare. They're probably mostly nice people.

The fact that it's basically only men that women have to worry about is very relevant. If it wasn't, you'd have a point because women would be missing the risk posed by other women. But they're not.

The argument here isn't that all people are something bad. It's the opposite — most people aren't bad. It's just that you can't tell which ones are, and when making decisions about your own comfort and safety, women will choose to act on this insecurity on the one obvious identity they can see. I think that's an understandable choice among shitty options.

You're dimissing this because of a weak analogy to racism. If that's your best argument, it isn't much. What's more, you're appealing to high principles and objectivity for something that doesn't involve those. You're arguing as of women have chosen to be prejudiced against men and can stop it when they want, but in fact it's a forced reaction to an actual threat.

That's not at all what I'm saying. I'm simply saying that you don't make an argument that is clearly wrong and has racist analogues. You can still be careful around men, just as I will often feel uncomfortable (often for illegitimate reasons) when walking by a group of young people of color. The difference, however, is that I don't try to justify it by saying that people of color are Schrodinger's mugger, because I recognize that's a shitty argument that makes someone's identity the problem.

The fact that you are more likely to be raped by a man than anyone else is irrelevant to this being a terrible argument. If it were the case that you are more likely to be mugged by a person of color, that wouldn't justify saying all people of color are Schrodinger's mugger. Even more telling is that people can and HAVE made that argument, because it is pretty easy to cite prison population racial statistics to support nonsense like that.

So I'll say it again: I'm not saying rape isn't an important issue for feminism. I'm not saying that women can't be wary or careful about sexual abuse.

First of all, not all ""venting"" is catharsis.  For something to be cathartic, it has to have certain qualities.

It refers specifically to drama, and the idea is that by watching characters undergo fluctuations in emotion, the audience experiences those fluctuations also and it releases pent-up emotional energy.  These characters and experiences teach people how they should feel about something; as Aristotle wrote ""men are sometimes too much addicted to pity or fear, sometimes too little; tragedy brings them back to a virtuous and happy mean.""

Therefore, ""venting"" is not cathartic in the true sense of the word.  With catharsis there is a strong sense of bringing people back to how they SHOULD be feeling.  I've always thought the logic behind venting is letting a person feel however they want about something.

Yes, but the implication is wrong. The idea that you can fully 'let out' some kind of feeling is based on nonsense.

Does having sex stop you from wanting to have sex again? Does eating a big meal stop you from wanting to eat a big meal again? 

Even going back to my Buddhist thinking - the only way you can get rid of things is to work let them go, which can be a difficult habit to get into.

Rehearsing ideas and feelings doesn't make something go away - certainly not violent behaviour.
It may give temporary relief, but that's not the same thing.

 KUNDUZ, Afghanistan - An Afghan man killed his wife for giving birth to a third daughter rather than the son he'd hoped for, police said Monday.

 Storai had given birth to the couple's third daughter three months ago in Mohasili village in Afghanistan's northern Kunduz province.

 Nadera Geya, head of the Kunduz women's affairs department, called the killing one of the worst examples of violence against women she had encountered.

 Acid attack Violence against women is common in Afghanistan.

 With foreign combat troops set to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014, and moves ongoing to kickstart a peace process involving the ultra-conservative Taliban, rights watchdogs inside and outside Afghanistan fear women's rights may be sacrificed.

 NBC News reported that President Hamid Karzai announced over the weekend that he will hold a conference in February focused on eliminating violence against women.

If we assume that domestic duties including cooking dinner, doing laundry, gardening, light mantenance, and so on, takes 10 hours a week (and that is very optimistic), it is perfectly reasonable to ask oneself whether, if they worked that extra 10 hours, they could earn more than it would cost to employ someone else to do that work for them: for upper-middle class people, domestic workers are not necessarily irrational, and it might even be sensible for lower-paid workers. Certainly when I can afford it, I shall almost certainly hire some kind of charwoman even if I can't afford a maid or a cook-housekeeper: time spent cleaning would be better used to advance my career.

Thus one must ask if it is moral: for gardeners, maids, cooks, and so on, I don't think it is in and of itself wrong: on the one hand, you are having more money or more free time (or both), on the other, you are employing someone who would otherwise be unemployed.

bikemaul,,,"I don't think tearing down and restarting the social system is possible. 

I hope to see a continuing relaxation of the general roles and expectations of men being providers/protectors and women as nurturers/social/support. How we value these roles will also likely become more equal as the system becomes less rigid. 

I think young adults now integrating into society will in general gravitate towards their gender's traditional role. As long as the basic building block of our society is seen as a single man paired long term with a single woman these roles will be reinforced. 

I think gender roles would be greatly changed if fathers became the primary care giver for children. I don't think most women are willing to give up that role.

On a personal note, as a child I had the idea to dress up for my fourth birthday party in a dress, probably because I liked playing dress up with my big sister. My parents told me I might be unhappy when other people thought the dress was strange. In the end I did not. It made me realize even loved ones could be inflexible.

I do think it's important to teach children to be accepting of non-traditional roles. Yet, gender roles are a reality and it's not fair to force a child into the many difficult situations that do result when they are outside the norm.

On topic: *Triggers* exist for most any traumatic experience.  There is a constant problem in moral and ethical behavior of how we conduct ourselves to not cause harm to others.  Some problems are simple to solve (no physically touching others who don't want to be touched).  Other problems are more complex (what about when our sounds hurt people).  

I still remember the first day of one of my sociology classes, when the professor stood up and announced that if you ever felt like you couldn't take stand being in the class, to just leave the class or to skip that day, but come talk to him.  The reason being, it was a class on child abuse and some of the things we studied there deeply affected even the people who had not history of abuse.  No other class have I ever heard the teacher actively encourage people to walk out if they felt like they couldn't handle it.

Of course, I think there is a major difference between dealing with a group of people who are trying to determine the correct limits to place on their actions because it may trigger some people and dealing with a group of people who don't believe in triggering.

The latter is a problem we have been dealing with in many other realms, people who ignore evidence for evolution or ignore evidence of homosexuality being natural.  And honestly, there isn't really a good solution to dealing with people who ignore evidence that doesn't fit their worldview.

On some level though, it is ironic that some atheist are now on the same side as creationist and homophobes.

&gt; The data is from the US, and considering that women don't outnumber men 3:1, I would conclude that a higher percentage of women attempt suicide.

It's certainly possible and probable given the information in the fact sheet about the teenaged girls. However that specific information on the site doesn't lead to that conclusion. 3x as many female attempts as male attempts doesn't mean that 3x as many women attempted as men. There are lots of possible situations that could lead to that data, because the data is not very good. It could mean that the same number of men attempt and fail to commit suicide, but women try it 3x as much. It could mean that men and women attempt it the same amount, but 3x as many women are suicidal. It could also mean that more men are suicidal, but women who are suicidal try it much more than 3x. All of these things could result in the 3 times as many female attempts, unfortunately, and I think they're pretty substantially different from each other, don't you?

&gt; I assume from your assumption that women's attempts of suicide being common knowledge that you work in or have a personal interest in a field related to the science of behavior.

It was covered in middle and high school. It's also covered in all sorts of news outlets whenever there's a big to-do about suicide which is unfortunately much more regular nowadays with all of the focus on LGBT youth.

If I say I am interested in the number of women who attempt suicide, then that means that I don't want individual women who attempt it twice to be counted twice. What you are doing is counting individuals who attempt it multiple times as being multiple people.

If you count the number of visits to the hospital for suicidal behaviour, then it should count a person once even if they go to the hospital twice. Do you understand how that is different?

One is a potential issue of the repetition of suicide attempts of women, and the other is an issue of the prevalence of suicide attempts among women.

&gt; Now you are adding as an additional request to factor in ""successful"" suicides, which as mentioned earlier, is irrelevant to your original request of comparing attempted suicides.

When I say it's not interesting, I mean because it conveys mostly common knowledge and obscures the details while also being sensationalist.

It doesn't concern itself with the number of women versus the number of men that attempt suicide, but instead the number of times. And also since it reduces it to a comparison, so it doesn't even cover the actual number of times that suicide is attempted. The way the information is presented in the section on students is much more useful as a basis for comparison, but unfortunately it's only focused on a particular age group.

&gt; I do think that the fact that women attempt suicide more than once, after having been intervened on previously is interesting to clinicians in the treatment of depression, bi-polar and other illnesses that commonly lead to suicidal behaviors.

The thing with this is that while you and I both know that women often attempt suicide more than once based on our superior (to the fact sheet) knowledge about this subject, the fact sheet doesn't specifically indicate any such thing. It could quite possibly be a case where 2-3x (or more) women are simply attempting suicide once, and that's why the rate is 2-3x that of men. So while that is sort of interesting but also common knowledge, it's not something that is actually even supported by this fact sheet.

In group B, 1000 people try to kill themselves once each.

In each group, the rate of suicide attempts is the same, but they paint very different pictures.

(And there is the other matter that, in a lot of countries, the policy is that only a person of your own gender can do a physical search. As someone who travels a lot internationally, I was NEVER searched by a man) EDIT: Actually I remember I was once, and the poor boy apologised profusely for it. But that was like once incident in 20+ years of international travel.

My mom is Eastern European, and I know that in the ""iron curtain days"" they were even completely anal about things like beards. My mom knew someone who literally couldn't get into the country because his passport pic had facial hair. Compared to that, some border patrols now are actually mild.

Last time I applied for an international passport, they basically needed a picture that would be easy to recognise by facial recognition software. My dad actually had his fingerprints taken. It's part of the increased paranoia of over-the-top security at airports. They also asked about ""defining characteristics"" like scars or tattoos - and while this is not on my passport, I'm sure it's on file somewhere. I do not like this evolution - but this is the reality of international travel today.

Their interest is to categorize you in as many boxes as possible, because next to being a citizen, you are also a potential terrorist and a potential criminal.

Separately from that, the problem is not necassarily that gender is displayed on ID's. The problem is you can only pick one or the other. If you could add ftm, mtf, or ""other"" - or whatever, the situation would be different. Also, if they truly insist on only searching people by a customs officers of their gender, they should hire trans individuals.

&gt; For those of you who are currently listening to &amp;#039;Look at Me Now&amp;#039; and wondering what the big deal is, a quick recap: The night before the Grammys in 2009, Chris Brown got angry at his girlfriend, Rihanna, and he took it out on her face.

&gt; By blacklisting Chris Brown from the Grammys for a &amp;quot;few&amp;quot; years, the Grammys have gone above and beyond expectations for the social exile of an adult man who hit his girlfriend so hard she went to the hospital, and honestly it was really, really hard for them to show even that much support for victims of domestic violence worldwide.

&gt; The Grammys think that they were the victim of Chris Brown hitting Rihanna in the face.

There are books and books on this, but to try to summarize it in two examples: 

1. My piano teacher was this old Russian woman who grew up in the Crimea.  In her village, all the very old women walked with a severe limp.  
The reason was that when the Turks invaded, they raped all the women and cut their Achilles tendon on the right side so that for the rest of their lives people would know they were trash that had been 'violated' by Turks.  
Sex was used a weapon to shame the entire community, not just the women.

2. In Afghanistan, a man stole another man's property.  To punish him, they raped his sister.  This rendered his property spoiled and thus worthless to sell to a husband later.  

In both cases, the bodies of women are merely property or tools for men to use to shame each other.  This is not uncommon in human history.  ",0,1329710225,,,0,c3syxwe,t3_pwtfl,3.0,t1_c3sxj6c,8641,1428385194,14,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1326656792.0,t2_6o7kp

ibsulon,,,"I'm not sure about the messaging. (Disclosure: white gay male, feminist, totally agree with the message. I've also studied a bit in the mass communication fields and am *only* talking about strategy, and I am also a former Evangelical with insight into that community.)

I can tell you the entire primary and secondary message targets in the IGB campaign. The primary is gay kids at risk. The secondary is older LGBT to fundraise for the Trevor Project.

Who is the target here? Is it conservative women? Is it congress? Is it the media? Those of us who already agree are not called to action. (IE calling your congresscritters.) Those who disagree are unlikely to watch, and further it doesn't target the opponents' messaging. 

The opponents' messaging is, ""If Catholics' freedom of religion can be abridged because of popular consensus, it establishes a precedent that our freedom of religion can be abridged later, and we'll be forced to stop preaching against gays, hire atheists in our churches, and &lt;insert slippery slope argument here."" (Oh, and there are two Catholics and a Libertarian running for office.)

The dog whistle message is that women and men come to the Church in crisis, and this removes yet another opportunity for those people to come to Jesus and live more Christian lives. (Yes, it's BULLSHIT. But it is an important subtext to understand.) Their contention is that the Church should be the central support structure, however ill-equipped it is to provide such a service to their own communities, much less the greater public.

We, as allies, can't approach the subtext. I believe a good strategy for messaging is a call to action for Evangelical women with these points.

1. The health care bill was changed such that insurances are the provider of services, not the churches,
2. As many as 1/3rd of fertilized eggs pass through during a period, never implanted. God obviously does not believe that the fertilized egg is a human being, or he wouldn't allow so many babies to die. (Does anyone have a fact check on this? I remember hearing this at one point.)
3. Our voices matter. Our lives have been improved with birth control. 
4. We have the duty to speak up for those less fortunate than us. (This is the trickiest part, because it gets into some bad stereotypes about poor people and birth control in that community.)

I've heard some people claim that Leet really meant conclusions that reinforce stereotypes, and other things of that nature, but I've never been convinced that she would be so sloppy of a writer.  It's such a simple, powerful definition, and one that doesn't require other more nebulous definitions, such as how large an institution must be, or how we would measure and compare the humiliation of different groups of people.  It gets to the very core of what an oppressive ism is, without making it hard to understand.

There are so many different views as to what really is the core of oppression.

wasserperson,,,"Copied over from my response on her post:

As a White, male, straight, upper-middle class US citizen, I completely agree that my experiences on the receiving end of individual and institutional sexism, racism, classism, heterosexism, &amp; other ""isms,"" don't really amount to an overall experience of oppression.  

I also don't think the frame of ""oppressor"" works very well to describe my experience or my role in society, but I do believe that:
1. I operate within a system of oppressive power dynamics that works to privilege me at the expense of people that aren't like me.
2. My actions can support that system or increase that oppressive dynamic regardless of my beliefs or intents.
3. People oppressed by that system should decide for themselves who their oppressors are, and what that word means, and while I hope to be seen as an ally, if I'm not, then I generally have at least as much if not more power to help change that.

In my conversations with other White people, I hear a lot of confusion about the difference between oppression, discrimination, prejudice, &amp; so on.  I think the messiness of vocabulary &amp; the rarity of good dialogue makes for lots of evasive, sloppy thinking.  I think it's uncomfortable to reconcile my internal sense of myself as a good person with the idea that I am complicit in a system of very bad things.  &amp; it's easy to default to a reductionist position of ""I've struggled too, &amp; I've been judged/discriminated/constrained because of my gender/skin color/sexuality too.""

Struggle isn't the same as oppression; racism isn't the same as prejudice; etc.  

I think, personally, the ""oppressor/oppressed"" distinction isn't very useful when looking at the United States, because we're pretty far removed from the kind of feudalism or stark Marxist class boundaries where that term originates.  &amp;, as I understand our history, most of our social progress has come through intersectional alliances, not through stark revolutionary conflicts.  Again, though, that's the view that currently best fits my knowledge, &amp; I don't have a monopoly on logic or information.  Even working just from what I personally know, I can make an intellectual case for the more binary oppressor/oppressed distinctions in the US.  So, just because I don't see the frame as useful doesn't mean no one can, does, or should.  &amp;, honestly, I do think there's a lot of White men in specific, and US people in general, who have trouble saying, ""I don't think that's the best way of looking at _____, but I can see how you might &amp; I respect your choice.""",0,1330404144,,,0,c3vqqba,t3_q89lk,1.0,t3_q89lk,42813,1428433399,2,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1324680273.0,t2_6i2bj

It can be, but that wasn't my particular issue. I'm not an indoctrinated soul, but some of my family is Christian and it really bothers me when the atheist community, for instance, argues that nothing good ever came of Christianity, or makes generalizations about people and their religions that they honestly know nothing about.

The uneducated atheist tells us that because he was raised to obey rules that make no sense to him, and taught these rules in ways that did not better him as a person, the entire religion is defunct and should be abolished. But he didn't retain any of the knowledge about the religion or its history/customs, and refuses to consider possibilities other than whatever was shoved down his throat when he was too young to understand it.

Our culture in the United States has granted much privilege to white, heteronormative Christian males. But if I fit into three of those categories instead of four, I'm in virtually the same privilege boat as nearly any other person who is any combination of three. Social privilege doesn't really stem from religion; they stem from something else within us all. We are all capable of hatred, intolerance and bigotry. Some of us choose to use religion to reinforce it. Some of us choose to use *the lack of* religion to reinforce it - and there, you have the /r/atheism community, in my experience.

They're just a very embittered people, /r/atheism. They come from a culture that rejects and reviles them, in most cases - assuming the majority of them are Americans. I understand why they might feel that way, I just think that as long as the community is full of young people - the way the site is just churning in new young people every day, keeping the demographic young - no one there can offer the insights of anyone who has moved past the anger.

dada_,,,"Well, I'm glad there's finally some account of the kind of place /r/mensrights is. This is actually a very benign description of the place.

One of their central illusions is that society is right now being sustained entirely by men, because women are worthless, and that an economic collapse followed by a bloody revolution, during which men secure their rights as the superior gender, is inevitable. People have been advised (incidentally, by commenters who got voted up) that buying a gun is a good way to prepare for when this occurs.

Underscoring just how deranged these people are is the fact that none of this is particularly controversial, nor does it get voted down. At least never when I was paying attention. It's not the opinion of a small subsection of crazy people.

I actually think a place like this is dangerous, when you take into account the massive attack on women's rights and women's healthcare in the US right now, and the fact that so many women still suffer from severe domestic violence. Here's a subsection of Reddit dedicated to indoctrinating people on how women are the source of all their problems, and women are the ones who secretly control whether you have a job, and women are the ones using up all your hard earned money and giving you nothing in return.

dada_,,,"&gt; Some people, feminists included, are *doing it wrong*. I fully accept that. Militant feminism, brutal denigration of men, etc., is not the right way.

The reason why I don't really think it's worth talking about ""militant feminism"" and the deliberate misandrists is because they barely exist. It's the most marginal group within feminism and has virtually no power whatsoever in society—other than the power vested in them by the patriarchy so that they can be used to defame feminism. They have no political influence to speak of.

Besides that, a lot of these so-called misandrists, if you bother looking at what they write and how they think, are really just being deliberately facetious about the whole thing. It's a way of reminding people that *actual* gender hatred (namely, the kind that men perpetrate, which is the only one worth talking about) does exist and is worthy of condemnation.

brightifrit,,,"I think it's unfortunate that men accused of rape are sometimes guilty until proven innocent. On the other hand, it was legal for a husband to rape his wife in the US until 1997. And most women who actually report rape face social stigma and blaming. There are cases where the men need better justice, but there is much improvement to be done on the women's side as well. The attitude I find with Men's Rights is that while rape is bad, they're defining it much more strictly than it should be defined. If a woman decides to stop having sex halfway through and the guy forces her to continue, that is still rape. Unfortunately that's not what I hear around Men's Rights sites. ""It was her fault,"" ""she was the one making out with him,"" and that sort of thing, seem to come up a lot. It's as if they think that because there are some cases where the woman has used rape accusations as a tool to harm others, that means that all rape cases should be instead treated as if the woman is guilty of false accusation until she proves she's innocent. 

As for ""chivalry"", now there is a system that ultimately benefits no one. Chivalry was a code of behavior for knights in the Middle Ages that dictates how one was supposed to show respect to other knights. This included showing respect to the other knights through the way you treated things that belonged to them, such as their horses, serfs, and wives. That's right, chivalry is all about treating women and horses in a way that won't offend their owners. It was romanticized in the Victorian era and turned into the nasty pedestal people take it for today. I would like for it to go away, for everyone's sake.

brightifrit,,,"Say we have two groups of 3-year-olds. One group has ten cookies. the other has five. Someone comes and gives the group with five cookies another five, so they have just as many as the first group. Now the first group starts complaining. Why is the other group getting more cookies? It's not fair! Those cookies should be taken away so that things can be fair again.

Men's Rights is like that.

Our culture discriminates against both sexes. Men are sometimes labeled as stupid, lacking sexual self control, and being unable to do things like parent and cook, when if any of these things are the case it is purely because men have been raised to believe that they are this way. The pressure that men in more conservative subcultures receive to be the sole providers for their family is enormous, and has a tendency to absorb their entire identity. This is not to the same level as women experience with being moms, but it is still a real problem. There is still work to be done on both sides. But this is not the same as believing that rights are being taken away from men. Privileges? Yes. It's certainly a privilege to have a wife that is legally considered your property, who legally can't refuse sex with you, can't divorce you, can't cheat on you but is forced to watch you do whatever you'd like, who is expected to take care of the children, run errands, cook, and clean all day, be fresh for you when you come home, keep working while you rest, and then have sex after the kids go to bed. That is what things were like for women 100 years ago. The Men's Right's movement wants that back. Seeing the women with an equal number of cookies makes them feel like they have less now, so they want those cookies taken away so things can be the way they were.

SarahLee,,,I agree.

dorky2,,,"That's what I thought too.  It takes a lot of force, more than a 'smack' to bloody a child's mouth.

I subscribed to [/r/mensrights](/r/mensrights) for awhile when I first heard about it.  I thought they had some legitimate concerns, especially about the courts favoring mothers in child custody disputes and about how false rape/child abuse accusations can ruin a man's life.  But it became apparent that a lot of the guys on there actually just think that women are like a separate species, and that as a group we are hurting men and preventing them from living the lives they deserve to live.  They said hateful things about 'females,' not even using the word 'women' much of the time. I get that boys and men are struggling with their changing role in society, which is less clearly defined than it was even 30 years ago.  I get that there is unfairness out there that some men have found themselves on the wrong side of.  But hating feminists, and sometimes women in general, to the point of violence, will not get them the things they want.  Nor will it teach us a lesson.",0,1331439390,,,0,c3zrwgj,t3_qq646,2.0,t1_c3zni7a,30670,1428503666,10,False,feminisms,t5_2qhba,,1273878858.0,t2_424xm
