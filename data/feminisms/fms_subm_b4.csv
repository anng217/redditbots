I've been a ""fan"" of Planned Parenthood and the services it offers to women for a long time. I consider myself a Pro-Choice feminist and I think that all women deserve a place where they can access contraception, sex education material, and other services. I'm going to school to be a social worker and I've told many people that I'd like to work at a place like Planned Parenthood in the future, and advocate for the kind of sex education and access to info and services that everyone deserves.

That said, I hadn't had any first hand experiences with Planned Parenthood until today. Maybe I was wrong to expect it to be a place where people truly cared about the people walking through the door, or maybe they do and I'm just expecting too much. However, I felt really let down. What do you guys make of my experience, and what have your experiences been?

Here's what happened today:
I saw on the website that Planned Parenthood takes walk-ins on Mondays and Wednesdays until 4:30. I called several times (probably 9 or 10 times) over a couple of hours trying to talk to someone in the office to see if they could see me and ask questions about testing prices. No one answered, and on two of those 9 or 10 calls I stayed on hold for over 30 minutes hoping someone would pick up the phone. No one ever did, so I drove up there.

It was a 45 minute drive and I had to pay for parking. The person in the clinic turned both me and the woman in front of me away for walk-in appointments. I wasn't that upset about that, after all it was about 2:30 and I know how doctor's offices can get. But I was upset that no one answered my phone calls, and when I asked the woman at the desk about it she said there were no phones in the office, I'd have to talk to the call center. She gave me the number for the call center, which was the same number I called earlier. The woman in line in front of me also said no one had answered her calls.

So I walked across the hall to the door marked ""administration."" I talked to the woman there about my concerns and she said she couldn't help me, I needed to talk to the call center. She said she'd get me someone to talk to, and proceeded to call a bunch of people on her phone at her desk. None of them answered, and she said the manager was in a meeting and couldn't talk to me. She couldn't give me any kind of explanation. So I left...

I was upset, but I made sure to be very polite and understanding with everyone I talked to. I wasn't rude. Am I just expecting too much of a busy doctor's office, or do I have a right to be upset? Have other people had experiences like mine?",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,What kind of experiences have you had with Planned Parenthood?,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/o9v1b/what_kind_of_experiences_have_you_had_with/,,,,

Although she has had two full panel STD tests since then that have come back negative for everything, she is obsessed with the idea that she contracted something as a result of the rape. She believes that if she does turn out to have a chronic and/or fatal STD (HIV, hepatitis, herpes, etc.) she will have no choice but to commit suicide. There are deeper pre-existing clinical issues involved her than ""just"" the rape. If she wasn't obsessive, anxious, or suicidal about the rape it would be about something else, and I'm working with her on that. Lots of specific background stuff I cannot get into. However, she has expressed that hearing how other rape survivors who contracted an STD as a result of their rape/assault have managed to not only survive but to live and thrive would really help her. She really cannot imagine living with a chronic and/or fatal STD, so seeing how others can do so might make a difference with her.

I have Googled the heck out of this, and have come up with nada. If anyone can share a link or two with me I would really appreciate it. Or if you can share your own story if this scenario applies to you. Books or things I would have to go out and buy won't really work for my purposes as I need things I can print out from the computer at work. Again, I'm looking for stories from rape/assault survivors who contracted an STD as a result of the incident and have gone on to live healthy &amp; productive lives. Anything would help - long stories, short stories, autobiographical, biographical, formal, casual, male, female, whatever.

Thanks in advance!

Btw, just to cover my bases - yes, I've already done lots of psychoeducation with her on sexual violence, gender issues/feminism, and found her a local sexual violence survivor support group she can go to once she's left our facility. I am a doctor, after all :-) And I'm also aware that the odds that she has an STD at this point that didn't show up on the tests she's gotten thus far is slim to none.

Girls are all different of course. Instead of making broad assumptions about females as a whole, [I went and asked them how they felt about this sort of thing](http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/general-discussion/how-does-it-make-you-feel-when-you-post-a-picture-on-the-net/t.76820799_recent/).

Pretty much every response has been different:

* so go0o0o0d [sarcasm?]
* it's funny
* [a gif of a girl shrugging her shoulders]
* flattered but uncomfortable
* Objectified
* Pissed off
* i get a headache 
* It just shows how immature they are
* A little flattered
* I'd be flattered
* It doesn't phase me. I just ignore them. I've been on the internet way too long for it to still affect me.
* Awkward, and nervous, but interested.

The sample of girls that posted in this thread clearly doesn't represent the female population as a whole, but it does a good job of demonstrating that there's a diversity of opinions out there.

The moral of the story? The polite thing to do is to get to know what sort of remarks a woman is and is not comfortable with hearing, probably by asking her, before considering making a sexual remark about one of her photos.

So now I'm wondering, when [threads like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/nquef/fapfapfapfapfapfapfap_potentially_nsfw/) are at +700 is it that redditors have no interest in being polite?

I realize that a petition is no guarantee of anything happening, but I'd hoped to find more support. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but I honestly can't understand it.

Ooh, first the kid shows that he works at manual labor with a distinctly all-male crew (and one techno-dinosaur). Then the kid takes the truck over to a stereotypically feminine doll (colored pink, of course, and standing next to a pink My Little Pony) who has no idea how to haul her own goods and needs Captain Truckfucker to roll up in his gas-guzzling shithound and do it for her. Fast forward and the kid rolls up to the dollhouse representing ""home"", and who is his wife, but none other than Lara Croft? The camera hilariously focuses on her bare stomach and large breasts. Then the man-sized version of this asshole comes home, whereupon the kid runs right up to him (past his mom) and loses his shit. (Not shown in this version of the commercial; there's an alternate floating around somewhere that I saw on TV earlier showing her, while also minimizing the focus on Lara Croft.)

It's all the subtle things. There's rape; there's domestic violence; and then there's all the insidious little, subtle, psychological images that reinforce traditional roles. Right here, it's the woman being helpless to do physical work or being a hot piece of ass who stays home all day while the man is out braving the dangers of hauling heavy shit around. Pathetic.

It's nice to see everyone again.

I was eating dinner with my family tonight, wearing my old karate pants. I've had them for upwards of 5 years so they're kind of small-- when I sit they go up to just below my knees.

Now, I don't shave my legs. I have made the decision that I personally do not want to do it, and that I think that others can do what they please but I think no one should feel the need to. There are many more reasons to shave than not to shave, in my opinion, or at least an equal amount, and the reasons to shave are more artificial. And more importantly, when I was very young I always thought, ""I can't wait to have body hair, it'll mean I'm grown up"" and then when I grew up that ended up not being something to aspire to-- women're supposed to shave it all so they don't look like ~~adult women~~ men. Enough! Women have enough to be self conscious about, and I'm a self-conscious, anxious type of person. I'm self conscious about the way I think, write, speak, and look, just as much as anyone else and more in some cases. I have enough to be nervous about in my life. 

The problem? I'm one of those women, of all women, who ""*needs""* to shave. Oh *yes,* I have extremely pale skin, and extremely dark, thick hair. I do not have fair, thin, light brown hair. I am not blonde. I am not a red-head. I am not someone ~~whose hair is impossible to see~~ *looks good* unshaved.


And to make matters a bit more unfortunate, while I was away from home I got an incredible quantity of mosquito bites, which I scratched like a madman. Normally I wouldn't, but I would wake up in the night and go wild half-asleep, and in the morning I would have to wear rubber boots every day because I was doing an ecology project in the rivers, which caused chafing even when I wasn't scratching. So now I have a lot of really visible blemishes, and they're not pretty.


So I'm eating my dinner, and my dad gets one look at my legs and gets completely shocked. Yes, he pointed out the blemishes, and I agreed that they look bad and I shouldn't have scratched as much as I did. But then he says more or less:

&gt;Jesus Christ! You practically have more hair than I do! What if you ever wanted to go out and wear a dress, you know, *look nice*, or wear a swim suit? You should go shave it right away, although from the looks of it, it may take you about a year!

First of all, I do not wear dresses. This is simply a matter of personal preference that I've had forever. I've never liked them, I simply prefer other clothing, and it doesn't even suit me (the last time I wore a dress my best friends laughed at me and I laughed at myself because I truly look ridiculous in one). Anyway, I protested to dad that it is winter so no one will see my leg hair (although in truth I don't shave in the summer, either.) His response was the kicker for me:

&gt;It doesn't matter! If anyone were to see it, think what they'd *think of you*? They'd be disgusted!

After washing my plate I promptly left the room (and started crying eventually, I admit), and he sincerely apologized... for... what he said about the bug bites. And he kept on repeating, ""Aw. Don't be so sensitive about what I said, don't be sensitive and let what I say offend you. It's not so bad, you'll just put on the cream and it'll get better.""

I wasn't being overly sensitive... I don't like it when people insult me like that. That wasn't just criticism, it was ridicule. My dad's a funny guy, he's great at ridicule, and it's hilarious to be on the receiving end sometimes, especially when he has a good point or valid opinion. But this time I felt it was really offensive. I don't feel I need to justify why I do what I do to anyone. That's my business. If you are actually curious about why someone does something, ask them a question about it. Feel free to disagree. But my dad, as much as I love him, doesn't exactly think that way about this type of thing-- the fact that I may be doing something out of opinion, or that there is an opinion to be had on the matter, so I can't exactly expect that type of critical thinking. He's smart, and a critical thinker, but just not about this, I guess. I guess I expected a member of my own family to at least not be judgmental about what I do with my body if it's something as benign as shaving.

------
Interesting other feminism-related observation: I wore a blazer, pants, and tie to prom for fun. People repeatedly referred to the outfit as ""smart"" as in ""a smart choice,"" one specific reason being that I would have comfy feet during prom. Does that make people who wear dresses-- and therefore practically *need* dressy shoes, heels, sandals, or slippers-- are considered un-smart in peoples' minds? What a bizarre association for people to make.

Girls are not born less angry and more anxious, they’re rewarded for being less angry and more anxious. So, it should come as no surprise to anyone that large groups of stressed out girls and women collectively facing the dissolution of a cohesive social structure might be more disposed to fall prey to mass psychosis. It is arguable that men and boys experience similarly jarring episodes of anger and anxiety-channelling mass psychosis, but we call it male aggression and fund military industrial complexes to deal with it.”

My mom had her back turned towards us, but was just listening to our conversation.  

My niece grabbed my college ring off my hand and put it on her own finger.  
me: ""well one day you'll have one of those too!"", 
my mom without turning around:""only if she wants one"".  
me: ""oh, she is just playing with my college ring,"" 
my mom: ""Oh!  Yes you'll have one of those sweetie... but you don't have to get married unless you want to""

It made me smile so much because when I was a kid in the 80's I was told by this same lady that normal women get married, and go to college only if they want to, but wasn't expected to get a career.  I'm just so proud of how far my mom's views have changed.  She of course WANTED me to go to college and have a career, but didn't expect it, but she did certainly seem to expect me to get married... which I did towards the end of my 20's to a guy that I dated for 8 years (and have been best friends with since we were kids), though even our marriage would have been considered a big deal 50 years ago since we are of mixed ethnicity.

Sometimes I just like to step back and marvel at our progress... that is all.

I'm only trying to acquire a better understand of feminism and male rights and egalitarianism and how they all fit together.

Are there currently any efforts within feminist groups to repeal patriarchal laws which are benignly sexist, but which appear to the layperson as being 'female privilege'? 

E.g. - Selective Service in the US. To the ignorant (no menace intended) it appears that this is 'female privilege'. However, of course it's obviously actually a form of patriarchal institutionalized benign sexism. 

So what is being done about it? Whether feminist or not, we can probably all agree from an egalitarian position that selective service in the US should be both female and male, or neither. However, when I was searching for efforts to repeal selective service, the only person I could find who has actually been trying to repeal it is Ron Paul (and I don't think it's necessary for me to elaborate on why feminists have a problem with Paul.)

I admit that I'm not the most well versed in feminism nor male-rights, but from trying to learn the arguments of the male rights perspective and of the female rights perspective and of the human rights perspective, it seems to me that the polarization between groups  (outright misogyny and misandry excluded) often comes down statements along the lines of ""why don't you care about my grievances"" and ""why don't you think my concerns are important."" So going back to my original question, are there rights campaigns trying to do this?

I would appreciate any discussion or insight to this :)",feminisms,t5_2qhba,default,Repealing benign sexism laws?,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/ozirb/repealing_benign_sexism_laws/,,,,

My definition, based largely on online discussions:

Privilege is some ""thing"" that 

1) makes your life easier, or more frictionless, 

2) due to your membership in a specific group,

3) relative to another group

So the common example of not getting harassed by the police is part of your privilege only if you live in a society where there is racial or age-based profiling.  If everyone has that kind of freedom, then it's just status quo, not privilege.

Am I right? Or is the concept more complicated than that?

A few interesting questions came up:

1) Why the word ""privilege"" instead of ""disadvantage"" or ""inequity""? Is it just rhetoric, or is there a deeper reason for the word? After all, most examples of the word seem to be pointing to things that we think should be universal but aren't, so the idea that being free is somehow a ""privilege"" is a little strange.  

2) Am I right that privilege is only meaningful when making comparisons between groups? Example: If everyone in the world were able to walk around alone at night without fear, then would it no longer be considered part of one's privilege? 

3) Is it feminism's goal to remove all privilege (is privilege necessarily something ""bad"" that we want to eradicate)? In that case, doesn't that mean that feminism is working towards removal of group identity? What exactly is the point of talking about privilege?

4) Is privilege necessarily bound with ideas of power and dominance, or are they separate (though related) issues?

5) Has the concept changed over the years? I know that feminist discourse has evolved a lot over the last 30 years or so. And in general feminists used to be more on the offensive because things were much more imbalanced than they are now.

I have heard this a couple times from women who seem to think that being a feminist means that you aren't supposed to give men oral sex or do the ""doggy style"" position. 

I am a feminist. I know that I should have complete control over my body, and the things that I choose to do with it.I believe that I should make just as much money as a man would after I graduate from college. To me being feminist is about standing up for our rights and KEEPING our rights that we have, and fighting for the ones we don't.

I know that feminism means different things to different women, but come on. This just irks my nerves when I hear women say this! 

Therefore, it is my RIGHT to give my boyfriend oral sex. He isn't forcing me to do it, he doesn't make me feel bad if I don't do it, and he reciprocates.

The other 50% of the time I'm pretty ambivalent about it. Even in life, I'm not the kind of person who is tied to the idea of getting married or even finding a partner who will be ""the love of my life"". I completely believe that as humans, we want to find passion in something. I just never wanted my passion to come from or be dependent on someone else. I still don't and most probably never will. I think that's why this particular scene just got me.


Margaret: I will never be one of those women who can stay silent on the arm of her husband. One's own life must matter, Dennis.

Denis Thatcher: That's why I want to marry you, my dear.


It was just incredibly moving that the thing that Margaret Thatcher's husband loved most about her was the fact that she was her own person and not just your typical ""feminine"" woman. He loved that she was independent minded and wanted her life's work to matter. If in the future I am every lucky enough to meet a guy who was honestly and truly that respectful and supportive of who I am as a PERSON rather than as a woman, I would marry him in a heartbeat. At the same time, if it doesn't happen I won't be heartbroken.

I'd really appreciate any input from anyone willing share their thoughts...

1. In the Western world, is it a more radical act of feminism to wear hijab, or to abandon it? What about in the Middle East?

2. Do you/have you ever veiled? Why/why not?

3. Can fundamentalist Muslim women live peacefully with Western feminists, or would accommodating each other cost us both our principles?

“Visionary feminism is a wise and loving politics. It is rooted in the love of male and female being, refusing to privilege one over the other. The soul of feminist politics is the commitment to ending patriarchal domination of women and men, girls and boys. Love cannot exist in any relationship that is based on domination and coercion. Males cannot love themselves in patriarchal culture if their very self-definition relies on submission to patriarchal rules. When men embrace feminist thinking and practice, which emphasizes the value of mutual growth and self-actualization in all relationships, their emotional well-being will be enhanced. A genuine feminist politics always brings us from bondage to freedom, from lovelessness to loving.”

Rape is when a person violates another person in the most despicable, degrading way imaginable and among the myriad of terrible things humans can do to one another, rape is among the worst.

In this AMA:

He says, here (http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q9qzn/iama_former_nasa_space_shuttle_engineer_created/c3vz0j8)
:

&gt;A man who tries to solve a woman's problems typically ends up with no money, no relationship and a severe drinking problem. He also reveals that he just doesn't understand women.
The perfect response to hearing a woman start talking about her problems is to sit down and listen -- fully and sincerely, and offering no solutions. Brew some coffee. Take the phone off the hook. Cancel your appointments. And it can't hurt to say ""Life is so unfair!"" from time to time. But a man who ""takes it to the next level,"" who offers to solve a woman's problems, simply doesn't get it.
To me personally, women represent the greatest waste of human potential ever -- people who should be scientists, leaders, thinkers, Nobel Prizewinners, and who are more than fully qualified to do all those things, but who instead complain about how unfair life is, and how it's all the fault of men.

Between his bizzare anti-psychology stuff, and this crap, why does this stuff get upvoted on reddit?

Not really a big age difference. I guess we're both part of the same generation, but it doesn't feel like it.

She's taking a gender studies class in college now, but not because she cares about it. I lent her my copy of ""The Handmaid's Tale"" (one of my favs) which was required reading for the course, but I don't think she's read it, nor do I think she cares.

I've tried to send her interesting articles on stuff relating to feminism and the conservative war on reproductive rights in America, but she never responds or says anything about it.

I was hoping her class would teach her some things, but she once mentioned what they were doing and it really made me worry. It was a while ago so the details are fuzzy, but I remember her saying how they weren't going to be discussing theory or anything, and that the professor was putting all these artificial restrictions on debate.

What upsets me the most is how apathetic she, and seemingly all her friends her age, are about their rights as human beings! They have no interest in what's going on around them!

She's never lived in a pre-Roe v Wade world. (Nor have I, but I at least appreciate the difference) She's able to walk into any walgreens and buy contraceptive. She's able to walk into an abortion clinic and get an abortion if it comes to that. She doesn't seem to realize that this might not be possible in the vary near future.

She doesn't seem to realize that in politics, women aren't human beings with rights, rather, they are an assembly of parts to be regulated and controlled. 

I've tried to get through to her, but whenever I bring up feminism I get weird looks from her and everyone else I know. (Because clearly, a man can't be a feminist since all feminists are raging dykes who burn their bras)

Not to mention that she takes amazing care of me. Also, the sex is fantastic.

What distracts me is that she had apparently gained a significant ) amount of weight just before I met her. (i.e now she is 5' 2'' and 170ish lbs. When we were getting ready for a party, none of her dresses fit) When we were looking through her facebook photos together, when I see her from about a year or two ago, I said ""Wow, you look GREAT."" It turns out that at that time, she had an eating disorder.

I've been in three long-term relationships (i.e 2+ years), and have dated many women. The majority of them have been very petite. Additionally, I train in a very demanding sport, and am in pretty good shape, personally. The shape of her body makes me less inclined to marvel at her, in the way that I marvel at her intelligence or creativity. I'm afraid that she'll catch wind of my apprehension, and harm herself to satisfy me. A very selfish part of me would like it if she lost weight.

I understand that the fact that I focus on her physical body- and that I compare it to a misogynistic standard of beauty- means that I'm totally supporting the patriarchy, and more importantly, could be harming her. I don't want to be an asshole. So, feminisms

- Where is the line between preference and patriarchy?
- If I've been conditioned to measure women up to a certain standard, how do I 'uncondition' myself?

""Sen. Greg Reed, R-Jasper, voted to move Senate Bill 12 out of committee last week because he said it’s a good bill that would help “a mother to understand that a live baby is inside her body.”""

Sen. Reed is not a woman.  He is not capable of childbirth.  He seems to find it difficult to understand the concept of a fetus forming inside a person.  I get the impression that just because HE can't understand that he assumes women also can't.  Except, a pregnant woman would be a better authority of what's going on inside her.  She's the one in the situation, she would know better the gravity.   

It just seems to me a lot of these anti-women bills are created on the insecurity of male congresspeople, projecting their own inability to understand an issue onto those it actually affects.   It almost even seems that these congressmen assume women can't know better than they, demonstrating extreme arrogance and a further need for diversity in political representation.",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,is it just me or do Congressmen in support of the state-sanctioned rape bill seem to think because they can't comprehend a womens issue than neither can a woman?,http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/q9wi5/is_it_just_me_or_do_congressmen_in_support_of_the/,,,,

But then, I had a very affirming thought..

My story *IS* common; so common that even those of us who have similar experiences almost never seem to realize the significance.

I was born into a world obsessed with technology. When I was born, we were on the verge of the internet. Quite a few kids had gaming systems, the rest had an almost constant stream of television and/or movies, and soon we would all have our own computers. Even in those days, I was aware that I was transsexual. 

I remember how excited I felt when I turned on Mario 2 for the very first time and saw that I could play as Princess Peach. It was such a silly little thing, but getting to be her meant so much to me. Before that I had been Mario, Luigi, Megaman, Link, and a slew of other male characters (plus Samus who I had no idea was female), but I felt no connection with any of them. I didn't want to save princesses, I wanted to be one.

I didn't have a lot of friends, but those I did make tended to be female. We grew up together with similar experiences, reveling in our imaginations together, while almost no adults were watching. I would play the male roles when I needed to, letting the cis girls be the princesses, but when I could, I was just one of the girls.

My entire childhood was that way, I have nothing but happy memories of it. But then, as childhoods tend to do, mine began to end. I was thrown into a moderated world, where children were put into a sifter and the girls were sprinkled onto one side of the playground and the boys were dumped on the other. I wasn't allowed to play that way anymore, I was only allowed to be friends with the boys, I had to play with imaginary guns, trucks, and a bunch of turtles who somehow had become ninjas. I couldn't be a princess anymore; if I were, I would be ridiculed for it.

So, I continued on, grew up, and became more and more displaced. Going into puberty, I was disgusted with myself and what was happening to me. I was quiet, completely disconnected, and by that time, had no friends whatsoever. I was completely ridiculed by other kids on a regular basis, which was easy to do because I *never* filled the roles they expected me to. My grades dropped off to nothing, I shut down, and completely stopped caring about myself. I wasn't even a teenager yet and I was already waiting to die.

My mom, who thankfully was perceptive enough to notice what was happening to me (though she had no idea the actual cause) pulled me out of school. I was lucky enough to be home-schooled through most of Jr. High/High School. It was during that time I was home-schooled that the internet boom happened, and all of our lives were changed forever, but perhaps none more than my own. I had a space where I could, finally, be myself again. I think I was only online for about a week before I began creating a female persona and presenting myself as one across the entire internet. I barely ever existed on the internet as anything at all but female.

I still struggled with it, mostly internally, because the voices of my moderated development were still screaming at me to be male, but I continually rejected them. I pushed through, continued to develop my persona, and made so many friends again. My friends only existed digitally to me, as did I to them, and not one ever knew what I really was or treated me any differently than a real girl. It was perfect, I had never been so content.

Eventually I went back to school, but by then most everyone had grown up. Our socializations had sunk in so well, and everyone just became so busy and found so many other things to worry about that no one openly ridiculed anyone anymore, but the split was still there; it was still just as hard to have female friends. I fell in with the nerds, the largely male, yet generally gender-neutral social rejects. I got into reading and writing, D&amp;D, anime, etc. I was male with those friends, but carried on with my female life online, where I would dump all of my day's experiences (pre-facebook/twitter even) and bring my female persona to life. My real life became a feeding tube for my internet life. It was odd, and a lot like living a life for someone else, but it kept me feeling alive.

The internet continued to develop, so did I, and eventually I met someone who would change everything. She quickly became my best friend, and eventually the love of my life. At first, she thought I was male, but when I recognized how in love we were, I couldn't keep my double-life a secret. When I told her the truth, she taught me the single most important thing I've ever learned: It's okay to be what I am. 

As she accepted and even lifted me up, I began to accept myself, and my two lives finally began to finally merge into one. I became happy, I was finally able to start being myself with someone. And from there, I grew. I told all of my friends, most of whom accepted me; I told my family, who had a little trouble at first, but then began to understand what they had been seeing my entire life and how this had affected me, and they accepted me too.

Today, no one needs to know at all that I ever led a double-life. I am the woman I was always meant to be. My body, mind, and soul are, for the first time in my life, completely united.

I'm a fairly typical modern-day transsexual. Looking back on my life, I recognize that it was easy. Apart from a few teachers and a handful of cruel kids, I never had any real hardships that existed outside of my own mind and body. 

So, my story might not be that interesting, but there is something very significant I've found in it. I, like a vast majority of transsexuals, was socialized to be female from the very beginning. Outside of narrow-minded moderated societal influence based entirely on who had a penis and who had a vagina in elementary school, which I rejected as completely as I could, there was a vast, open, technological world that I clung to, which lifted me above that tiny filtered elementary school world.

I am far from an anthropological expert, I only have my own experiences and perceptions, but I believe that with a little bit of study, we transsexuals are going to one day prove conclusively what feminists have been pushing for for decades. **TL;DR: Sex (the body) and gender (the socialized mind) are completely separate entities.**",feminisms,t5_2qhba,self,How I Became Me: The Story of One Woman's Socialization [x-post from r/lgbt],http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/qwfhh/how_i_became_me_the_story_of_one_womans/,,,,

Here is my problem - and please, bear with me, this is my first foray into feminism - I am struggling to deconstruct the poem separate from its AIDS context, and place it in more of a lesbian continuum/sisterhood feminism argument.

If this is better suited to the literary forums I apologize, as I am just studying feminism for the first time, I am hoping for some feminist input not limited to exclusively literary studies.

In this hostile corridor by Cheryl Clarke

A quickening nostalgia suffuses

me, this late evening fin de siecle

between two endangered sites.

The marvelous

have been blighted by

a blood borne scourge.

Flamboyantly frail, good looking,

still marvelous

you nourish these failing geographies.

As I face your graceful soliticitous-

ness over the counter

of this nasty KFC

and am dazzled by your articulated brows,

applied mascara

discrete texture of  facial skin.

Cultivated nails.

You recognize me too—

my precise haircut.
