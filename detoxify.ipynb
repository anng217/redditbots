Here it is:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is clear that [r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/) explicitly rejects mainstream liberal feminism. \\'Tis even more evident that [r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/) sits in contention with less mainstream(but relevant) sects of radical feminism. Like my previous post, if you want me to expand on any of my points or definitions, please ask as these are all gross simplifications.\\r\\n\\r\\n**1: liberal/mainstream feminism**\\r\\n\\r\\nDefining what feminism exactly is turns out to be difficult, it is *just* a label and the label does not really tell you anything useful about a person\\'s beliefs in a lot of contexts and the label is quite arbitrary. When I refer to \"liberal\" or \"mainstream\" feminism what I am talking about are people who hold some or all of the following views:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Men and women are equal\\r\\n* Pornography/sex work is empowering\\r\\n* Pro-choice\\r\\n* Pro-transgender attitudes\\r\\n* Black feminism\\r\\n* Celebrity feminism(think Emma Watson or Beyonce)\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course there are more beliefs than this, but this is generally the trend. These beliefs are what would be held by a young American college student or some random Blue Pill woman on [r/TheBluePill](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/) might believe.\\r\\n\\r\\n**2: fringe/radical feminism**\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are more fringe examples of feminism such as TERF or contemporary Marxist feminists. These groups explicitly reject liberal feminism on most grounds(rejecting sex work as empowering on the case of TERFs not having pro-transgender attitude. We will call these types *radical* feminists because they mirror the second wave radical feminist movements in many ways. Some beliefs they might hold are:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Lesbian separatism\\r\\n* Gender nihilism\\r\\n* Anti-sex work and anti-pornography\\r\\n* Class-based analyses\\r\\n* Pro-choice\\r\\n* Anti-family\\r\\n* Anti-religious\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course some of these views do contradict each other in a sense(it is because it is not typically the same people simultaneously believing this and even if it was it does not matter in this context due to this being strictly an attempt at a vague description) and some are compatible with more mainstream liberal feminist attitudes, but some are not.\\r\\n\\r\\n**3:** [r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/)\\r\\n\\r\\n[r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/) is a subreddit that claims to give women dating advice, of course this is not the case. There is also many criticisms of men on there, attitudes women can hold, memes etc. that are clearly not just dating advice. You can check the top posts all of all time and the flair guides at the bottom to probably get a better idea of what the subreddit *actually* is. Anyway here is the subreddit description:\\r\\n\\r\\n&gt;Effective dating strategy for women that know what they want and prefer to be able to take control of their dating lives. Also includes strategies to maintain a relationship that benefits you. Plus tips on how to deal with some of the negative strategies from men that you encounter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will take this at face value, because it is not technically incorrect in the sense that it is not telling any lies, but rather omitting some information about the subreddit\\r\\n\\r\\n**4: normative and descriptive disconnect**\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of ideologies share underlying descriptive claims, but what separates these ideologies is not just the descriptions given, but also the normative claims made by them. Incels, MGTOW and Red Pill users actually do share a lot of descriptive claims(hypergamy, feminism, psychology to name a few), but differentiate each other by how they tell their user bases to respond to such descriptions. Incels have a more nihilistic outlook for instance, and more or less advocate for lying down and rotting. MGTOWs advocate for distancing yourself from cultures or societies because they are \"gynocentric\" and improving yourself for the sake of your own fulfillment. And Red Pill users advocate for improving yourself as an ends to being sexual successful. There is of course overlaps in this sometimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of feminism, you can see the disconnect. Liberal and radical feminists might both agree that the sex industry(prostitution and pornography) is harmful to women, but where the major disagreement is how to respond. A more liberal feminist would want to make the working conditions for sex workers better as a radical feminist might suggest the industry is exploitation as it\\'s core and women should work to get out of it or it should be gone all together.\\r\\n\\r\\n**5:** [r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/) **and normativity**\\r\\n\\r\\n[r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/) might descriptively agree with everything a liberal or radical feminist says, but they clearly disagree about the normativity. [r/femaledatingstragy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstragy/) tells women \"this is how the world is\\\\*, then proceeds to give them advice on how to exploit this world for their personal gain. They do this by telling women they live in abundance, telling them what there worth is to men, telling them how much they can possibly squeeze out of them and even going as far as to mess with them(this mirrors Red Pill communities a lot of course in a lot of ways, but it is obviously non-identical or comparable I would argue). They are actually rejecting feminism viz. making no normative claims about restructuring societies, institutions, no talk of how to overcome patriarchal ideas and no talk of how men should be.\\r\\n\\r\\n**6: the assumption**\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the assumption here is that if a woman is rejecting feminism, that they turn into a traditional conservative wife, a Red Pill woman or they just worship men and masculinity. This is not the case however, it is ideally coherent- I would even say expected- that women who do reject feminism could easily accept the normativity of [r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/). Perhaps the advice is immoral, repugnant or strange, but nonetheless they are rejecting feminism and this is how it could look and I suspect if a lot of women did actually reject feminism they would come to the conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n**7: it is categorically different**\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if someone on here wanted to call this \"feminism\"(as there is nothing stopping anyone from doing this) it is clearly categorically different and stands in opposition or apathy to the more mainstream ideas of feminism. If woman talking about doing things that solely benefit them is feminism to you, then your definition of feminism is absurd and covers so much ground you are making make-up tutorials into feminism. I think most definitions that people can give that implicate the two as feminism would result in this reduction.\\r\\n\\r\\n**8: conclusion**\\r\\n\\r\\n[r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/) is rejecting feminism due to the above reasons. It is not not enough just to reject feminism to make the men who are upset at reading the subreddit okay, but you must also reject it in a way they want you to do it. I think in light of this, it makes sense for men to be pro-feminist(liberal at least, as this does benefit men I think), despite their objections to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am looking for discussions that explicitly challenge my view on this, explain a crucial point I am missing or asking a question about my post.

That's why more women pass on their genes than men. I think there was a study backin this up a while ago, in caveman days more women passed on their genes than men did.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou see evidence of this all the time, my female rabbit used to reject males including her rapey brother rabbit that tried it.

There is a reason they attract more women lmaoo. Besides I keep myself toned/in shape/ look after my skin etc- even chads tell me I haven't aged/look good so wtf why should I settle for some 6chinned incel with no personality/confidence. Fuck off!! Chads messing good women around means nothing as most of them won't settle until THEY decide they want to and for most of them thats mid 30s onwards- everythin else is irrelevant.

He was also paranoid about women being goldiggas/whores and conveniently he preferred to stay indoors (aka he was a cheapskate unwilling to invest money into relationships) so he got pissy when as a woman you suggest going out for the day.

I refused to be exclusive for quite awhile and he continued to show up.

But I dont think we need anyone to reinforce our negative ideologies.\\r\\nIt doesn't help we are all opinionated creatures lol.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis doesnt make you wrong though, I knew before reddit and before trp sub that men are more sexually driven and I love psych, so, its proven they are able to detach their emotions which makes them better at fwb situations and having multiple partners without becoming overly emotionally attached\\r\\n Whereas women cannot, and we become emotionally invested when we sleep with a man\\r\\n. This being said, vetting process is VERY important. And as long as you dwell on the positive aspects more than the negative ones you should be good.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have tailored my vetting process to join them in a way.

Which to me is only fair if I cant shove the children I have with him back up once we are done. I need an equal amount of commitment in turn and for men, that is money\\r\\nThey are visual and materialist beings.\\r\\nI dont believe we love with the same depth, they are more simple and more primal. Unconditional love that we all so want so bad can come from 1 ourselves,  2. Our parents /siblings and 3, our kids. Men only seem to love on conditions. They have no problems dating and living with women they dont plan on being forever with and are more than capable on being with a woman out of convinience. Once they find better they leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is just my personal observation and also info I have gathered from others.\\r\\nWomen do fucked up shit too, but look at stats and you will see majority of rapes are commited by men, the demand for women in sex trades are majority demanded from men, women get abducted and trafficked for sex by men, murders are commited primarily by men. And even when a woman commits a murder the motives differ.\\r\\nMost serial killers are men. Wars start due to men, expiraments on humans during wars were primarily if not all conducted by men. Resources from the planet are being extracted mostly by men (CEO's of large companies).\\r\\n I can get into more spiritual aspect of this. And say it is because the masculine and feminine energy is not equal right now to balance each other out as the feminine has been suppressed.\\r\\nAnd masculine traits are traits of destruction and leadership and it's been in reign but that's for another sub.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion: it's sad, it hurts, but cant close your eyes to it.

       " \"Oh I'm with you sis. Yeah this is why women's no1 focus should be levelling up, healing, travelling, pursuing their career and getting their act together. Only then can you be in a position to think clearly about what you're looking for in a partner/how to protect yourself. Only then do you have the experiences to draw from. Men can't fuck with you so easily once you've done enough work on yourself, earned your stripes &amp; raised your esteem- if you put all that effort into yourself you're not just gonna let it go to some lazy self loathing dusty immature man on a whim. Even if he's cute- looks fade too chads!! You're looking for someone levelled up that recognises that value within you and has done the same for themselves.  I can't believe how many women have been had with that, they really think a grown ass 6ft4 35yr old man still needs a woman to tell him to do basic shit? LMAOOO. That he still can't possibly know how to put the toilet lid down or how not to disrespect her. LMAO no, he just chose to be lazy /act helpless and let a woman do it for him. He knows damn well when he is disrespecting her he just plays dumb. If a man thinks he can control a woman with a few sentences &amp; get a full time servant on the cheap, like these pickmeshas, he's gonna run &amp; take a mile with it. Ugh nah I never save these men now, I send them on their way. Shoo shoo little boy, go fix yourself.  A broken boy and a broken man are two very different things indeed.\",\n",

That's why it's just a dirty band-aid on an infected wound that won't heal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur subconscious only responds to results in real life.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy best advice for you is to break all your big goals in as tiny pieces as possible. The goal is then to check off as many of those tiny pieces as you can a day, consistently.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, if possible, try to spend some time in nature. Take an audiobook or podcast if it feels boring at first. But the goal is to be present in nature. To notice, really see the trees, the birds, the grass.

If a guy is making you poorer, less happy, more stressed, more insecure, etc. he's not worth keeping in your life. A rich man who makes you go 50/50 is much worse than an average guy who takes you out but not to super nice places. The way I imagine it is: would I be happy if there were more men like him in the world? I love my boyfriend and I honestly think he's a total sweetheart, which is why it's so weird that he's in love with me of all people. I *wish* more men treated their girlfriends the way mine treats me. I would want my sister and my best friend to date a man like him. If you wouldn't want your sister or best friend to date a man like him, then why would you? IMO money is only important to a point. If he's making you pay for everything or literally jobless, that's an obvious pass. If he has a decent, stable job and is able to afford his expenses, I don't think it's a con unless you're really into the spoiled girlfriend thing (middle class men can still spoil too but it'll obviously be less extravagant than straight up wealthy men).

I think for most women sex without emotional connection is a depressing waste of time that will leave us feeling used and dehumanized. Because of this some men (PUAs) have developed whole theories, written books, taken courses on how to bully and manipulate us into submission and damage us emotionally until we feel that we deserve no better and can expect no better than to be used to masturbate in by occasion and receive nothing but hurt in return. The methods have spread from the dedicated PUA circles and become mainstream to the point that it is hard to find men that aren't at least somewhat inspired by their way of thinking. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that I am bringing more to the table than merely my body, the fact that I am willing to invest my feelings, my heart in a man makes me vulnerable to this kind of men. To have genuine emotional connection you have to be open, you have to show an amount of trust and be willing to give the other person the benefit of the doubt. These men are intentionally using this against us to use us and leave us in a state of heartbreak. Every time this happens to a woman she becomes more suspicious and cynical, less open and trusting.

       " 'More sex strategy for you queens-\\r\\n\\r\\nSay NO degrading sex acts that have been put into a man’s head by porn and were seen as taboo forty years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several acts that are absolutely not pleasurable for women, and that are degrading. They have been normalized by the sick porn industry. \\r\\n\\r\\nDo not let a man gaslight you into thinking they’re normal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat’s the easiest way to tell if he is going to get off on humiliating and degrading you? Reverse the roles and see if he would accept the same from you. There are numerous things men routinely try to coerce women into doing, and below, you’ll see how men would never accept the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHave ____ eat his own __. \\r\\nHave him put a _ up his ___.\\r\\n See if he likes being smacked and spoken down to.\\r\\n Tell him his parts are inadequate. \\r\\nTell him you’re not about to reciprocate after he gives you head.\\r\\nMake him stop doing what he enjoys most, switch to an uncomfortable position. \\r\\nTell him he didn’t do enough foreplay after 75 minutes.\\r\\n Tell him you want to see him in something he normally doesn’t wear. Tell him he’d look better with a different hair color. \\r\\nDon’t put the focus on him, act like he should be treating you like the queen. \\r\\nPropose a threesome with a handsome man, better yet, his hottest friend.\\r\\n Bring out a whip.\\r\\n\\r\\n*You’ll find out they understand EXACTLY what is demeaning and degrading REAL QUICK! They will be immensely insulted by any of the above.*\\r\\n\\r\\nReclaim your sexuality. Sex should be pleasing to you and not a humiliating experience. If you’re not enjoying yourself, muster up all the strength you have and WALK OUT. Get comfortable with yourself and your own desires and EXPECT them to be fulfilled.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou don’t want any man to be able to say he smashed, and especially not if you didn’t even enjoy yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour TIME is too important. Your LIFE is too important. Your SELF-RESPECT is too important. You deserve better. You can’t waste your own time anymore, ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment he starts putting his double standards on you or not making your pleasure a priority, either kick him out or walk out.\\r\\n\\r\\n#KickHimOut2020 is the new motto of the new year, and we are going to start a movement that will have men coming to reddit like “why did she kick me out after I refused to give her oral?” 🤔 \\r\\n\\r\\nIs he inattentive to your needs during sex? Does he want you to tolerate bodily fluids he would never come near himself? Does want you to try anal when he won’t take a ____ up his ____? What a clown. \\r\\n\\r\\nStart laughing and then saunter away. Who cares. You don’t owe anyone any of your time and you do not need mediocre, unsatisfying sex in your life.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelfish lovers have been gaslighting women into thinking unreciprocated and unsatisfying sex is normal for years. Today is the day you stop accepting it. \\r\\n\\r\\nA note on compliments: Turn unsolicited comments back on people from now on. If he says you should darken your hair, tell him he should go blonde. If he says you look better without glasses, tell him he looks better with sunglasses on. If he says you should squat more, tell him to work on his chicken legs. If he says you should be degraded during sex, suggest the same for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll compliments you receive should be absolutes, like \"you are beautiful\", \"your smile is amazing\", etc. Do not accept \"suggestions\" you have never asked for.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther reading recommendation: \\r\\nThe Hite Report on Female Sexuality. Available online.\\r\\n\\r\\n#KickHimOut2020\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause YOUR TIME and YOUR SEX LIFE are yours. We aren’t being guilted into crap sex anymore, and we aren’t having sex until the moment we enthusiastically want to anymore either. There’s no rush.',\n",
