I need some help.

So we're both young and very much so in love. We've been going strong for a year. He has his flaws, but nothing to write him off for. Other than that he's been an amaizing boyfriend.

I currently go to college, so he took the part of ""providing"" for me. He treats me to lunch, coffee's, drinks, trips, etc.

He even buys me little things like trinkets, books, etc.

He's very kind and caring. He makes me laugh and is good with my friends and family. 

He makes effort to he interested in the things I am, and compromises over things we don't really agree about or are mutually interested in.

The **only** things I'm **really** worried about is his future job, and his low interest in many areas of life. 

What I mean by this, is that if he's not interested in something, he won't focus on it at all. And if he is interested in something, he's usually very, very knowledgeable about it. But doesn't know how to turn his ideas and hobbies into a job or a career. 

He only has highschool education, which you'd be extremely surprised by if you met him, since he seems very smart and educated. 

The sad part is that he never did well at school. He outperformed everyone is surtain subjects, but then substantially underperformed in others. Either the worst, or the best.

And because of our school system, you can't simply focus on the things you're good at, and go to college for it. You need good grades and to do well on the final exam, which he **didn't even take**. 

He works now, but doesn't earn much, and doesn't enjoy/care about his job at all. 

I don't want that for him... But I don't know how to point him in the right direction. 

I don't want to throw away everything we have just because he's not gonna have an amaizing career (It's not even about money, it's just about his wellbeing).",86101,"My partner is very smart and he has potential...

Guys could never get mad at me as they cant pinpoint what i did wrong. I listen, observe and show them in actions.

Okay, so about 4 months ago, I started dating this guy right before quarantine began. When quarantine hit, we decided to keep talking and date via video calls, socially distanced outdoor meetings, etc. 

I found FDS in the middle of quarantine, after I started dating this guy. This sub is helping me gain confidence in not just myself but also in identifying LVM. I realized I definitely had (and am still working on overcoming) pickme tendencies.

I've realized this guy isn't that great. He's nice enough, and we have things in common. But he's too pessimistic and kinda belitting towards others (and me!) for my taste. He also never asks about the important things in my life. And he kept suggesting we break social distancing to see each other. I'm over it. 

🤡 I realize I should have cut him off earlier. Unfortunately I did not. 

I want to end things with him, but I'm trying to determine how. We're not technically boyfriend/girlfriend but he says we're exclusive (🤡), and we have been talking/""together"" for 4 months. Do you think it's appropriate to ghost him? End it over text? Do it on the phone or a video call? Arrange an in-person meeting? (I'm still navigating the fine line between ""nice for what?"" while also remaining a kind-but-no-BS woman.)

I was at a low, influenced by liberal fem ideas pick me advice about relationships, sex and ""empowerment"",I didn't understand the reason HVW acted the way they did and not being religious made me feel like it was unfair i was expected to ""waste the best years of my life without sex"" I had high drive, was lonely, insecure about my body and its flaws, thinking I was unworthy, so i made dumb choices to get validation, i never performed any act or kissed anyone   I'm still virgin, i hate the whole doing stuff behind back, hide ect so there's that at least

after I felt awful, stupid, i had no real experience about dating, i never even had a bf only close calls so I had no idea how to act, what boundaries to stick to, i suck at being stubborn about that which is a weakness, how damaging the over-sexualisation culture is.. but then coming across FDS gave me all the answers to the questions that haunted me all my life and especially about the confusing situation I was in that did a number (no actual abuse but i was turning into something I didn't like) so i was like what the? these are great people not the hateful bitter women that youtuber framed you as

within my society, i wasn't a full on pick me, more like Medium value woman due to inexperience lol, I was even told ""girl u're single cause u're too strong minded for most dudes looking for ""passing time"" "" so that was reassuring at least, i didn't tolerate the abusive and controlling stuff most girls accepted like a bf controlling what u wear, where u go, excessive jealousy , short temper ect,  and I was against accepting husband ordering me to stay at home and not work ect and I always made sure to advise my friends to expect better from their bfs 

FDS, and through it discovering Why Men Love B\*\* (I devoured in 2 days) helped me go to the next level and avoid terrible mistakes and corrected the libfem views i had like 50/50 sex expect an actual date ect, idk if i'm HV or not yet but i got stronger I got validation for my boundaries and encouragement to stick to them

Now I'm at peace, happy, working on myself mentally and physically, and most of all voluntarily single till i could manage to get away with my work to a better place, because the dating options are against me, the majority can't marry me, and the similar minority are NVM who play girls, endanger them by   
 asking for pics, having sex before marriage then leave (which can get a girl killed and makes her isolated from marriage) and looking  for a decent unicorn out of them is like playing lottery with 50 numbers containing 3 digits, good luck winning, so it isn't worth the effort.",81365,FDS is a life savior - thank you,0,,,

Well I didn't know what a situationship was back then. I've never had a real boyfriend before. I was also a ""cool girl""(smh) and a pickmeisha I now realize(going 50/50, texting first)

 I was friends with him since I've started college. He was an international student from India and he was very tall and very handsome. I kinda thought he was cute but I've never seen him beyond a friend. Near August he broke up with his now ex-girlfriend. We got drunk. I told him he was cute. He told it to me back. We   went to my house(because his dorm was locked). We did not have sex. But sleepovers became a regular thing after that. At this time I didn't know much about relationships much less fds. 

I fell for him fast. We kept seeing eachother. We actually did most things together (gym, homework, classes, he would invite me places and I would invite him etc.) He told me he loved me and that he just needed time to get over his ex. And I like a fool fell into that trap. I had my first kiss with him and lost ""half of my virginity"" to him. 

During this time I started watching sheraseven1, greta bereisaite, shallon lester and etc.. I was slowly introduced to fds. 

I began to realize he wasn't very nice to me at times. His jokes toward me was demeaning (calling me stupid and telling me I should work on my butt) he was hot and cold toward me. But I was still so infatuated and disillusioned by his words. He said he cared for me  because he didn't take my virginity and it was hard to supress blah blah blah.

During winter break he left to go to India. And since then I started to go really deep into fds. Since he decided not to come back because of covid 19, It wasn't hard for me to focus on my mental glow up. 

He would text or call me every few weeks and I would humour him slightly (tbh he bacame desperate the last few calls)  but I realized he didn't love me. He just wanted to see if I was still available to him. 
 The last ""hi, (my nickname)"" text I just left him on read. And that was a month ago... It was hard for me because it just seemed like an innocent text and I felt really mean for ignoring him. (please kill me lol)

I am conflicted. Most of the time I don't even think about him but sometimes I feel extremely guilty for ignoring him. My mind knows what's good for me and I mostly act upon logic. But my heart hurts so much I can't ignore it(ugh whyy). I think it's the chemicals from cuddling and sleeping with him too much... 

I need big sister advice and encouragement😣😣☹☹😢😢 

I swear I'm not like this most of the time... It's 5 in the morning and I haven't slept. I know the answer is obvious.. I'm sorry,  I just needed to end this once and for all.",81351,"Ladies, please destroy me with your words",0,,,

“Down to earth” - dumb,
“Looking for the one” - looking for a one night stand, 
“Looking for a friend with benefits” - offering to disappoint you in about two minutes,
“In an open relationship, my wife is aware of this” - wife is unaware of any of this,
“In a polyamorous relationship” - the ugliest f*cker on the app, forcing his emotional abuse on an unhappy girlfriend/s, 
“Sensitive, thoughtful” - looking for free therapy,
“Like style and elegance” - likes to sit at home in a greasy tracksuit with holes,

“Drink socially” - my hobby is alcohol,

I married a LVM. He presented himself as a HVM for nearly 2 years before we were married (we did not live together before marriage) and it was only after we moved in that I found out his drinking never stopped after a night out, and the alcohol brought out his verbal and physical abusiveness. I also found out he had massive credit card debt &amp; when forced to pay that off and start being financially savvy he was constantly upset at his 'responsibility' which only made him drink more. Tried to work some stuff out with therapy and once I finally realized (after several years) that nothing was ever going to change I left. Obviously I  made some mistakes that I have learned from,  and continuing to learn from thanks to this sub!

I've taken this past year to learn how to live on my own again, and realized how much I gave up over that time span. One of those things were my friends. The LVM would only allow me to hang out with his friend group, and would criticize my old friends (i.e. ""Wow she looks like a lesbian, I bet she's closeted, why does she want to hang out with you alone."") Yeah I know, red flags everywhere (and although I did not see that friend over those years, we still kept in contact via texting and now I do see her regularly!!) 

I am about to move to another town in my area, and I am hoping to start finding and making new friends! Due to the Ex-LVM and the divorce I do not have a lot in the way of finances, and I am having trouble finding no-cost options (or low cost - like $5) to meet new people! About my only idea is volunteering, which is a non-option at the moment because of COVID? Any ideas?",86012,Making Friends Again,0,,,

I said I might have time but I had other stuff going on too. (My thought is that it’s been like 5 years, if he comes up with something good, I’ll see him. Not hook up or anything, just meet up and catch up. We were also friends.) 

He vanishes after some bland convo and then reaches out to me ten minutes before the bars close to see if I’m going out later. (Cue the title of this post.)

God does not love you. And like the common break up trope: it’s not you, it’s him. Except that in this scenario, it’s actually true. From the sexist and borderline misogynistic ideas and beliefs of the Bible. My personal theory is that God resents Eve, and consequently all women for deceiving his precious Adam. His first born son, the first human he ever created betrayed him and chose a woman over him. The resentment bled into hatred and is reflected in the Bible as God prescribes for men to treat women as second class citizens and use them as they see fit. This popular verse comes to mind: “...but the woman for the man”. You as woman, were apparently created for the pleasure and use of men. And you apparently do not have the equivalent right to use men as you see fit. Everything you do should be for men or as men want it, because your life is supposed to be dedicated to them, but not theirs to you. This is one of the many disparities regarding the way the Bible views women, compared to how it views men. 

In his supposed magnanimity, the one mistake that he made was to give men the high sex drive that he did. By doing this, he invariably placed a lot of power in the hands of women. You may not consciously realize this, but as a woman, you have a lot of power to will things as you want them to be. Feminism is proof of this. The only reason that patriarchy existed is because women either did not fully realize the advantage they had or because they placed it in the hands of men that they supposedly trusted. Look at the how that turned out? Regardless of all the criticism against feminism, the truth is that women would not have rebelled against male authority, if they felt like they benefitted enough from it. There was something inherently wrong with the system of the past, for it to push women to move from the supposedly safe cushy comfort of their homes and out to the workforce. And the truth is that when you place power and authority too much in the hands of men, they tend to abuse it. Some might argue that it’s not even their fault. They can’t help it. They are men, after all.

It’s a way for men to tally their demands within a relationship and marriage as having priority over yours. 

Any woman that has been in a serious relationship with a man would seriously laugh in your face if anyone told her that to keep a man happy, all you need to do is “keep his belly full and his balls empty”. Men like to tote this up and down, in a disingenuous way to simplify the things they want. But as women, we all know that not only is there a lot more that goes into feeding a man and fucking him regularly, but the demands that they have and expect in a relationship often go way beyond just that. Just because you can abbreviate what you want in 7-word sentence doesn’t mean that doing the thing is simple. 

Men are just as complex and keeping them happy can be very difficult. Which is why your primary goal should be keeping yourself happy. You need to be more concerned about what you’re getting out of that relationship and whether you’re satisfied with the man that you’ve chosen. An unhappy person cannot make someone else happy. You need to make sure that the value and sacrifices that he brings into the relationship makes you happy, before you can tackle the things that might make him happy. 

You as a woman, have incredible value and power. Just because you exist. Use it. Use it as leverage to get what you want out of your relationship and be more concerned about making sure you’re happy with the benefits you’re getting. That happiness will bleed into the relationship and your man can draw from it and use that as confidence that he’s pleasing you. Which would lead to his happiness, as men like to keep their women happy. 

Your needs are just as important as your man’s, and I would argue, even more important. If your man has an attitude of pleasing you, it means he respects you and values you. And if your man doesn’t respect you and put you first, then you need to run like hell from him. There are so many others available, it’s almost ridiculous. And once you adopt that attitude, you notice that you start to attract men that act the way you would prefer them to act. 

A relationship with an unhappy woman, is essentially a dead one. And a dead relationship is a monumental waste of time.",398,Men are not simple. And neither are they easy to please.,0,2019-07-29 01:34:54,,

It hurts even more when you see said man hanging out with other girls afterwards — causes you to wonder what they have that you don’t !

FDS is a dynamic and ever growing pool of wisdom and shared experiences aimed at garnering a better situation for women as a whole. Therefore it adapts itself to the “levels” and lifestyles of many very different people.

So-called ideologies such as TRP and MGTOW, on the other hand, aren’t nearly as nuanced. Everything I have seen in these groups willfully and stubbornly shoves the world into very specific boxes, especially in the realm of gender but also in other ways as well (such as the “valid” types of masculinity vs “invalid” ones by their estimation). These boxes are really one dimensional.

FDS has certain underlying values and standards, but it’s a hell of a lot more nuanced. That is something I think women are generally much better at - adapting. And therein lies our strength and ability to continue growing.

The aforementioned manosphere groups view adaptability itself as weakness...which is literally against the entire biological basis of evolution. I’m perhaps rambling, but this is why I think the backlash against us as a group is pretty pointless. We are a moving and very resilient target, whereas the manoshpere is rigid and ultimately lacking in a functional foundation.",84056,"Opinion: FDS works because, although it gives women tools, it isn’t a rigid worldview - it is dynamic.",0,,,

It is a really big red flag to encounter someone so preoccupied by weight/size/looks. 

&gt;I got myself over an eating disorder so I never fall for this BS from anyone. I used to be very thin, looking at those old photos makes me sad. I am recovered and healthy now and I accept my body type. I am not very skinny anymore, I have curves, and I am happy to not have an eating disorder. Some people still call me slim, some would say curvy, but I am at a healthy weight and I am healthy mentally which is what matters to me. So whenever someone makes a comment now being condescending or pushy about health/fitness/food, making ""suggestions"", I instantly drop them. I already fought my ED battle on my own, it was a battle hard-fought, the last thing I need is a LVM trying to get me to think in eating disordered ways again and to obsess over my figure. I think if a HVM or good man only knew what I've been through and how healthy I am in my current state he wouldn't dream of saying one word to me about diet. Those kinds of comments are not welcome, I thought everyone knew it was rude to make comments about diet. No one knows what you do or what you've been through, and it's no one's place besides yours to decide what you eat. Eating an extra brownie at dinner is always going to be better for me than starving myself for three days eating nothing but boiled potatoes. So anyone who is trying to give me shit or condescend me about health, or making a comment about what I eat, can fuck right off. No one knows better than me what to do for myself. I feel bad for men who are so preoccupied with food and fitness, the way they talk reminds me of when I was in the throes of my eating disorder, never happy with myself, sad, insecure, thinking about food. These guys who are so obsessed with weight are sad individuals. You should never let their own neuroses get to you.  
&gt;  
&gt;I've reached a point where I can say I love my body and shout it from the rooftops. So hearing any negative/condescension/""diet advice"" talk from a LVM instantly turns me off and spoils my whole vibe. I can't associate with anyone like that or anyone so looks-obsessed or condescending. I could actually out-do any negging LVM when it comes to exercise at any time. I used to workout 6 days a week. It's not how I live my life anymore because that's not healthy for me, but to have LVM try to mansplain to me health and fitness is an instant turn-off. None of their business what I do, what their mother does, what their kids do. They should keep to themselves- they can choose their own diet and leave everyone else alone. I run away from these pieces of shit because their preoccupation with weight is a reflection of an eating disorder I used to have. Non-disordered people don't think about food so obsessively. **Lots of LVM these days seem to have eating disorders and want to push these eating disorders and insecurities onto women. I see a lot of** ***orthorexic*** **men try to shame women into eating their idea of ""healthy"" and trying to guilt them, or neg in the form of ""advice"". It should be a public health crisis-LVM left and right are trying to transfer their own food issues onto women in their life to feel superior. They are all overly preoccupied with it and need to get treatment.**  
&gt;  
&gt;I had an orthorexic LVM tell me before that I should not drink frappuccinos anymore and switch to green tea, implying I will get fat. He also implies the sugar will give me wrinkles, as if that is the worst possible thing that could ever happen to me. Wrinkles. What is a woman worth if she has wrinkles, right gals?? #LVMLogic. What he doesn't know is it's a victory for me to be able to have a frappuccino without thinking about calories and I celebrate being mentally free enough to do that. I am proud of myself, I cross off previously forbidden foods on a list I have and am thrilled whenever I overcome my previous self-imposed restrictions. What he doesn't know is that moderation is the key to a healthy diet. What he doesn't know is I might have only had 800 calories that day, and the frappuccino will not do a thing to my weight, I'd still be under the amount of energy needed to get through my day. He doesn't know if I am having a low blood sugar episode. He doesn't know if I had a workout prior and need to replenish with carbs. He doesn't know if it's between drinking a frappuccino and not having the appetite to eat anything at all I would pick the former every time, because I made a commitment to nourish myself. Where I'm at today is a huge victory to me and testament to my strength. What I've been through shows me how many people are struggling with disordered thinking and are out here untreated and pushing their issues on to others. I see in these LVM who I used to be before I recovered. And my weight and looks could never define my worth anyway. I am so much more than that.  
&gt;  
&gt;I encourage all women to avoid LVM who make comments about weight/looks like that. Being involved with someone with that kind of neurosis and disordered view of the world is damaging. Don't let them push their disordered thinking on to you. Orthorexic LVM will shame you for having birthday cake on your bday or getting a cheeky frappuccino at the mall. That's no way to live. He can have his chicken breasts and broccoli. But not you. Until these guys get treatment for their orthorexia they can't be good partners. It's a mental illness, an offshoot of OCD and anxiety. I'm not exaggerating. Their issues with their own self-image and control issues run deep. If it's gotten to the point he is projecting on you, run. Even back when I had a ED, I never policed anyone's eating choices or weight. So just know he is sick if he is doing that to you. Life is really fucking short. It is a sad thing to look back and realize you didn't split the dessert with your girl friends on vacation because you were worried about gaining a pound. It is a sad thing to realize you spent so much energy thinking about your weight in your youth. It is a sad thing not to enjoy your favorite french toast. You're in this world to live your life, not to look like a perfect model or obsess over your weight.  
&gt;  
&gt;The last thing any woman needs is to have someone in her life whispering in her ear telling her she's not good enough, not pretty enough, not skinny enough, not smart enough. We do enough self-critique on or own, run far away anyone trying to bring you down. HVM will uplift you and speak positivity into your life. This can be hard to understand if you grew up with critical parents or a family that has normalized criticism. You will feel comfortable in the presence of LVM who are ok with critiquing you and belittling you. But the thing is, you get to choose how you live when you're an adult. My life shall be free of any trifling ass LVM who try to disrespect me. And you all can choose this too. Some advice: if you have never overcome an eating disorder before, please be mindful of associating with anybody who thinks it's normal to make comments about other people's diets/sizes/weights/exercise/health. Slowly but surely you can start to feel inadequate and develop disordered thinking yourself. It quietly creeps up on you, the best thing you can do for yourself is to get away from anybody making comments like that in the first place. They will transfer their own mental illness and diseased thinking on to you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Think about it. Is this the kind of man you need in your life? Your worst critic? Mr. You're Not Good Enough For Me? Mr. Know-it-all about health? Or would you prefer somebody who doesn't project his insecurities, neuroses, and diseased thinking on to others? Trust me when I say, it is a disease. These guys have no clue about the real meaning of life. Everything is a superficial, vanity-filled, looks-obsessed game to them. No, he's not ""helping you"" or telling you ""out of love"". He is trying to control you, because eating disorders are a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. He is trying to mold you into a trophy. He has bought into societal brainwashing and is now trying to get you to buy into it and put your own health at risk in the quest to lose weight and be as skinny as Bella Hadid. It has nothing to do with health or fitness. He doesn't want the best for you. He wants the best for him, he is a shallow, vain individual and he gets off making you feel inadequate. You are perfect as you are. Why is he with you if he can pick so many flaws? You don't need that kind of energy or person in your life. Dump him, let him be toxic with someone else. Your level-up journey is for you, not him. He can either be supportive and loving or fuck off.   
&gt;  
&gt;And ask yourself, why the fuck is he expending his energy on this? Couldn't he ask you about your job? See if there's anything you need help with? Ask you what you think about current affairs or your favorite book? Get to know you on a deeper level? Why is he commenting on looks and size and not fostering a deeper connection with you? Emotionally unavailable and shallow douchebags are prone to doing this. There are so many more interesting things to talk about than weight, diet, and exercise. Does he even know your favorite book?   
&gt;  
&gt;I am not saying if both of you happen to enjoy Crossfit, or if both of you have a dairy-free diet in common don't talk about it. That's great!! Do that! I am saying if he's trying to push anything on you, or insinuate anything about your weight, size, or health, or be a know-it-all about things, run. Is he a personal trainer? Is he a physician? Or a nutritionist? Didn't think so.  
&gt;  
&gt;You were doing fine before him and you will continue to be fine after him. He thinks he can swoop in and mansplain to you how to be healthy? lol. You're better than that, ladies. Stay confident in who you are and stay confident knowing you make the best decisions for you and you don't need anyone's input in that. Comments about weight/size/health/exercise/diet are negging attempts, and should be treating accordingly. #blockdelete. To go further, they are evidence of his own diseased mind and inability to know what's important in life or how to have a proper relationship based on something deeper than looks.",84048,Red flag: Comments about your health/weight/size/diet/exercise,0,,,

I befriend a guy and we have a normal platonic friendship, he has a girl and I have 0 interest in him and could care less who he dates and of course I respect his relationship.

I cannot emphasize enough that he is the inappropriate one, often calling me things like ""sexy"" etc even though I've made it clear I'm not interested in him. I have a theory at this point that LVM friends and acquaintances intentionally formulate these situations with attractive women to make their gfs feel threatened because it makes them feel wanted and powerful. It's a gross ego trip they pull and I'm sick of being in the middle of it. They intentionally jeopardize their own relationships just to make their gfs jealous for this selfish fantasy of being wanted by more than one woman and I want zero part in it. 

It's revolting. I've read the FDS handbook a bit and I know that LVM and NVM often think they're the shit because of the partners who treated them well and now act like they're hot af and have huge egos. But using your female friend to create love triangle bullshit is next level narcissism!

The kind of man that would intentionally lead you to feel threatened and jealous of his female friends is a vindictive piece of shit.

Before the break up, my ex had done things that I would now look back at and think ""Why and how did I put up with this"". Now, only a month after the break up, I have made so many valuable friendships and been working out and focusing intensely on my own goals. 

Also, I find that my self-love has skyrocketed out of nowhere! I have always loved myself, but I find that it just multiplied tenfold. And with this love, I feel people are noticing this energy and are gravitating towards it! I have never had so much positive energy surrounding me in my life until now. It feels amazing to be here.

Honestly, it feels like my life has done a complete 180 in a matter of a month. I have never been happier with my life both on the outside and on the inside. It is crazy to think that just a month ago I was in a relationship that was emotionally and mentally abusive. My comeback was incredibly fast and powerful and it really made me realize that I am stronger than I had ever thought myself to be. I can live without him, and I want to. I love my life now more than ever and I feel like I deserve to finally be here.

The divorce will finalize in November (no kids). I’m working with a therapist. I won’t be dating until well after it is finalized (2021 earliest). 

But I’m thinking about when and how to explain my divorce. I just turned 27. I dated my ex for 6 years, engaged for 1, married under 1. It was my first sexual relationship. He was faithful and wanted to marry me, but after I married him, I learned that he never was in love with me (!) and he wants a ‘companionate’ marriage (domestic work, childbearing, plus one, hanging out, having sex, and making dual incomes--but without a deeper level of emotional intimacy or affection. Nopppe.). For years, I made it clear that I wanted to move back to my home city to raise a family; after we made it legal, he backtracked and became resentful. Oh, and I learned that he invited someone who assaulted me to our wedding. In general, I let him bring me down instead of finding someone who helps boost me up. Marriage counseling did not help the dysfunction. I regret marrying him at all. 

I've discussed self esteem with my therapist and tbh I feel good about myself. I’m a student at a top law school, I’ll graduate with little debt, I’m a former college athlete, my parents are still in love with one another and support me, and my friends are great. But I’m afraid a young divorce will look like a red flag + I'm embarrassed about not realizing he was trash earlier.

By what date are women roughly expected to disclose a divorce? I feel like I bring a lot to the table and I’d rather focus on that, but I also don’t want to hide the ball.

So first of all I just want to say that I'm super heartbroken that it had to come to this but I couldnt continue to outright disrespect myself time and time again. After speaking to other women, and reading posts here I finally put together the courage to leave. Out of those 4 years we lived together for 3.

I just had enough. I work full time, he only works part time.

I found his porn and it finally clicked that this is the reason why we only had sex once every 2-3 MONTHS

Every time I tried to bring up problems we were having I was just told to ""get over it"" or be told that I'm being ridiculous, that what I was feeling wasnt right, and that HE was not doing anything wrong.

Dates? Practically non existant 

Only ever had dinner cooked for me when I got home when he knew I was upset with him.

Expected me to just quit my job and move provinces with him on the off chance he finds something full time.

Wouldn't accept that I am bisexual, thought his magic penis ""fixed"" me and made me straight despite me having sex with women before him

Animals are very important to me, but I was never ""allowed"" to get them (our apartment was not pet friendly but even things like geckos or snakes he was against, even though him having 2 fish tanks was OK)

He wants kids, which he never told me until a few years into our relationship, because I made it clear from the very start that I never wanted them.

Told me he loved my curves and yet constantly pressured me to lose weight, would make comments on what I was eating, how much, what I should be eating instead etc.. said it was because he cared (even after explicitly telling him his comments were hurtful and unwanted!)

Looking back we never had a really healthy relationship even in the beginning, and I should have noticed when we started dating when I (22F) was 18 and he (32M) was 29 that there was too much of an age gap for this to ever work out (11 year difference).

However - it reached a very sexual boiling point. So I ended up asking him.

And he told me he’s still into his ex. 

It came as a shock to me. I was wary of him this whole time Incase he did only want sex. I thought maybe if it’s only been a year he hasn’t been single for long enough. but for some reason that wasn’t anything I suspected. This feels way harsher.

He said he just wanted to add some fun. why did it have to be specifically me all this time, building up. It’s been months. (We lived in different cities, and corona complicated things there is why I didn’t see him in that time) but I feel exposed and stupid. I don’t want to just be someone’s plaything

It’s crazy because even about 3 years ago I would have still repeatedly slept with a guy like that. thinking it’s better than nothing, thinking maybe he might come to like me 

But this time I didn’t beg. I didn’t ask him any “whys.” I just said it would feel like a waste to me if he already knows It’s not going anywhere. And that was it.

I’m suspicious of my man cheating. Oh well at this point lol. But my question is: would you dm a guy on IG if you knew he didn’t have a gf? And if you didn’t know, would you be open to telling her the truth if she dm’ed you to ask if he cheated or how she knows him? I’m thinking of doing the latter and being nice about it since it’s not her fault (she definitely doesn’t know I exist).

However, I still felt something was missing in these books, that I didn't \*fully\* grasp just what's going in men's head. Enter. This. Book. *Every Man Sees You Naked* by David M. Matthews.

Girls, this book is amazing. I paid $9 to read the ebook (there is no free online version sadly) based on the interesting preview on Amazon and the male comments in the review section calling this book ""spot on"". I wondered what new things I would learn from it and to be honest, I doubted it would enlighten me more than I am already.

Oh boy was I wrong! So, though I didn't learn anything new on \*what\* men think (any woman who ever read a Cosmo magazine or scrolled through this sub would have figured that out), what I learned is \*how\* they think. I can safely say this book delivered the hardest, coldest blackpill I ever swallowed. **This book is rude, crude but also incredibly frank and honest. There is no sugarcoating, no attempt at soothing my hurt feelings.** I had to take several pauses because some stuffs I read in this book were shocking and hurtful. I did gasp, I did scowl, I did grimace, I did scream ""what the hell!!!!"" but even if 50% of this book was hard to read, I know it's nothing but the truth.

Though I advise everyone to part from their hard earned $9 and read the whole book, I'm still going to share some of the most blackpilled truths in this book with you guys.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Let's start with the  title: Every Man Sees You Naked.** You can read this part in the preview of the book on Amazon but here's a short summary: every man, when they see you, imagine you naked and then right after imagine having sex with you. Every man: your university professor, the male cashier at Walmart, your BFF's father and yes... even your own father (for the father, there is no 'imagining sex with you' bit though, just imagining you naked). So even if you don't catch them red handed, this is what's going on in their head.
2. **Men are not just obsessed with sex, sex defines them.** Almost everything they do is in hope of getting laid. If they pursue a career, dress better, get fit, go through a therapy, want a girlfriend, are nice to you, are willing to open their wallets for you... Almost everything men do is because they think it'll lead to sex. This is beyond just ""thinking about sex all the time"", their brain revolves around sex. This is why men believe that women who are nice to them, smile at them, or just look their way want to have sex with them: because that's how *they* work so they think women are also the same. That's also why if you browse an incel subreddit, all they talk about is sex, sex, sex. Never love. Actually, not just incel subreddits. Everywhere, what men mention all the time is sex, never love. Worse: in their list of priorities, sex always comes first, yes before even food. If men had to choose between getting laid and getting food, they would gladly starve every day! **Sex is their raison d'être**, period.
3. **There are only 2 categories of women for men: fuckable and unfuckable.** Their behavior towards you is based on which category they put you in. If you're fuckable, they'll do everything to sleep with you and if they can't, they'll try to be your friend in hope you will one day open your legs for them. You can ask any of your male single friend if they would be down to fuck, they will all say yes because men are rarely ever friends with women they don't find attractive. Women they don't find attractive are invisible. When Harry in *""How Harry Met Sally""* says men can't be friends with women, he's telling the truth y'all. That's just how they think. They can be friends with other men but there's always a secret agenda when they're close to a woman. They might not always be plotting to have sex with you *but* if you ask them out, they'll always say yes (given they're heterosexual and single).
4. **Men are naturally allergic to monogamy.** If you give a man the choice between staying with his One True Love™ for the rest of his life or spend it having sex with new attractive women every day... Ladies, he'll pick the second option without blinking. The only reason men commit to a woman is because they will have a regular sexual partner this way (on top of free emotional labor and free cleaning+cooking+childrearing). They want sex first, then comfort and then companionship. Don't be fooled by romcoms and romance books. The men in these pieces of fiction think like women, not like men. That's why when Hugh Hefner died, you could see millions of men crying on Twitter, calling him an ""inspiration"". That's why men aren't repulsed by Leonardo DiCaprio going through an endless stream of 18 years old blonde bikini models, they would too if they could. The ultimate dream for them is to live like Hank Moody from Californication or Don Draper from Mad Men. They only get married because of societal pressure and because they know it's impossible for them to have daily one night stands with 10/10 women unless they're billionaires. Men are crazy about ""new pussy"", the thought of sleeping with a new woman haunt their dreams and most of them would cheat if given the opportunity (the ones that don't cheat no matter what just value loyalty more, but a lot of these loyal men see no problem with imagining having sex with someone else while they're sleeping with you! It's not cheating if it's in their heads!).
5. **Men are desperate for sex.** They're so desperate, they're willing to do anything for it. After all, didn't Henry IV create an entire religion just to get into Anne Boleyn's pants??? **It means also that everything a man tells you before having sex with you is a lie.** They're willing to lie about everything, tell you what you want to hear, romance you, wine and dine you, give you gifts etc as long as it guarantees an access to your coochie.
6. **Men don't know if they like you until they have sex with you.** Yup. Don't be fooled, you will only know if this relationship is going somewhere after having sex with him. So don't get attached before sex, just like men never get attached before it.
7. **Men don't necessarily respect women.** They would have sex with you even if they think you're a major doormat, the world's worst racist woman, a serial killer, they don't care as long as you put out for them. They think *""yes, this woman is Satan in heels but I would still do her""*. Actually they love when women go around with skimpy outfits or when they hit on them because it's an almost guarantee ticket to Sexland. That's it. So when you see a scrote telling you to make the first move, what they truly want is women they find remotely attractive to give them their coochie on a silver platter. Then you're discarded because they don't care about you beyond that. Respect has nothing to do with your attractiveness. And he says that a man treating you with respect is not the same as a man respecting you. On that part, though, the author doesn't delve much on it. **I can't help but believe that deep down, most men (if not all) don't respect women** but I guess even this blackpill was too hard to write, even in this frank book?

However, personally I prefer to go over to a guys house when we are exclusive and at the sleeping over stage. Because my place is so small, and then I have to clean and it’s just that I see it as “my” space that I don’t really let many people come into to be honest.

I have been seeing a guy for a couple of months, so I do stay at his house a couple of times a week, and we watch movies or chat. When I do ?go, he always has a bottle of wine there to go, and always buys or makes me dinner. He will then either take me out for breakfast the next morning, or will go out and get us breakfast and coffee in bed.

He takes me on date nights 1-2 times per week, to nice restaurants - asks me what I like, researches and suggests a place, books it himself, drives us there, pays for everything, and will often pick up a bottle of wine for him also.

Because my last ex took me for granted going to his house all the time, (he rarely took me out, rarely bought me anything (besides when he had done something wrong), I just feel maybe I shouldn’t be going to this new guys house and should have him come to mine more...I just feel so uncomfortable with that!

Perhaps I just need to make sure the times we see each other are actual “date” nights. But sometimes I’m so exhausted from job searching, and also doing a very physical low paid job to get by, that I just don’t feel like getting dressed up and going out multiple times a week. Sometimes I do just like going there to watch movies, and have him bring me wine and dinner.

I'm sorry for the impending wall of text, but here goes. 

Today is one of many dark moments for me, and this sounds so pathetic, but it is what it is. I think due to a lot of daddy *and* mommy issues, as well as other untreated mental health problems because of stigma in my family, I have very low self-esteem and am constantly looking outside of myself for validation. No matter how hard I try, I never seem to find it within myself. Even on days when I get dressed and feel pretty, all it takes is one minuscule thing to happen for it all to come crumbling.

Much like today. A really cute and nice guy who has always given off HVM vibes DMed me on Instagram today, and we talked consistently for the past two days. But then he left me on read and just ""liked"" my last message. I honestly feel like crying. Again, pathetic, but it's the truth. 

I want to say at this point that I absolutely, 100% agree with and LOVE Female Dating Strategy and everything FDS teaches. I believe wholeheartedly that the women of today - especially young women (F/19) - need this. But sometimes I feel like a failure to my sisters because I'm STILL extremely dependent on a man's approval to make myself feel whole. I have watched for years as my other friends and family members have found love and even just dated. Other than briefly text a few guys in the past couple years and getting used by a guy, I have done **nothing**. Nothing of substance, that is. Meanwhile a lot of my friends have had similar experiences and have had so much love in their lives from HVM. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. 

And PLEASE, for the love of God, don't hit me with the ""but you're still so young!"" I know. But at 19, most people have had all of these FULFILLING experiences with relationships, and I haven't had any. I've just had to sit back while I watch everyone else have what I've always wanted. I did the PickMe thing at first, and guys didn't like it. Now I use the FDS teachings (especially pulling back to not give him the upper hand) and guys still don't like it. I am so depressed, lonely, sad, and miserable, and I don't know what else I can do to fix it or to make people drawn to me. 

**So, at what point does FDS manifest itself positively with HVM (read: NOT LVM) in your life? Because I am extremely lonely. And, what am I doing wrong?**",80818,I feel hopeless.,0,,,

An abusive man or a narcissist is a NVM. He is a NVM - no value man. Someone pin this haha. 

The truth is the NVM doesn't give me a shit about you. He never did. He does not love you. He wants to control you. Its not romantic. It's not love or undying devotion. He plays mind games and wants you to slowly turn insane to the point where you will beg that you will do ANYTHING to make him stay. The more you give him the satisfaction of having control over you, the more he will gaslight, emotionally and/or physically abuse you. A narcissist is a monster, a void. They break you down slowly but surely. They know what they are fucking doing. You think you're the angel come to save him. You think he will change for you. He won't. He will never change. If he cannot CONTROL you he will give up.



I used to think comments like ""You know you're not funny like everyone says you are. I am."" and ""You're unphotogenic, HoneyBouquet. You look better in real life"" or ""Well done for going to the gym. You're getting better at sex now. The more you go the more you will endure."" was normal. He used to say I would overreact or I was ""oversensitive over everything."" I used to think him having a temper or being addicted to weed was something I could work on. 


Narcissistic NVM can come in many forms. Some are ugly and fat and prey on cute girls and compliment and insult their girlfriend/wife at the same time. The girl thinks that the man will never leave him. Some like them like my NVM ex look like models, but prey on insecure and women with toxic households like me. Out of 29 dates, only 7 were public. I think I must have developed stockholm syndrome from being in a hotel room for so long (our culture doesnt allow us to go to our homes before marriage). 

Narcissists are often are seen as mysterious, have a troubled childhood or a dark past. They often have a bad or absent father figure. They can be uneducated and resent further learning. They crave validation from others always.  They talk about how toxic or awful their exes were and often the girls would leave them. He says he believes in love but no one has shown him. I'm telling you now sis. You can't do shit. You could suck his dick for hours, plan amazing dates, listen to him talk shit about his family or work but it will never be enough. It's not your duty to heal a broken man. Your duty to yourself is to love yourself and for someone who values you and loves you as the amazing queen you are. 

I had the unfortunate luck of being with a malignant narcissist. The first time he raped me I was intoxicated. In October he joked that ""I will fucking kill you"" when I got him into trouble with his family. I tried to break up with him then but he gaslighted me. The second time he raped me I was sober and was crying out in pain. He broke up with me 3 days after the rape stating he had ""lost attraction"". We were together for 10 months. I only knew about narcissism after he discarded me in December. He lied to me about going abroad because he was depressed. He got a new girlfriend pretty quickly. I did not go back to him. 2 months after the breakup, he made a fake profile of me on a dating app, photoshopped my selfies and put my mobile number and social media in the bio. I knew he wanted a reaction but I never gave it to him. I silently had to file a police report against him for action fraud and harassment. He still calls me on a private number, has stalked me on Linkedin but ive pretty much blocked him. My fellow sisters, I can't make this shit up. 

Things that helped me with healing over an abusive relationship with a narcissist:

✅ Delving into your hobbies. I made several moodboards and am writing a book. I made some music playlists to listej to when travelling. 

✅ Exercise frequently and regularly. It encourages wellbeing and taking care of your physical health is important. 

✅ Talking to people, even if its online or friends or family. Having a support network is so important when it comes to healing and recovering. 

✅Start making a plan of your ambitions and goals. Men hate it when a woman has a boss mindset and is financially secure. Go start cashing checks sis 💅

✅ Knowing you are a good person and you have a good heart. This man did not break you. He tried to control you. You are a free soul. It will break your heart knowing what you tolerated but we have to live and learn sis. 

✅ Love yourself. Treat yourself. Go buy that dress or handbag or necklace you wanted. You fucking deserve it. You're a queen! 

✅ Spend hours and hours looking up red flags and abuse. The forms of abuse. Why it happens. What can you to do to make sure it NEVER happens again! Do your research!
 Go FBI on your past relationship! 

✅ This is the most important. FORGIVE YOURSELF. I wrote a letter to my past self and apologized to her. Do better now you have the knowledge of what has happened. 


You have control of your life. You are the amazing protagonist of your life! 

Dump his ass and block him forever. This time make sure trash stays in the trash. You don't walk on shit and walk in it again or worse, go into fire. Your soul needs water now. Your heart will heal and learn to be with a healthy amazing HVM or you have the option of being single too!",80742,Narcissist NVM and healing after a breakup 👩‍⚕️,0,,,

I matched with a guy on a dating app. He planned a first date and it went well. I had been single for three years at the time and was desperate to meet someone. I was kind of indifferent towards him in our talking stage but was instantly attracted to him after the first date. I proceeded to then do everything wrong:

- When he pulled away I pursued him 
- I lavished him with thoughtful gifts/kind acts
- I “loaned” him money several times. He never paid back
- He broke up with me thee times
- I told him I loved him (I was wrong) after 3 months and he didn’t return it. Instead, he got  upset and said it was too soon and the man should say it first anyway. 
- By the end, I saw he was on Tinder. When I asked him about it he got mad at me. I stayed. 
- After 8 months of dating I finally realized I was only in love with the idea of him and he certainly wasn’t into me. He was just keeping me around because who wouldn’t want such a sure thing? 

I looked him up on Facebook a few months after we broke up and he was seeing someone else. He was posting pictures with her (never did with me), buying her flowers and thoughtful gifts (never did for me once), and saying I love you after a couple of months (when it was “too soon” with me).  I saw him post 5 months later that they were engaged. I literally laughed when I read it because I had zero feelings for him and wasn’t jealous at all. I was laughing at my pre FDS, Pickmeisha self. 

Ladies, this is why we don’t pursue. This is why we only let ourselves get attracted men who treats us well. This. Is. Why. We. Vet. Don’t believe the hype that it’s 2020 and women can ask a guy out. It’s a lie. I looked back and realized that I was carrying the WHOLE relationship, I was so horribly desperate and too into him too soon, and I was tolerating such shitty behavior. I was displaying incredibly low value. 

Men go after what they want when they believe it’s valuable. They feel better about it and you will feel better about yourself. BE A HIGH VALUE WOMAN.  Let him come get YOU and make him put in the majority of the time and the majority of the work to prove himself. Worst case scenario: he will get tired of maintain the effort and you’ll learn early on that he’s LVM. Best case scenario: you weed out the losers to clear space for High Value Men to enter your life.

L. Lambert so I already knew overall *what* men think and *how* they more or less see women and dating. However, I still felt something was missing in these books, that I didn't \*fully\* grasp just what's going in men's head. Enter. This. Book. Every Man Sees You Naked by David M. Matthews.

Girls, this book is amazing. I paid $9 to read the ebook (there is no free online version sadly) based on the interesting preview on Amazon and the male comments in the review section calling this book ""spot on"". I wondered what new things I would learn from it and to be honest, I doubted it would enlighten me more than I am already.

Oh boy was I wrong! So, though I didn't learn anything new on \*what\* men think (any woman who ever read a Cosmo magazine or scrolled through this sub would have figured that out), what I learn is \*how\* they think. I can safely say this book delivered the hardest, coldest blackpill I ever swallowed. **This book is rude, crude but also incredibly frank and honest. There is no sugarcoating, no attempt at soothing my hurt feelings.** I had to take several pauses because some stuffs I read in this book were shocking and hurtful. I did gasp, I did scowl, I did grimace, I did scream ""what the hell!!!!"" but even if 50% of this book was hard to read, I know it's nothing but the truth.

Though I advise everyone to part from their hard earned $9 and read the whole book, I'm still going to share some of the most blackpilled truths in this book with you guys.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Let's start with the  title: Every Man Sees You Naked.** You can read this part in the preview of the book on Amazon but here's a short summary: every man, when they see you, imagine you naked and then right after imagine having sex with you. Every man: your university professor, the male cashier at Walmart, your BFF's father and yes... even your own father (for the father, there is no 'imagining sex with you' bit though, just imagining you naked). So even if you don't catch them red handed, this is what's going on in their head.
2. **Men are not just obsessed with sex, sex defines them.** Almost everything they do is in hope of getting laid. If they pursue a career, dress better, get fit, go through a therapy, want a girlfriend, are nice to you, are willing to open their wallets for you... Almost everything men do is because they think it'll lead to sex. This is beyond just ""thinking about sex all the time"", their brain revolves around sex. This is why men believe that women who are nice to them, smile at them, or just look their way want to have sex with them: because that how *they* work so they think women are also the same. That's also why if you browse an incel subreddit, all they talk about is sex, sex, sex. Never love. Actually, not just incel subreddits. Everywhere, what men mention all the time is sex, never love. Worse: in their list of priorities, sex always comes first, yes before even food. If men had to choose between getting laid and getting food, they would gladly starve every day! **Sex is their raison d'être**, period.
3. **There are only 2 categories of women for men: fuckable and unfuckable.** Their behavior towards you is based on which category they put you in. If you're fuckable, they'll do everything to sleep with you and if they can't, they'll try to be your friend in hope you will one day open your legs for them. You can ask any of your male single friend if they would be down to fuck, they will all say yes because men are rarely ever friends with women they don't find attractive. Women they don't find attractive are invisible. When Harry in *""How Harry Met Sally""* says men can't be friends with women, he's telling the truth y'all. That's just not how they think. They can be friends with other men but there's always a secret agenda when they're close to a woman. They might not always be plotting to have sex with you *but* if you ask them out, they'll always say yes (given they're heterosexual and single).
4. **Men are naturally allergic to monogamy.** If you give a man the choice between staying with his One True Love™ for the rest of his life or spend it having sex with new attractive women every day... Ladies, he'll pick the second option without blinking. The only reason men commit to a woman is because they will have a regular sexual partner this way (on top of free emotional labor and free cleaning+cooking+childrearing). They want sex first, then comfort and then companionship. Don't be fooled by romcoms and romance books. The men in these pieces of fiction think like women, not like men. That's why when Hugh Hefner died, you could see millions of men crying on Twitter, calling him an ""inspiration"". That's why men aren't repulsed by Leonardo DiCaprio going through an endless stream of 18 years old blonde bikini models, they would too if they could. The ultimate dream for them is to live like Hank Moody from Californication or Don Draper from Mad Men. They only get married because of societal pressure and because they know it's impossible for them to have daily one night stands with 10/10 women unless they're billionaires. Men are crazy about ""new pussy"", the thought of sleeping with a new woman haunt their dreams and most of them would cheat if given the opportunity (the ones that don't cheat no matter what just value loyalty more, but a lot of these loyal men see no problem with imagining having sex with someone else while they're sleeping with you! It's not cheating if it's in their heads!).
5. **Men are desperate for sex.** They're so desperate, they're willing to do anything for it. After all, didn't Henry IV create an entire religion just to get into Anne Boleyn's pants??? **It means also that everything a man tells you before having sex with you is a lie.** They're willing to lie about everything, tell you what you want to hear, romance you, wine and dine you, give you gifts etc as long as it guarantees an access to your coochie.
6. **Men don't know if they like you until they have sex with you.** Yup. Don't be fooled, you will only know if this relationship is going somewhere after having sex with him. So don't get attached before sex, just like men never get attached before it.
7. **Men don't necessarily respect women.** They would have sex with you even if they think you're a major doormat, the world's worst racist woman, a serial killer, they don't care as long as you put out for them. They think *""yes, this woman is Satan in heels but I would still do her""*. Actually they love when women go around with skimpy outfits or when they hit on them because it's an almost guarantee ticket to Sexland. That's it. So when you see a scrote telling you to make the first move, what they truly want is women they find remotely attractive to give them their coochie on a silver platter. Then you're discarded because they don't care about you beyond that. Respect has nothing to do with your attractiveness. And he says that a man treating you with respect is not the same as a man respecting you. On that part, though, the author doesn't delve much on it. **I can't help but believe that deep down, most men don't respect women** but I guess even this blackpill was too hard to write, even in this frank book?

My ex fucked his ex, told me he needed space, fucked her again, asked me back, went on holiday during my 30th birthday with her, fucked her again, she went psycho and put fake complaints about me at work, he refused to break contact, fucked her again… I think you see where this is going. 

Two weeks ago, he broke up with me. Again. And I want to be strong. I deleted his number his email, everything. Doesn’t matter I know them by heart anyway. 

And I do miss him. It was an abusive relationship where I was gaslit to the point of absolute insanity. Genuinely I thought I was losing grip on reality and got therapy. 

I don’t have any close friends, my family aren’t around. I have no support system and I’m so damn sad that all I want to do is message him and ask him to take me back. 

Nothing in that relationship brought me happiness but I would still go back if he asked. Because I’m so alone and so sad. I barely make it through each day. I’m taking sleeping pills at like 7pm just so I don’t have to feel anything. 

How do I walk away? For good this time. This has been a five year cycle of feeling like I’m not good enough and I’m tired. I don’t want to be like this anymore.

It's really sad. Even vanilla porn isn't ok with me, it's a betrayal imo. I hate that women put up with their men consuming porn. And now with the rise of Onlyfans, everything seems hopeless. I hate that men and even women justify men's reliance on porn as men ""needing"" it because ""men are more visual"". Really? Why do some women watch porn too then? Why do women go crazy for Chris Hemsworth and other such eye candy? 

""Porn is just a tool for getting off."" Yes, and a lazy one at that. ""Men need porn."" Ok then what on earth did they do before the age of the internet? It's so wrong. Just use your imagination. Oh of course men won't do that. Most men are too lazy to even go down on a woman, why would they rely on imagination when they can just go on Pornhub? 

It sickens me so much to think you could be dating a seemingly great guy only for him to be beating his meat to porn. Even if porn wasn't rife with abuse, it would still be gross and disrespectful to your partner. You can't even watch a TV show or movie without there being a high chance of sexualised female nudity. ""Nudity is natural, don't be a prude!"" Ok so where is all the male nudity then? 

I'm lucky to be with a man who considers porn to be cheating in a relationship. He thinks shows like Game of Thrones are gross for their objectification of women and the constant rape! I'd feel so uncomfortable if my partner watched GoT. He thinks men who use Onlyfans are pathetic and exploiting women. Trouble is I don't even know if I fancy him!

In my last long term relationship I was the definition of a PickMe and had the lowest standards ever. This was always evident around holidays because despite how much I love holidays and gift giving and celebrating someone I never felt I deserved much of that for myself. I never wanted to be a bother. And so, I never got much. 

I remember waking up on my birthday in my last relationship and he smiled and said “Happy Birthday! What do you want to do today?” He hadn’t planned a damn thing. Didn’t even buy a card. Over the years that followed I can barely even remember anything he did for me on important days. We spent the better part of a decade together and I can count on one hand his efforts to make me happy. It was always just enough effort to keep me hoping for better. It never improved though. I was living off crumbs for years. 

Now that I’ve healed from that relationship and leveled up in my own life I feel strong in expressing my needs and wants in a relationship. My partner knows how much I love birthdays and all celebrations. He has taken me to a gorgeous spa, broadway shows, Michelin star restaurants. He’s planned multi course meals that fit into my dietary preferences. He knows all my favorite shops and the sizes I wear so his clothing gifts are almost always something I love. My favorite flowers and sweets are always involved. And aside from holidays I almost have to be careful what I mention because he is so persistent in trying to meet my every whim. Apparently having confidence in your desires gives HVM endless opportunities to feel successful. 

Just a side note this isn’t a monetary issue either as they made similar salaries. It’s 100% a priority issue. 

The difference is so jarring. I was so scared of being too much. Needing too much. Not being worthy of my desires. It’s so freeing to have this confidence now. I’m not asking for too much at all!",82294,Special occasions ~ then &amp; now,0,,,

It's really sad. Even vanilla porn isn't ok with me, it's a betrayal imo. I hate that women put up with their men consuming porn. And now with the rise of Onlyfans, everything seems hopeless. I hate that men and even women justify men's reliance on porn as men ""needing"" it because ""men are more visual"". Really? Why do some women watch porn too then? Why do women go crazy for Chris Hemsworth and other such eye candy? 

""Porn is just a tool for getting off."" Yes, and a lazy one at that. ""Men need porn."" Ok then what on earth did they do before the age of the internet? It's so wrong. Just use your imagination. Oh of course men won't do that. Most men are too lazy to even go down on a woman, why would they rely on imagination when they can just go on Pornhub? 

It sickens me so much to think you could be dating a seemingly great guy only for him to be beating his meat to porn. Even if porn wasn't rife with abuse, it would still be gross and disrespectful to your partner. You can't even watch a TV show or movie without there being a high chance of sexualised female nudity. ""Nudity is natural, don't be a prude!"" Ok so where is all the male nudity then? 

I'm lucky to be with a man who considers porn to be cheating in a relationship. He thinks shows like Game of Thrones are gross for their objectification of women and the constant rape! I'd feel so uncomfortable if my partner watched GoT. He thinks men who use Onlyfans are pathetic and exploiting women. Trouble is I don't even know if I fancy him!

Me: The best days are cool when you can feel the breeze and not collapse from heat exhaustion lol.

Him: Yeah, I love days where you can feel the breeze.

Me: Yes I agree. I love things like that too. Chill days where you don't really have to do anything and just feel the cool air.

Him: Yeah, days where you can just have the window open and feel the breeze. You and me watching a movie, just relaxing. 

Me: I'm not into Netflix and chill.

Him: When did I say that I wanted to Netflix and chill? I'm not trying to sleep with you, that wasn't the intention of my statement.
At this point, I deleted the chat and stopped responding to him.

I feel like I do not know this person at all and like my picker must be so off-course, because how did I ever fall for this guy in the first place? There were some red flags like his moodiness, but I thought that was one apple worth of issues. What I uncovered was a whole apple orchard of red flags once I discovered his cheating. I feel blindsided and like I must not really be ready to date if I could have been played for a fool for a whole year and not even realize it. It has really messed with my confidence that I can pick good situations for myself.

This guy used to complain that women have baggage/jadedness and don't have hope/excitement in relationships. And look what he's done to me, he's left me with this baggage of being cheated on and trust issues. My whole view of the world has changed, I do not feel like I can trust anyone 100% anymore because I trusted this guy with my life and he let me down and betrayed me. If he could do that, anyone can do that. He was so cold in the discard, so conscienceless and remorseless about his actions that I felt so ashamed I even was with this guy in the first place. I thought at the very least I picked someone who could display basic decency during a breakup, but nope, not even that.

I am not someone who falls hard usually but this was the exception as my future husband, he had proposed! I am picky and I don't give my love or loyalty to just anyone. This was the second committed relationship I've ever been in. The first one was my first love and we broke up amicably. This second relationship I loved this guy even more than my first love, I thought this is it, my future husband, we are going to get married (we were planning for a wedding this summer). So I feel doubly slapped in the face because I am so selective when it comes to who gets my love and loyalty, he knew that full well, he told me I am the most loyal and pure-hearted person he has ever met, and he still cheated on me. It was very cruel, I am obviously more on the innocent and vulnerable side and he took pleasure in sneaking around behind my back and lying to me. Although like a true gaslighter, he maintains because the cheating wasn't ""physical"" it wasn't cheating, which means nothing to me because we all know he wouldn't swipe right on someone he wouldn't want to fuck and there's no proof it didn't become physical with anyone. I feel so dumb being faithful and giving a year of my youth up to a scumbag who couldn't be faithful to me and was shopping around on the side.

I have tried hard to move forward, I read self-help books, I read FDS, I read about narcissists and their signs, I go to therapy (not helping), I read about red flags, I am trying to put energy into my career, but I still feel my hope in love and meeting someone who can be as faithful and loving to me as I am to them has been shattered. I am accepting the fact my picker seems to be off and I am afraid I will always subconsciously pick men like that. The inner work I am doing is helpful to logically know it was my ex who was messed up, not me, but it doesn't give me any hope that I can meet better people or make better decisions going forward. I don't miss him, only who I thought he was, and I know he will do the bait and switch on any woman he meets. But the aftermath for me is I was mindfucked in such an awful way that it's making it hard to move forward and trust anyone else, or be optimistic about people in general. The proliferation of dating apps has just ruined everything, every guy is on there looking for better.

I used to be very vibrant, vivacious, everyone told me I always had a smile on my face. I lived a happy kind of life, thinking that if I work hard and am nice to people, the universe brings good back to me, I used to be super optimistic. But after this horrific life experience I am finding it hard to be like that or expect the good in people. I feel like I can find happiness doing my own thing and being single, but my view of humanity has been altered. What makes me extra sad is that this person has a reputation for being upstanding, and he shouldn't. He has an important and influential position, and he shouldn't. He is such a vindictive and pathological liar that no report would help me, he is just too much of a conscienceless liar. I guess my question is, do I just accept that my picker is off and not date? Is there a way to be hopeful again after being burned like this?",83775,How do you get over past relationship hurt and stay hopeful?,0,,,

And you don’t need any other reason to have a porn-free relationship.

I understand there are SO many issues with porn, especially the ethical side with trafficking victims and exploiting under age victims.

However, I am so sick of women and girls being made to feel bad for their insecurities which are a perfectly normal response to their partner watching porn!

I see so many posts all over the Internet, and hear so many women in real life justify their partners use by “I know my insecurities and jealousy are my problem. I just don’t know how to work through them. I just really don’t like the ethical issues with porn...” etc. 

Of course we should be outraged by the ethical issues of porn. But we shouldn’t have to be experts on these issues to justify and school men, and try to convince them not to watch!

Your insecurity should be enough for him! He should want to show you that he cares about your feelings, and wants to make you feel like the only one for him. 

If men faced the same kind of blatant objectification and constant visual assault of naked men, that we do as women, they would be in the corner shrieking. I know they pretend they don’t care, but this is just a cover so they can continue watching and alleviate their feelings of guilt or discomfort. When faced with the actual reality, they do not like the tables turned on them.

As women, we are constantly being pressured into caring about everything and everyone and every cause possible. It’s great if you genuinely care about trafficked victims, and if you want to learn more and do more in this area - great!

However we shouldn’t have to do this to get our point across to anyone. There are so many causes that we probably all care about, we can’t all be experts in every single cause! We would have no time to work! 

Men are not expected to be experts so why should we?

Why should we not own our very valid feelings of jealousy and insecurity?

Women are gaslit into just accepting so much sexual abuse and lower standards on a cultural level - their partners and other men ogling, cheating, prostitutes, strippers, porn, camgirls and on and on and on it goes. I’m sick of women denying their own feelings. 

Sure, be aware of ethical issues of porn in a general sense, and know where to get the info if you need to refer someone. But don’t feel bad about owning your feelings, or feel like you need a psychology/ sexology/ research degree to explain why porn is bad just to avoid being labelled as insecure or a prude.

Ideally, men should already be aware of the inherent sexism and ethical issues of porn and refrain from use to start with. We know this isn’t too likely, so if we are going to give an inch and a chance for them to stop, at least give that chance to a man who genuinely wants to listen and make you feel secure, and alleviate your feelings of jealousy.",83687,"Your insecurity about him watching porn is valid, and reason enough to expect a no-porn in your relationship.",0,,,

What is sexual abuse? Why is it lacking from descriptions of abusive relationships, of physical abuse? Why are people so reluctant to name it and illustrate it? I think it is because it is so widespread and it challenges Fair Use of women's bodies, the Sex Class as, Spinster Aunt would say. 

Sexual abuse:
Being made to ""perform"" sex for the man rather than satisfy myself. 
Being hurt over and over again physically and saying nothing 
Being hurt over and over again physically regardless of how many times I tell the man that he's hurting me 
Having my vagina ripped open 
Having my ass ripped open 
Or a man ripping my ass open 
Accepting when they ignore me after telling them they're hurting me 
Being ignored when I say I need more foreplay 
Being ignored when I say I need more lube
Men ""accidentally"" trying to shove their dicks up my ass 
Lying there while I'm being hurt
Lying there like I'm dead and having the guy still fuck me like it's OK and he doesn't notice 
Staring at the ceiling while I'm being hurt and violated 
Laying there not able to sleep after he orgasms and leaves me high and dry over and over and over again
Or better, never asking for him to give me an orgasm or demanding 
Being deprived again and again and again of what I want and need 
Feeling like I'm not even there because the guy ignores me so thoroughly 
Never simply saying rub my clit  
Never saying I want to come!
Never saying I don't like that 
Having sex by what I can accept rather than what I want 
Being hurt while he's enjoying himself with my body 
Not changing positions when and how I want to 
Not saying what I want 
Not getting what I want 
Continuing to see men that rape me and hurt me 
Lying there silent while they rape me
Being put down for wanting sex 
Being put down and degraded for liking sex 
Men raping you because you're honest about liking sex.  Maybe this has to do with the fact that liking sex and being the subject rather than object, you're taking their subjectivity away, you're threatening their pleasure, their power and their control of sex?

The truth is that they know what they're doing. They know that they are raping you, they know that they're hurting you, they know that they are ripping your vagina open, they just don't care because you are not a person to them. 

I will no longer accept any measure of pain during sex. Even at the end if it has to fuck hard to come, that's too bad for him. 
I will come every single time even if I have to use my vibrator and he doesn't like that. If he is offended by that then I will stop the sex right there. If he comes first I will make him finish me off.
Sex will be for me or I will stop it in the middle.
If a man refuses to take no for a drink or a date or my phone number or touching, I will call him on it and walk away. I will say ""oh you don't like to take no for an answer from a woman? Rapist.""
I will say what I want to say and ask questions and evaluate those answers. I will probe his ideas about masculinity and femininity, rape and abuse and I will annihilate them honestly. I will leave if he comes up lacking.
I will leave this man if he thinks these are small things or funny or a joke.
I will choose masturbation over lousy dick.
I will stop sex in the middle if I am NOT enjoying it or if he's hurting me or does not seem to care about my pleasure.
I will not accept any subtlely derogatory comments about my body. Such as ""do you tan? well you should get a tan."" ""You should work out more."" ""You could look so attractive if... ""
I will leave any man who tells me what I want or that he knows what I want, especially if he insists despite my protestations.
I will leave if I feel uncomfortable.
I will stop sex if I feel uncomfortable.

I will speak up.

At first I thought it was as simple as when the fur on a dog's back sticks up at a stranger for no reason. But he has gradually gotten worse and my suspicions have been confirmed - he is a LVM. This is his case file. 

Evidence: 

\-Didn't get anything for my mom for Valentine's day because it was the same day his ex-wife served the divorce papers and he was angry all day, despite getting my mom Valentine's days gifts prior. Also, Valentine's day week is the same week of my mom's ex-wedding anniversary yet she still managed to get a Valentine's gift for him.

\-Drinks so much that his doctor told him to stop because it is killing him. Today he began drinking at 11:40 in the MORNING straight out of a liquor bottle. While he isn't an angry drunk in the slightest, it is leading to him accelerating memory loss which runs in his family. His own dad was recently diagnosed with some type of dementia, and was also an alcoholic. I find it upsetting that he would do this and potentially leave my mom stuck being his caretaker one day. She actually was his dad's caretaker for over a year WHILE she was going through menopause and she became depressed with all of the stress because my stepdad's dad disrespected her DAILY.

\-As for the chores, my mom does 99% of the housework because her job allows her to stay at home. Since I moved in, I took over a portion of it to help her with the stress. He literally does NOTHING except cook occasionally (and ruin it half the time because he's drinking while cooking) or wash the dishes in the sink (??? Have not seen this in a while. Recently heard him say he doesn't know how to use the dishwasher in his OWN HOME). Despite him doing none of the housework, for about a month during quarantine he became fixated on the dishes never being done and implied that my sisters and I do no chores and we're the reason our mom is stressed (LMAO). He called my sister lazy and made her cry, and my mom still defended him saying that he was having withdrawals...

\-Lastly, my own personal pet peeves would be that he constantly asks if I work, when I work, where I'm going if I head to my car, and notifies my mom if my car is gone. This is SO annoying because I am 22, and they got married when I was 18, so in no way did he raise me. I have also lived alone since I was 18 and only recently moved back in because of covid. My own mom has asked him to let me just be an adult and come and go as I please, yet he hovers. He also constantly burps and farts and then in a mocking voice says 'excuse me' as a joke because he obviously knew it was coming. He is basically a redneck who refers to anyone who it not white as colored people, which I have told him TIME AND TIME AGAIN do not use that outdated terminology in public for the love of god. 

I truly do not know if I can handle folding this LVM's laundry another day. I just feel so alone in all of this because my sisters may feel this way but certainly don't feel as strongly as I do, and it's difficult to avoid him because it is a VERY small house. I basically live at the dining room table and he doesn't fucking hesitate to fart anywhere. I know he isn't the absolute worst, and sure he has some good qualities, but even ONE of these bullet points would've been enough for me to realize this isn't worth it if this was my husband.",83646,I'm sick of living with a LVM stepdad.

In spring 2019, I got out of a relationship with a LVM. As unhealthy as the relationship was for both of us and as much as I knew the breakup was for the best, healing was still difficult. 

I joined FDS, consumed all the information you’ve all worked so hard to put together, and took a few months off from dating to heal. I also began losing weight (I wasn’t overweight before but was at the high end of the healthy range for my height and knew I could look even better) and am now 25 pounds down. 

When I returned to OLD, it was exhausting. I encountered many LVMs (some who didn’t reveal themselves to be LVMs until several dates in), but I reminded myself not to define my worth by their validation or how well they were treating me, because I know I deserve to be treated like a queen. 

Aside from dating, I stayed busy with work, friends, fitness, hobbies, etc., but I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t TIRING weeding out one LVM after another, with time investments involved in the ones who weren’t LVM right away. I learned how to be completely happy alone but also knew in the back of my hand how much  joy the perfect HVM for me could bring to my life.

Enter my current boyfriend who I met after several months of OLD. He’s the man of my dreams - we connect deeply on an emotional, physical, mental, etc. level and I love who he is. We’ve been dating for 5 months. I followed FDS principles to a T (mostly...I agree with 99 percent of the rules here!) and always carried myself as a prize all along (he has no idea my ex was a LVM and no idea that I was at all jaded from OLD, and he believes I was always treated like a queen). 

The night we finally had sex for the first time he told me he wanted to treat me like the queen I am...and he’s never stopped. I’ve carefully observed his every move and he hasn’t wavered. We’re the perfect match, and I truly couldn’t be happier. 

The FDS journey never ends. While I am confident in him and our relationship, I know that I need to continue to be the HVW he fell for and need to be able to appreciate the joy he brings to my life WITHOUT ever RELYING on him for my happiness. I reread “Why Men Love Bitches” from the FDS-suggested readings because it has so many important learnings about how to maintain my independence and allure and not lose myself in this relationship. I’m confident in myself that I won’t ever be a pick-me again (like I have been in a past life) and that I can continue to hold my own in this relationship. 

So grateful to FDS for everything and just wanted to share!",83645,FDS worked for me!,0,,,

English is not my first language so forgive all the mistakes.

 I have internalized the words ""whore, slut, prostitute etc""  said to me by my school bully and my verbally abusive mother(Though she has stopped now) in my childhood. Everytime I do something like laugh out loud in public, wear clothes that compliment my body  I ask myself if this behavior will be seen badly? if I will be called a whore/slut behind my back? and how do I stop this thinking pattern?

I am 27 years old, an engineer and never had sex or a serious relationship cause in my country women are expected to be devoted to one man and if a girl changes boyfriend she is automatically labelled a slut, divorce and remarrying (by women) are rare cause of slut shaming and its a taboo to have premarital sex though things are changing now.I am average looking and get approached by men but in the past I was unable to move on from the guys whom I had crush to for 2-3 years(unhealthy, I know) so I never gave the men who approached me a chance.

The last guy (whom I approached)  I was talking to who scammed me for drugs told me, ""You act like a whore of \_\_\_\_\_(red zone area of my country)"" because according to his logic if a woman approaches a man she is a whore. I have codependy(which I didnt know about back then) and was thinking I was ""helping"" him by encouraging him to seek help. The whole time I was talking to him I kept telling him to seek help, go to rehab and finding locations of NA meetings in my area, was being super supportive cause he kept saying he wanted to get clean. He knew I had feelings for him but I never asked him to be my boyfriend, always avoided conversations about sex. He knew my dating history, he knew I am a virgin and still called me a Whore. I know now trying to help him was because of my own issue ie my codependency not because I had compassion/love for him. And I am dealing with that. But every time I am reminded of the words he said to me I feel like crying. How do I get over this?",85246,I have internalized the word whore. how to get out of it?,0,,,

basically I just graduated college and every summer when I was home I would hook up with this guy (he's a little bit older and has been out of college for a couple years now). never turned into anything serious because I was not looking for a relationship in the past but I'll soon be moving to the city he lives in &amp; staying there for my foreseeable life post-grad! In the past, when I was just home for the summer he definitely made it clear that he liked me (i acted in a high value way, never needy or initiating anything wooo) but like I said, i didn't want anything real. but now that I'm about to be in the real world, I'm reconsidering a relationship. he's already reached out a bunch about hanging out once I move into the city but my question for you queens is: if / when I do see him, does it matter if I hook up with him right away since we've done it in the past? or should i try to ""reset the clock"" and make him earn it again??

We met in college and toward the end of undergrad we moved in together. That’s was 3 years ago, we’re in the same place relationship wise. We’ve gotten better jobs, I actually helped him his most recent job that included a $5000 sign on bonus he would try to get my engagement ring with. Before Covid-19 he was a music teacher, but that job no longer exists. So I wasn’t so surprised when a piano was delivered this week. Then he told me it was about a $800 piano and I was livid. I helped him get this job, and he spent his bonus on... a piano?? He’s obviously not taking me seriously and he’s fine with how things are. To make maters worse, his family regards me as his wife and his cousins/nieces and nephews call me tia. I’ve told him, and at this point I feel like I’m begging. If he ever does it I don’t think it’ll be because he’s excited to marry me, but it’s something he has to do. He wants to marry me, he says, but he just wants to go to the courthouse and I just want a special moment. I see that happening for other girls, and I think I’m great so why not me??

In my most recent relationship with a NVM the scrote wouldn’t go down on me unless I shaved down below EVERY SINGLE DAY. On top of that, he was very pornsick and watched a lot of hentai - couldn’t keep it hard if his life depended on it. He would even go limp during penetration but probably thought I wouldn’t be able to tell.

Shaving that area too soon after the hair starts growing makes me bleed A LOT and irritates me badly. I was very much a pickme and would spend hours in the shower every week bleeding everywhere only to make sure I got every tiny little hair. 

The loser even stated that he likes it fully shaved and “not looking like a jungle, because I’m not an explorer”. Yet he hadn’t shaved his disgusting pubes since puberty and I would frequently have them stuck around after sex. Gross as shit. Not to mention that he had nails and TOENAILS longer than some girls with acrylics.

Now that I’m out of that shithole I shave every 4 days, as that’s what I’m personally happy and comfortable with. I’ve also strongly come to consider shaving for men as a very pick-me trait.

I also personally believe that men who make a fuss out of a girl’s shaving habits are LVM and heavily pornsick. While I understand having a preference, trying to impose that on your girlfriend or attempting to change her habits in your favour is 100% not HVM behaviour.

I'm still in therapy for the backlash of it.

Back when I was young (17) and dumb and (Fill in the blank with the rest of the phrase), I started dating this guy we'll call him Johnathan. He was 19, sweet, nice, funny, ultimate package (at the time). We met while we were both enlisting in the military. I was enlisting in the Army and he, the Air Force. We became friends and then decided to be exclusive. He took me to my senior prom, we saw each other every day before we shipped out to basic, even went on a quick mini vacay out of town the week before we left. It was perfect in my eyes.

In basic training, you have limited access to outside communication so we wrote each other letters. I actually still had his letters until about a month ago when I burned them, for some reason I couldn't be bothered to burn them sooner. They were just put away in a box somewhere in my house. So for 10 weeks that's all we had. In tech school (job training), we had a little more communication. It wasn't much, but in my mind ""we're both so busy so it is what it is"".

When we finished training, I came back home to MS because I was National Guard, but Johnathan went to Florida for his duty station. No big deal. We made plans for me to come see him for his birthday a few weeks later, I paid for my plane ticket, he picked me up, and it was a week of just fun in Florida. We even almost eloped, but something in my gut told me, ""nope, don't do that. Just wait on it."" So we didn't.

Not even a month after I made it back to Mississippi, little homie started dropping off the face of the earth like this was cool. He'd go days, weeks, without answering a phone call or a text, but then would pop up out of nowhere like it was all good. I explained away everything like its no big deal. This went on for about 3 or so months. After that, I got straight radio silence 10 months before we were supposed to get married. Plans had been made, things just needed to be paid for. I know, I was an idiot. It took a lot to learn.

It wasn't until I was invited on a trip to Florida (Two years after we started dating mind you) with a friend girl of mine, that's when shit hit the fan. I went, had some fun, tried to ignore the fact that my supposed boyfriend thought it was cool to just drop off the face of the earth like that. I snapped and told her I'll be back, I'm taking a drive. I drove to the Air Force Base, remembered where this dude lived, knocked on the door and told him we needed to talk. He took his time answering the door. When I walked in, I saw the evidence of another woman and I had seen enough. Cool bro. You found you another woman, but you couldn't be bothered to tell your fiance that you didn't want to be with her anymore? That was too much?

He fed me the bullshit of he was just scared of getting married, and he didn't know what to do or to say and didn't want to hurt me. He loved me, but just needed to take some time to figure himself out. I took the bait. I was pissed, he knew I was, and he gave me what I wanted to calm me down. He said give him some time to sort himself out and we'll make it work. So I went back to Mississippi a happy woman because I thought I had made some good progress in this. I thought that was what strong women did. As soon as I left his presence, I received only more radio silence. He would shoot me a text every now and again, but after I got comfortable with talking to him again, he was a ghost.

He did that to me for about two more times over the span of two more years, and I hated myself for allowing it to happen. I only stopped it because every time he did it, he was with a new girl, and he would cheat on that girl with me. The last time we were in each others presence, he was telling me that he had a baby on the way. And I wasn't going to allow him to defile me any further, especially knowing that he was doing another woman dirty who was carrying his child. The breadcrumbing hurt me to the core to the point where I now have some serious insecurity issues. Hell, I'm married with my own child, and I still have the occasional fear that my HUSBAND may think I'm not enough for him. It took me a long time to bring myself back to some type of sensibleness, and therapy was a huge part in that. I just wish I had recognized it sooner so the damage could be minimized.",85196,My personal experience with breadcrumbing,0,,,

How do you choose a healthy partner based on the way they give you presents? Let’s take four scenarios:

1: A single mother is dating a well-off man. He takes her out to dinner, treats her to gifts, brings her flowers. However, he hasn’t given anything to her son. She is in a difficult financial position after her divorce and asks him for money for her son and he refuses. Instead he continues taking her out on fancy dates. She breaks up with him and he is left confused. 💔 

2: A woman has been with her boyfriend for several monthes. He tells her that he has no money for gifts and dates. However he routinely buys himself drinks, gaming supplies, clothes...🎮

3: This lady has been with her boyfriend for a while. He should know what she likes and dislikes. However each birthday, he buys her a perfume set knowing she has a scent-allergy. 🌸 

4: A woman gets into a fight with her partner. He takes her to the store and begrudgingly tells her to pick out a present for herself a sign of his ‘saying sorry’. She reluctantly picks out some flowers that he pays for. However she is still unhappy at him because he hasn’t properly apologized with words and he doesn’t understand why she is so unthankful for the gift he bought her.

Have you recognized any of these cases? What is similar about all the situations is the fact that the man does not understand the value of gift giving. We see repeating themes of greed, narcissism, manipulation, lack of interest. A gift is neither a way to buy someone’s love, nor a way to manipulate someone into doing anything for you. A gift is a sign of generosity and love. 

Here are some warning signs and positive marks to look for in a healthy partner.

Healthy signs ⭐️ 

🌟  He asks you about your interests and needs.

🌟 He is generous with his time and money. 

🌟 He understands that finances are an important part of a relationship. Spending money of your significant other is a way to provide and protect and to increase value in their life.

🌟 His gifts reflect your needs and interests.

Warning signs ⚠️ 

⚠️ He lies about his financial status.

⚠️ He is a long term unemployed man. Not due to special circumstances, but due to laze and immaturity.

⚠️ His needs come before yours.

⚠️ He doesn’t spend money on your children. A man who wants to take responsibility for you realizes that your children are just as part of the relationship package as you are.

⚠️ His gifts reflect only his needs and interests.

⚠️ He manipulates you into doing things for him in exchange for gifts. This is life any sexual favours, emotional favours, physical favours Ext. His gifts come with a price tag.

 ⚠️  He is upset if you aren’t overly excited about his gifts. He thinks his gifts owe him endless praise.

⚠️ He uses gifts to buy your love and affection.

Do you have any situations of gift giving in relationships to share? Write them below. Until next time 👑

I said that was really unfair. He knows that I am not interested based on conversations we've had in the past. I told him he needs to find someone his own age (exactly the same age not years or decades younger) and stop projecting his lack of a relationship onto me.

I told him I've had enough of his behaviour and that it wasn't healthy for me, and wasn't healthy for him.

Among the various tricks and whining that then ensued (you can imagine I'm sure) he proceeded to complain about women his own age and why they were no good.

 I told him he was just HOLDING UP A MIRROR TO HIMSELF. 

Every complaint about them was just total nonsense. It ranged from he didn't really want sex anymore to they werent attractive and he didnt want to have to listen to them talk about their grandkids.

I said if that's how you think about women your own age, I can assure you that's how women  think about you.

He then insisted that ""I just didn't understand"" and tried to give me the option of having a relationship with him ""where I could be physical with someone else""

Who cares that I'm not interested apparently. Just here's another option so he can make it work for him. 

More than anything he seems to take great pleasure in letting his friends know he's ""going to visit me"".

I am turning 27 in a couple of days and I am from Nepal. And I have had a fulfilling life with a good family and friends through school and college. All my life I have been overweight, I am pretty but fat and guys don't approach me tbh. I told my friends about my love life and sex life. But the truth was I have never been in a relationship nor have I had sex till last year!! I have talked with guys long term but none of those guys ever committed to me, even though they made me their therapist and fucking drowned me with their bullshit, I was always their friend. Tbh now that I think about subconsciously, I felt inadequate being single. I can never be honest with my friends about my past cus I have lied so much about my ""relationships"" saying those guys I talked to were my boyfriends lol.

Last year my work friend and I ended up having sex for a couple of months and then he ended it with me after burdening me with his fucking issues and using me to get over his ex girlfriend. It took me so long to get over what that fuckboy did to me, the audacity of that imbecile dumping me while we had just ended having sex. I still have flashbacks of him making fun of my vagina, and calling me ugly at times *as a joke* of course. We weren't in a relationship but I did girlfriend shit for a fuckboy. At that time I was going through a lot with family stuff and the way he dumped me really disoriented me, idk how to explain that. And I thought he was my friend, that's the kicker. I was gaslighted so hard, him stating again and again that we were just good friends, I questioned my judgement.  I tried being his ""friend"" but I felt so betrayed by him, I was basically incoherent and begging at times for him to take me back, ew.  I worked through that and I don't talk to that asshole anymore. Deleted and blocked, left that job and I feel so good, it's been around 6 months now. Onto the next one, I hooked up with someone from Tinder and he had told me he just wanted and casual stuff but I still thought I could change that LVM lmao!! We dated for a month and when I told him I wanted more he ended things with me. 

That was just before Covid situation and these past months I have been self reflecting a lot at why I give them sex so easily when they don't even respect enough to ever ""date"" me. And I know I am a beautiful intelligent woman but those men made me question my self worth. I have always acted confident but I have never been really confident if I let those kind of men treat me so poorly.

I am turning 27 and I always felt like I lost so much of my time and potential as I had abandoned my Bachelors degree in the past but I am now again enrolled in online school to get my degree. When I finish my degree I'll be 30. My forever dream has been to move to Europe and live there for some years to get my masters but I have been panicking thinking how my friends are all getting married or are on the way to get married. I act as a confident modern woman but I panic thinking about societal conditions of getting married ""at the right age"". **FUCK THAT NOISE!** I will get my bachelors and move to Europe at 30.

It's been so eye opening reading the guidebook and opinions of you all here. It's been shocking but completely right unlearning these shitty sex positive agendas where I have to be cool and easy for men! I don't have to get married or date below average dudes with mediocre dicks just because time is running by. I will live for myself. I will only date guys who respect me and want me as a partner, not just use me like a fleshlight. I am not going to try change men, I will only give time to a partner who is worthy of me.

Thank you all!",85147,A long vent about my life as a newbie here!,0,,,

When I snooped my boyfriend's phone I did it because he has done something fishy and I have found his narcissistic tendencies. but I never got a chance to find proofs.

On reddit app, he saved tons of nudes and followed a bunch of NSFW subreddits.(almost 100 NSFW subs)

On His gallery, there were 1GB of nudes from pornstars.

And I found he exchanged girls' nudes with a cousin of his when he was 16ish on his Instagram inbox and his cousin suggested threesome to my boyfriend several times saying 'wanna kick it with this b**ch? She'll take both of us.' I don't know if my bf did it or not. 

And in general he was not respectful. The other day I asked him if he was bigger in high school and he said ""if I was I wouldn't have met you."" Lol and then I tried to break up, he begged me to forgive him. I should've dumped him at that time.

Sorry for unorganized format. I am done with him. I called him sick human being and he said ' you are overthinking this God know I didnt do, you are involving with my past too much. Stop' and then I was sure he is a narc.

Please be kind and gentle in your responses.

A guy I graduated with reached out to me last year wanting to get together. In school, he liked me but he picked on me because he said he couldn’t handle his emotions and had insecurities blah blah blah. It really hurt me how he treated me. So when he reached out years later wanting to see me, I didn’t take it seriously.

Fast forward, I moved back to my hometown and he’s been pushing to see me and take me out on his boat. I confronted him with how he treated me and he apologized a few times. I also confronted him about rumors being spread through friend circle about how he treats women sexually. He had answers for it all and I believed them.

While he was pushing to set a date to get together, he asked if I lived alone but then made plans for us to go back to his house after. 

I was pushed away but thought I was overthinking and he did say he has a guest room.

Then I realized, our entire conversation has only been about him and me asking him questions. He never once asked about me except if I lived alone and when I was free. He also got super annoyed when I wouldn’t cancel plans to see him. He then bashed his daughters mom called her a fat slut and a deadbeat mom.

My anxiety was already heightened the moment he reached out, but the comments about his daughters mom really disgusted me. 

I told him I wasn’t comfortable going on him boat with him but would be happy to catch up and talk.

To which he said that’s fine but what do you mean you’re uncomfortable. I laid it all out there about not getting to know me, his baby mom, the sexual allegations against him and how I feel he doesn’t respect women. He replies “okay. Do whatever you want”

I haven’t responded since but it’s weighing heavily on me if I was being an asshole. I need tough love that I AM making the right decision and I’m not over reacting or the opposite. I have my therapy appointment next week and like I said, I’ve never had a healthy relationship so if this is common sense to someone else, it’s not to me... I keep second guessing myself and I guess wanting to give him the benefit of the doubt because he did make a comment that I’m holding something from 10+ years ago against him.",85114,Can someone tell me if I’m projecting my insecurities/trust issues or if he’s probably trying to just get laid and he’s an ass??,0,,,

Why can’t I just enjoy this (lol surprise it’s because I’m codependent and also don’t trust his intentions, despite still being mad for him, for the reasons about to be chronicled)?

So long story short: Basically, for a year I (25F) have been in a grey area friendship with my close friend (28M) who I have cuddled/fallen asleep with several times. For the first half a year or so, He kind of lead me on, avoided talking about us, and when I confronted him he said he needed friendship right now but that it could change (that was last fall). Right after that convo, (lol don’t kill me) we moved in together with a couple friends. We have amazing chemistry and an amazing friendship, so naturally we’ve been great roommates. I had to get over the fact that he was dating around, and I was heartbroken, but I took the L. Right when I took the L, he kissed me. Best kiss of my life. And then we kissed again the next week. And then it seemed like, okay. Maybe we are just getting situated as roomies, and something could actually happen eventually. Come COVID times, we’re closer than ever. 100% on our married couple shit, we’re completely intertwined. Something has felt like it’s really shifted, and the closer we get (he’s giving me so many signals, I mean we basically are constantly touching each other) the more I really think something has changed and things between us are blossoming. But, I’m having a ton of fear and self doubt, since reflecting on how he was in the past (and fearing that, maybe nothing has changed).

I think what’s scaring me is that my illusion of him is shattering by considering the other possibilities. A quote that sparked me to actually consider all my fears was “A relationship that only exists when you don’t speak up is a prison.” And it worried me. I’ve been hurt by him in the past, and really, who am I to say the signals he’s been giving me are him “changing”? They could be just for sex, attention, or just to see how far he can go before I burst the bubble and confront him. The bottom line is: I don’t know. And also that I’m simply searching for answers that can a ONLY be found through verbal communication.  EVEN IF things continue to get physical, which I’m not even sure I want if he doesn’t want anything more, I can’t really say that’s “him changing”. 

Also, I found that the “Law Of Attraction” has been both helpful and a total monster with this. In the beginning, I found it, and it kickstarted my self love journey and my understanding of how negative beliefs turn into negative thinking which turn into self sabotage. But I also found myself feeling this pressure to best myself up whenever I felt this crappy feeling about my situation because it felt like “well if you just FELT GOOD ABOUT IT it would HAPPEN” and I felt like I couldn’t just feel my feelings (though on the flip side I know it’s not good to ruminate- perhaps there is a healthy medium?) otherwise I would NEVER get what I want. 

And then part of me has been questioning whether or not I even want this still or if I’m just basically trained (by myself) into chasing commitment from him because it’s been at the forefront of my mind for literally over a year. 

In the past, I would say he’s been emotionally unavailable, and quite frankly gaslit me over the entire situation we were in. He would avoid  communicating clearly what he wanted and just avoided any plans we would make go hang alone.

But in the present, I would say since we kissed in December, but even more particularly since April, our married couple thing has gotten real strong. He’s constantly touching me. We are constantly flirting. And for awhile, that was the validation I needed to see that there was a chance of something happening. And I feel like all of the pressure is on me to ruin it or not ruin it (and I feel like if I’m not aloof and chill then I’ll ruin it... and that feeling sucks). But now, I just can’t enjoy those little fun flirty hits of validation because I don’t know his intentions. 

And not to mention  it’s so hard for me to let go of the reasons I initially put him on a pedestal: he’s kind to others, caring, cares about me, cares about humanity, has interesting thoughts, silly, we have amazing chemistry, same sense of humor, same sex drive, same passions... I could go on. I’ve just always had a gut feeling we’d end up together, and this realization of how he’s actually treated me in the past is skewing my view of and my hope for the future (even though there might still be a chance). 

I just don’t know what to believe, and I can’t quite figure out “the right time” to talk to him, because it feels like I should wait a little bit also feels like I literally can’t and need to talk to him right now. Both options somehow feel self destructive. 

I feel like all I need to do is ask “so this thing we have going on, I like it and would love to see where it goes. So I have to ask, do you see it going somewhere?” But I know that if he said no, I would NEED to move out. Because being around him while heartbroken and our trust broken would be torture for me. But it’s also torture not saying anything. But as far as moving now, it seems like such an uncertain time with COVID, so I don’t even know if that’s possible. 

Do I wait? Do I plan to move out and THEN tell him to just drop me a line or something? If so, how do I manage my feelings now with him always around me? Do I just say it now and hope for the best? Do I focus on myself and try and forget the whole situation for now anyways (especially due to COVID)? Any thoughts are appreciated! Thank you for the support!

TL/DR: I am roommates with a close friend that I’ve had a grey area relationship with. I’ve always wanted more, and in the past he’s avoided that and didn’t. But now, it seems like he might want more. But I don’t know if I can trust the signals he’s giving me because of how the past went down, and I think I need to talk to him... but talking to him and risking being stuck with him if it doesn’t go well seems just as much like self sabotage as bottling it in does. So I don’t know what to do. Help?",85101,"In love with my roommate... but questioning his intentions due to mixed feelings about grey area history.

The wife was diagnosed with THREE forms of cancer in the last six months. She is doing okay, but probably has only a few years left, at most. 

Here’s how her high value husband handled the situation: bought her her dream river-front house a few miles from their children/grandchildren, retired from his job to be present with her every moment of every day she has left. He is currently fixing up the orchard on the property so she can continue to can and jam the fruit, her favorite hobby. We went for a walk after lunch and every few minutes he asked her how she was doing/if she needed to turn back, asking “How are you doing, my sweet wife?”.

I just wanted to share this incredible couple because we hear so few stories of men who truly treasure the women in their lives. Yes, they are of an older generation, but their children have witnessed a HV relationship and have mirrored those traits in their own lives as well.

-my boyfriend is looking at pictures, following girls, won’t pause his game- (if this has been going on for a while, you don’t need our permission to yeet him aside? Haha)

She is high value to the core and would never ever do anything to hurt me. And there is no way a chance that I will chose a man over her if need be.

Anyway, my fiancé or whatever the hell he is jokingly said he wants to marry my bestfriend. I was immediately taken aback and called him disgusting and a creep. But then the conversation changed. 

I am assuming that he said this to hurt me and get revenge. Since i told him about a guy who showed interest in me. My fiancé got jealous and made an issue out of it. But I just kept quiet. Then he made this remark about my friend.

I know for a fact that my best friend would never even consider him or even talk to him without my permission. Just like i would never make a move on her guy.

But I cannot shake this weird feeling inside me. What if down the road my “fiance” or husband wants to sleep with another friend of mine and that friend being an opportunist takes on the offer or something? 

Its like the more i think about it, the more i want to throw this whole man away and never deal with this kind of shit again.

God. I wish. I wish so hard that that were true.

My country has been quarantined for months. During those months i met lovely men and have enjoyed chatting, one even here on reddit. I was so excited to start meeting them in person. I've met 3 now and exchanged pics with 3 more. Decent guys. 

But...

No one prepares you for how physically unappealing these ""prime"" aged men are. It's like turning down the aisle of a Halloween shop where they keep the creepy masks.

I want to cry.

Worst part is i think i just have to get past this and look past their looks? I guess? I hate to be shallow. Really i do. But I'm so disappointed. Coming to terms with the fact that this is just what reality looks like. I like sex with younger men. But there's no way I'd enter a relationship with a young man.

My husband passed years ago. I wasnt ready to date back then. Which i regret. Back then the dating pool was a lot of men who divorced for understandable reasons (actual incompatibilities that were overlooked because of marrying too young). Now the good looking ones that are divorced in their 40s and up seem to be divorced because they're cheaters and sex addicts. That right there filters out tons of them. Oh and 40 plus year old fuck bois, dont foget those guys. So now whats left is the normal but unattractive guys. It seems like.

Recovering Pickmeisha here. I'm relatively new to this sub and absolutely love it. Before I found this sub, I always used to split the bill or pay for dates. Men rarely picked up the tab. Now that I've found FDS, I'm trying to level up and deprogram my ""Pick Me"" behaviour. I was a serial bill splitter and paid for men much more often than they paid for me 🤦‍♀️. I now realise that I wanted to be the ""cool girl"" and show them I'm a ""strong independent woman."" Thankfully I  lurked this sub and realised how insecure I probably was and that expecting a man to pay does not take away my independence or degrade it in any way. It's simply a standard that I SHOULD have. Also male approval or attention ain't shit. I'm genuinely starting to think that women insisting on paying for dates or bill splitting comes across as desperate for  approval to men. So they're more likely to test your boundaries and disrespect you.

I want advice on how to react when the bill arrives?  Do some of you offer to pay/split then bill and then ghost if he allows it? Or simply smile at the guy and do nothing? It usually feels like such an awkward moment when the bill arrives. If the guy refuses to pay or insists on splitting the bill, how do I react or respond with class in the moment? I know I'll be deleting and blocking guys after the date if they pull shit like that.

We’d ft all the time when I was at school, home, work just all the time. In our calls he would love bomb me (didn’t know about that before) and tell me I was so perfect and his soulmate and we even made a list for baby names. At one point he came to my city for something and had me drive out to him to a hotel and he smoked and got high and when we where in the hotel his homie was sleeping and he had us go into the bathroom, made out for a few mins and then he went straight to trying to penetrate me and I told him no and he was like ""what you don’t just fuck anybody"" and I was like yea tf and plus I’m a Virgin and you don’t have a condom and his response was ""I don’t like condoms and I always pull out"" so I go home and we continue talking. Then he tells me that I was too young and that we would have to wait till I was 18 to start dating. So we spend the next months texting and calling with promises that he would come see me or fly me out and to no avail did any of that happen. At one point he started asking me for money here and there to get food, fix his car, or his check from work didn’t come through🙄, bullshit like that. So months go by and I finally turn 18 and nothing happens, he starts to love bomb less and less calling and texting less than out of nowhere he starts calling himself my boyfriend and I confronted him about it and his response was ""I said we’d start dating when u turned 18"" and I was like you didn’t ask nor took me out you gotta communicated that sort of thing and in there somewhere he said “I love you” and when I didn’t say it back he got offended even after I told him that it would be better when I mean it. Then weeks go bye barely calling and then when he would call he would accuse me of cheating???? Or ignoring him on purpose. We than had a conversation about me going off to college and at one point I was like I’m gonna live on campus and get a dorm and he was like ""ooo imma be all up in ur dorm room"" and I told him that that was weird and creepy and he got straight offended and hung up on me. So I find FDS and have just now been realizing that he’s a MAJOR LVM,LEM and that whole year that I have wasted on him when I could of been having fun in my last year of high school with boys my age just infuriates me and I feel like I was taken advantage of at my age.

Ok so, we were in a LDR. We lived about 3 provinces apart. He is very talented and ""uwu quirky🤪"". We were good friends but he caught feelings because I'm ""the only one who complemented his works all the time"" (I like to encourage others). I didn't like him but I felt bad and said yes. The thing is, he CONSTANTLY B*TCHED ABOUT HIS ""toxic"" ex and called her ugly. He was RUDE to my sister (I love my sister how dare you). He called me the b word before multiple times (as an ""endearing"" term). He constantly called people ugly as if he looks any better (even me sometime). He pressured me to say the n word (he's black) and I was really mad whenever he does that because I'm not a rude person who would call people degrading things. He also dismissed me a lot. We both support anti racism and I told him about how the hate crimes toward Asian people really hurt me. He dismissed it and doesn't care unless it comes to black issues which I'm all for it. He could at least listen to what I have to say. 
He also followed a lot of Instagram models and p*rnstars. I told him that I'm uncomfortable and I would only follow Instagram models because of the products they sell or to use their aesthetics as an inspiration. He told me he's too lazy to unfollow them and I understand because I'm lazy too. He was ALWAYS jealous of my ex before him and called him mean things. So I deleted the pics of me and my other ex off my spam account. He never did the same for me.
We planned to meet each other when I'm 18. But he doesn't want to travel here to meet me but insisted me travelling there instead knowing he's wayyyyyy well off than me (he's upper middle class with a hugeee house). He knows that I'm lower middle class with a disabled mother and a father carrying 2 jobs. All because he traveled to another province before and it was the worst experience of his life because there ""wasn't a lot of black people"". Girllllll, I was an immigrant yet I can handle living in this predominantly white land for YEARS. I was offended a little bit but I understand. He kept telling me that he hates gold diggers and wouldn't simp for chivalry whenever I told him ""hey my bag is really heavy since I have a lot of textbooks, I wish you were here to carry it for me."" And buy me raccoon plushies, other random stuffs that are probably $10. He was so rude about it I literally cried. He kept telling me that he doesn't want to be a provider for me because of his past experiences with his gold digging toxic ex. I KNEW something never sat right with me. At last, we broke up. Thanks God.

I need your help. I (30F) have dated one too many LVM in my life, two of which were really damaging. Since then, for about a year now, I've been trying to adhere to FDS Handbook guidelines. However, with this new guy I'm dating (about 2 months now), I'm having a hard time telling. 

Here are some of his HVM attributes:

- he is a huge gentlemen in every sense: he opens the car door for me every time, pays for everything, walks me home, always opens the door for me, etc.

- he classy and comes from a good background/family

- he is VERY successful and very financially stable. And he definitely spoils me

- he is intelligent and well-educated

- he is extremely hardworking 

- he is generous in the bedroom, BUT* he can't stay hard

- he has a protective personality in that he provides for and takes on responsibility for some of his family members

- he met my parents and was great with them

Now for his LVM attributes:

- he literally ONLY talks about himself. He never asks about me and if I ever start to talk about myself, his eyes gloss over and/or he interrupts me to turn my story about himself. It's just about his friends, his stories, his job, his family, etc. It's making me not feel an emotional connection with him.

- he said ""I love you"" after one week. I really didn't feel it and didn't feel comfortable saying it back, but he was persistent and kept saying it so I waited about a week until I caved and finally said it back to him (I know, I know...I shouldn't say it if I didn't mean it, but he kept putting me on the spot). But I think for him, it doesn't carry weight

- he hardly texts or calls me except for a ""have a wonderful day!"" text once a day. That's like, how I sign off my emails. It feels so impersonal.

- after a few weeks of dating (after he had already said ""I love you"") I saw that he still had Tinder on his phone when he was searching for something. I called him on it and he sheepishly denied and changed the subject. But then the next day he came clean and said he deleted it and showed me his phone to prove it. He said his friend had installed Tinder on there and he had notifications off for it so he had forgotten about it. I think I believe him, but still something I wanted to note

- okay I don't know if this one is LVM, but this is just weird and I think tied into how quickly he said ""I love you"", but he calls EVERYONE ""my love"" or ""darling"" and ""honey"" and ""doll"". Like he's even said it to male waiters. He even casually drops ""omg I love you"" to people, like my doorman or waitresses and stuff. He says it's because he's charming (yes, he called himself charming, which I feel is in direct contrast to someone who is actually charming).

- despite considering himself my boyfriend and telling me he loves me, and despite him only being 30 minutes away, we have no plans to see each other for almost two weeks. When I asked him what gives with us having no plans to see each other for that long, he says it's about ""boundaries""

- I know in the HVM part I said he spoiled me, but to be honest, the wining and dining has died down pretty significantly from our first few weeks. It almost feels like he was going in head first at full speed the first few weeks with really expensive dates, with calling me his girlfriend so quickly, not to mention telling me he loves me so quickly, etc., and now that he feels like he hooked me, the effort has subsided...hardly any texts, hardly making time to see me or take me out, etc. I mean, he runs like 3 businesses so I get he's busy, but still...

I don't know. I know the bar is super low for men, but I really am smitten with how much of a gentleman he is. He really blows everyone else I've dated out of the water when it comes to class and gentlemanly traits.

I said to myself after my last ex I wouldn't settle for ever feeling like an option.

He said he'd call at a set time and I had to prompt. Then he showed as online but didn't answer me for another 10 minutes. He asked to call me after half an hour of being a no show; I said thanks for standing me up, declined the phone call and blocked.

Did I do right? My friend is reading me for filth over it saying I was being overly harsh, but fuck, I think if it was important, he'd have stuck to the time! 

...or am I crazy?

Edit: ooh, so update. He called my mobile because I didn't block his number there! What an oversight. He apologised and conversation was okay for all of 10 minutes, AND THEN ""so would you be willing to meet for a drink?""

""No""

""What are you looking for?""

I am noncommittal but obviously not ""looking to see where things go""

""Well, if you want to meet me for a drink and get to know me, I'd be up for that. No expectations, LIKE YOU (????), but yeah, I'm down for getting to know each other""

LOL!

Thank you for reiterating my intuition, random Hinge mistake. And I'm sorry I ever doubted myself and gave you a second chance.

And thank you FDS community for once again proving that the rules are there for a reason.

We had a good chance to catch up with one another, and we were able to bond undisturbed throughout our gathering. Around 10:30pm, my friends decided to call it a night. I had a drink to finish, so I decided to stay behind at the bar for a bit. Within 5 minutes of their departure, a guy approached and sat at the barstool next to me. I did not pay him any attention and remained focused on my drink. Roughly 2 minutes passed before he started talking to me.

He introduced himself and asked me what I was drinking. I had been around the rodeo enough to know that this was his opening line, and I didn't want things to drag on for longer than they needed to be. I told him what I was drinking and that I was leaving once I had finished the drink. He proceeded down what I presume to be his normal ""pickup banter"". He said he had seen me with my friends all night, and he only now had the opportunity to approach me. He said that he found me cute, and that he would like to have my phone number.

My only interest at that time was to finish my drink and leave, so I politely declined his request. I took that moment to gulp down my remaining beverage and stood up to begin my exit. At this point, the man decided asking for my phone number again would be the right call. I declined him again. He asked for a third time, to which I again declined and started walking towards the bar's exit. 

Much to my surprise, the lovely gentleman decided to follow me through the bar and grab my arm to stop me from leaving. He asked me one final time for my number, and wanted to know why I wouldn't give it to him. It is at this point that all desire to remain cordial on my end had evaporated from my being. I removed his hand from my arm, told him no a final time, and  proceeded to address the entirety of the patrons of the bar for an announcement. I asked if any lovely patron would be so kind as to give this man a phone number, since I would not be giving him mine. The bar erupted into laughter, the man stood there dumbfounded, and I continued to walk out of the bar.

I thought I was in the clear until the man barged out of the exit door 10 seconds behind me, and followed me to my car. He was irate at this point and had cornered me between himself and the driver side door of my car. He was so in a fit of rage that he had also failed to notice the 5-10 guys who had followed him out of the bar in order to watch a spectacle that was likely afoot. Much to my surprise, the men that came outside to watch the drama unfold actually stepped in, grabbed the man from behind, and drug him away from me and back into the bar. 

To whoever the gentlemen were that swooped in and carried the rowdy gent away, you have my sincerest thanks.

Dating was never brought up. He went through a messy breakup fairly recently and is still living with his ex, only one of many reasons I'm 100% a no go on him. 

Lately my gut has been giving me 'hes interested' signals and I'm quite unhappy about this. I like hanging out with him, hes always been platonic with me and as I'm sure every woman on here can relate to I dont have male friends bc they always find a way to duck it up. 

My question to you wise woman is do I tell him I'm not interested in a romantic or sexual relationship preemptively or wait until he makes a move/declaration?

Obviously there's a classy and a ratchet way to do this, and I'm all for women celebrating their bodies, but I wanna know your general opinion as I don't remember reading about it on the manual. Hope you are all staying safe and well &lt;3",80649,FDS stance on posting revealing pictures on social media?,0,,,

This is sometimes lauded as the woman being assertive, in control, etc. And indeed, you should not be allowing someone to make the decisions for you with regards to your life affairs. But, know where to draw the line, and recognize if you're being taken advantage of, by having a bunch of stuff dumped on you that isn't your job. 

As many women get older and get married/start having families etc, they become accustomed to bearing the brunt of this, whether it is deciding what to make for dinner everyday, coordinating schedules, setting up appointments, remembering things for everyone... The list goes on. This is reproductive work, and women are not compensated for it. 

Many men try to justify it, saying he is not good at xyz, telling the woman she does it better and she is so good at doing it which is why she's in charge of it, (also applicable for things like cooking, cleaning etc). 

Meanwhile, these men are often in positions of power in the public sphere, or at least have jobs that demand some sort of skills like organization, planning, supervising, etc. It has nothing to do with not being capable, the only difference is that they are being compensated for it. So they often leave their wives/girlfriends to do the emotional labor at home, resulting in women not only bearing the brunt of their own affairs, but those of her husband/boyfriend as well (and the rest of the family if applicable), as well.

The building is my hopes, dreams, goals etc. I’m the worker with my safety shit on so I don’t fall off, fixing that building. The scaffolding levels are men. With everything set up safely, I’m going higher and higher doing the work on said building with the help of the scaffold to go between the levels. It’s not to say that I *can’t* get to that next level on my own, because I will MAKE a way, but if a man is in my life at this point, he’s gotta be functional and practical. He *has* to serve a good purpose that I can readily identify. Something that I can use in my life besides hard dick and bubble gum. 

I’m tired of building men.

Edited to add: or maybe I just know too much about construction due to my soon to be ex husband that I’m signing divorce papers with this week. 🙄 In any case, this article about scaffolding is hilarious when you think of it in the dating terms I laid out 😂😂😂

Things that my aunt has put up with over the years of being with this guy(that we know of):

* verbal abuse in front of her children and my mom
* controlling behavior/jealousy. She can't go to family reunions without him calling every 10 minutes to yell at her
* getting locked out of her house because scrote is mad and changed the locks
* multiple occasions of her and her children simultaneously crying because of how stressful this POS is
* living in a shit city because he doesn't want to spend more in a lower-crime city

This is not something my aunt knows about, but one time he was watching lesbian porn WITH HIS DAUGHTER IN THE ROOM. I can't remember if my cousin said she was 5 or 6 years old at the time, but yeah... absolutely disgusting.

Even before I knew that he was a porn addict, I didn't like the guy. I overheard my cousin (age 15 at the time) and him talking on speakerphone at a family reunion. He plays mind games. He spoke in a way that made her think she was in trouble (""I want you to be honest with me"") only to turn around and lightheartedly ask ""did you have fun?""

My aunt has her FB status as ""married"" but she has no ring on her finger and my mom said he never proposed. Idk.

Whenever I would bring up my concerns about my how emotional and physical needs were not being met (and this conversation happened far too many times over the course of a few months), his first response would usually be to reassure me that he isn't intending to hurt me or be malicious or neglectful. I finally got it through to him that his so called intent doesn't matter - the impact does, and his impact on me fucking sucked.

He was so busy with work, his house, getting his MA, hell, even his plants garnered more attention and care than I did, it seems. But he was the one who early on in dating pursued me. Then as soon as he had me all effort went out the window. He didn't communicate. I had to initiate important conversations, and he would barely contribute. I suspect he's on the spectrum which makes communication more difficult, but at 35 years old with multiple degrees and all of the information in the world available at your fingertips, he should have done his own damn research to figure out why he was so emotionally constipated and how to improve.

I think back on things that happened with us and I get so angry. He doesn't understand just how negatively his neglect impacted me. I am left wondering what I even meant to him. He couldn't even tell me that when we had our closure conversation, just that I ""wasn't an afterthought to him"" like he  so often made me feel.

I've always been that woman who has dated men for their potential, or tried to fix them, etc. It stems from my childhood trauma which I have been in therapy for years to unpack. I have come a very long way. I had an emotionally, physically, sexually, and financially abusive ex that drained me dry for a year (luckily, only just) while I was trying to fix him with my love to no avail, of course. And then I end up with this emotionally unavailable and neglectful guy, because his abuse isn't so outright. It's really fucking me up.

I also get angry with myself for putting up with it for so long. This one lasted about seven months, and I should have ended it four months in, if not sooner than that. I'm happy to be single now and to focus on myself and it will stay that way until a king comes around and treats me like the queen I am. But damn, this healing process is a tough one to navigate.

I got back on tinder and had a few virtual dates and last night came to the realization that I am not ready to even just casually virtual date. It was draining me, and I didn't realize. It's draining to swipe through so many trash men and feel like there isn't a HVM out there for you, even though I know there is. While I'm fine being single right now, I do crave love and companionship. I'm human, and I want to share my life with someone just as incredible as me. But I'm not going to settle any longer just because I want that. It hurts so much more than being alone.

Also, I'm getting a couple of cats soon, and I can't wait to pour my love and care into them and bond with their amazing selves instead of a stupid ass man.",81700,Realizing just how wrong things were &amp; dealing with anger,0,,,

But also in just average bros. Not just in romantic relationship but friendship and business. I must never express anger, even if it’s incredibly justified. 

It gets shamed like me being unstable. Or if they’re being generous- immature 

I’m the quintessence of patience. If I finally snap on someone it’s is something they really need to be held accountable on. 

I feel like it’s an emotional gaslight designed to keep things comfortable for them. A manipulation technique to keep you in your place. And to keep you from holding them accountable on things they know are fucking wrong.

Every time you express something that is wrong in the relationship you go unheard or if you turn up the volume- shamed as an unstable crazy. Another thing i’ve encountered is them shouting you down into your place when you express a valid concern. Almost to scare you/ intimidate you out of speaking your concerns. Like you just keep that pretty little smile on your face. It’s almost an abuse tactic to my mind or at the least a very unsavory intimidation one.

I find it reductive. It’s like a silent pressure is being exerted on you to be malleable and doll like at all times. You are not allowed the full range of emotions a normal human has at their disposable- of which anger is an necessary/ appropriate component- just the cute ones that bring them pleasure to see. 

Same men have no trouble being loud, aggressive and that’s right- ANGRY about things you do they don’t care for. And of course their anger is powerful and right- never immature, out of control or mentally unsound like mine supposedly is. But it’s like you must walk on eggshells to express displeasure with anything in the relationship 

If i finally get them past the point of ignorantly ignoring the problem and gaslighting me that it doesn’t exist, it’s like it’s such a painful blow to their ego to acknowledge that yes, this is happening and no i’m not happy with it. 

Like they reel with hurt over the idea i don’t think they’re perfect/ performed perfectly.

Almost like telling a man the sex is bad. That’s how bruised the ego gets and how much upset there is.

In bros it manifests as them always wanting you to be cheerful and uplift them in convo and bailing if u ever have a real world issue. Sick? See ya! Job issues? See ya! But they’re perfectly fine using you as an emotional kleenex/ therapist/ cheerleader for their many more frequent and more petty life problems.


tl;dr- Tired of reductive men who try to shame your appropriate shows of anger as you being unstable. Or go crazy shouting them down louder than you, to cow you into not speaking up. It’s like some men only want to see cute emotions and use manipulation techniques to cow and train you into showing only those emotions that are convenient to and sexually desirable to them- the cute, doll ones",81691,Common Issue I Find with Men,0,,,

This is why we don't put up with or chase men that aren't ready for commitment.  At best, you'll get a man that realises he has no other options and you'll enter a loveless marriage where he settles for you and is always looking for someone better or will leave you as soon as the woman he loved is free.  Men are the real marriage trappers.

My ex recently dumped me because he wasn't ready for marriage and children which is fine and all but he did string me along knowing it's what I wanted.  He said he hoped when he was ready (eg after he sleeps around looking for better) we can get back together.  No, I am not waiting for you.

There seems to be this belief that the more you suffer through these relationships that are unhealthy, or make you feel bad about yourself, or the more people you really liked or even loved break up with you, the more likely you will find your forever love/soulmate.

I have seen threads on other dating subreddits where people will talk about how they have had dozens of short-term relationships (some didn’t even make it to that point). There is nothing wrong with that if that is all you wanted. But I feel like if you had hoped to find someone for the long term, and the same thing is happening over and over, you could think about what you could do differently. 

For example, I dated a guy back in the beginning of the year. It lasted for a month (4 dates). I was always more interested in him. There were so many signs that he wasn’t that into me. When I look back, I can see that I should not have asked him out on 2 of those dates, I should not have offered to split the bill, I should not have gone out with him when he just wanted to go to a bar, I should not have started so many text conversations. I have no desire to repeat that experience over and over. I am aware of what I did ""wrong"", and what I will do differently next time. 

While I will always agree that being single is better than in a bad relationship, I don’t think constantly getting in these meaningless or unhealthy short term relationships, if you can even call them that, or putting too much time and energy into guys that don’t deserve it is anything to brag about. 

I have friends who will start dating a guy. They know there are red flags. A lot of times they do not even like him all that much. But they feel obligated to date him until he shows he is “crazy”. It does not make them feel good about themselves. Afterwards, they need to take a break from dating because they feel like shit. 

I guess I just wish there were more acknowledgement of the mental health toll dating can have. Whether it’s dating people who make you feel bad about yourself, or getting your heart broken by someone, and then repeating these experiences over years or decades, it can definitely have a negative impact on a person. And you can either change your action or change your response. Personally, I would rather change how I date, how I vet, what I look for, my standards for how I want to be treated, than try to make myself be super positive about bad dating experiences.

In conclusion, what I like about FDS is it teaches women to take action when they spot the first red flag, to vet men extensively, to not feel like she owes anyone a chance, etc.",81591,You don't have to waste your time in meaningless or unhealthy short-term relationships,0,,,

I analyzed it and talked about it with friends. It seems that it's not very widespread in my country and absolutely not something men would even 'joke' about.

It made me think about the translation as well. In English, you can say 'to strangle' and 'to choke'. The latter seems to be normalized and sexualized. In my language, we translate 'to strangle' to 'to strangle' and 'to choke' to 'to strangle/suffocate'. Both have very negative connotations. It would be very scary for a man to say either one to a women.

I did notice that LVM who try to cover up their toxic behavior use a lot of English words of words from other languages (most people in my country speak several), because it kind of softens the blow.

I feel that men try to use language to distract form their toxic behavior: 'a little bit of choking' instead of ' I want to strangle you', 'breath play' instead of 'suffocation', 'you're so sensitive/you can't take a joke' instead of 'you can't take insults' and so on.

They really use language to their advantage. What are some examples you encountered? I would also be very grateful for the more 'uncommon' ones, since it's good to spread the word so more women can protect themselves by covert toxic behavior.",81575,Using specific language to distract from toxic behavior,0,,,

If you have not yet done so, [please read this post about our website launch first.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/hiha1o/its_here_weve_launched/) 

We had to launch the website sooner than expected, so changes are still rapidly being made; you may see things be switched around on a daily basis.  You also may see some popular posts be deleted from Reddit and moved to the Website. This is to protect our content from deletion by Reddit and piracy.

Now that we've had some time to streamline the process, we are making a few changes:

**SIGN UP:**

1. We are only accepting 8 digit code requests through the website. If you PM me or any of the mods on Reddit, Instagram or Twitter we will be redirecting you to the website. This helps us keep track of all the requests in one place.[Click here to request an 8 digit code.](https://www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com/8-digit-code)
2. Please make sure you can receive DMs on your platform of choice. There were some people we tried to send codes to who had their Direct Messages disabled, so we had to pass. 
3. Please be patient! Due to demand, We are on about a 72 hour lag on sending out 8 digit codes. If you are not an existing sub member or someone we can easily identify as female from your social media, OR we can't reach you, you will likely be passed over for someone else in the queue. 
4. We have some members who we've sent codes to who as of yet have yet to create an account.  If you do not sign up within 60 days of receiving your code, you will be bumped from the approval queue completely and will have to start over.

**FORUM:**

1. Once you are approved, please log in and say hello in the Forum! We just want to make sure it is working for everyone. All new members are restricted to one post per day for their first week of membership to make moderation easier for us while we get the website off the ground. 
2. The Strategy subs and Sex subs on the website are for members only - this is to protect the privacy of our members who want to ask sensitive questions. If you are not logged in as a member, you can read posts, but you cannot comment.

As a result, am a bit naive about OLD still. I read this subreddit religiously, which has been a huge help for spotting red flags. I’m probably going to stop OLD pretty soon to give myself a break, but I’ve been noticing a weird trend with some of the dudes I’ve been talking to: during the FIRST PHONE CALL, they will sometimes ask me if I’m dating other men. 

I’m always kind of mildly insulted by the question. It seems super strange to me. I would never assume that I was the only woman they were talking to, but I would also never dream of asking about it for the first few months, let alone on the first call?

I’m always honest and say that I’m talking to other guys, which always seems to throw them off as well... but, again, that seems like an odd response. I never ask them back because I honestly don’t care; it’s just way too early
to even think about.

At least one of the guys seemed socially adept enough to know better, so it can’t all be due to social incompetence. Is it a PUA tactic? Or some weird jealousy paranoia thing? Are they looking for women who are only going to date one guy at a time while they explore other options?

No matter what, I can tell it’s a red flag and have crossed those guys off the list... but curious what y’all thought is going through their minds.",81557,Question for people OLD right now,0,,,

Why does it matter who is the table? 

- Secretive deeds are done under the table 
- Honesty means laying one’s cards on the table
- Switching things up causes the tables to turn
- You might invite an enemy to come to the table 
- An idea you disagree with is totally OFF the table while a good prospect is ON the table 

Tables are arguably THE single most important and useful type of furnishing. There are perhaps more kinds of tables than there are of any other type of furniture.

The table is the meeting place and negotiating platform.  BEING THE TABLE means any interaction you have with a potential male suitor revolves around how he interacts with you; not the other way around . YOU ARE THE FOCAL POINT. You are at the center of this equation. Women level up and become High Value to gain intrinsic worth.  MEN LEVEL UP TO PROVIDE SOMETHING FOR THE TABLE (WOMEN)",82098,Don’t level up to bring more to the table. BE the fucking table.,0,,,

I was super excited about my new Level Up Strategy and all that but it turned out that my issues with men and dating sociopaths were more than just because of cultural and societal influences. I recently started therapy. I might actually have HPD which makes things a little more difficult and while I told myself to stick to the handbook, it basically took one pretty fuckboy to make me completely forget my principles. Something really traumatic happened to me, once again.

Now without going into detail he basically lead me on to take advantage of the fact that I was infatuated with him, intoxicated and just vulnerable overall. He turned me down the next morning, after he got what he wanted. I’m hurt, disgusted by myself and in complete despair because I feel like I keep making the same mistakes.

Now my friends think it could be helpful for my self esteem and self respect if I stand up for myself and send him a big fat text in which I call him out on his disgusting behaviour. 

Part of me thinks it could be helpful, the other part just wants to hide and not bother or face him because my stupid brain still things he somehow deserves the comfort of knowing that he can just dine &amp; dash without consequences.

I’m talking to my therapist on Friday but I first wanted to post here to see if you have any advice on how to stand up for yourself even though it’s hard and uncomfortable and part of you still wants the guy to like you.",82004,I need some help standing up for myself.,0,,,

So my lovely teenage self had finally accepted that I was gay. So, I’m telling all of my friends, my family, guys who would hit on me. It was a beautiful time, this would mean that guys would no longer bother my ugly ass self(At least I thought I was. My self-esteem didn’t come until later, but I’ll explain that in another post.). This would mean that my friend who’s liked me since we were in elementary school would move on from me. He’d respect me, right? 

Fucking wrong. That was the time I learned that men do not care about your sexuality one bit. He became even more obsessed with me. He would appear everywhere I went, just watching me. I talked to my guy friends to see if they would help me. I’ve known them longer than I’ve known my stalker, they’d help me, right?

Fucking wrong. Instead, I got the blame for leading my stalker on. I got blamed for the bruises he left on my arms after he grabbed them so tightly because I wouldn’t listen to him. Apparently telling him that I don’t like him for many years was leading him on. Telling him I was a lesbian: Leading him on. I only had one guy friend on my side. He would escort me to and from class and he would prove to be the only guy I could trust. And that was because we’re both gay.

My regret was not telling my mom, the school, any adult. I regret listening to all of my guy and girl friends who said that I shouldn’t get him in trouble because it was my fault. Their asses were dumped immediately.

The lessons that were learned: Guys don’t care one fucking bit about your sexuality. Guys will literally band together if you even think about telling them about their friend’s behavior, even if you’ve known them longer than they’ve known your abuser. If you’re being hurt, tell someone. You can’t be helped if no one knows.

I know this subreddit isn’t really for lesbians, but this subreddit has helped me level up. This subreddit has taught me to choose my friends wisely. And this subreddit has taught me to stand up for not only myself, but others around me. I may not use it for dating advice, but I sure as hell use it for a lot of other advice and for that I want to thank each and every one of you queens! 👸🏽❤️",83098,A lesbian who had to learn about men even though she doesn’t date them.,0,,,

I’m happy for any of them, if what they portray is real, but I can’t help but cry. It shows me that HVM might exist, but they are just far, far away from the realm of possibility for me.

If I don’t see these positive romances, then I either don’t think about relationships or I am content with the fact that I may never be in one. But I find positive love stories to be more triggering than hopeful.

I feel like that should be enough, but some of these dudes are VERY intent on knowing the specifics.

So here's why I'd rather keep silent about it:

As some of you may know, I was stuck in a six year relationship (my first ""actual"" relationship) with a guy who I thought was ""safe"" because he was nerdy. Looks wise, I was far out of his league. Our first year was okay, but after the second, his true side began to show and I'm still mad at myself for letting it extend for so long. I should have known his fucked up home life with an abusive, playboy military father was a gigantic red flag. But I was a naive PickMe.

Year 2 was the first time he cheated (with a friend of his who was still in high school because she was a ""conquest"" he'd forgotten about...his words). He was 21, she was 17. It was also the first time he laid hands on me by twisting my wrist extremely hard because we had an event to go to and he refused to leave the house without a couple of his grandmother's Vicodin pills (to take for fun). He also chain smoked due to his BFF doing the same thing, and when I said it bothered me he stopped for one week before resuming.

But I think our last two years were objectively the worst. By that time, we had moved in together, since he pressured me into it because ""oh my grandma is kicking me out, she says she can't handle another person in the house."" Mind you, he uprooted her peaceful retirement with all the bullshit he was doing, so I'm not surprised. He was kicked out of his parents' house for being a ""danger"" to his sister and two half sisters. I later on found out that he may have molested his bio sister, when she had told me he often said that he wished I looked more like her. I look like a woman, and she has the body of a 12 year old girl(inherited from their mother). Obviously I would have never been able to match up to that, but it explains why he loved going for petite/thin girls. The manic pixie ones were his favorites, or ones that looked barely legal.

Our apartment life was miserable as fuck. Every three months he had decided he was ""bored of me"", and would kick me out of my own damn apartment just to bring a girl over to fuck in our bed or in our living room. And I had actually overheard him and a girl he had been casually dating fucking because they were moaning so loud. That shit messes you up. The only reason why she broke up with him is because one day I happened to be home first, and I locked myself in the bedroom and refused to leave, and I could hear her whispering that this wasn't cool and that she was ending this. She was perfectly aware that he was still ""sort of"" with me. He turned our relationship into an open relationship without my permission. Sometimes I still remember the night he came home hopped up on cocaine, proudly bragging that he had fucked the hottest stripper at the strip club he and his buddy went to. He waited to meet her after her shift, and he would not shut up about how she had the most beautiful Southern accent. In total, he must have cheated maybe 15 times while I was faithful and did everything a girlfriend should do. 

He would also get terribly drunk and tell me the nastiest things. I can still recall the time when he was mad that I didn't want to have children with him, and he said ""I would love to just tie you up in front of your parents, slit their throats, and then rape the fuck out of you. Maybe then you'll give me a child.""

When he was back in the honeymoon stage, besides the constant sex(for his pleasure), he would ignore me for hours to play League of Legends or some other MMORPG, leaving me alone in our bed. I would wake up to go to work and still find him playing games, on the brand new Playstation I bought for him.

But besides the mental/emotional abuse, the worst was the physical. He became belligerently drunk one night, and choked me to the point of blacking out \*twice\*, just because I was not as thin as I had been five years ago. He would deliberately starve me, weigh me, and track me to the gym to make sure I was working out. I was not overweight btw. I'd just grown into my hips that I got from my mother. 

The last straw was when we were living at my parents' house after losing the apartment, and that particular day, I was excited because I'd just gotten another raise, and a promotion at work. I finally had money to fix my dying car, because he sure as shit wouldn't drive me to work. He was drunk by the time I came home(he was unemployed at the time and my parents had been pressuring him to go looking for jobs as a stipulation for letting him live with us). I told him about my day at work, and instead of congratulating me, he got angry that I wasn't using the money on him, and attacked me. My mom heard us both hit the ground from downstairs, and she came running upstairs to find him pinning me down, his fingers pressing hard into my jaws to shut me up from screaming. She had been holding the phone, and out of shock and rage, she smacked his head with the phone, and yelled for my dad, who had luckily just come home. My dad's a big guy, and when my ex tried to make a bolt for the door to escape, he tackled him and held him down while my mom called the cops. He was arrested that day, but because of white privilege he was released in three days. He manipulated me into not pressing charges because my bruises were ""self inflicted"" and that I must have gone into the bathroom and beat myself up to show the cops.

This is just a very small snapshot of the torture I went through, and while therapy has helped a ton in getting through a lot of the PTSD I got, I do not want to divulge ANY of this to a new partner. They do not need to fucking know, because god knows how depraved some men are. 

TL;DR: What is a proper answer to get the point across that the past relationship ended, end of story? I do not want to divulge the entirety of my incredibly abusive LTR.",83019,"""When was your last relationship+why did it end?""",0,,,

Now I noticed that it had many pros and cons, and tell me what you think about it

Pros:
-the girls were strong and independent, i love how the show made them stronger than their boyfriends, and how you see them moving on without focusing on their love life. There’s literally an episode where the MC ( aka the redhead) was being judged by her boyfriend for focusing too much on improving her powers, but at the end he admitted that he was wrong and regretted what he did by saying that he acted like an idiot, and that he was ashamed that his jealousy made him afraid of seeing his girlfriend having fun without him. 

- you sometimes see the male and female characters having a meaningful conversation with each other without falling in love

- the alpha man wannabe ( Riven the purple haired man) is portrayed as a ridiculous show off

- it teaches girls that they can be girly and badass at the same time.

- the only great physical thing there is that it made me confident with my hair color, cause except the little mermaids redhead were rarely represented as attractive in many cartoons. It was the first time that I saw a show featuring a redhead being nice, attractive and popular.


That série made me and my cousin confident in our intellectual and athleticism abilities and I never thought for a second that a man was physically superior to me because of it. It’s surprising that this show was made by a man

Cons:

- unfortunately like most cartoons they have the girls being anorexic and thick at the same time, with big light wide eyes, voluminous thick hair  and inexistant waists. What I also noticed is how the fairies ( the good girls) have an angel skull and great features but the witches have a witch skull with a big crocked nose.

- the other beauty standards they set is how all the girls have either dark hair with light eyes, and the only girl with brown-hazel eyes ( Stella) is a blonde!  Even aisha the black-mixed fairy who was supposed to be ethnic have blue eyes.

My best friend have brown  hair and dark eyes and it made her feel a little bit anxious about her coloring even tho she’s gorgeous, cause it made her believe when she was a kid that the only way for a girl to be considered beautiful is to have light eyes and dark hair or dark eyes and light hair, or light eyes and light hair. 

I my self have redhair and hazel eyes, so even tho I became confident with my hair color, I couldn’t help but thinking sometimes that the main character was only considered pretty with her hair because she have light blue eyes",82964,I would like to share a cartoon with you girls.

I’m a newbie and was wondering what FDS thought of name changes. For starters, I know, you’ll tell me I shouldn’t have changed my name in the first place. But my father was a dirtbag abuser, and I took the easy way out when I got married and changed my last name to my husband’s and dropped my maiden name completely. I have very little attachment to that side of my family, and all of the family members I do like don’t share that name. I even like more in-law family members in my husband’s family. (Although, we’ll see after the divorce is known...which will happen after I change my name publicly.) It made sense at the time.

But now I’m getting a divorce, so yeah, I can’t keep my husband’s name. I never liked it that much in the first place (it’s a weird one you always have to spell), so this is definitely not the saddest part of my marriage ending. I don’t want to go back to my father’s last name, as we have been NC for years.

I am considering selecting a name from my mother’s side of the family, since I feel closer to them. But we’re still not close. Also, all my choices for her side are Hispanic names. I grew up with the privilege of my white father’s name. The feminist side says go for it, but the logical side says, “Don’t do it! You live in a racist state in a racist country!” A person with a white name gets more respect—it’s just the reality we face in this day. Even my own mother uses an Americanized version of her first name. I don’t know if I want to subject myself to more racist hate from white LVMs.

Did anyone pick a brand new last name in a divorce? How did you decide? Unmarried ladies, anyone else pick a new name in adulthood to detach from your abusive family member’s name? What about middle name changes? My current middle name is just a generic popular name during the time I was born, so I’m not attached to it either, so I might change them both since I have to pay for it anyway due to not just reverting to my maiden. Tell me your stories and share some thoughts on changing names in adulthood.",82907,Divorced ladies and name changes,0,,,

I can't help but compare myself to those men and wonder if I'll be like them. I have a great boyfriend of 4 years but I'm not sure he is the one I want to marry and settle down with. He's wonderful but because of financial issues we don't live together, we're not engaged and I feel unsatisfied sexually. I don't want to be one of these people who thinks ""the grass is greener"", and end up alone because I've left something good. 

So I just wondered in the event that I do walk away from relationship, how could I be happy knowing I might not even find another loving and loyal man? I can't imagine being happy alone. I am not close to family and don't have many friends. I'd like to hear from some happily single Queens ❤️",83419,Are there any older women here who are happily single?,0,,,

Since reading FDS, I’ve been very cautious about men in general, so I refused to label him HV, even though he “seemed” it. I wanted to wait for him to unfold. Last week, I notice that he was way more distant that usual. As in, he wouldn’t respond to my texts for hours at a time, sometimes for the entire day and didn’t really attempt to start conversation. I asked him what was up and he said that he didn’t want to invest more time into the relationship because he was wanted to work on his career instead. He said he’s happy with the way things are now (breadcrumbing). 

Pre-FDS, I would have taken that as a cue to start chasing. I would have told “ooooh, that’s okay, I won’t ask you for anything, I’ll accept whatever crumbs you’re kind enough to Chuck at me”. I have an anxious avoidant attachment style, so when I feel someone is pulling away, my instinct is often to chase them. Doing that landed me in a situationship for three years. Now, I’ve cut him off. I know I have a lot to offer, and I’m not going to waste any more time on someone who can’t even be bothered to meet me halfway. I’ve been reading “Mr Unavailable and the Fallback Girl” by Natalie Lue, and also reading pretty much every post here, and I know I’ve made the right choice. It’s always difficult to accept when someone who seems promising fails to deliver, but the days of chasing after lukewarm are through. I’m going to take a break from dating for several months (possibly the remainder of the year) and continue to work on myself, but I’m so glad I’ve found this community. 

Thank you all ❤️❤️❤️❤️",83420,Finding FDS has really made me realise my worth and that I don’t have to put up substandard behaviour and crumbs from men,0,,,

I am seeing that the search for a husband-material and father-material has been pretty difficult for me. I will be 30 in a few years. I have always wanted to have kids and be a mom, and I have always wanted to have kids between ages 27-33. I am not shading those who became mothers older, but I would definitely prefer to do it sooner rather than later or closer to 40. I want more than one kid, ideally 3. I am not certain I will find the right man by 27 to have kids with, and I don't want the absence of a man to affect my life plans too much. Should I look for a high-quality sperm donor, get pregnant and have kids on my own? Any man who comes into my life after that would have to be a supreme top-notch HVM, otherwise I would be ok with being single for life. I just am seeing months after months go by in my dating attempts, despite using FDS, my time wasted by non-committal guys, or guys I figure would not be the kind of husband I am looking for (too selfish).  I do the 90 days rule, let him chase, everything, but their long-cons fall through later on and I have to dump them eventually for revealing their true colors. I don't want to prioritize finding a man because I may reach 40 when that happens and my biological chances of having kids naturally by then decrease a lot. I watch Shera on youtube and she recommends not working so hard, not being ambitious, hanging around good areas to find suitable men, and I do kind of want to try that, but I also have put so much already into my education and career. I do not have time to find a husband the non-working or lite-work way. I am grateful that I have enough savings right now that I could try that out for a year, but I would be setting myself back on my career trajectory. What do you ladies think? I am totally on-board with FDS philosophy, and putting myself first, but being a mother is something I have always wanted and I would be heartbroken if that weren't to happen. So I am not really looking for any answers that are along the lines of ""forget having kids, just have a career, get rich, be the cool traveling aunt"".  I am also thinking that my location might be a problem. I could try moving where more HVM and marriage-minded men are abundant, but I don't know where that would be. The women in my life are so career-driven, I don't think they understand my desire to be a mom at some point, and they tell me to put it off because it will just happen somehow. I don't think it works that way. I see they often settle for LVM and that's why they think getting pregnant is always a possibility, but I have higher standards than just any LVM in my life at the time. Isn't a sperm donor preferable?  If I were to meet a HVM, he would have to be at the financial level where being a SAHM would be an option even though I would always remain financially independent and working at least a bit.

I remember one of the things he always joked about was how ""demanding"" I was because I always stated my wants and needs. However, because he said it often as a ""joke,"" I started to become so self-conscious about everything I said and did around him. My responses went from ""What? You can't handle it?"" and laughing it off to ""Is that a bad thing?"" It would loom on my mind and I would keep thinking there was something wrong with me. I wish I had realized this early on and walked away then, especially when he joked about it quite frequently.

Ladies, if a guy jokes about how ""demanding"" you are, he really can't handle you. He knows you're worthy but he ain't worth it. There's nothing wrong with having standards and knowing what you want and what you need.",83349,Demanding,0,,,

Here is the original e-mail if you're curious: [https://ontd.pictures/images/2020/07/11/IMG\_5351-copy.png](https://ontd.pictures/images/2020/07/11/IMG_5351-copy.png)

Basically, an ex reached out to me after 2 years of no-contact to apologize for not being ""patient"" during my anxiety and for trying to drink all the time. This is the same guy who secretly filmed me in the shower because I wouldn't give him nudes.

Many of you suspected he's part of a 12-step program but said that his email made too many assumptions and wouldn't be approved by an AA sponsor. Today, I found out he's been sober for 3 months. A friend told me that he posted on social media about how he's sober now: Here is the post my friend sent me: [https://ontd.pictures/images/2020/07/11/Screen-Shot-2020-07-11-at-11.30.20-AM.png](https://ontd.pictures/images/2020/07/11/Screen-Shot-2020-07-11-at-11.30.20-AM.png)

My mom thinks he's trying to hoover me w/breadcrumbs, not that an AA sponsor told him to apologize to me. After dating me for 2.5 years, he ghosted me and started dating someone 9 years younger than him *immediately*. Now they're living together, and I'm sure she's miserable like I was.

Uggggghhhh... why can't ego-driven LVM men just sit home and masturbate to photos of themselves instead of dragging innocent women into their messes?  I don't plan to respond to his e-mail, but I'm just pissed off that he got in my head again after I'd finally moved on.",83337,Follow up to the ex who “apologized” to me but didn't apologize for secretly photographing me nude w/o permission,0,,,

They always say ""you have your hobbies, and I have mine"". What are my hobbies? Painting, reading, watching documentaries, cooking, jogging, yoga... you know, age-appropriate things that are productive, and usually are a skill that can be refined over time (apart from the documentaries I guess but at least they're intellectually engaging). I don't think my hobbies are anything particularly amazing, but I've yet to meet a woman who was as unproductive as the average Western man in her free time (I have no idea if men are such gigantic babies outside of Western countries - are they?). So, how are video games equivalent to this? You shoot at pixels and get angry if a 14 year old on Xbox live pwns you, or whatever. This isn't productive, it's extremely immature, it's not a useful life skill, it's not creative, it's not really intellectually engaging. I always look down on men who game more than as a way to pass time when they're really, really bored.

As for car stuff and collecting bobbleheads (or Funko Pops or whatever it is these days), sorry, that's kinda dumb too. Unless you're a mechanic and can fix a car, I don't find it impressive that you dump all of your money on a loud, obnoxious vehicle. Most of these guys don't actually have the skills required to service a car, they just have some ""fancy sports vehicle"" that they for some reason think females find attractive. And don't get me started on collecting random Star Wars and Marvel crap, it's so immature. They need to just grow up and get adult hobbies. It's embarrassing. I decorate my room with pretty, artistic things, not action figures and bobbleheads and posters from children's franchises.

Of course, you can *enjoy* these things in moderation, but that's not what I'm talking about. Too many young men devote their entire lives to these things. It's even worse once they're married, expect their wife to make half of the income, and when they both come home from work, their ""free time"" is spent differently: She goes and cooks dinner, does laundry, dusts and cleans furniture, and he goes and plays Far Cry or polishes his moronic ""nice car"". If the woman sits down for a minute to enjoy a book or movie, she's wasting time. But he can continue to live in a 5 year old boy's world where money and time is devoted to unproductive, immature things.

No thank you. Never dating another gamer, ""car guy"", or Marvel addict ever again.",84440,"Guys who play video games, obsess over cars in a childish way, or collect stupid piece of plastic as ""hobbies""",0,,,

My mother and my maternal grandmother were both married to violent, alcoholic perverts (my father sexually abused me &amp; my mother pickmeisha'd her way out of taking responsibility for it). I was raised to believe that men were something holy and perfect, and that women are here to serve them. Of course, no one in my family would say it that way, but it sure did come across that way. Everything my mother and grandmother ever did was to become more beautiful to men, and ""men won't like you if you X"" was a common criticism toward me.

Of course, I grew up thinking that a man is the most important thing I could achieve in life. I thought I needed a man, or I failed. Every relationship was the same - I met a guy, didn't really like him *all* that much, but thought I *needed* him because he had a penis, so I changed everything about myself for him (the amount of ""phases"" I went through because of a guy, ugh), wasn't happy at all, usually got emotionally abused, and then it was over. 

Currently, I'm dating a guy... but taking a completely different approach. I don't *need* him for anything. I keep him around because I like him and he's nice to me. I could go the rest of my life without him. My personality is my own, my interests are my own, I don't pretend to like or believe in anything because he does (I used to do that for *every* guy), and I'm not changing a damn thing about myself for him! And for the first time in my life, I'm at least somewhat at peace with a relationship.

And it's true. I could go the rest of my life without even speaking to a male. A decent male is an alright life addition, but he's never anything necessary, anything you couldn't live without. If I do get married, cool. If I don't, also cool.

Men get better with age or sth. They will hit their  prime at 40, because that is when they will become wealthy and  succesful, attracting loads of 18-20yo FEEEMOIDS. While stacys will  become postwall hags that nobody wants.

But, what does reality say?

Unamrried  men are a very, VERY unhappy demographic. The percent of men who are so  rich they can have sugarbabies is incredibly low. Just look at wealth  distribution. The average male could never. **And average means most.** Even a financially stable male cannot afford that, as being a cashcow is ESSPENSIVE AF.

Truth is, if they do not settle down and be a HVM spouse, there are two options for them.

1.)  Be a part of the 1-2%, become extremely rich by having incredible  luck and a privileged background so they can afford to finance a sugarbaby-  who ofc won't be loyal because- why?

2.)  Be a lonely and invisible average Joe who cries on the internet about  women, telling himself that he will enter his prime anytime now as he  races towards 45, then 50, then 55, while alcoholism gets worse and  pills just keep popping.

Reality is that single women are the happiest demographic, while single men just... rot.

Their  entire idology is a lie, from the false statement that a traditional family makes  women happy, to the false claims about female and male SMV with age.

Oh  and, EVEN if women have less sex appeal with age, fuck does that  matter? Males are in most cases nothing but an energy drain, yet they  act like that pathetic worm between their legs makes them a real prize  to behold. It does not work that way.",84307,The lie misogynists tell about female/male happines,0,,,

Sometimes I deal with mild jealousy and idk if my jealousy is really being directed in the right way.

Example: he went to a guys friends house a few nights ago after work, he ended up ghosting our text conversation and the next day said he meant to text me when he got home but passed out, then he told me 2 other girls came over too. 

One of these girls I feel like he has a semi crush on, she’s gorgeous. Idc if he pays her a compliment or anything like that. But he talked about how pretty she was a few times in the beginning of our relationship.

And after her bday she posted the pic of them together first out of all the photos she took that night. I brushed that off. 

Then we were on a mini vacation and while I was brushing my teeth, he Comes to tell me that he hit this girl up, and asked her to make a logo for my brothers business.... this was the first of me hearing of this...... this also means that he was messaging her while we were together, even more freaking weird imo.

Then this AM he says look at this picture (we will call her sally) sally sent me, it was a pic of their boss on his birthday. Really random I thought. 

He also looks at her snaps a lot.

Alsoooo we had paint night and she forgot a tube of paint there, and it’s gone, but idk when he returned it back to her. I asked him if he gave her, her paint back today and he said he didn’t know or couldn’t remember....

One of the couples are in their 50s, married for some 20 years. The gathering took place on a terrace of a restaurant. The husband of said couple came to sit at my table for a while. We were conversing, and suddenly his face lit up. I turned around to see what he was looking at, and saw his wife several tables away holding a glass full of wine and smiling. Turns out that he, even though he had gotten up from their table to go mingle with other people, had constantly kept an eye over the room on his wife's glass, and had ordered the waiter to bring her a new one as soon as her glass was empty. She gave him a smile, he smiled back at her, and then said, ""This thing never gets old. Ordering your wife a glass of wine - such a small thing that always makes me happy."" I loved how he nailed the HVM mindset - the mere fact of taking care of your wife and doing little considerate things that makes her feel appreciated is a source of happiness if you are a HVM.

I matched with this guy out of a magazine, instead of a real convo he used a sleazy pick up line which I am ashamed to have entertained but as the conversation went on, he said he wanted a fwb while I had already said that I wanted to date primarily. He continued being cheesy , and I said “I’m only willing to date, if that’s something you’re interested in then we can continue but if not then I hope you find what you’re looking for.”

Throughout college, I didn’t love myself or see my worth at all and this was reflected in my “dating strategy.” My goal was to date as far down as far as possible while making sure I was working to my maximum potential to enhance myself. Basically, I was dating guys with no life goals who were absolutely comfortable being at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder while I was working to finish my degree and keep myself as physically fit and attractive as I could. I thought if I did this, I would land a guy who adored and appreciated me because he scored a girl out of his league. Looking back I was the ultimate “pick me.” Long story short, each one of these guys treated me like pure garbage. They treated me in ways you wouldn’t even imagine and I didn’t think I deserved better. I’m telling you this to say don’t ever fucking do this. Even if you don’t think you’re attractive or worthy, don’t EVER fucking date down. It will do you no favors. You may as well stay single and work on yourself until you realize what you truly deserve. This isn’t some bullshit toxic positivity I’m feeding you but real life 100% factual advice. If you date up and the guy turns out to be an asshole, you can say you got something out of it, whether it be nice dates, fun trips or strategic social connections. If you date down and you end up getting heartbroken and nothing else. 

I’m sure some version of this has already been said on this subreddit but it can’t be stressed enough, especially to the younger ladies. So I’m saying it again.

Thank you so much to all the kind women who’ve commented. It was really something I needed to hear. Originally, I wanted to meet up with him tomorrow to explain to him in person but after a long conversation with my mom (aka my free therapist) I decided to just text him saying that he disrespected my boundaries. He just replied with a sorry thanks for letting me know 🤦‍♀️ obviously a LVM. Anyway I really appreciate all the help and support and I’m so glad I found this sub. Take care everyone! 

Throw away account for obvious reasons. This is going to be pretty long so please bear with me, I really need sound advice.  
So last week Wednesday I matched with this guy on Bumble. He was cute and seemed interesting so I suggested like a walk in the park. We saw each other the next day and spent more or less 10 hours together just walking and talking. We ended up in his apartment and it’s not because there were any implications of ya know messing around but because it was a very hot day and I was feeling pretty dehydrated and his flat was just near the park we were at. Anyway, we went back out and talked some more then we went back to his apartment. At this point, he’s only held my hand and kissed me me playfully with a mask on in the elevator going up to his room. Things happened, we kinda fooled around (third base) and he invited me to sleep over. An important note here, I told him that I’m a practicing Christian and would not have penetrative sex with him and he respected that and said it’s okay. Another note, I’ve never had a serious relationship before so sleeping over at a guy’s place was something big for me. At 3 am, I went to go pee but ended up getting spooked so I actually left without leaving a note or anything cause I was planning to just text him in the morning. He ends up waking up and texting me what happened. I send him a text explaining what I felt and that I really am so incredibly sorry for doing what I just did. I asked him if I could explain to him personally the next day so I dropped by at his apartment Saturday.   
Saturday comes around I say sorry and he was like no worries. He was just worried when he woke up in the middle of the night and I wasn’t there. I guess I got spooked cause again I’ve never slept over at a guy’s place before and I felt like I messed up big time since we already fooled around on the first date and I felt like he would have never taken me seriously anymore. I told him we should take it slow but somehow we ended up fooling around again and even going farther than what we were doing before. When we were in bed I asked if we were seeing/dating each other and he said we’ll continue to hang out and see. He walks me to the elevators and even before I got in, he leaves already. He does however tell me to text him when I get home.   Sunday comes and I text him a pretty long message that we can’t fool around anymore and I don’t want just to hook up or like a casual relationship. So if that’s more his drift, this won’t work out. He said nope I want to keep hanging out with you and that he enjoys me. Anyway we text throughout the week and he actually asks me why my day was shit and even if I don’t reply, he’ll text me later on asking me how my day was.   

Fast forward to Friday, we weren’t really planning on seeing each other but he knew I was feeling pretty under the weather. We met and walked around again and this time he was like do you want some beer to drink in the park and I ended up paying for it!  At one point he said he needed to pee so we go to his apartment, fooled around again (yeah I really hate myself) but I ended up sleeping over and not leaving. Morning comes and he tells me he has a really busy day (which I know is true bc even last week he said that the weekend was a no go for him). I actually even blow him. But while we were in bed I saw that he was still on bumble and it looked like a diff conversation with someone else. I felt gutted. What also made me feel so bad was that he didn’t offer me breakfast and didn’t even bother seeing me off. I’m so sad and mad at myself sorry for the wall of texts I just really needed to get it out. Our original plan was to see each other Monday and before I left, he said he’ll see me Monday and I didn’t reply.  

Now my question is, should I tell him that what he did really hurt my feelings or should I just text him right now and say that this won’t work out.",85028,Should I tell him that he hurt my feelings or should I just tell him now that this isn't going to work out?,0,,,

Relationships are won and lost on communication. The bulk of advice on communication in dating focusses on the frequency of communication. How often he texts/calls/video calls. Whilst that’s all well and good, what’s equally, if not more important than frequency, is the *quality*. 

People think that just because they are in regular contact with their partner that they have good communication, but they’re not always the same thing. Communication is both pro-active and reactive. Ideally, a HVM would be both. Reactive communication can be if you ask them a question and they tell you the answer. Proactive communication involves them telling you *before* you have to ask or chase them up. 

For example, you’ve agreed to a date, but he’s running late/plans have changed. A proactive communicator would inform you of this well ahead of time. A reactive communicator would inform you at the last minute, after the time you were supposed to meet, or even worse, not at all. I’ve dated men who claimed to believe in communication, but they were always reactive. The last guy I dated was so bad that he didn’t even bother to tell me that he didn’t want us to be in a relationship anymore. He only told me after I asked him why the frequency of his communication had dropped so suddenly. When you’re looking for a partner, make sure that he understands what proactive communication is. It’s not telling you after the fact. It’s not him telling you eventually after you’ve picked up that he’s slacking. These are all signs of someone who doesn’t know how to communicate effectively. Reactive communication is also extremely important, but for a man to be an effective communicator, he also needs to know when to take initiative and communicate proactively.",85010,Let’s talk about communication,0,,,

I went from fat and unhappy to a normal BMI and much more self confidence - but there’s no way I could eat the way I used to and continue to maintain my weight. It’s not feasible. And the kicker is, men WANT you tiny - and when you eat like they do, you get heavier and then funnily enough, they don’t want you anymore. Huh. Yet another life advantage - men can eat virtually whatever they want when they’re young and not gain weight - but women have to watch every calorie that goes into their mouth the minute they hit puberty. 

Life is a balance. And if you want your sexy beautiful waifu then you need to understand she can’t stuff Arby’s and Taco Bell in her mouth everyday like y’all do.",84992,Men want women to EAT but also stay ‘tiny.’ How Does that work?,0,,,

A dude then approached me with this really awkward line, saying he liked my dress and asking where I got it so he could buy it for a woman. I thought it might have been a legitimate question, but then he started asking me what I was listening to, asking if the dress would be a good gift, and generally forcing conversation. I eventually told him he was making me uncomfortable and left.

I’ve been cold approached many, many times in my life and it’s never been anything less than this intense degree of awkward. Dudes think they’re being smooth but the lack of self-awareness required to think walking up to a woman who is alone, wearing headphones, at night, on a dark street is a good approach is really something. I don’t want to talk about my Starbucks order or the queso at Chipotle with you. I literally just want to mind my business and go about my day. We all do. Leave us alone.

When did taking a woman out on a date stop being a privilege to them?

In my grandparents' generation, having a woman accept an invitation to go out for an evening with a man was something valued and appreciated. It was a privilege to have the opportunity to spend time with a woman, her beauty, her company, her femininity were things that were precious and sought after. 

Now a lot of men seem to think taking a woman out on a date is a hassle and a chore. And God forbid that the woman actually expect him to pay. When and why did this shift happen? Why is making reservations at a nice restaurant to spend an evening with a beautiful and intelligent woman perceived as an inconvenience rather than an honor? There are certainly HVM out there that still love to treat a woman, but why is this becoming so rare?

(ETA: I'm not idealizing 'the good old days' as I know marriage was a shitshow for women, but men did actually make a God damn effort in the courting phase. Now we don't even have that.)",84698,Why do modern men act like taking a woman out on a date is a 'chore' and not a privilege?,0,,,

I can apply what I've learned to my own situation and I've already started seeking some changes in the way I deal with LVM. 

Are there any other women from the UK who are in their 40s+ who can share their stories of using FDS? Did you change the way you approached dating? How did that work?

Also I haven't read anything about how to get a date in the first place and was going to ask for some advice here.

Then he kept deflecting, I asked why and he just said that he was making a point. 

I’m annoyed and I don’t think that behavior is sustainable, it’s not good for his health and it’s obviously affecting our sex life.

The next time I saw her I told her what had happened, and she was like uhhh.... and showed me a casual vid of them hanging in his room petting his cats or something.

I was like ??? And asked him about it and he STUCK TO HIS STORY lmaoo. He eventually admitted to knowing her and that he must’ve blacked out bc he ‘barely’ remembered her but they def didn’t hook up etc. (Totally dont buy this btw). At this point I was just like super dumbfounded by the audacity.

He is military and would provide benefits. Military, to me, also means a strong work ethic.

He is looking for a serious commitment and a family.

He is a handyman which I find not only helpful but attractive (he enjoys hard manual labor).

He is used to positions of authority and leadership.

No signs of disrespect, misogyny, sexual remarks etc.

Cons:

I am academically ambitious, he is not academic and much prefers to work with his hands. I feel like I would be okay, but would my ambition in academia make him feel insecure?

I told him I am a light drinker, he says it is easy for him to get carried away drinking when he does it, and goes through phases of complete sobriety. This makes me think of impulse control. I’d have to see how often he truly does get drunk, and what he is like in this state- can he handle his liquor?

I feel like I would be willing to give this a shot, since he seems kind and respectful. My concern is that a man like this might feel insecure about my drive, or might impulsively cheat on me, especially while drunk. However it might be stereotypical, because I have ADD and I’ve never had a problem staying faithful.

Too often we're forced into family care roles by accidental children or poverty. I volunteered for planned parenthood for a couple years, and believe there's a real attempt to rid us of body autonomy by taking away reproductive healthcare. I feel low income girls and women are forced into relationships by a desperate need for stability which makes me sad because women need money to level up. It's one of the best ways to protect yourself. Title X funding is very important, but what are some others? In what ways are we limited from income opportunities and how can we navigate those road blocks? Forced family care roles and poverty makes it extremely difficult to rise up financially. When a boy in hs/college gets a girl pregnant, he can continue school. Most pregnant girls cannot. If he does drop out, there are loads of high paying manual labor positions. Women in these fields do not fare well, not because they're physically weak, but because the men are pigs. Some blue collar nvm I know actually talk about their mid-60s female coworker's ass in group messages and say how hot she is and how one or the other is f-ing her. I think I put a stop to it, but it's not my workplace. It was simply something I found out about and was repulsed with. My ex-husband witnessed a young woman storm out of his work place because she was young and attractive and 40+ year old scrotes were openly hitting on her. Men secretly photograph women for any reason, to say she's hot or humiliate her. They don't care and their entitlement makes certain workplaces intolerable. These are jobs that start at $18 with regular raises, but require zero skill. Any bearded dingus can get one of these jobs and he will be in a vacuum where they claim women just can't do what they do. They tell themselves their jobs are for men, but in reality they are so no value, women cannot stand to work with them. Oftentimes, it is dangerous for women to do so. They need to ask themselves how they got so overweight and lazy if their jobs require something women just don't have. The truth is women quit these jobs because they're alone and subjected to a lot of sexual harassment. Women, especially girls and women in poverty, need all the funding and education on where to go. I'm proposing in the comments we leave advice, links to resources, and anecdotes on what helped or is helping you to be more wealthy. Men don't care about pregnancy or disease, and they rarely get themselves treated. Personally, I am regular with doctors and I take birth control (but I hate it and women should not have to take it. I choose to and have been on it for years), and I think protecting myself from stds and pregnancy helped me get through my abusive marriage and to a place where I can make some money and work on myself. I guess I am posting because we talk a lot about how important having our own money is, but it takes more time when the glass ceiling is higher and you begin in poverty or having accidental families. What strategies do you have and do you think reproductive healthcare directly effects a woman's ability to make enough money to exist on her own? I'm also curious to know of any strategies and resources.

&gt;Valentine’s Day is around the corner, and with it, a flurry of marriage proposals will flood your social media timelines. Be ready. Your Facebook cousins ended 2017 in grand style with an argument about rings, which they will surely resurrect. An alleged [Kay Jewelers ad for a $24.99](http://www.kfvs12.com/story/37160774/this-engagement-ring-will-cost-you-less-than-2-movie-tickets) engagement ring had married and single women debating if wanting a more expensive ring made them gold diggers or not.  
&gt;  
&gt;So before they reprise their battle royal, I want to talk about why we all should let women get engaged without telling them to lower their demands—for rings or anything else.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The internet refers to women as a “pick me” when they seem to bend over backward to accommodate potential mates. Women with obsequious opinions on relationships aren’t necessarily jockeying for a man to notice them. Sure, they might be annoying at times, but I keep my complexion clear by remembering there is someone for everyone. I simply am not here for telling other women how low they must go to find love. As bad as a “pick me” can look, it has nothing on a woman boasting about how cheaply she got picked for.  
&gt;  
&gt;I find it tacky when married women tell single women how their love didn’t cost a thing and expect their unmarried counterparts to follow suit. Sis, I admire your struggle love, really, I do. But that doesn’t have to be every woman’s narrative.  
&gt;  
&gt;Their stories try to convey that the quality of the ring doesn’t determine the quality of the relationship. I applaud that. Collectively, however, the overwhelming message turns into: “He picked me for less, and you should ask for less, too.”  
&gt;  
&gt;However, it’s OK if some women want a ring that costs more than a Popeyes chicken bucket. But single women who dare express this truth hear two ugly lies about themselves:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**1. “Women are more concerned about the engagement ring than the marriage.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;How important is a ring, anyway?  
&gt;  
&gt;We aren’t all going to agree on the answer to that question. And you know what? That’s perfectly fine. You can point out that the [popularity of the diamond engagement ring is the result of marketing](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/how-an-ad-campaign-invented-the-diamond-engagement-ring/385376/)—and you would be right. If you start to unravel many traditions behind weddings, they are often rooted in misogyny or money, not romance. It is a saving grace that wedding rituals evolved over time to signify something beautiful. We fall in love with the symbolism and create our own reasons as to why it matters.  
&gt;  
&gt;A ring is merely one symbol in a social rite full of symbols: changing one’s name, walking down the aisle, jumping the broom, breaking the glass. Neither the ceremony nor the traditions surrounding weddings hold much import in the actual marriage.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is why I do not understand the vitriol and “gold digger” labels reserved for women who value the ring as a token of affection. It is asinine to castigate other women for adhering to one expendable nuptial custom when you probably have your own.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most women aren’t more concerned about engagement rings than about their (impending or imagined) marriages. Arguments that women who give thought to their rings are “focusing on the wrong thing” present a false binary. You can ask for the ring you prefer *and* put a lot of care into your marital relationship.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**2. “Women should be so happy to receive a proposal; they should accept anything.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;First of all, I see a proposal as the introduction to a lifetime of partnership and work, not an honorific. Marriage is not a validation that women should be thankful to receive. But I saw one message from a woman scolding others: “Somebody actually wanted you! Sit down! Be humble!”  
&gt;  
&gt;I have a serious problem with people telling black women that they should be grateful anyone proposes to them at all. Black women are often [cast as undesirable in the American imagination](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2017/08/why_rachel_lindsay_s_season_of_the_bachelorette_was_heartbreaking_for_black.html). It works a raw nerve to hear us tell one another that we are unworthy of material or emotional good.  
&gt;  
&gt;Inasmuch as we should all express gratitude for finding love in this world, it’s another thing entirely to consider a proposal as a charity. “Beggars can’t be choosers” doesn’t apply here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, a ring is a gift you’re expected to wear day in and day out. What is so reprehensible about trying to find a ring a woman likes? Can we even apply the rule that “it’s the thought that counts” if the gift reflects thoughtlessness? Any token offered without the recipient in mind is a bribe for a compliment.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Most women are not arguing that a man they truly love should go bankrupt on a ring.* Women want to feel consideration, and they want a ring they don’t hate. If the issue is affordability, and a woman inflexibly demands something her beau can’t afford, that couple has bigger fish to fry than carats.  
&gt;  
&gt;*But were we really arguing over $25 rings ... or something else?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Honestly, I don’t believe a conversation about “ungrateful” women and cheap engagement rings is actually about rings at all. The unspoken contention is that (black) women are not allowed to have a floor, a preference, a bare minimum, a shred of a standard in their own love story. We are expected not to find someone who would willingly be what we desire and require, but to ask for little and be overjoyed at just enough. And apparently, “too much” is a ring over $25.  
&gt;  
&gt;This Valentine’s Day, don’t be that married person lecturing singles about how your beau had nothing to offer but his undying love and twin bed. I know you gladly accepted an engagement ring fished out of a Cracker Jack box. Yes, we know your 20-year marriage is going strong, even though it didn’t start out with the Rock of Gibraltar on your finger. Your examples show us that true love can thrive with less.  
&gt;  
&gt;But love is just as beautiful when it finds us worthy of what we ask for, even if it’s more.",85433,I love everything about this article.,0,,,

After this I plan to peace out of here for a while to work on myself instead of dating. Strap in if you plan to read the whole thing, it’s long. You can skip to the tl;dr for my lessons learned.

In my late 20s/early 30s I was the archetypal ""strong independent woman"". I was chased, I did not chase. I was successful at work (still am). I was confident, I had hobbies and good friends and honestly a pretty great life.

Then I took a new job in a new city, because it paid more and got me closer to my family (what I felt was the only missing piece in my life). My new job had me traveling a LOT (&gt;80%) and I suddenly didn’t have many friends, or much of a social life, and it goes without saying my dating life was shite with all the travel. I dated a coworker, it went poorly, then I resigned myself to singledom and few friends because of my (very well paying!) job.

Then one day, a rare Friday I was actually in town, my roommate set me up on a blind date with a friend of a friend. It had been ages since I got laid so I figured why not. He wasn’t super attractive, fit but short with thinning hair, and didn’t have a great job (personal trainer). But I took him home and it turned out he was GREAT in bed. Months later we met up again when I happened to be in town, and suddenly we started texting a lot more and spending all my weekends at home together. He was fun to be around, was happy to introduce me to his friends and family, and again *great* in bed. He made time for me. At the time this was all I was asking for. Pretty bottom of the barrel standards, eh? The sort of thing ANY guy should be able to do if you’re dating him. We got close super fast and we exchanged “I love yous” only a month or two after we started hanging out seriously.

During this time, mid-2019 as we’re early into dating, I start finding out some serious shit about him as he slowly lets it trickle out. He still lived with his parents – why? Because he OD’d a few years back and was found brain dead in his home by his ex, who stayed with him long enough for him to leave the hospital and more or less get physically back to normal before she peaced out. She left because he was still seriously depressed (the reason he OD’d in the first place) and just had a shitty outlook on life. His depression took over his life to the point where he had to quit his job and move back home. He was still struggling with that depression when I met him in early 2019, but he managed to mask it long enough to hook me in, and he flatly refused to get therapy for it (therapy doesn’t work honey, it’s just bunk!). He still struggled with addiction issues, to the point of stealing my Adderall which I relied on at the time to keep up with my demanding job, then when I threatened to break up he cried and moaned until I took him back and it took me FOREVER to force him to replace the Adderall he’d stolen. He didn’t work on this addiction issue, instead he expected me to buy a lockbox for my meds because he couldn’t control himself. Then he figured out how to sneak into that lockbox, when I caught him again, it was now MY fault that I didn’t secure the meds well enough. He finally got a real job, very low paying due to his poor employment history, but still didn’t move out of his parents house because he was desperately broke and needed to save his money. Yet I watched him spend money on weed (TONS of money on weed), spend money ordering out food (but it’s for you, too, honey!), spend money on over-expensive gym memberships he really didn’t need when there were far more affordable options. Through this I was also spending tons of money – on him. I bought him a brand new iPhone for his birthday. For Christmas I got him the latest Airpods (I myself was still using the last generation ones). I supplied the majority of the weed – he never had to pay for anything, if he felt like it he would buy some on his own to share. I even paid entirely for a post-Christmas beach vacation in Laguna Beach, I booked at room at the Ritz, paid for room service, paid for weed to get delivered to our room; he spent the whole thing sleeping in our hotel room and I think we maybe had sex once or twice. You’d think I would’ve seen the obvious but nope.

During this time, I was still traveling the majority of the week, when I came home we’d spend 100% of our time together. He was a pretty supportive during these times – he would pick me up from the airport, he would cook for me and would help clean up if I cooked, he would help around the house. He would make a point to work with me to plan fun things for us to do together. He bought me flowers a couple times. The sex was frequent (well, frequent enough – once or twice on the weekends, but hey we hardly saw each other). He would pay attention to me. I felt like I mattered in his life. FWIW this one paragraph basically sums up why I stayed with him, in case you are wondering. This really was all I was asking for. I was completely ok with being the main provider, I just wanted to be with someone who made me feel like *I mattered to him.* Pretty low standards, eh? This went on for the entire second half of 2019.

So we’re 6 months in or so and we’re talking marriage. Fast forward a month and he’s telling my parents he’s going to ask me. Fast forward a month or two, it’s early 2020, and he’s proposing, with a small ring (it’s all he can afford) while sitting on a park bench outside my sister’s house, in a proposal that was so poorly planned and executed it was embarrassing to tell others the story. What happened to a romantic surprise on top of a mountain? What happened to a long romantic speech that would sweep me off my feet? It took us less than 5 minutes and was so anti-climactic and such a disappointment compared to my dreams that when we went to bed that night, I snuck out of bed to go to the bathroom for a quiet cry.

Why did I put up with all this, you ask? The dialogue in the back of my head went like this:

-	You’re in your 30s! No one wants a woman that old. Especially since you don’t want kids. Finding someone who wants you will be like finding a needle in a haystack.

-	No one is perfect. You can’t expect perfection, especially at your age. At your age you’ll be getting leftovers and semi-broken people.

-	You’re not perfect yourself. Never mind that you’re working on yourself, you can’t expect perfection from someone else if you can’t deliver it yourself.

-	You work too much to date anyway. It would take way too much work to replace this guy. Be happy you at least found something.

But it doesn’t stop there. I wanted to move to another city, and his work supported him transferring to a city we both wanted to move to. We got there at the end of Feb 2020, then – coronavirus hit. Quarantine came down 2 weeks after we moved there and suddenly we were stuck with each other 24/7.

Up til this point he’d been living with his parents for several years and was quite used to having his every need provided for – he was a true momma’s boy. He hadn’t had to take care of himself or really do chores beyond occasionally doing his own laundry when he REALLY needed to. On top of that his job started to place more pressure on him, and since up til that point he’d had zero success in a professional role in his entire life, he tied his entire sense of self-esteem to success at that job and made success there a top priority in his life – above all else, including me. For reference, I was making 4x as much as him in take home pay. I was the primary provider, and he told me that rankled him. I was paying the majority of rent (~70%), buying most of the groceries, paying all the bills. I bought most of the weed we smoked, though at this point I started to realize he was bleeding me dry and started to designate “my” weed (bought by me) from “his” weed (bought by him). This made him pissy and upset, because we’re engaged and what’s mine should be his too! Yet he had zero interest in budgeting, or trying to cut back, to save MY money. Instead he wanted to become as successful as me, so he could take care of me – he wasn’t really that ok with me being the provider.

But my job slowed down during quarantine – although I was still making the same pay, I had to work ¾ of the day instead of the full day. He just assumed that with this free time, I should be able to also take care of everything around the house too. He rarely did his share of the chores, and wouldn’t bother to clean up after himself. He was working typically 10-12 hours a day, sometimes more, which I completely understand is tough because I’ve been there too – but I never lapsed the way he would. Yet when I would ask him to clean up after himself, at a minimum, it would turn into a fight because he claimed he just couldn’t do it. I was expected to live in his filth, or clean it up if I didn’t like it. He wanted to adopt a puppy, so we did, but again the little guy became entirely my responsibility. Another example – I would often go out to do errands and pick up groceries, on my own (pandemic, I had free time, w/e). I would come home with armfuls of groceries. I would have to explicitly ASK him for help to bring in and put away the groceries. Even when I asked him, he would put away a couple things, then wander off because he “forgot” he was still supposed to be helping me, even though I am clearly still working and the table is still clearly full of groceries. I mean just dumb shit.

The cherry on top is that between the stress of his work, and the stress I was apparently adding to his life because I was “nagging” him to clean up his own shit, we stopped having sex. But hey, it had been months (since about a month before we got engaged actually) since he’d bothered to put effort into sex at all. Foreplay, if it happened, was 30 seconds or less. He was reluctant to use lube too. Sex itself was maybe a minute, 2 tops, of him pumping until he was done. He didn’t touch my clit, in spite of EVERY time we had sex I would make a point to physically grab his hand, put it on my clit, and tell him to touch me, while I was blowing him or touching him to excite him so we could have sex. I even told him, on several occasions, that I needed more foreplay. Guess how often he initiated foreplay even after I told him multiple times I liked it and was being about as bluntly direct as I could be that I *fucking wanted foreplay*? HAHAHA I don’t think I need to tell you.

We (I) kept trying though. We fought almost daily. He stopped touching me. He never cuddled me, rarely hugged or kissed me, and buried himself in his work. He’d spend the first 2 hours of his day in bed on his phone, then go to the office for 8-10 hours (even though his work would have let him stay home during the pandemic - but no he “needed” to get out of the house), then when he came home he wanted to be left alone to “decompress” for another 2 hours while he sat on his phone again (I was expected to walk the pup, prep food, and just wait around for him to be available during this). If I was lucky after all this, he’d spend 30 minutes to an hour eating food and telling me about his work. He never asked about my work. He never asked about my day. I would try to tell him details, but he’d be back on his phone while I talked, and when I would bring updates to stories I’d previously told him, it was clear he didn’t remember what I’d told him in the first place. Yet I was his professional counselor, I gave him so many tips on how to succeed at work (remember he was someone who’d never been professionally successful and I had a stellar and successful career). I was still doing the majority of the chores around the house. I was pouring myself into this relationship and he couldn’t be arsed to talk to me, or do dishes, or fuck, even TOUCH me.

Was I bitter and angry with him? Yes. He made me feel guilty constantly for my frustration. It would go like this – he did a shitty thing. I got upset and frustrated. He got angry with me for being upset. I would apologize. He would haughtily accept my apology…and never recognize my very valid frustration, would never change, would never acknowledge his contribution to the situation. It took me a long time to realize that fucking Mother Theresa would’ve gotten frustrated with his dumb ass. My reaction was completely understandable.

Through all this, I was sinking into depression. I’d lost 20 lbs and I was already skinny before all this started, I was barely able to sleep 5 hours a night, and my body literally started falling apart. After a scary brush with my health, I realized that I was slowly killing myself by staying in the relationship. At this point I had begged him over and over to get therapy for himself. At a minimum I wanted couples counseling. When I’d tell him this, he would shrug and say he didn’t have the time/money for therapy for himself (plus he thought it “wouldn’t work”), but that, ok fine, sure why not, we could do couples therapy. I realized he was expecting me, once again, to do all the work – find the therapist, schedule the appt, pay for it. I realized this was going to be my life, forever. I was forever going to do the work in this relationship. It would be more than a full time job and if I was lucky I might get occasionally tepid sex with no foreplay and maybe a half-attentive listener a few times a week. I realized I could literally pay someone to do this role and it would cost me less than supporting his worthless ass.

I realized if I did not get him out of my life, the stress would literally kill me.

What finally broke me was when we had to re-sign our short-term lease from when we’d first moved. I realized that I was tying myself to another year of potentially living with this guy. I couldn’t take it anymore. I told him it was over. I broke up with him and told him I wouldn’t be signing a new lease, and that he needed to find another place to live within the next month or so (when our lease ended).

It doesn’t end there sadly. Instead I went full simp: At this time thanks to my health issues, I badly needed help with some things around the house that I simply physically could not do. I offered to pay him for this help. I did need the help but I also pitied him – he was going to struggle with money and I knew he needed some kind of help there. He agreed, then when we ended up fighting between the time I paid him and the time he was to do the work, he took my money and didn’t help me. I dunno what to even say here except ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

At this point he is blocked everywhere I can think of. I hope to god I never see him again. My health is getting better. I’m finally eating and sleeping again. I’m searching for a therapist and “auditioning” to find one that can replace the amazing therapist I had in my old city. My pup is my life and has been my strongest supporter, he is awesome and is literally the only positive thing I can say my ex brought to my life. If not for that pup, I would say the last year of my life was not just wasted but actively damaged by this human being.

**Tl;dr:** 

1.	It doesn’t matter how old you are, or what you look like, or how badly you want a relationship. I promise you a bad relationship is worse than no relationship at all. Even non-abusive relationships can result in unintentional harm to yourself. The pain and anxiety of trying to force a relationship that isn’t working, can be truly awful. Do you love yourself? Because you should. And if you love yourself, you wouldn’t put yourself through that. Do you have a sister or brother or friend who you love? If you saw them in your relationship, would you tell them to GTFO?

2.	You have to be crystal clear with yourself on your standards. But expecting your partner to be a generally good person and have their shit together is not a “standard” for a relationship. It’s a hygiene item. It’s something anyone who is dating should be expected to do. It’s not a plus, it’s a base expectation. Always remember to differentiate what are “hygiene” items, and what are items that would help you differentiate between who you want to date and why. Examples of hygiene items – can he clean up after himself? Is he nice to other people? Is he nice to you? These aren’t PLUSES. These are the BASICS. A “plus” is –Is he a good cook? Is he really fit? Does he have a good sense of humor (for you)? Yes these things are my “standards” and I think they should be standards for everyone, but it is NOT a “standard” to expect someone to do their own fucking dishes. That’s a hygiene item. It’s ok if he is working on some of the “pluses”, some people may disagree here but it is not a dealbreaker to me if a guy is between jobs, or has a low-paying job (to me, I’d rather have a passionate artist than a soulless millionaire), or even if he lives with his parents. Is he actively trying to improve himself? Is he capable of asking for and getting help to improve himself? Is continuous self-improvement a priority for him? THOSE are important markers. I’ll never judge someone for getting shat on by luck or a bad economy, but I WILL judge someone who settles for a job that makes them miserable and never really tries to improve their lot in life, or does dumb shit because they won’t take the time to ask for help or advice and actually act on it. Because here’s the thing: their misery, and their shite approach to life, WILL eventually rub off on you or at least start to detrimentally affect your life.

3.	It doesn’t matter how old you are. It doesn’t matter what you look like. Never sacrifice these standards. Before I met him, my standards had been carved in stone because of tears I’d shed in previous shitty relationships in my 20s. Yet as I started to get older, I thought – if you want someone, you have to lower your standards, because *you yourself will need others to lower their standards to love you.* What a self-defeating, self-deprecating, shitty way to look at myself. I love myself. I will never shortchange my standards again.",85420,[WARNING: LONG] [30sF] unburdening myself and sharing so no one makes my stupid mistakes ever again,0,,,

He has a rather successful career, he's secured, we had plenty of open and honest conversation and both of us knew exactly where the other person stands. There was no confusion and he made it clear that he's putting in the time and effort for me. Great, right? But then this fool called me up drunk one night and started venting about this girl he used to date who ghosted him (this was probably at least 7 or 8 months ago), turns out he found out on Facebook and she just got married. He then went farther by saying he'd really like to be petty and talk to her now-husband to send him all the ""stuff"" that she sent him. Something inside me clicked and that whole act instantly repulsed me, so I stopped him and told him why that's unnecessary and damaging to her BRAND SPANKING NEW MARRIAGE. Why he shouldn't care because she clearly stopped months ago. He couldn't understand where I was coming from, so I let it go because I wasn't going to have an argument with a drunk person. The next day, I brought it up hoping we could discuss it as honestly and openly as we've discussed other things in the past. He freaked out and accused me of insulting him by throwing his venting to his face when I merely asked him if he had some unresolved issues with his ex that needed to be addressed. He went out of his way to make me feel like I was the insecure, crazy one for thinking he's not over her when he CLEARLY wasn't. 

I've been in enough toxic relationships in the past to know that behaviors like that only get worse, so I cut him loose. Maybe it was just one simple drunken venting, but his willingness to ruin a marriage so his past hurt can be justified was something I never expected from him and it shook me.",85420,"No, I am NOT the crazy one.",0,,,

I've been reading various threads about the spark and whether it's important or not and I'm struggling to figure out whether I should proceed with one guy I've been seeing. We matched on an app during COVID and had 3 video chats which were all fun and interesting. He ticks most of my boxes - religion, background, height, general ""type,"" and seems very into me. When we finally met in person we also had a pleasant conversation and I had a reasonably good time, but was on the fence on physical attraction. I was kind of indifferent. We did get along well, but I have the gift of gab and can talk to pretty much anyone.

Second date a couple weeks later, literally same situation - pleasant conversation, but almost no physical attraction from my end. He took me out to dinner and when I first saw him outside the restaurant, I didn't think he was particularly attractive. I thought he had a cute face but meh body. Idk if it's worth it to keep seeing him and maybe he'll make me more attracted to him with his actions somehow, or if I should just let him go.

For me the biggest thing is I have zero excitement to see him again. In fact I'm sort of dreading it because I know he'll attempt to kiss me and I have zero desire to do that. I haven't kissed anyone since pre-COVID and I don't want my ""first"" to be him lol. I don't have much experience turning people down after a couple dates, usually it's an immediate yes/no from me on the first date, and I've been the dumpee in my past couple relationships so this feels weird to me.

I think this is where vetting comes in again.

The whole idea of waiting 3 months to have sex with someone is so he can prove himself to you. Part of that is showing what he has to offer sexually. We are definitely not telling anyone to go 0 to 60 with their sex life. You can vet for sexual performance and compatibility during that time. You can vet how he kisses, caresses, snuggles, holds you, rhythm and the quality, durability and consistency of his erections to a degree (kissing and grinding on each other), stamina (sports like swimming running soccer are great for sexual stamina), generosity and how he is with his hands with neck rubs/foot rubs. He should absolutely be enthusiastic to prove himself to you as a good mate. Through all of these things you can give preferences and bits of feedback and see how he handles that to vet for how considerate he is of what you want physically. 

Later, before sex but after commitment is established, you can try oral. You can see how good he is with his mouth, if he can make you orgasm, what he can do with his hands and how considerate he is. If you go down on him you can vet for any creepy porn behavior like shoving your head down or making gross comments. You can also see the quality and duration of his erections. If he continuously goes soft that's a very bad sign. Ditto for premature ejaculation. I would absolutely make a man make you orgasm before you ever have sex with him. Either from oral or manual. He needs to show he can get you off for you to be willing to have sex with him. This way to you can judge his sexual generosity and also his enthusiasm for making his partner orgasm. Absolutely do not settle for a man who isn't super enthusiastic and turned on! He should I have an erection from going down on you. Also test him by having him finish you but don't give him anything. See how he handles it to vet for pushy rapist behavior. You could also start and stop physical sexual activities and see if he gets angry, cries, pushes, or tries to manipulate you.

This will all help you find someone who is good in bed, cares about giving you pleasure and won't pressure you. Vet hard for any porn behavior. A porn adict will not make it through all of this without repeatedly revealing himself to be a low value creep.

Edited to add


A follower in the notes asked how you can avoid going too far once you start and how to tell the guy your boundaries:

You have to be strong and probably have some sort of a deadline that you'll stick to like a restaurant reservation or a time he needs to leave by. I would also do some of my making out and touching in the car at night when he would bring me home from a date. You really shouldn't have to even make any boundaries clear. A man who's actually interested in you isn't going to try to move every touch to sex. If he does, that's a red flag. If he tries to move things further than you're willing to go just tell him this is as far as you're willing to go with the level that you know him and you're still getting comfortable with him. Trust is earned. Tell him you want to move slowly with intimacy so that you are fully comfortable and because you're still getting to know him and trust him.

Say you're making out a little and he starts trying to take your top off. Just use your hand and put it on his hand and stop him and say no. This should be all you need to do. This is another vetting opportunity as well. If he tries again 2 minutes later then he's a pushy creep who isn't listening to you! He has failed.


Here's my response to another commenter about how are not given any sort of conceptual framing for progressing through physical intimacy and up to sex in stages:

I really didn't understand this when I was younger either. Society very much pushes this have sex immediately narrative on women. We're not given any tools to judge a man sexually, even when it comes to our own safety. No information on how to figure out if a guy is a rapey creep. Nothing. There's no longer any narrative about making out, necking, petting or working up to things for months. Or at all.  No ""going steady"" which implies a greater level of physical intimacy based on commitment, trust, time and investment.",85415,How to vet for sexual compatibility,0,,,

He was exactly what I was looking for at the time because I was looking for someone who could give me “answers”. He helped me with my state and gave me a whole new perspective that contributed to a huge change in me including that of religious and political beliefs (which I still have). He was condescending at times but I had zero self worth at the time and thought I deserved it. So you can guess what happened when I went from being extremely lonely to having “deep” conversations with a guy everyday. I got attached to him and idolized him (I had never even seen his face). I would think to myself this is the guy I want to marry (oh, naive me). 

We were friends for two years but would gradually only talk twice a month due to “security” reasons since he’s in a strict shite country. (We’re both middle eastern just for context and we have the same ethnicity but our families are of different, very opposing, religious sects). After a while I noticed he was being flirty with me and thought he was trying to indirectly tell me that he likes me. He started paying a lot of attention to me so we called and talked and played everyday. I was waiting for him to directly tell me that he likes me but he didn’t so I did 🤡. so we just went on from there without even dating and got into a relationship that had me hating it and confused for so long and one significant reason being that he was not the same person when we were just friends. He was very depressed at the time so I blamed our messy relationship on that and thought that I should “help” him until he gets better. But it was just him showing his true colors. He was holding up the LVM flag and I was completely blind to it. 

So in the course of our relationship we had a lot of ups and downs and I broke up with him a few times for petty things he said/did. He always talked me back into it. I decided to stay with him if he changed for me. And he did get better. But I was still uncomfortable and always felt like something was wrong. That’s when I came across this subreddit. Upon reading the handbook I realized how many things were wrong and how both of us were LVs. I had made up my mind on everything but one thing that was bothering me was that he is not a bad guy and has improved a lot since the beginning but I had to cut the relationship off regardless, because of how drained I was feeling. even though he was supportive too but he would still disappoint me sometimes and I lost attraction gradually.                                                 
And btw, we’ve never met in person. Ever. Which is another huge mistake we made. 

Besides all of this, we have our families in the way. My parents would never accept me marrying him. So even if we were a flawless couple, we would still have a huge problem ahead of us. And I don’t think he’s worth going through all that trouble for. 

The feeling to end things became very strong in me and now here I am single and clear headed after 1.5 years of on and off confusion. 

And that’s all thanks to this subreddit. I’m very grateful for you queens’ hard work and care. It didn’t help me solely relationship wise, but also personality and lifestyle wise. I never realized how many of my problems were due to low self worth. I’m definitely not an exact HVW right now but there’s been a significant shift and it’s ongoing.

Cultural thing) And yes I followed FDS rules to a T.

Since discovering FDS around a few months ago, my dating life has changed drastically. I'm now in a relationship with a man who seems HV so far, even though it's still  too early to tell definitely. Still, I've made a few experiences with men I would *never* have *considered* dating pre-FDS, namely, men who were more conservative than anything I'd dated before.

*When I'm talking about men who are conservative or religious, I do not mean alt-right anti-feminist All-Lives-Matter guys.* I live in a European country in which we don't have as much of a problem with rising facism as people do in the US. I'm mostly talking about practising Catholics  who hold some more socially conservative opinions. They might not be down with Third Wave Feminism (sex work, gender issues) but certainly believe in women's general equality to men.  The ones I dated also usually came from very well-to-do families with strong female role models.

Before FDS, I usually dated men whose political opinions were very similar to my own on the surface: The  sort of bougie liberal who buy hummus en masse and have a thing for quinoa. You know the type.

The reason I felt increasingly bothered by these men is that I found that whilst they often *preached* the lingo of feminism very well, they had *terrible* behavioural patterns.  They were overly sensitive, required tons of emotional labour, were insecure in their masculinity, and *did not meaningfully support me on my own journey in return*.

I eventually discovered FDS, broke up with one of those Hummus-Eaters, and shortly after dated someone very different. Met him via university, and was really surprised by the whole experience. He was notably more conservative than any man I'd ever dated before, and also more religious than even me. Not gonna lie, it caused some discussions. But what really struck me were two things: He allowed those discussions. They didn't turn into witch hunts. He even changed his mind on a few issues. And:

*He actually felt like he had a role to fill in our relationship*.

The Hummus-Eaters had basically deconstructed their own masculinity to the point that they offered *no* tangible 'benefit' to me. They didn't believe in men providing, so they weren't providers. They didn't believe in men being strong bedrocks, so they dumped their emotional issues on me. They didn't believe in men having to be physically able, so they didn't exercise or engage in typically male hobbies like sports. They rejected traditional masculinity, but they had *nothing* to replace it with, so they ended up being leeches who couldn't *give* me anything.

This guy had a *role*. He wasn't some sort of alpha-male-gotta-provide-gotta-have-muscles-hurr-durr-guy, but he still saw certain things as his 'job' in a relationship that the Hummus-Eaters would have rejected based on some notion of sexism: He felt it was his job to woo me, gift me flowers,  try to fix my car, be the yang to my yin.

I later dated another guy with similar views. That guy is now my boyfriend. We've been commited for six months and so far, I'm *really* into this relationship.

It's that same notion of him having a 'role'. He doesn't require constant reassurance and support. He has his life in order, he's active, focused on his academic and career development, none of that self-flagellating analysis of 'privilege' the Hummus-Eaters were prone to. He has a sense of masculinity independent of me that fuels him to achieve.

English is not my first language, so i am sorry for my possible mistakes :)

Since the covid lost most of its effect and places got reopened in my state, i had been to 3 dates with this guy with whom i had 1 zoom date during the quarantine. He is 3 years older than me, doing his phd in a popular field, he has nice face, great body and good manners (so far). we met through OKC and both of us had ""looking for a long term relationship"" in profiles.

He paid for all of our dates, he took me with his car and dropped me at wherever I wanted, and his choice of restaurants was good. he mentioned he's also really into cooking but hasn't invited me over his place directly. he seems attracted to me and i am starting to feel attraction towards him as well.

Now the first issue is about a conversation we had in our last date. here is what i remember:

\*talking about relationships and first dates\*

me: i hope you don't expect me to have sex with you bc you are paying for dates.

at this point his smile went away, he stopped for a second, thought a bit and then:

he: hmm... i am expecting you to have sex with me at some point, not bc that i am paying for dates, but bc you actually wanna have sex with me. don't know when that day comes, but i'm looking forward to it. absolutely no pressure. sex is much better when both parties are comfortable.

i couldn't really say anything bc i was waiting him to say something stupid but now i cannot process what he actually said. i mean.. is this him pressuring me under the cover of being nice and smart? i have been manipulated before so much i need your input here :(

another issue is that he is using both tinder and OKC. (I saw a tinder notification while he was showing me something, he acted pretty normal when this happened.) I asked why he is using both of the apps. He said he is using Tinder just for casual encounters (we have never discussed being exclusive so far), and OKC for relationships. According to him this way will make sure the intentions are clear. He said something like this: ""since we met through OKC, I am dating you with the hopes that this turns into something serious. But I don't feel like it's time for us to be exclusive. I stopped multidating right after our second date, but I have some casual encounters now and then. I just assume you do the same."" He also reassured me that he gets tested regularly and can show proof etc. Now what I think is this:

I agree that we are not ready to be exclusive

I still multidate and still see my fwb

I am feeling a bit insecure that he is getting around. i enjoy he is confident and hot enough for this, but it makes me think if he is not trustworthy.

I didn't catch any lies or sketchy behavior, his academic story checks out with google. but since the past bad experiences of myself i am confusing myself, i dont wanna be deceived and need your input here again.

thank you so much.",85381,some concerning issues with a possible HVM,0,,,

Currently reading this and I will recommend it to anyone.  Women need to realize these things and keep themselves safe. An example that is brought up is the subject of pets, how women will say ""my pet never liked him"", but it actually often is the case of your pet picking up on the vibes you are giving of about a person and reacting to it and how we do not trust our own premonitions and we rationalize about dangerous situations. Trust your intuition and read books such as this to learn how to be safe. It can literally help save the life of yourself and your loved ones.

It describes a phenomenon where a man promises things in the future (often unprompted) to get what he wants in the present. He can promise things like marriage, children, moving in together or getting a better career. 

It’s easy to assume that a man wouldn’t talk about the future if he was no intention of sticking around to deliver his promises, but the reality is often very different. Future faking is a common tactic used by men who mean you no good, because it means you get invested in them and the relationship faster. That’s the pay-off for men who future fake. They’re able to reap the benefits (sex, attention, love, devotion, etc), without having to show that he’s serious.

So, how can we avoid being future faked? 

1. Observe a man’s actions over what he says. A useful formula to determine whether you are being future faked is this:

Promises - reasonable actions to fulfil that promise = future faking. 

Pay attention to when he promises something small, such as promising to call you at a certain time, but fails to deliver. 

2. Be especially wary of men who talk about huge milestones, such as marriage and kids, too soon. I know this sub promotes the idea that men know who they want to marry straight away. But a high value man will still do his due diligence before telling a woman that he wants to settle down with her. Men who start talking about marriage and kids early on have form - *they’ve done it to other women before*. Understand that there’s no way a man can know if you’re marriage material until he’s gotten to know you over a period of time. It seems flattering when a guy recognised that you’re fabulous and wants to cuff you within the first week, but it’s really anything but. There’s a high chance that he’s a future faker. 


3. If someone seems too good to true, they probably are. Make sure you slow the pace of a relationship down. If a relationship is meant to last a long time, there’s no need to rush.",85378,Let’s talk about future faking,0,,,

I asked the universe to have him leave me first bc I felt too weak to leave him (attachment issues, it's bad). I got what I wanted. Except my stomach feels sick and my head feels hot.

We talked about breaking up and he just like stopped smoking weed and cleaned and talked about therapy. Then tonight he's like I was still planning on moving out you know.

A man has surprised me by being consistently thoughtful and generous and kind. 

Backstory: this guy and I started seeing each other right before the pandemic hit. I had been FDS'ing for about a month at this time and followed the handbook to a T from the get-go with him. He impressed me originally by doing the normal things; always paying for dates (pre-lockdown), opening all doors, pulling out chairs, not being sexually aggressive, remembering things I told him, texting me daily...the lot of it. 

I was still suspicious (because, men), but I knew this man had a lot more potential than the usual scrote. For the last four months he's been bringing me groceries, energy drinks, offering to run errands so I don't go out in the pandemic dystopia unless I absolutely have to, etc. 

Three weeks ago, he bought me a kitten. I'd had my eye on a more expensive breed. He found her, sent me pictures asking if I was interested in her, and contacted the breeder. When the day came to get her, he came to pick me up so we could go together. When I got in the car, he opened his center console to ""show me something"" and out popped the sweetest, cutest freaking kitten you've ever seen:  [https://imgur.com/a/8ytHKvy](https://imgur.com/a/8ytHKvy) 

Then. TODAY. Oh my god, you guys.

I have a mild obsession with RGB. I have a Razer RGB keyboard, mouse, mousepad, a Razer laptop with RGB keys, all Hue chroma lights around my house, and my favorite: 9 Nanoleaf panels above my desk. (If you don't know what Nanoleaf panels are, give it a google, be entranced, and get some.) I've told this man how, in an ideal world, my entire house would just be plastered in Nanoleaf panels.

Today, I got home, and saw a panel in my window. ""That's weird,"" I thought. ""One of my panels must have fallen off the wall. Don't know why he'd put it in the window though...weirdo.""

Then there was another panel on my keyboard, with a sticky note with my name on it, and a ""30"" in the corner. And a random letter in another corner. What the f was going on?? I counted the panels on the wall. Still 9. I honestly had to count a couple times, thought I was going crazy.

Then I found the ""4"" panel, with ""The"" written on it, next to my phone charger. Oh shit, I had been given a scavenger hunt of Nanoleaf panels.

Eventually I found all 30 of them. Yes, 30. In the microwave, in the shower caddy, under a pair of heels, in the silverware drawer, under my pillow. The sticky notes, when placed in order, had a really sweet message. The random letters in the corners, spelled out a message to check my air vent. In the air vent were the power cords and connectors for the lights, AS WELL AS A DRESS. I had shown him this dress online for like, two minutes, two months ago. He bought it and kept it until today, when he stashed it in my air vent. After freaking out and thanking him over text, he let me know that, no, he didn't get me 30 panels. He got me 60. He just couldn't find 30 more hiding places. 

My apartment is about to be RGB Rave Central.

I'm still in shock, honestly. Who does this even happen to?? Why aren't they all like this???

A few other observations I’ve recently noticed:  

* Take a look at the posts sorted by new.  Almost every one of them has been downvoted to zero.  I assume it’s by jealous or angry scrotes.  

* Sure, the best or top posts might have some okay advice, but when you sort by new, you really see the woman haters come out.  I was recently searching for a specific topic and came across a post that didn’t get popular, only had ten or so comments and the top comment was “obviously only feEEeEMales and feminists have commented here so far, so let me provide my perspective as a man” and went on to mansplain how the op (a woman) was jealous, controlling, and manipulative etc etc.

I've learned the hard way, over and over, that men simply don't fear female anger the same way we fear male anger.

Men like to joke about ""crazy women"" and it's considered funny because they know that an angry woman is ultimately harmless. Whereas a ""crazy man"" having a fit of rage might kill all of his children, then his wife, and then himself.

Male anger is fucking scary and potentially life threatening. 

In contrast, men are largely indifferent to female anger. It's why you hear stories like ""my wife left me because I didn't do the dishes! I was totally blindsided!"" Chances are, she had been asking him to contribute to the household chores for months or even *years* and he didn't notice or care. Her anger literally just did not register in his mind.

Worse still, some men think that female anger is amusing, and will deliberately push your buttons just to get a rise out of you and will then laugh in your face. This is why men love trolling feminist spaces, it's merely entertainment to them.

This is why at FDS we say ""block and delete"". Sending him lengthy messages describing in excruciating detail why he's an asshole and how he hurt you will achieve nothing. Even short witty insults have the same effect.

He either doesn't care at all, or he actively enjoys it. Don't give him pleasure of knowing that he provoked a reaction out of you. It makes him feel powerful and in control. Deny him the satisfaction and don't respond. Just block and delete. 

I know, I know. You're hurt, you're angry, and you want to teach him a lesson or hurt him just like he hurt you. I get it.

What I'm ***not*** saying is ""don't ever feel anger"". It's normal to feel angry when someone treats you unfairly. Those feelings are completely justified. All I'm saying is don't *show* or *communicate* that you are angry because if you do, he wins and you lose.

If you *absolutely must* have some form of revenge, remember this quote:

*Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them.*

If you really want to hit a man where it hurts, laugh at him. I do it all the time with male family members and male coworkers and it works like a charm. Humor just totally disarms men and puts them in their place. This works especially well in a group context where other people can pile on and laugh at him too.

A good example of this is the scene in Pride &amp; Prejudice when Darcy insults Lizzie, and instead of getting angry and confronting him, she walks over to her friend and repeats what he just said and they both have a good laugh at his expense.

Of course, only do this if you are completely safe from retaliation. Men will sometimes respond to ego injuries like a wounded animal, they just lash out with pure unhinged rage.

TL;DR: Don't show a man that you are angry. The best response is no response at all. If you absolutely *must* respond, simply laugh at him. No wordy messages, just laughter. Female ridicule is a man's worst nightmare.",85684,"Never let a LVM know that you are angry with him. Men simply don't fear female anger in the same way that women fear male anger.

Now, I want you to read these carefully and start building yourself up, because you're no cheap product. I repeat, the universe resides within you, and you have to realise it now. We have made the mistake of letting someone in and letting them walk all around our place soiling it, but it's high time we forgive ourselves, and let no man or woman simply enter our life and leave us completely drained of your self esteem. 

Number 6: Stop looking back.
You know how you take the day's garbage and put it in the garbage bag and throw it out in the trash? That's exactly what's happening here. Once they leave you trampled, or you see their red flags and decide to leave them, they're getting dumped in that garbage bag and thrown in the trash on their own. The only reason it feels like that's not the case is because you're going back and opening the trash again and getting a whiff of it. Smells fucking rank, and that's why it hurts. I have to quote one of my favourite quotes from Alan Watts here, ""Muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone"", and I cannot stress enough on this. All this looking back is going to snap your neck in half, and your head looks the best when it's respectfully standing on your shoulders. You are now strong and alone, and you are free to do SO much that's going to make you a beautiful, bold person that you were always meant to be. Don't let a worthless jerk make you feel otherwise, you only look forward now. This isn't an option btw, it's a necessity. Look forward, and ONLY forward. No going back. 
This also applies to the ones who get their exes texting after a year or so, asking to get back together. That's literally garbage walking into your house again, are you really going to keep that rotten shit in your house? Hell no, throw it out, where it's meant to be. In the trash. 

Number 7: Do not compare yourself to anyone. 
I know it's easier said than done, but you have to believe me when I say this, you are no less than anybody. You are a product of the universe, period. If that guy cheated on you and you find yourself comparing to the one he cheated with, shrug that thought away, and look out for yourself, look forward. This acts like a fuel to the fire, your fire. Work on yourself to become the best version of you, because if you don't, it means that in your head you're still trying to impress that person in your fantasy that you once thought loved you. Which means that you're going back to the trashcan that you're supposed to leave alone, and you don't need that. The moment you get such thoughts, keep telling yourself that you are only supposed to look forward, and that's not an option. You have to do it. Nothing can take away what's yours, nothing can take away the beauty you have. It doesn't feel like that right now, but once you start working on your inner beauty and your inner respect, the outer glow is bound to come back. Nobody can steal that light. 

Number 8: Recognise the symbol.
Often times we still linger onto our exes in our fantasy because of the way they treated us good in the beginning, and at that time we felt like that was exactly what we needed, more like ""deserved"". In my case, I come from an abusive family and I was in desperate need of caring and love, and that's exactly what he gave to me, so he became a symbol of ""care and love"" to me. When he left, that symbol of care and love was gone, and I could feel a hole in my heart in that exact spot. If I had that spot already filled by knowing my self worth, I wouldn't have felt so hollow and trampled. In fact I would've never attracted a person like him in the first place who would pick my weakest point and manipulate me there. So right now, I'm asking you to think about that one thing that your ex filled you with, be it financial support, love, care, attention, security, whatever it is that he gave you that made you love him so much (at the same time I don't want you to spiral back into a negative thought process, ie think only about what he gave you), and understand that symbol. Whatever it is that he gave you and took away. You are now alone and golden, and this is the best time to fill yourself with what he took away from you. Remember that our goal is to attract healthy people. Damage attracts damage, and we want healthy attracting healthy. That only happens when you heal yourself in areas that you subconsciously didn't think needed any healing. This also goes to self parenting, since a lot of our parents didn't set a right example for us and we ended up attracting the wrong kind of people. I will make another big post about parenting and how it correlates to dating soon. 

Number 9: Set your standards. 
Remember that you're not high maintenance, or ""too much"" or expensive, as I said in my last post. They cannot afford you. Which means that you are the gift that a man gets. Not the other way around. I'm not saying that we should be mean either. The correct way is to be down to earth, and at the same time know this mind game like the back of your hand. If you set your standards high enough, the ones who cannot afford you will automatically get repelled. They'll remain as window shoppers. People will get jealous of you for having those standards set, because deep inside they can't afford to do that for themselves, since they're caught in a negative cycle. People will act mean or rude to you to get a shock value out of you, or a reaction. Don't give into any of it. Men know exactly what we're insecure about, men know that we are attracted to the loving and caring kind, men know us very well because they've dealt with women who didn't know themselves fully and gave into their bullshit. You have to be different. You know that they know, but what they know is derived from women who didn't know their self worth. For you to know your self worth, you've to set standards for yourself, high enough that no low value man can invade your space and litter it. 

Number 10: Dance. 
So random, right? But one of the best things out there. I don't mean dancing with rehearsed steps, no. What I mean is dancing out of your mind, dancing to music that gets your adrenaline rushing and exploding, dancing brainlessly. This is that one thing that's going to completely get your mind off of the situationship past, and put you in the present. At the same time it's going to induce love hormones in your brain, and slowly open up your mind to accepting your energy. Dancing will help you become more vibrant with your energy, it will automatically make you feel a little high, make you sweat, make you smile even for a temporary while. I recommend you do it at least once in a day. Especially if you're on the last stages of almost moving on, then it's going to be a life saver. 

Lastly, I want to affirm you that all of this is going to amount to something much better, something you cannot even imagine right now, but I promise you it's going to be 100% better and worth it. I'm gonna repeat here what I said in my former post, the guy that did this to you, it's on him. The pain and agony that you've suffered, it is equivalent to getting your muscles ripped after a heavy workout, but that workout goes to waste if we don't feed our body with the right nutrients. So you've to feed your mind and soul with with healthy stuff, not junk food (ie rebound and temporary situationships). You've to feed your mind and soul with self acceptance, and constantly be in the process of building yourself up. Do not look back, no matter what happens, and do not go back to the losers that let you down. You have come so far and it cannot be all for nothing. You are here to be the best version of yourself, and I'm glad I could have this talk with you. I will be posting more in the future, and whatever I learn about relationships, I will share it with you so that we can build together. Be strong for me, and most importantly, for yourself.

As you can see from the title I’m talking to a guy I met online a week ago. He already told me he loves me. He lives in another country so it’s not like it would really ever work out. 

This is my first “relationship”. I’ve never dated before. I don’t know anything about dating. And I’m a very non-confrontational person. I’m bad at being assertive. I’m naturally submissive and soft hearted. I feel so guilty breaking up with him because he’s so attached. 

I want to end things with him. He’s taking it too fast. He’s already talked about marriage and kids. 

And the worst part is that I started saying “I love you” back without meaning it because I hated how I was always making things awkward by staying silent so I started saying it back. But I don’t mean it. 
And now I feel stuck. I feel responsible for his feelings especially after telling him I love him. 

I tried to end things (sort of- expresses my doubts to him about all of this) and he told me how much he cares about me and can’t live without me. I felt cared for and wanted and it made me emotional because everything he says is what I want from a person. He even cried. I don’t know what to make of this.

But I know that this isn’t love. Idk why he’s so attached to me already. He has family issues so he gets attached quick from what I can tell. 

I want to end things properly with him. Let him know this is too much and just end it. But it’s so much harder doing it on the phone (which is how we usually communicate) then it is on text. 
I just need help.",85674,I’m (20F) talking to a guy (18M) online who is moving too fast- already said I love you after a week. How to end things,0,,,

I had a great experience today, which I think illustrates this:

I have always been a good dresser, I have good taste and standards for my appearance even in everyday scenarios. Since the end of lockdown where I live I have been making an extra effort to always look my best, wearing make up more consistently. I live in a small town and often (sometimes daily) pop into the small supermarket for groceries. Since COVID a man has been stationed at the door to count customers in and out, I have come to recognise most of them and usually exchange a hello. 

Today, to my great enjoyment, the man who was on duty stopped me on my way out: he said “Excuse me, but I just wanted to say that you always look so elegant” and I thanked him with a laugh and went on my way. The reason it stuck with me was the way that he delivered this compliment. It was done in the most respectful way, felt genuine, wasn’t creepy at all and didn’t make me uncomfortable.  (It was a lovely feeling to have someone appreciated my beauty and elegance without the sinister thirst of a LVM)

Since diving deep into the psychology of LVM, narcissists and abusers during lockdown it has become so clear to me that not every man is capable of doing that, it takes a serious amount of self assurance to see an elegant sophisticated HVW and not feel threatened or insecure to respond in a dismissive, or passive aggressive way. To express in a non creepy way a respectful compliment I think takes real maturity and quality, and while this man is obviously not rich or high status, this is HVM behaviour in my eyes. 

Do you agree? Has anyone else had a refreshing experience recently?",85671,"What differentiates HVM behaviour is an attitude, regardless of status and wealth",0,,,

Once they found out about what I was doing I was inundated with questions like “how often are you running?” “What are you eating” “how long can you run for” “what other exercise are you doing?”. I will politely answer their questions in naively thinking they are interested in being supportive.

&gt; There are some white Slavic women with good values and family oriented. Some of my friends got wives from Ukraine. These women also care of themselves unlike Western liberal women.

He has put down my appearance and blows hot and cold. At first I knew I had to dump him but I stupidly gave him a chance, then another chance. Being around him drains me. He’s lovely and attentive, but then suddenly he becomes cold and mean. He speaks to me terribly and then tells me I’m too sensitive or can’t take a joke. He told me I’m much hotter to him when he’s drunk. It’s starting to feel like gaslighting. I said this to him and he was upset and said he’d change. He hasn’t. Today I actually started crying in his company because I’ve never felt so lonely with another person. I just told him I was having a bad week.

My appetite is gone now and my confidence is shrinking. 

I don’t know why I don’t have the strength to let go. I keep thinking about his good points and I think I’m just afraid to be alone. There’s also something about being around someone who lowers your confidence in this way, somehow it makes you more reliant on them.

I’d really appreciate some advice! Thanks.",85623,Need strength to dump LVM,0,,,

I have a semi interesting situation and I'm not sure how to navigate it.

I have mostly read the handbook and while I feel I have a solid grasp on everything I'm sure as a newbie there is infinite more I can learn.

In a very long story short I (19f) am a few months single after a long term relationship. I have come to realize that the relationship is not what I want or need and have leveled up in that respect. However, I was thinking of getting into the dating scene again. I took to an OLD app to practice the principles of FDS a few weeks ago. I have gotten better at enforcing boundaries and blocking as soon as red flags appear.

I actually start graduate school in the fall. I feel as if I am miles ahead in my life than peers my age. Any guy my actual age seems too immature or ""just wanting fun"". Sadly, my peers class wise (22-23) either seem just as immature or on the opposite spectrum but wanting to move extremely fast and ""settle down"". Both scenarios seem like red flags.

I guess my overall question is how would you handle this situation? Would you just not date for a few years? Would you date age range peers? Or would you class wise peers? As I'm sure this is not a common scenario I feel super lost.

Please be gentle and please give any advice relating to the situation or just leveling up in my situation in general! (Also I'm heading to bed shortly but I plan on answering any comments/questions in the morning!)",85564,Is Dating Even Worth It Right Now?,0,,,

I have an issue and i need some help overcoming it and am in need of some advice!

Im 20, so i know im in the prime of college and ive been to quite a few get togethers, parties, and social events where i meet new people. I love meeting new people and im a major extrovert! While i love to attend them, Im unable to click with the women there, in fact that isn’t even my issue, my issue is that i feel insecure around them! I sort of feel like they’re superior to me..? Its hard to explain. I dont know if its me being odd, or if its actually an issue any of you face. I love you ladies and look up to you so please help me if i am wrong!

These women often brag about doing drugs(including major ones like acid, cocaine, etc), all their hookups, threesomes, offering to strip during a drinking game, etc. And are quite out there. I don’t judge them, and i try not to. Ive tried weed but i dont like it and haven’t done it since, i dont hook up/FWB, and i never strip my clothes, or kiss random guys at parties. I socially drink of course but i’m responsible about it. 

Ill get dressed appropriately (sexy but covered because i’m modest anyway LOL) and think i look amazing and all my friends will hype me up of how great i look, and i will attend the event and start to feel insecure when the women brag about the things they’ve done. Maybe its the attention they get from men? I’ll get quite alot of attention but when the guy realizes he isnt getting the cookie from me, he quickly goes to the other women who are very open about it. I feel less worthy i guess? But then again, i know i wouldn’t want a guy who just wants sex anyway so i know genuinely benefits me. I just cant help but feel like they’re better than me. I dont know what is considered a LVW, but it really gets to me and want to know if this is just a personal issue or if other women go through this too. It has nothing to do with physical confidence, I get extremely confident in my appearance when i get ready to go out, but when they boast about what they’ve done so openly i feel very inferior.  

please help me out queens ❤️🥺",85567,Insecure around certain women?,0,,,

Learn from my mistakes and don't let being friendly, polite, or practicing basic human decency allow LVM/NVM partners of your friends or acquaintances get too close. Some of them are are so deluded they will interpret any small kindness as a sign that \*you\* are their friend, and take advantage of their proximity to you. The hosts of one of my favorite podcasts, The Read, say they are not friends with any friend's partner until the couple is married. I say, fuck marriage if the guy is a LVM/NVM, keep them as far away from you as possible, regardless of how serious or legally sanctioned the union is.

I can't stress this enough, especially with people who are in messy open relationships. Even if their relationship is closed, consider it a massive fucking red flag if any of the following fuckery is at play:

* The woman has straight up told you the dude she's with is a bad partner. This is subjective to an extent, but I think it is glaringly obvious if the partner regularly causes them harm, is neglectful, is controlling, constantly makes them doubt themselves or the relationship with hot/cold BS, fails to support them or intervene when they are being treated poorly by others, etc, etc.
* The partner openly puts them down, disrespects them, or treats them poorly while other people are around to witness it (even if it is under the guise of ""joking""). If you feel embarrassed for the woman based on how the partner treats them in public, that's a bad sign and it is almost certainly worse in private.
* The partner gives you creepy ""scouting"" vibes. Your intuition is probably on point, no matter how sneaky or covert they may try to be about their interest. A man who respects his partner and his relationship will avoid anything that may even \*appear\* untoward with that partner's friends, not try bullshit like rubber necking as a friend discusses her likes and dislikes about other men. Don't get entangled in other people's messy relationships with scrotes. You will be put in an uncomfortable position and/or be made out to be the bad guy.

After determining the partner is in fact a LVM/NVM, examine if you really want to be friends with someone who has a shitty partner, because a person's closest intimate relationship has a tremendous impact on the rest of their life by influencing, among other things:

* Their self esteem: being constantly uncertain of how the 1 person in the world who is supposed have your back feels about you makes it pretty hard to maintain healthy self esteem. This leads to tolerating shitty behavior, an inability to stand up for themselves, and being walked all over elsewhere in their life (side relationships, friendships, work, etc), which causes second order issues that you then have to hear them complain about.
* What they consider to be acceptable behavior: every flake I've known was partnered with or close friends with other flakes; they will assume that and other crappy interpersonal habits that are acceptable in their subpar relationships should be acceptable in their friendship with you, as well; you will suffer from them having a bar that is buried deep into the Earth's crust. If you cut them a bit of slack initially, for whatever reason (in my case, knowing the woman was recovering from deep trauma), they will abuse it and make unreliability the norm. Do not allow this bullshit. 
* The way they interact with everyone else: a gaping emotional void from having a shitty partner breeds desperation for validation/affection everywhere else.
   * Don't let anyone love bomb you into friendship with lame, empty flattery if it is clear their romantic relationships are crap, no matter how many good qualities they have or how much you'd like to make new friends.
   * Run away ASAP if they are unloading bullshit about their relationship on you when you hardly know each other; they may think this is cute bonding/girl talk but it is a prime example of poor boundaries.
   * Don't feel sorry for them because they are troubled or have been through a lot, there is a reason they are in such a dysfunctional relationship, they are emotionally unhealthy and this means the chances of you having a healthy and worthwhile friendship with them are slim.

If you decide the friendship is worth keeping (questionable), keep as far away from the LVM/NVM partner as possible:

* Do not add the LVM/NVM on any social media, for any reason. You shouldn't even allow them you follow you on social media if they request it.
* Do not visit the friend's home when the LVM/NVM will be there.
* Do not ask the friend about how the LVM/NVM is doing or ""tell X I said hi"" when making conversation, as you would with any normal, functional person. They will take this to mean you approve of or like them as a person. 
* Do not open up invitations to events you and your friend are attending to the LVM/NVM.
* DO NOT allow the LVM/NVM to join on trips you are taking with the friend (yes, someone actually tried to ask about this while I was planning a trip with one female friend to visit another female friend; people are wild. Was it a coincidence this occurred shortly after the couple in question had a threesome with the woman's repulsive side bf? I think not).
* Do not disclose too much of your personal information when speaking to the friend if the LVM/NVM is anywhere within earshot. This includes via phone, Zoom, etc.
* Do not ask the LVM/NVM about possible networking connections, no matter how desperate you are for work.
* Do not talk about \*anything\* even vaguely sexual if the LVM/NVM is around, no matter who brings it up in the conversation or if everyone is joking. Shut that bullshit down as soon as it happens and keep your mouth zipped. Don't let them get any ideas.
* Do not have any substantive conversations with the LVM/NVM, by any means of communication. Anything beyond ""hi"" and ""bye"" when you are forced to interact with them in person is too much and opening yourself up to gross shenanigans.

If you are smart and self respecting enough to see some bullshit is at play, you need to be extra vigilant to protect yourself around women who are too deluded/brainwashed to realize they are latched to a human turd.",86587,"2 degrees of separation is too close with LVM/NVM, protect yourself from women with shitty partners",0,,,

Now, not all of his affairs were physical, so most of the guys I’ve told this to in the past have told me that it’s not “actually cheating”, as if it hurts any less to find out the (Shitty) man you love has been telling other women that he wants them to bear his children. 

I never had *definite* proof of his cheating until one fateful day, when we were  driving back from an overnight trip. An hour or so into the drive I notice that his phone had gotten several notifications from the same person so I looked— and it was fb messages from a woman who clearly was under the impression that they were in a romantic relationship. 

I immediately asked him who she was of course and his answer was simply to snatch his phone out of my hands and tell me I didn’t know what I was talking about. To which my response was quoting her messages back to him from memory. He started to get angry and tell me i was crazy and paranoid. I told him that I had seen the proof with my own eyes and I wouldn’t listen to any of his bullshit and we were over. He responded by becoming hysterical and screaming at me that I had no right to ‘violate’ his privacy like that and that it was more complicated than I knew and that I’d regret asking. 

So of course I asked him to explain himself and he told me that he had *cancer* and she was a family friend and an MD who was helping him. Then he **spit in my face** and told me that we were over.

I was dumbfounded. I wish I could tell you all (and myself) that it ended there, but I of course bought the bullshit and tried to work things out. Of course I never heard about his cancer ever again and when I tried to bring it up he would just roll his eyes and make some excuse or accuse me of “starting trouble”.

I’m not sure there’s a clear lesson here, but I guess if I could go back in time I would tell myself that pity or guilt are never good reasons to stay with a LVM. In fact it’s almost always manipulation.",86586,The time my ex gaslighted me about having cancer,0,,,

I think the reason it worked so well was because in the beginning I really was not communicating in the most effective ways. But I worked on it. I worked on being more vulnerable. I worked on communicating when I didn’t want to. I worked on figuring out how to match his communication style. But he just kept using that line.

\*\*Story Time:\*\*

At the end I communicated a clear need. We were in a store, I said “I need you to not ask me questions for just two minutes.” Now anyone else hearing that line is going to be rightfully concerned they’ll probably say “oh my gosh are you okay?” Which is a question, but the point was I just needed a few minutes to think. Not the LVM I was with. Oh no, not even 5 seconds later he’s asking me “okay, but this brand or that brand?” and another question that I can hardly remember due to the sheer audacity of not only completely ignoring my request, but completely ignoring it TWICE. I didn’t want to make a scene so I just dealt with it in the moment as best as I could, and got done with the shopping.

When I was finally able to be alone with my thoughts I started thinking okay I want to prevent this situation from happening in the future, so how to compromise with him on this? 🤦‍♀️ hmmm well maybe we can establish that if I use our safeword in public it’s because I need him to really listen to me and I’m trying not to cause a scene. Yes I fully formed this thought before I realized: Hey wait a second he’s always saying I’m bad at communicating. But I just communicated a very clear and specific need and he just completely ignored it! Hold on a second - it’s not that I’m bad at communicating it’s that he’s bad at listening.    💡 

\*\*Why you should drop someone who uses this line immediately\*\*  


Now you may be thinking “But what if I really am bad at communicating?” You likely aren’t. And even if you are an HVM won’t say that. Here’s why:

”You’re bad at communicating“ is a throwaway label. When an LVM uses this line he doesn’t have to take any personal responsibility for any faults that may be on his end. He doesn’t have to analyze the situation and possibly come to the conclusion he’s wrong because “you’re the issue.”  And \*\*this line doesn’t solve anything.\*\* It doesn’t help either party figure out what went wrong in order to avoid it in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even if you are truly bad at communicating a kind hearted person will analyze the acute situation where they felt like there was a communication breakdown. They will take that situation and try to help solve the problem together. The kind hearted person would try to see if there were any cues they missed or if there would’ve been a way to being open to more communication so there would’ve been more time/opportunity for you to communicate. They will take active steps to figure out if there was a way to prevent the problem and if so how to do that going forward. And most importantly they want the best for the relationship so they will say things like “had I been told \_\_\_\_\_\_ then I would’ve done \_\_\_\_\_” or “ what do you mean when you say \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ I interpret that to mean \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ But should I be  interpreting it differently?”

&amp;#x200B;

An LVM assumes you are 100% to blame for the fact that there was “miscommunication” (I put that in quotes because sometimes you’ve communicated perfectly and it’s really a mis-listening). And they don’t want to solve the problem. An LVM doesn’t care that you’ve told him in the past you’re lactose intolerant and now you’re mad he ordered a cheese pizza for you to share. He will just say “wELl yOU ShoULD’vE cOMmunICaTed that you didn’t like cheese pizza.”

&amp;#x200B;

LVMs want to label you to:

a) bring your self esteem down so it’s more reliant on theirs

b) get you to work harder on your communication/effort and invest more into the relationship because “you messed up.”

c) Not acknowledge anything that they may need to do/fix.

&amp;#x200B;

They don’t really care about this “miscommunication” or the idea that it might repeat itself in the future. In fact more “miscommunication” issues just let him keep labeling you to keep cycling the take down of your self esteem and self confidence.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr communication is a two way street.",86573,“You’re bad at communicating”,0,,,

This thread is inspired by [this viral tweet](https://twitter.com/samriv2s/status/1287559089506009088) where a man asks what sex is like for women and women proceed to roast him to high hell about having sex with men mostly being trash.

FDS asked a very simple question: **What have you done to improve your sexual performance skills? Concrete examples?** 

**Men's answer:**  ""giRls hAve To CoMmUniCatE"". They further put all the blame on women for men's repeated sexual failures instead of providing examples of how they have or can improve their sexual skills, or even bothering to ask women in the thread how it can be done. The responses are an Absolute disappointment, and the reflexive defensiveness feels like  men are deliberately making the choice to be trash. 

So scrotes, please provide examples, any examples at all, of you pro-actively improving your sex game instead of waiting for women to bottle feed you every bit of information?

Basically I'm roommates with a creepy loser neckbeard but choose to continue living here because I like everything else about my situation and feel that having to move would be super inconvenient, also I've taken control of the situation to the point that he is genuinely afraid to piss me off again so I feel no need to leave. I resent that when men fuck up a woman's life situation, society expects her to change her whole ass life to get away from him and if she chooses to put with the situation and just quietly resent him instead, she is treated as deserving everything she gets. I still want to vent about how unbearable he is, even if I'm generally now comfortable with my living situation. I just cant help but hate the guy and for very good reasons. Just because I live relatively comfortably with this LVM doesnt mean I cant be disgusted by how shit he is. 


Anyways this post got stormed by shitty men defending him, villainizing me, and accusing me of all kinds of false bullshit because they sympathize with the oh so poor rejected male. 

They suggested I'm anti-mask (I'm not I have a post about the higher risk of infection when wearing marks but it does not suggest prople should stop wearing them. I wear a mask every single day).

They accused me of living rent free and taking advantage of his pathetic crush on me (if I wanted nothing to do with him why the hell would I make myself financially dependent on him) 

And other ridiculous and frequently misogynistic assumptions. Enjoy.

We are still getting requests to sign up for, [TheRealFemaleDatingStrategy.com](https://www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com/), and we are overwhelmed by the response - thank you!!

If you have not yet done so, [please read this post about our website launch first.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/hiha1o/its_here_weve_launched/)

We had to launch the website sooner than expected, so changes are still rapidly being made; you may see things be switched around on a daily basis. You also may see some popular posts be deleted from Reddit and moved to the Website. This is to protect our content from deletion by Reddit and piracy.

Now that we've had some time to streamline the process, we are making a few changes:

**SIGN UP:**

1. **We are only accepting 8 digit code requests through the website.** If you PM me or any of the mods on Reddit, Instagram or Twitter we will be redirecting you to the website. This helps us keep track of all the requests in one place. [Click here to request an 8 digit code.](https://www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com/8-digit-code)
2. **Use Instagram or Twitter for an expedited approval process.** Our reddit requests are backlogged and many of you are far too new for us to verify your account on the website. For expedited sign up, please apply with your instagram or twitter accounts.
3. **Please make sure you can receive DMs on your platform of choice.** There were some people we tried to send codes to who had their Direct Messages disabled, so we had to pass. If you are unsure, please DM the official FDS twitter or instagram accounts so we can respond.
4. **Please be patient! Due to demand, We are on about a 5 day lag on sending out 8 digit codes.** If you are not an existing sub member or someone we can easily identify as female from your social media, OR we can't reach you, you will likely be passed over for someone else in the queue.
5. **If you do not sign up within 60 days of receiving your code, you will be bumped from the approval queue completely and will have to start over.** We have some members who we've sent codes to who as of yet have yet to create an account. Please do so ASAP!
6. **Our website is now available via the Wix app!** It can be dowloaded for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wix-app-website-builder/id1099748482) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wix.android&amp;hl=en_US)! Use the code ""WZBOVG"" to join the app page **AFTER** you have requested and received your 8 digit code. If you join through the app without the 8 digit code, it will be rejected.

**FORUM:**

1. **Once you are approved, please log in** [**and say hello in the Forum!**](https://www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com/forum) We just want to make sure it is working for everyone. All new members are restricted to one post per day for their first week of membership to make moderation easier for us while we get the website off the ground.
2. **The Strategy subforums and Sex subforum on the website are for members only** \- this is to protect the privacy of our members who want to ask sensitive questions.
3. **If you are not logged in as a member, you can read the posts in most of the subforums, but you cannot comment.** You will not be able to read posts in the Strategy or Sex Forum at all.

**SOCIAL MEDIA:**

We've archived our Facebook page due to security concerns (facebook LEACHES data), but we have just launched a new **Pinterest** and **Tumblr**!

Here are links to all our social media accounts if you wish to follow us!

When LVM would grow distant emotionally, the only way back was through sex. 

Lesson:

They have a choice: but LVM don’t choose any avenue for intimacy other than sex. That’s why they prioritize it so much (other than being entitled). 

They have the time and energy: Young LVM on here mentioned spending 3 hours just looking for porn to watch, and another couldn’t hold off from masturbating in a virtual meeting. 

They don’t have the excuse: HVM know what intimacy is and know it doesn’t have to involve sex. So while you are getting to know someone, look for things that build intimacy: (comment examples below)

I ‘meet’ this one guy with who I had a interesting conversations so I allowed him to add me on another message app.  However, he asked about a date and i let him know that I only agree if there’s proper planning and he tells me days in advance. First he agreed and seems to be fine with it which looked like a good sign for me but it’s almost funny how the last few days before the date he started to send me pictures of spots close to his home (- 1 red flag, I said I won’t travel that far) and mention he would like to “show me around” (essentially “walking” there, - another red flag).

After seeing this I responded only shortly because we didn’t even meet yet nor did he planned something and he already expects me to be excited about a second “walk date” 🤦‍♀️

So now it’s one day before the “expected” date day and he writes me a short hi, no question how I’m doing or anything and send me a picture of another park. No mention of any restaurant where we would have lunch (this was what we both agreed too), no meeting time, no mention of picking me up from the station etc.

My Intuition tells me that he never wanted to actually take me out on a proper date but instead “sneaking” a walk date in and then hope I would had forgot about the rest. It only proofs the point that men will try to scam you if you let them. Surely I won’t go on a date with him at any future.

Oh and this is in Japan.

For me, it was making plans. I was dating a guy for about three months but had made all of our plans beyond the initial date. When I inquired about it, he said it wasn’t his thing and my ideas were cooler. 

Then, the last time I saw him he offhandedly mentioned planning dates with multiple women and getting upset when they canceled or altered plans. Beyond this, the night I went over he had a date two hours after I got there and was trying to rush me out. That he planned using one of my old ideas. He even thanked me for the suggestion. 

When I communicated feeling like a benchwarmer, he explained that no I came first and he would like to keep me around. 

A younger me would have tried harder for that top spot or that monogamy. The older me said prove it and stopped contacting him first. 

Wouldn’t you know? He never reached out again. This is when I knew I needed a mindset shift. Ladies, if he isn’t a planner but actively plans for other people just walk. 

Now, I realize, as I move through my FDS learnings this guy wouldn’t have lasted beyond the first few weeks. It sucks to feel like you’re dragging someone by the shirt collar only to realize (as comes up here often) - if they wanted to, they would.

He constantly cheated on me with other women and didn't even deny or try to hide it. Instead he had made sure to instill in me that I was absolutely unlovable, ugly and toxic and that he was the only one to ever ""give me a chance"", but that I needed to work hard to keep that privilege. If I'd leave him, I'd be a toxic quitter, who didn't want to self-improve.

I was terribly lonely as a child, abused by my father, later disowned by his family in retaliation when my mother finally split from him, horrifically bullied in school because I never learned how to stand up for myself with a family background like that. I wanted to be loved so badly, had no self esteem due to my past abuse and knew the feeling of not getting any love as punishment very well. 

This self-help guru callously used all of this to his benefit and gaslit me into accepting him sleeping around as - according to him - this was what any mature, woke adult would do and if I had a problem with it this would be a testament to my own short-comings, which also were the cause of my past abuse (talk about victim blaming). If I felt pain, it was not due to his cruelty, but due to my unwillingness to self-improve in order to be free of ""unreasonable, toxic jealousy"". 

He would always say that I was free to sleep around too, if I ever found a guy who would want me (implying I'm too ugly, too unlovable). But even if I did, he claimed, he wouldn't react toxic and jealous like me, because he ""accepts my sexual freedom"" and is spiritually on a much higher plane than poor little me who is stuck in a jealous hamster wheel of a mind. Of course, in hindsight I realise that all of this was bs. He wouldn't have been jealous for the simple reason that he didn't care about me, if I was happy or in pain, if I lived or died. While I was with him, I ended up in hospital with a blood clot and when I tried to reach him, scared and in need of support, he didn't pick up the phone for WEEKS, because he was on a ""spiritual journey"" with another woman. I was so brainwashed that I was lying in my hospital bed wondering what was wrong with ME, terrified of losing him.

So this guy got me to read Medium where lots of self-important manipulators like him, especially from the tech sector, publish their bs takes on digital nomad lifestyles, self-improvement, woke liberal feminism laced with very superficial liberal identity politics. I used to religiously read it, even paid for a membership, because I hoped eventually I'd be woke enough for him to love me. I know... pathetic, but also just sad. :(

I didn't renew my subscription after it ran out, but I still get the newsletter. Today I was directed towards this gem: ""I let my boyfriend have sex with another woman"" [https://psiloveyou.xyz/i-let-my-boyfriend-have-sex-with-another-woman-ce2492138185](https://psiloveyou.xyz/i-let-my-boyfriend-have-sex-with-another-woman-ce2492138185). 

The author recounts being manipulated and pressured in consenting and partaking in her boyfriend's sexual adventure even though the thought of it made her cry and she felt vulnarable and upset. She only did it, because her boyfriend said he was disappointed in her not being fun anymore. In the end, she still comes to the conclusion that this was somehow empowering to her own sexuality and hasn't dumped the boyfriend despite recognising that he manipulated her. I feel so bad for her, because I was exactly in that mindset. To me she's not some pathetic pickmeisha, she is a victim first and foremost. I understand how it is to be taught by men that you are worthless and if you don't want to spend your life alone, you cannot make ""outrageous"" demands such as being treated with love and dignity.

It also made me realise that Medium is full of stories like that, where male gurus posing as woke feminists, pickmeishas, as well as true abuse victims with Stockholm syndrome, recount stories that make my skin crawl because they are triggering horrible memories from horrible times. 

But then I was like ... wait a minute: The fact, that these horrible feelings are no longer omnipresent in my life and have been relegated to memories that have to get triggered in order to be felt, is SUCH an improvement. I used to constantly feel this dread and threat of losing the people, who are supposed to love me (my parents, my family, my boyfriends), because I was callously abandoned by them so often as a punishment. Now I realise, I don't feel that threat anymore and haven't for quite a few years. I'm alone, yes, but I'm so safe and content and there is no more active pain in me like it used to all the goddam time. The best thing was to be abandoned by absolutely every man in my life, because still I have myself, my mum, my pets and my girlfriends and none of them have ever caused me pain nor will they. It's telling how the one nightmare scenario that all of them always threatened would ruin me (ending up alone without a guy), actually made my life the best it has ever been.",86829,"Medium.com is mostly a platform for male ""self help gurus"", cool girls, pickmeishas and abused women with Stockholm syndrome to gaslight other women into accepting unacceptable abuse... change my mind.",0,,,

They shape our attachment styles in our adult relationship.

However, in my experience, a man's relationship with his mother is especially important because it's very predictive of his behavior towards women, and NOT just the women he's dating, but women in general. 

1. If she is abusive - this is, of course, awful and I feel remorse for any victim of physical or emotional abuse. However, this also means he most likely didn't have a positive female figure in his life, which will almost definitely result in some more or less obvious grudges towards the female gender (or just an unhealthy attachment style). If he's not in therapy, be VERY VERY careful. 


2. If he's a momma's boy - I'm sure I don't need to tell you this : you will never live up to her, but at the same time, he will expect you to do everything for him. If you think you're the exception, you're most likely not. 


3. If she's controlling - at first you will like his independence and him standing up to her. This guy is most likely a free spirit, fun guy. However, because of her constant smothering throughout his young life, he has a need to 'live his life' now and will run away the first time you complain about anything at all. This is the guy with commitment issues. 


4. If she is distant and cold - he will be clingy, unless he went to therapy. 


And finally, always pay attention to the marriage of your partner's parents, because this is where he learned how a relationship should look like.

We all carry similar issues from our young lives but I feel that women are more receptive of them and more ready to work on them in therapy.",81548,Why you should always pay attention to a guy's relationship with his mother,0,,,

What is discussed most frequently here is that it costs more to be a woman in this world. Our daily maintenance is much more expensive and time consuming than a man’s BEFORE we even consider what it takes to get ready for a date. Even if you’re a low maintenance women, you spend more than the average male on your daily hygiene, maintenance and care

Let’s not even get into all of the statistics of men who are deadbeat dads and men who leave their long term marriages with SAHM’s for younger women

What is less often discussed is the fact that if a man is not just in it for  sex, he will be willing to make an investment in treating you well and getting to know you in the PROPER setting of an evening out at a PUBLIC place and treating you to a meal so that you feel SAFE, secure and desired. How else can you open up and get to know someone if you don’t feel not just safe, but special?

Every other guy is just a throwaway. Block and delete

And if he can’t afford to spend $25 on a meal for a women, he deserves the ole’ block and delete. If he wants to be able to seriously date you, he needs to be able to afford everything it takes to go forward with a secure future and start a life together.

girls sexy photos on Instagram, even when we had multiple conversations about how it made me uncomfortable. The best he could do was say “I’ll try to do better, can’t promise I’ll be perfect.” I told him I felt vulnerable because I was going to go work in a hospital during a pandemic in a very high risk state. He said it was my choice to go into healthcare and basically to not complain. I told him I was stressed and could not take one more thing to stress out over. Like it’s so hard to not double tap a photo. Between that and inviting an old hook up to his birthday party without discussing it with me and then she flirted with him the whole time in front of my face. I felt sad and I could start to see my self esteem and self worth slipping. I just couldn’t do it. We blocked each other on everything. This morning I was just feeling sad though. I felt like I knew I deserved better, but I also felt stressed about being alone. Especially during this state of the world. FDS is the one of the things in my life that helps me feel better.

this guy was feeling like - what if I marry this dude? What if I don’t have time time to get dolled up and am
caring for an infant. If he doesn’t make me feel beautiful now (and I am quite conventionally attractive and 26) ... what am I going to feel like when I’ve gained pregnancy weight, am at my wits end, and don’t have time to look perfect all of the time?

   * suffocating/smothering
   * too concerned about his life

* **he is easily irritable, seems to think of you as the bad guy no matter what**
* ""don't worry about that"" *WORRY ABOUT THAT*
* secretive about his phone, social media, internet, computer, accounts
* shady about finances
* **stingy with you but you know he's well off (he is spending on a mistress)**
* lots of late night phone calls
* change in routine
* change in work habits
* **new attention to appearance, looking good, and exercises**
* new expressions, catchphrases, and words (picked up after spending time with another woman)
* porn use IS infidelity, period.
   * Drooling over IG thots IS infidelity, period.
   * Lusting after strangers and celebrities IS infidelity, period.
   * Flirting with other women IS infidelity. Advertising himself as single IS infidelity. Not revealing his relationship status IS infidelity.
   * Talking shit about you behind your back IS infidelity.
      * The first step to full blown cheating is being comfortable disrespecting you when you're not around and talking shit behind your back. Someone loyal to you who cares about your well-being would never smear your name or reputation.
* insulting you, smearing your reputation or name
* **sabotaging your work attempts, putting you down to make himself feel better (guilty conscience)**
* going out ""with the guys""
* **you should know bro code.**
   * THEY WILL COVER FOR EACH OTHER 100% OF THE TIME. EVEN HIS MOM, DAD, AND SIBLINGS WILL. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU, THEY'RE NOT LOYAL TO YOU. YOU ARE WHO YOU HANG OUT WITH. IF HE'S A LIAR, REST ASSURED ALL HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE BONAFIDE LIARS AND YOU CAN'T TRUST THEM. They have HIS back, not yours.
      * bro code is always saying ""yeah he was with me"" to cover for him
* signs he is about to cheat
   * he will begin talking shit about you to his family so they can't feel sympathy for you after the inevitable blow out, he will tell them you are a frigid and emotionless bitch or that you took a break from the relationship (more like he disappeared to cheat), and that he was single. He will paint you as crazy. The shit-talking begins far before you two breakup.
* **responding to your questions with anything other than pleasantness and transparency**
* being evasive in general
* **NOT SMILING.** liars cannot hold in their contempt for long. If you watch closely you'll notice they sneer at you in all your greatness, mad that you aren't as low or two-faced as they are
* LIARS and CHEATERS have self-worth issues.
   * They may seem arrogant or confident, but trust, they hate themselves and they have a guilty conscience all the time.
   * It will show on their faces soon in accelerated aging, don't worry.
   * **He may complain of STOMACH ISSUES, SLEEP ISSUES, LOW IMMUNE SYSTEM, HEADACHES, MIGRAINES, CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME (texting the mistress), TIREDNESS, FATIGUE, because humans aren't made to live triple and quadruple lives!** ***Watch closely!*** cheaters often are irritable because they have constant headaches keeping all of their lives straight.
* Think about the man who was most devoted to you in your love life and compare him to that.
   * If you had a bf who was super busy but would still make time for you and plan surprises on your bday, that is the standard you're looking for. Doesn't matter if your new guy has a time-consuming job, he shows you through his actions where his priorities lie. **REMEMBER:The number one excuse guys use to cover their cheating tracks is BUSY AT WORK. BUSY AT WORK. Don't forget it.**
* **Look for routine change. He used to call you every day, now you're lucky to get a text. Where is his time and energy going? Not to you**
* **HE STOPS CALLING YOU BY YOUR NAME AND USES PET NAMES INSTEAD**
* **HE DOES NOT ASK YOU HOW YOUR DAY WAS. He just goes through the motions trying to maintain a facade, his mind is elsewhere, with other women he is chasing. He got bored:**
   * Dogs get bored once they get the prize and have to start chasing again to gain validation. Don't feel bad, dogs were never fit for monogamy in the first place. Consider it a blessing when true colors are revealed.
   * A HVM knows monogamy is A CHOICE and A COMMITMENT. There will always be different looks out there, different professions, people who have different qualities, etc. but he knows being monogamous and committed is saying there are billions of people out there, but I chose you and will keep choosing you every day because we are a team. And if he can't do that, he will respectfully make his feelings known, and break up with some dignity.
   * A cheater and dog on the other hand thinks *ME ME ME ME ME ME MUH DICK AND MUH VALIDATION.* *I WANT TO HAVE MY CAKE AND EAT IT TOO AND REFUSE TO ADDRESS MY EMOTIONAL ISSUES.*
   * He wants to have both your complete loyalty AND to fraternize with other women, with no regard as to how much of a betrayal that is to you and humiliating that is to you
* Stay away from self-obsessed LVM. It's a fine line because guys who are into self-improvement are good, but guys who only have loyalty to themselves are actually ***DANGEROUS***. **They will throw you under the bus and humiliate you without a second thought as long as it benefits them.**
* notice his core personality traits.
   * does he put you or him first? **avoid selfish men.**
   * is he stingy?
   * other red flags
      * **defensive, sensitive to criticism, secretive, people-pleasing (will say something to make you happy but internally feel differently)**
* **PEOPLE-PLEASERS ARE DANGEROUS-THEY CAN NEVER BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU AND WILL ONLY TELL YOU WHAT THEY THINK YOU WANT TO HEAR. AVOID ""PEOPLE-PLEASERS"" WHO ARE DISHONEST TO KEEP THE PEACE. TWO-FACED.**
* in the early stages of dating, DO NOT make your values known. Your standards and values are for you to know, and him to find out when he violates them, and you dump him. If you tell him upfront what you expect, you are giving him the key to manipulate you and put on an act pretending to be all that.
   * This has been confirmed by countless men, notably Derrick Jaxn, who has a youtube channel exposing the Fuckboy Mentality.
* see what he says naturally and how he acts naturally. Telling him your standards makes him put on an act because he doesn't want to lose emotional labor and access to sex.
* NOTICE what he says about cheating when other people do it. Does he sympathize? does he say he can see how some men are led to that? Does he put blame on the betrayed spouse? is the focus on sex or muh penis? **Does he say** ***MANY*** **COUPLES GO THROUGH IT? red flag sis, he is PRIMING YOU TO GO THROUGH IT and to add insult to injury, EXPECTING YOU TO RECONCILE ONCE HE IS EXPOSED because he has normalized cheating.**
* When you ask him if he's cheated in past relationships he gets defensive: ""How could you think I could do something like that?"" He is working hard to throw you off scent.
* He thinks relationships are hard work and full of disagreements. Uh, *no the fuck they're not*
* If he believes in 'til death do us part and not until 'til we get divorced or 'til you betray me, it means his **DADDY CHEATED ON HIS MOM AND SHE STAYED WITH HIM, AND HE IS EXPECTING THE SAME LIFESTYLE. WATCH OUT FOR THESE PEOPLE WHO GLORIFY THEIR PARENTS TOXIC MARRIAGES AND ARE VEHEMENTLY ANTI-DIVORCE AND ANTI-BREAKING UP.**
   * they want you to suffer for the greater good of letting him have his cake and eat it too
   * be especially wary of these types. They seem to have an idea that they can marry a ""good woman"" and go and philander as much as they want. It's the way they think marriage should be. Being monogamous means nothing to them, *getting married is a social image thing* they do to look good in front of others and to lock down a loyal woman they know wouldn't humiliate them the way they would humiliate her.
* If you know what he finds attractive in a woman, that's a red flag. You shouldn't really know. He should only be complimenting you and speaking about your beauty. **If he has said enough to give you an idea of who/what kind of look he would cheat with given the opportunity, run.** This also shows he lacks emotional intelligence-shouldn't be discussing women who are not you. Be doubly wary if his type doesn't look like you.
* Does he not believe in therapy? Is he not introspective? Does he think can solve his problems in life by running from them?
* ""**JOKES""** about infidelity,using language like bitches, conquests, or hoes, jokes about fooling women, two-timing them, misogynistic memes or sense of humor, seems to idolize players and men who disrespect women. Pay attention to what kind of media he consumes and what messages he's getting.
* a sense of entitlement. A supreme sense of entitlement ""to be happy"" (it will eventually be you making him unhappy, and needing to ""be happy"" and ""have his needs met"" will be the justification he uses to stray). Having morals or ethics, or thinking of people other than themselves doesn't register to them.
* Do they constantly brag about how good they are, how charitable and kind? If they were any of those things, you would notice. They would NOT need to tell you. Guilty conscience! Trying to manufacture a character before your eyes!
* Does he make statements about being single until married? That's not how it works, bro. If you can't be monogamous or loyal before, you cannot be after you say your marriage vows. These clowns are always on the lookout for something ""better"", and by better, I mean someone who is going to validate their egos more because you actually know him well and don't glorify him or put up with his shit. He goes and acts like Prince Charming, so the new girl treats him like a king because she doesn't know his flaws, and he thinks to himself, this girl is SO much nicer and better than my loyal partner! Don't worry, anyone who gets to know him will see his repugnant self-absorption eventually.
* What is his idea of difficulty in a relationship? If he mentions infidelity, like a run-of-the-mill issue, run. Cheating is a choice, not an accident or mistake- **IT IS A MINDSET AND CORE SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT AND DISHONESTY.**
* Relationship difficulties are things like being laid off, terminal diseases, moving...not making the choice to meet someone new and open up your relationship. It doesn't take much self-control to not do that. This shows cheaters do it to get off on the power imbalance and the disrespect. If you accept him back or give him a second chance, you are signing off to let him humiliate you later. Selfish dogs never change.
* Pornsick men are already cheaters by definition, they lust after women who are not you.
* Men who reach a certain age, 35 or so, and have never been married? It's because they delusionally were always on the lookout for someone ""better"" and didn't wife the HVW who gave her youth to him, thought he could still do ""better""
* If the energy and effort that he brought to you in the beginning of the relationship (of course he was high-effort in the beginning, you wouldn't have been with him otherwise, right?) is waning or decreasing, just know it is going elsewhere
* Most important of all is **YOUR INTUITION. DO NOT DOUBT IT ANYMORE. IF YOU FEEL SOMETHING IS OFF, IT IS.** He may lie until he is blue in the face if you confront him, but you have to stand your ground and keep relying on your intuition.
* the sex stops. Passion in the beginning, to nothing at all. Or ""too tired"".
   * Not just sex, feeling desired, and the compliments stop. He doesn't compliment you or make you feel desirable. Why? He is getting his sexual needs sickeningly satisfied elsewhere. He is either pornsick, sexting women, on dating apps, or physically cheating in real life.
* He stops talking about the future with the two of you in it.
* He is dragging his feet on important things (buying time, living in the fantasy of running off with his affair partner)
* Weird degrading stuff during sex, you can feel his contempt and disrespect for you now transferring from his cheating on you afar to how he treats you when you're in front of him. He is finding it hard to think of you as a human because he had to dehumanize you to justify his betrayal in his head.
* Seems to despise doing anything that will benefit you and not him
* feels ""unappreciated"" despite not doing shit
* His actions and how he spends his time will tell you his priorities. Less you, more video games, more friends, more ""work""? Bad sign.
* Constant showering, grooming
* New hobbies his new gf likes and got him into
* Acting weird in public or ashamed-He doesn't want the waiter to ask him about how he was there with another woman. He doesn't want the new girl's friends seeing you two in any PDA.
* Totally low-effort, netflix and chilling all the time.
* Forgets things you told him. His mind was elsewhere, already thinking about how he is about the call new girl. **The mind can only juggle so many conversations at once.**
* Doesn't care to impress you or live up to your standards more, new girl is more low-maintenance than you and he wants to transition to that soon
* gaslighting or lying about little things, priming you for a big thing
* Deceptive LVM are humans too, in that they are not computers or robots. They WILL slip and they will always leave clues. They are sloppy.
   * Some subconciously want to be found out for being unfaithful because they are too scared to end the relationship properly. Just don't let him know your suspicions in case he starts hiding more.
* Play nice and oblivious while you are compiling your evidence
* Think about how he was when he first got with you. You're not special to him, as he uses the same patterns on everyone. If he was sending you dick pics a month in, he is sending new girls dick pics right now. If you met him online, he probably met new girl online. If he slept with you a week in, he slept with her a week in.
* Cheaters lack consciences. They do not feel bad about having their cake and eating it too, and never will. Any remorse you see is with the intent to lure you back in. They are only ever sorry they got caught and now have to face consequences. You think he would've come clean if you didn't find out? Absolutely not. Which shows they are fucked up because living with that kind of double life is only something someone fucked up can do.
* **If he is in touch with his EXES, he IS flirting with them/sexting/giving false hope to them behind your back**. Especially if he is making her sound crazy like ""SHE is the one who CONTACTED ME""
   * yeah he contacted her to complain about you and to tell her he misses her. **He should not be in touch with any exes.** The past is in the past.  he is also going to think you're available for all of eternity after you dump him, texting you periodically telling you he misses you. Just like he did with his exes while he was with you.
* If you're way out of his league, he may cheat on you out of spite and jealousy. He knows you can do better, and to wrong you he will go out with other women as a f you to how much better you are than he is. Their psychology is twisted.
* Put him in front of people who have better BS detectors than you do, and see what they think of him.
* being obsessed with their sexual prowess/looks/money/job. They think life is for debauching and want to make the most out of what they perceive as their strengths by stringing multiple women along. **RUN AWAY from vain men.**
* He talks a big game about spirituality, religion, or doing the right thing. Anyone worth his salt wouldn't be talking about it, but embodying goodness. If he has to make a show of being good or religious, just now he has things he is hiding, guaranteed.
* **If he is ok arguing with his mother, he is ok with disrespecting you.** No grown man should be fighting with adult women. That is a sign of immaturity and misogyny.
   * he shouldn't be arguing with you at all either. Disagreements should always be handled in a respectful and upbeat way. None of that antagonism or sulking stuff.
* Silent treatment? Congrats sis, you now know the exact dates he was cheating on you physically.
* Ask him what his life goals are, and what they were
   * accumulating lots of money, being popular, sleeping with lots of women in college are red flags
   * being obsessed with making money (end goal is to attract women) is a red flag
* if he has nothing meaningful to say, like about the world or humanity, but is rather self-obsessed and obsessed with his few interests, run
* they try to dominate conversations and control the subjects you talk about. You may find yourself months in still knowing nothing of substance about this man because he talked your ear off about himself, how charitable he is, his violin fascination, and his favorite movies, and nothing deeper at all. Make sure he doesn't control the narrative of your convos and you are able to accurately vet and assess him getting the questions you want answered.
* emotional shallowness is a red flag, compartmentalizing his life or his emotions. Usually he will have one close guy friend to tell sordid details to and most often his mom to get sympathy from, and he will use these two as crutches and yes-men to justify his disrespect of all women he comes across.",81864,Thread on detecting lies and infidelity,0,,,

I didn’t feel like my emotional needs were met in the relationship, he was a hardcore introverted gamer and he still lived with his parents at 32 years old, he was also 6 years older than me. Just so many red flags that became apparent to me when I found out about FDS.

I was also a total pickme and would drive 1 hour to see him every 2 weeks. He never came to see me because I’m living with my parents and they wouldn’t feel comfortable with a guy coming over. This was his excuse for never driving to see me.

So I broke up with him back in April and we decided to stay as friends because we work together.

I seriously regret dating a coworker because it feels awkward af. I feel uncomfortable talking to him knowing that he’s seen my body and we’ve done intimate things despite us not being together anymore. 

Thankfully due to COVID I’ve been working from home and haven’t seen him over the past few
months, but he messages me everyday on Lync at work, sometimes saying flirty things. 

It happened a few times and so I told him to stop making flirty comments because we aren’t together anymore, and he said he was only doing it because “that’s what we did in the past” and he “still has residual feelings for me” and he’s “lonely”

Alarms went off, I knew he probably was lying and just was hoping to keep me in his back pocket to have sex if the opportunity ever came up.

I haven’t talked to him at all for the past 2 days. It just feels so awkward because we work together and I have to see his name at work. I’m really considering just applying to other positions at this point.

How do I handle this? Should I just stop all contact even though we’re coworkers? Or do I need to maintain some semblance of friendship while we work together? Thankfully I’m not seeing him at all right now in person.

PLEASE learn from my mistake and never date a coworker!!",82885,Thoughts on being friends with an ex who is a coworker?,0,,,

It feels disrespectful, it offends you, and it makes you uncomfortable. You  obviously wouldn't indulge his request - it's a hard no.

But you should also stop entertaining him altogether. You know what your boundaries are - now you need to enforce them ruthlessly. That means not allowing anyone into your life that would try to cross them.

He wants to Netflix and chill on the second date? Block and delete.

He asks you to send nudes? Block and delete.

He sends you a text at 11pm asking you to come over ""to cuddle""? Block and delete.

He asks for a degrading sex act? Make an excuse to leave, then block and delete.

He wants to have condom-less sex? Same as above.

Etc., etc.

Consider that the fact he asked in the first place shows how little respect and  consideration he has for you. It shows how little he values you. It shows that he's willing to risk losing you through his bad behavior. So  let him lose you!

Men don't make  such outrageous requests because they're clueless and don't know what's  socially appropriate. They ask for such things because they want to see how low your standards might be and/or how far you will bend your  boundaries for him. They want to take advantage. You can tell him ""no"" all you want, but do you really want to be with someone that is constantly poking and prodding at you, trying to figure out how much he can get away with and how much he can milk from you? That sounds exhausting.

You don't need to explain yourself to him. You don't need to verbally defend your boundaries. You do not need to negotiate. It's a waste of  your time and energy and it won't change a thing; if you're lucky, he'll  be on his best behavior just until he becomes sure that you care too much to leave, and then he'll test you again. And again.

It's better to let go of someone who clearly doesn't value you, and live peacefully knowing you'll only allow those who truly deserve you into  your life.",82879,"If he makes an unreasonable request, let him GO. No sticking around, no explaining, no negotiating.",0,,,

Mental abuse like gaslighting literally makes you dumber, it's one of the key ways guys will waste your time and hold you back (if you don't recognize it or allow it). I've always been a ""high performing"" student and employee, but I realized a common theme from the periods where I had cognitive decline intense enough to make school and work noticeably more difficult (despite taking steps to lighten my workload, etc): shitty, abusive men in my life.

They know the mental toll it takes to question and doubt yourself when someone is fucking with your head all the time, how exhausting it can be to brainstorm a bunch of different scenarios to explain inexplicable garbage behavior, how fucking maddening it is to have someone override your reality with nonsense revisionist history time and time again.

Consistent gaslighting and other psychological abuse puts you into a mental fog. The most heinous men are fully aware of this and weaponize it to cripple women they feel threatened by, or would like to make more malleable to control for other purposes (sex, free labor, etc). They get close under the guise of a relationship, friendship, work connection, etc and use their proximity to subtly shave you down over time with mental mind games.

As soon as a man gaslights you, cut him off or (in cases where you have to see him like at work) limit your contact to what is absolutely necessary. It's the only way to defend yourself from the harm they are intent on inflicting. They know what the fuck they are doing, don't allow them to trick you into becoming a depleted shell of yourself through mental exhaustion.",82852,"Psychological abuse from scrotes makes you stupid, we should talk about that more",1,,,

Hi all - recently joined this sub and am so grateful for being able to have a space where I'm not gaslighted and made to feel crazy because men have fantasies and we have standards.

I recently reconnected with an acquaintance from 3 years back. While catching up via text &amp; phone calls, he mentions to me very early on that 1) I'm the one who got away and 2) he's only ever been down for a few women but that's he's had a looooot of beautiful hookups/casuals. During this time, he practiced a lot of risky sex and like the embodiment of a true LVM, caught genital HSV2 and is desperate for a ""ride or die"" telling me I could be the one.

I really try not to perpetuate stigmas surrounding STIs because there are many who so unfairly catch it (i.e cheating partner/non-consensual sex). In his case, however, he IS the living stigma - hoeing around carelessly and recklessly. Now he's caught an incurable virus (that flares up consistently) and while I think he's cute and somewhat put together, I can't help but feel like he's ""damaged."" It's a horrible way of describing the situation but it's the only word that accurately captures what I feel. He keeps saying I'm extremely hot, intelligent, and that I have it all, but I see right through it and sense his desperation. I know I'm all of those things, but I treat my body and life like a sacred temple -- thoughtful and selective about who I let in, hence very few men and even less hookup occasions in my history. He loves that I don't have much experience/haven't dated in 3 years and is pressuring me to accept him because it makes things easier -- I can't help but feel like he looks pathetic beyond belief and is asking far more than his value allows him to.",82848,Desperation of a LVM,0,,,

* He didn't have a dad, so it's fine that he's an absentee father.
* His dad drank, so *of course* he fell into drugs and alcohol.
* He was cheated on, so his anger towards me is justified.
* His commitment issues are because of (insert) (every) (person) (but) (himself).

Imagine if we gave women this latitude. I don't know a single woman in my life who wasn't sexually, physically, emotionally or mentally assaulted at least once in her life. But women don't have the sympathy or luxury to be overcome by our traumas to the point where we can be absolute monsters to the people around us ""because we've been hurt"". Nor should we, that's ridiculous and society would collapse. But we do this for men *all the damn time.* 

* ""He was bullied, that's why he lashes out."" - No, he has impulse problems that he refuses to work through.
* ""He was cheated on so now he has commitment problems."" - No, he allows fear and insecurity  justify his chronic mistreatment  of women.
* ""He's messy because his mom worked and didn't teach him basic life skills."" - Nah, he's lazy as fuck and fine living in filth because the alternative requires effort.

This isn't to imply that men don't have real and significant trauma - they do. Few of us are walking around without some trauma or another. Trauma isn't our fault, but healing is our **responsibility**. We never heal if we make excuses  for our lack of willingness to grow and change. 

Remember ladies: **Intent doesn't negate impact.** He can say all day that he *wants* to do X, Y, and Z, but his actions will determine his character every time.  Don't excuse away his problematic behaviors because you are attracted to his potential. Don't make excuses for his inadequacies because you over-empathize and justify his choices based on his excuses. Men are capable and responsible for their own emotional growth, and if your man isn't growing because he wants to, he will **never** do it for you.",82794,"It does NOT fucking matter WHY he's problematic, that's NOT.

I think this is great advice because it lets women know that the man is serious about the date.

But I feel I (23f) can't really employ it given my lifestyle. I have always provided the date, time and location for my dates. And 60% of the time, I give the guys last minute notices.

My reasons are the following.

Location : I need to be able to provide the location for the dates, especially for the first few initial dates out of concern for safety and also my convenience. I always set up a date in a coffee shop close to my house, so that if the date is boring / the guy is creeping me out / I feel unsafe / any reason I don't want to continue the date; I can easily make an excuse and get home quickly, safely and easily.

If I let him choose a location and that's too far from my house, I won't be comfortable. What if it's difficult to get cabs in the area and I have to depend on him to get me home?

Also, I never tell the guy where I live until much later.

Nothing has ever happened to me but I'm just a little paranoid about these things because of news and stories from other people. And I feel it is my safety measures that have prevented anything bad from happening to me.

So no new, unfamiliar restaurants or places. No far away locations.

Time &amp; Date : Initially, I am not ready to sacrifice my weekends for a date with a guy. Absolutely not. I usually have a lot of plans with friends for weekends, that are mostly decided by Wednesday. Else, I have a lot of solo plans like hobbies &amp; solo trips.

Given this situation, I can never spare a weekend for a guy, at least not initially.

So what I do, is I set a date and time according to my convenience during the week. I have a 8hr, 9-5 job which sometimes becomes 10-6 or 11-7 depending on the work. Whenever I get off work on a weekday and am in the mood to go on a date, I text the guy the time, place and date, 1 hour prior to the date. They agree to this 90% of the time. And I get a date at my convenience &amp; at the location I am comfortable in.

After I feel the guy is ok, I allow dates on the weekends which I inform them need to be made before Wednesday because I'll be booked otherwise. It's very easy for them to accept this because they do see my social media posts filled with pictures of the things I did on the weekend. And they always end up making plans in advance.

But again, I choose the time and place according to my convenience. It just has to be that way. Once, I chose a place close to my friends house just so I could visit her after the date and have a productive weekend. That's just how I'm wired. I can't move my plans around to fit a guy at the time he wants.

So I feel if I let the guy take the lead and make the plan, I might have to adjust to that. Sure, I can say no to his offer and then suggest my own time &amp; place. But how many times can I really do this though, before he notices that I always turn down his ideas and I always choose the time &amp; location convenient for me.

At Least when I take the lead, they simply comply and seem to be oblivious that I'm having it my way. They usually feel like it's hard to spend time with me given my busy schedule and agree to my terms. I like it that way.

So I can't employ the advice of letting the man pick the date, time and location for a potential date.

Me: Early? No, I think that's normal

Him: Haha on a Saturday morning for me it was a little early

But okay then I have learned that you get up early every day of the week while I lie and go to bed on the weekends so you can be responsible for breakfast

Maybe we can keep in touch by text message instead so maybe we answer each other a little faster I'm not so active in here

Sex-work will always exist, though it’s best if a woman is fully mentally-developed to fully think it through before partaking it. 

I’m particularly young, and I’ve seen a decent amount people below their twenties get into sex-work. This is probably due to the romanization of OnlyFans and online sex-work. The glorification really leaves out the predatory behavior and dangers. 

The sex-worker industry, especially online, is very competitive, and most of the time, education for a *hypothetically* ethical and morally-correct sex-work is nonexistent. Workers doesn’t look out for each other whatsoever. 

You know, if tons of hyper-liberal women want to legalize sex-work, “lock up your local pedophile”, and remove the teen category from pornhub, why encourage and enable, highly vulnerable young women into the industry? These 18-year-old and 19-year-old ladies aren’t profiting cause they’re tackling their sexuality, but due to their age and luring-in (older) men because of taking advantage of it. Hyping up a young woman to go into the sex-work industry is grooming. It enables the buyer to continue be predatory. 

I don’t know if this was the right place to discuss this, but I said what I said.",83116,What The Sex-Worker Industry Enables,0,,,

However, as pertaining to the strategies I have learned from the FDS philosophy as well as personal life experience, I believe that we as women are undermined from an early age when it comes to striking a balance between the objective (scientist) mind and the subjective (feeling) heart. 

“Think like a scientist” is my starting mantra when facing a challenge, question, or action-based decision in the relationship/dating arena. Scientists may feel passionately about the topic they study, but their dedication to the objective merits of a good scientific method are the basis on which they seek answers and act in their exploration. The passion follows and is enhanced by this objective, analytical starting point. When dealing with questions of a man’s suitability as a partner, validity as a suitor, integrity of behavior, etc - you MUST allow your objective mind to take the lead. This is easier for some than others, but largely requires discipline and self reflection. You must consistently analyze YOURSELF in context and let your objective, evidence-based standards and knowledge decide whether your words, actions, or choices are truly in keeping with a strong and effective (read: FDS mindset) method.

“Feel like a sage” refers to the ability to then accept the emotions attached to a situation without allowing them to overrule your self-interest and logic-based behaviors. Even when addressing mistakes, a sage is able to view their emotions (ego) via a lens of calm acceptance and self-compassion. They let feelings exist and honor them WITHOUT handing them the reins to their lives and choices. Feelings are, to the sage, natural and neither “good” nor “bad.” They are to be honored as a part of the human experience while also being kept in their proper place.

The ability to separate these two frames of mind and heart is meant to be a natural part of becoming an adult. However, women are as a general rule trained by experience to lose touch with that ability, thus becoming susceptible to manipulation (both by others and their own egos). Thoughts and emotions, in short, become confused with one another. Instead of working in tandem, constant pressure and a range of traumas result in these two forces becoming unhealthily and hopelessly entangled. This is why we see such a prevalence of codependency OR avoidant behaviors in ourselves. 

Re-learning the art of “thinking like a scientist, feeling like a sage” is, luckily, easier than most of us probably expect. It is, as stated before, a matter of discipline and self-reflection. These two habits in all their forms naturally re-train us to achieve balance. FDS happens to encourage them both in numerous ways. Each woman will find her own methods and balance to work with. Mine, for example, has been informed by faith (religious studies), reading a wide array of western and eastern classical philosophic texts, and radical self-care. These, merged with experience, have given me a balanced relationship and life that is fulfilling and joyful beyond my wildest expectations.

So many aspects of FDS philosophy aid in the journey to achieve this objective-subjective synergy, but I felt that putting the concept into a long post might be useful to the sisters of this community. Please share any thoughts or points of further discussion!",84089,"“Think like a scientist, Feel like a sage.”",0,,,

So we ended up stopping communication because he couldn't get over me and needed to heal. During this time I felt lonely for friendship and with not dating anyone for months, my boyfriend who I was occasionally talking to messaged me a flirty text and I reciprocated almost immediately.  

I think it was a rebound, I never bothered getting to know him, and slept with him almost immediately because I havent had sex in months.(🤡 moment) I'm looking back and I feel like he used my daughter as a way to get close to me, considering he bought her a pack of cupcakes after our second date. And I feel like that's was some sort of catalyst for me to stay because it felt nice having someone accept me having a daughter at a young age. (🤡 moment)And also it's been two and half years of me being single. 

When I think of him, it's like hes made no effort in life: has almost no friends, just games in his spare time, has no hobbies, doesn't eat fruit or vegetables,  isn't active, never travelled, lives with his sister in her basement, and never went to college or finished high school,  doesn't drink or has tried drugs besides weed like one time (not necessarily a bad trait, but he makes me out to be like a crackhead when I talk about my experiences with drugs)And I'm only able to see him one day a week! Also too, I CARRY 90% OF THE CONVERSATION!! I feel like his good traits are just the absolute bare minimum for a person, which is treating me nicely, being kind. 

And it's not like I'm perfect or anything, but I feel like I'm on track of getting my life together, and have actual goals, and i keep up with my appearance regularly. Also I'm confident that my life is only going to get better in a matter of weeks with how I've been carrying myself and been saving :) I'm going back to university in the fall,  saving for a car, actively looking for an apartment, I exercise regularly,  have my own hobbies,  have a good amount of friends, take care of my appearance (I feel like I'm a pretty cute person!), eat healthily, and I'm actively trying to improve my mental health. 

I broke up with him for like 3 weeks and I went on a date with someone else, and now I'm wondering why I even went back. But i think it's mostly out of being familiar with him. Like the person I went out on a date is well travelled, likes to play music, career driven, very friendly,  works out, is funny, wanted to go on really fun dates and take me out immediately after our first date lol, is a home owner, and was sweet. Hes handsome, dresses nicely, has a dog and cat (shows he can take care of more than just himself), confident, and was adventurous. I'm not saying the guy I went out on a date with is the one for me, but it just goes to show how much I'm settling on and can do better


I really hate feeling like I wasted my time with him and I cancelled so much plans with friends because his only day off is on saturday, where I cancelled going camping, the beach, and a rave just to sit in his sisters basement to watch a movie on Netflix!!!! 

Anyway, how do I break up with someone without being like "" you're a total loser, bye!!"" ?",84562,"I got desperate during covid and ignored the FDS rules, and now I'm seeing the loser in him and want to break up with him but don't know how to do it nicely",0,,,

I found a Youtuber who's dedicated to helping others with relationships of all kinds. This video in particular goes into A LOT of FDS principles because he asked for women's advice for red flags in relationships and doesn't filter their voices. While communication is a recurring theme, some great talking points are: a man's financial immaturity; not to romanticize a man; keeping your hobbies; being aware of gaslighting, etc. I'm glad to see more women wising up and dating smarter in the wider world! Do you think it would be wise to post a link to FDS there? Or do some of you feel it's not FDS enough?

She talks about how to operate as the best version of yourself, how to figure out what you REQUIRE of a man, how not to settle for anything less and how to meet high value men!

It has been a tough day, but I finally did it. The restraining order paperwork has officially been served to my current, abusive husband. I went to the courthouse today and officially filed my proof of service. It has been a tough ride ladies. Very tough times for me emotionally and physically. 

I moved out about 5 months ago just me and my dog. He would tell me to move out or would make me sleep on the air mattress in the living room until I found a place to live. He hasn’t stopped calling emailing texting and voice messaging. I blocked him every way and he even made up different email addresses to email me. 

It was hard for me to relive the moments where I had to write down on paper the times that I went through and seeing the things that he has said to me through text messages, harassing me calling me over and over and over again. I had to go through the text messages and pictures of me today with a bruised eye. It is so traumatic to relive these experiences and I got through the day while working. This is why we need each other and we need to keep reminding each other of our strength and our value I want to Thank this channel for support and for the reminder of what we bring to the table and to never ever settle for anything less. This is a message to all of you to never lower your standards and always always look out for yourself as number one first. Much love XOXO

Update — I am overwhelmed by all the amazing comments from all you ladies. Thank you so much for your words and for making me feel deserving of a peace and happiness in my lifetime.

I had taken a step back to support his work and goals. 

I did everything I could to make him happy. Ironing his clothes, making his coffee and bringing it to him while he showers for work, cleaning, doing work admin for him etc.

He stopped respecting me. Would stay out late because he didn’t want to be around me. We fought all the time because of it. My neediness for his attention drove him away further.

I started reading this page and decided to not rely on someone else for my happiness. Moved out for a few months, started diving back into my hobbies and work, began loving myself again.

When we came back together to touch base he told me he had signed up for therapy to work on respecting me. Has been consistently going.

We’re now stronger than ever. He shares the chores. Goes out of his way to support my goals. He makes time to take me out for dinner twice a week. The other day he drove me up to see a sunset, hid flowers up on top of the hill and gave them to me with a gorgeous necklace. Popped a bottle of wine and told me he loved me.

I literally said in my head “accept nothing less queen 👑” 

My husband is a hella HVM right now, I’m more attracted to him than ever - and love and care for myself more than ever. So much respect both ways.

We’re both single and dating and all. She’s divorced. She married her ex-husband for a green card, this is not speculation, she admitted to this and told me she left him the second she got it. This ex of hers was a pretty nice guy, he did a lot for her and overtime as I’ve gotten to know her core, I sometimes wonder why he even married her considering she’s an extreme opportunist who uses people. She’s starting to use me too and that’s why I’m pissed and writing this.

So back in December I invited her to my cousin’s 40th birthday party. I have a huge family and we’re lots of fun. Most of her family lives overseas and she’s kind of alone here so I was nice enough to invite her to a family party. She’s also single and thought maybe she would meet someone (like in a normal way) not in the way she operates, and I’ll explain what I mean later on. 

Well she had her eyes set on my married cousin the whole time and even accused him of grabbing her ass at the party. My cousin would NEVER do that! First of all, his wife was there, second of all, his whole family was there, third of all, I know my cousin’s character, he would never ever do that. At first when she told me this, I didn’t know what to think of it. I didn’t want to accuse her of lying so I just kind of awkwardly laughed and was like yeah idk… but as time went on I was like no! no way my cousin did that. I hear how she talks about how literally EVERY guy on the face of earth wants her and is in love with her so I was like yup ok she lied about my cousin, she’s delusional and just a straight attention whore. Like I said, she SWEARS every man is after her. Every Instagram like she gets, she thinks that guy wants to marry her. Her mentality reminds me of how I used to think as a teenager on myspace lol. 

I know this sounds a little like pick-me behavior, but the reason why I say she’s not a pick-me is because she is BEYOND entitled for the very little that she offers. The thing that baffles me with her is that she wants a man to 100% supplement her life financially, take her on extravagant trips multiple times a year, fine dining 3-4 times a week, but he also needs to be a 30 something 6’2 MD with a hot body and perfect hair all while she does nothing except have a flat stomach. Literally that’s all she has to offer, a nice body and a nice face. 

She has zero ambitions, zero life outside of laying on the beach during the day and partying it up in LA clubs at night oh and also finding a man. She has a job at a bank where basically all of her income goes to her rent because she refuses to live anywhere except a super trendy part of LA which is obviously above her means. I’ve repeatedly told her to apply to other places to better herself and she expresses interest but then says she wants to find a guy first. I’ve even encouraged her to return to school and get a master’s degree or something, again she says she wants a man first. 

Some of her behavior is very pick-me, for example how she shits on all women, the only women in her eyes who are of any worth are Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber because they’re “hot”. But then some of the things about her that aren’t pick-me is that on first dates she must be taken to a five-star restaurant, she will settle for nothing less. She is very keen on finding this “perfect guy” that meets all of her requirements but also has to somehow be a self-made millionaire at 30?! Like I said, I just don’t see what she has to offer in return other than being somewhat attractive. She says she “deserves” all of these things. I think she is perfectly described as the type of arm candy that guys on reddit wish to have but keep in mind what kind of guys go on reddit. I seriously don’t understand nor see why an educated, successful, handsome HVM would waste his time with a girl like her merely because she’s “hot”. And if I were to share my opinion, she’s really not as hot as she thinks she is. She is an attractive girl with a nice body and fun personality but has zero substance, definitely has narcissistic tendencies and if I had to rate her level of intelligence, I’d say it’s pretty average.  

Anyways, being her friend is pretty draining and I’m just venting here. I basically spend all of my time talking shit on other women with her, which makes me so uncomfortable. I am too mature for this behavior but unfortunately have gotten sucked in. Her mentality is so child-like. Her posts on ig are so cringe, it’s selfie after selfie after selfie, most of which are in bikinis and it’s so obvious she does it for male attention. She’s added like 15 of my male cousins on her ig which makes me super uncomfortable because I feel like she’s just using me to “level up” or something cause I have a very nice family and she’s trying to snatch one of my cousins up and men are all so dumb, some of them swoon after her (the non-married ones of course) and like honestly if she was a decent girl, I would have no problem setting her up with one of them, this was my intention actually back in December to introduce her to one of my cousins but as I’ve gotten to know her and seen her behavior, I’m like HELL NO! I’ve seen her hook up with men and women in night clubs while I just awkwardly stand to the side. I had an altercation with her a couple of weeks ago where I basically put her in her place about my married cousin cause she would send me his pics and shit and be like omg my heart so I kind of went off on her and she sent me this whole essay about how she’s sorry, I accepted her apology but a part of me senses that she only sent it to cover her own ass because I have so much shit on her. I’ve heard her talk shit on her other friends, family members and so on and basically just know all her dirty little secrets (NONE of which I would ever reveal cause I’m not a shitty person) but I seriously feel like that’s the only reason why she apologized, to save face cause knowing what a self-ish opportunistic person she is, she literally does not give two shits about anyone.",85317,Friend’s not necessarily a pick-me but not sure what to make of her toxic character traits either,0,,,

This was back in 2018! Being inspired by your stories I decided to tell my own! I used to work with Mia (not her real name), I'm 3 years her senior and we got promoted into the same team. Not gonna lie, she's very pretty, silky hair, impeccable makeup skills and... shoddy taste on men.

She had a penchant to choose ""men no one wanted"" aka overweight, bald, short, etc. and tell me she ""had a thing for the unfortunate ones"". What does that even mean? She ended up having me play cupid for her and this... this fine specimen of LVM she chose. Seriously, he wore the same \*high IQ cartoon\* t-shirt monday through friday (he was on another team and could dress casual). Let's call him Mark.

This was months after we became friends so I tried to advise her not to go too fast, telling her to make him miss her a bit, she was too available, only to get clapped back by ""don't be such a prude, he should be proud of having such a prompt girlfriend like me"". She even bought him a Switch with Breath of the Wild bundle which cost about 600 dollars ""as a 1 month gift, I'm so independent and cool and he loves videogames""!

Mark eventually became my friend because we played Pokemon Go together (him, Mia and I) and he one day told me his ex girlfriend was crazy and ""nagged too much, took away his freedom"". 

Guess what eventually Mia came crying to me about? She asked him to watch the World Cup final with her at home, where it would be safer than going to a bar, but he pushed her aside and went with the boys anyway. When he came home shitfaced she ""agreed"" to have sex with him because ""she felt bad for nagging"".

After hearing this I snapped at Mia. Where are the consequences for his actions? This was only one of the multitudes of crap she would tell me for validation perhaps, but I started getting more and more hardened towards this sympathy baiting, and ended up giving her the phone to my therapist's office. Said I couldn't help her if she herself doesn't see this as abuse. She got super mad at me and called me a cold-hearted b-tch, prude, sexist, threw in a few unrelated insults and blocked me.

At the start of 2019 I got promoted into another team and she tried to be friends again. ""Sure why not"" I was dumb enough to think, and to my ""surprise"" they'd have broken up... because he was cheating. She apologized for the harsh words and we started having lunch together again. She was much more discreet now, but only for a while. 

Same day, as I was getting ready to go to bed she calls me. ""I slept with Mark! He called me crying saying that he missed me, so he's changed! Isn't it great how people learn and grow up!! What do you think, Sam?"" 

Me: ""I think this guy has you in the palm of his hand and you should drop his ass""  
Mia: ""Oh my god, Mark said you'd tell me this! He told me you wanted to undermine our relationship! You're jealous! You want him for yourself because you're think you're a better match!!""   
\*(we both like videogames, truly a match made in heaven /s)\*  
Me: ""He said that?""  
Mia: ""Word for word!!!""  
Me: ""Good night."" \*blocked\*

I carried on with work guilt-free since we were in different buildings now so I didn't have to run into this psycho again but I hope she at least dropped him this time. That guy is absolute scum and I hope she carried on with therapy, since she's a good girl with a very misguided heart.

I kept thinking about it afterwards. I wanted to know what FDS members thought of show?

Connell was such a dick to Marianne in high school and I was so mad at him for not asking her to the debs. I'm glad she straight-up ghosted him, it was well deserved. From a FDS standpoint, she should have stopped talking to him in university, but then the show would be over. 

I did love him by the end of the series, he really does grow to be a better person. It's hard to hate him despite his actions. I feel bad for his girlfriend (Helen) he strung along though and also Jamie. I know everyone hated him and he's a massive dick, but I really felt bad for him in Italy. 

It's also interesting to note that this show embodies everything that is wrong with millennial relationships these days. She initiates the relationship, they have sex very early, he never commits to her, he doesn't communicate etc. 
&gt;!I really loved the ending. I think Marianne was definitely a HVM by the end. She knows her worth, hence why she chooses to stay in Dublin without Connell.

He was, and is, an addict. He was sexually abusive towards me for six years, was watching porn under my nose in my house and at work, which I discovered years later. After we separated for six months over it, I set clear boundaries: No porn/sexually explicit/questionable material or we're done. No excuses. He went to a few therapy sessions and attended SA for two years, claiming he was in recovery. I never fully believed him. I guess my intuiton is too good.

Low and behold, a month ago, I found that my (soon to be) ex husband was watching anime videos on YouTube. These videos featured heavy chested Asian anime characters in scantily clad outfits, with the camera focusing on their bodies in the entire scene.

This fool, who claimed to be ""in recovery"" actually had the audacity to say the following to me upon confronting him:

""But...it's not porn."" (Delusional)

""You're judging me off of two videos!"" (Gaslighting)

""So you're just going to ignore all the other videos I watched that aren't like that??"" (Gaslighting)

""Can you stop doing this???"" (Avoidant, Gaslighting)

""It's a fight scene! You can clearly see it's a fight!"" (Gaslighting)

""IF it bothers you, I won't watch it anymore."" (Gaslighting, he knew my boundaries and chooses to play dumb, as if he couldn't imagine why watching ""a AnImE FiGht"" would be inappropriate)


A day later, he admits he ""wasn't as recovered as he thought he was"" and ""watched one video and went down a rabbit hole.""

I immediately snapped my fingers, said ""we're done,"" and walked out. He stopped going to SA and used COVID as an excuse, not even following up to see when they'd reopen. He also has ADHD and stopped going to his doctor to seek medical treatment. I will never ignore my gut again. I knew he was flaking, I just stayed silent and observed. And what I knew all along, was right. 

Not even a week prior to this, I admitted myself to the hospital on the verge of a breakdown and on the phone, he was in tears telling me ""he's not that person anymore."" 

This Man plays video games for hours on end, puts more effort into game achievements than he does in his own life. Now we sleep in separate rooms, and I walked into his bedroom to find a bowl of dessert from two days ago in the closet, ketchup bottle on the floor, crumbs of food and a chicken bone with an old Popeyes box on the floor. Blanket and pillow laying on the ground, with his TV and Playstation set up on our ironing board for him to play. I can't believe I actually saw potential in him. He piggybacked off my ambition. I was in the process of starting a cleaning company which he was going to drop his own plans to become an electrician to join. Past me would have been impressed by the ""support."" The REAL me sees this is someone with no ambition and low motivation that's perfectly fine following someone else's plans and taking no initiative to do better for HIMSELF.

A part of me feels sorry for him because he's losing me and my family that were a HUGE support system to him, more than they should've been. But I don't pity him. 


Unfortunately I'm stuck in a lease with this fool, barely employed, and have seven months to get my shit together on my own or I'll be homeless with three cats.

Please help restore my sanity and reassure me that I'm not trippin' 
I know I'm not, and I know in my heart I need to leave him, but it never hurts to hear it. Thank you all, you've been a tremendous blessing to me through this rough time in my life.",85294,Grown Ass Men Ending Marriages Over Porn &amp; Anime Women.,0,,,

so basically nicki minaj got married last year and i didnt think much abt it until i read a quote of hers that said she wanted to retire so as to have a family life. i found that to be very weird as in why give up ur life and succesful career for a marriage?. you can both .nothing wrong with that. it just seemed very weird because she has always had a no shits given attitude in the media which i respected.

then i did a little reading and guess what. i had a hard time not trying to find a wall to bang my head on.

KENNETH PETTY

here is some background on him

""Petty has served time for both manslaughter and for the attempted rape of a 16-year-old girl.

According to the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services  , on September 16, 1994, the NYPD's Sex Offender Unit arrested Petty  for “sexual intercourse” with a 16-year-old female.

Reports say the official conviction record states he used a  “knife/cutting instrument (e.g., axe, ice pick, screwdriver,  switchblade, Kung Fu stars, cane sword, etc.)” during the attempted  rape.

He was sentenced to between 18 and 54 months in a state prison, but it’s unclear how much time he actually served.

He remains a registered sex offender in the state of New York.

Kenneth also spent seven years behind bars after he was found guilty of manslaughter in 2006.

According to the criminal complaint from the Queens County District  Attorney, he pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter following the  fatal shooting of a man named Lamont Robinson.

The complaint states that on April 27, 2002, at 12.30am, Petty shot  Robinson “with a loaded handgin (sic) multiple times thereby causing his  death”.

Officials originally charged Petty with murder in the second degree,  but he struck a manslaughter deal with prosecutors and was sentenced to  10 years in prison, for which he served seven.

Court records indicate Petty was released in May 2013, and had been on supervised release for five years up until May 2018.""

This is a mess a mess a mess. gdi how can women be such boss bitches in their career . win fucking AMAs and then go and marry a **LVM**. like please treat your professional life and love life equally. have the same attitude and dont accept anything less. have quality ppl in both areas . and dont date down. its never worth it. date equals or someone who is doing better. even if that doesn't work you would have gained something from them instead of the opposite.

I'm 28 and just broke up with the last ""boy""friend I ever want to date. I realized dating LVM used up my energy on their fuck shit while pushing away and weakening relationships with females. Here's the thing, I soulfully crave healthy, supportive, conscious sisterhood above all things and I'm ready to heal myself and work toward that goal. Whilst I've built a great career and healthy habits I'm ready to take it to the next level and need all the energy I have to focus, focus, focus. I am determined!

Me- 
I am a massage therapist (top of my game, private practice) and have developed a multitude of healthy habbits and rituals sustained over a long period of time (newest, 6mo) I am no longer interested in healing boys.

Past-
I've fallen in love with a few LVM who had some excellent qualities, be it in business, music, outdoorsmen, but still lacked in some area. As a military kid, it was always ""do they like me"" rather than ""do I like you"" and this translated into my dating life. I am just now beginning to figure out what my standards and must haves are. 

Additionally, as a result of trauma, I used to push away feelings (consciously honoring now) and hard times. Because of those outdated coping mechanisms I never gave myself proper healing times after previous relationshios. I would think about and over romanticize past partners while dating new ones.  Such a hot mess. 

I broke up with my last boyfriend because I knew I needed to change course. I still care about this wonderful person and would like to someday be friends as we had a deep connection but I am in no way interested in sharing in his slobbish lifestyle of making lots of money and feeling like he's conquered his healing while engaging in unhealthy habbits and exemplifying a totally unstructured unhealthy lifestyle. 
 

Present- our relationship is freshly ended. I still have gifts he gave me during our relationship and I am struggling to cut ties. We also have a similar friend group which complicates the matter. (Its a small community and we had intertwined friends before dating) 

I feel alone. I've alienated myself from close girlfriends and I feel stuck in the laying in distracting and doubting myself. I'm new to healing from relationships and setting closure once and for all. I'm reading the FDS manual on break ups but I'm new to this stage of healing.

Edit: I am not blameless. I'm also struggling with the weight of my actions and the realization that I was irresponsible for my healing/emotions/actions and because I didn't take responsibility for ways I hurt myself I projected that onto partners and had poor boundaries and lashed for that as well. 

Im posting because being seen and heard feels nice and I'm up for advice, support, or similar experiences, etc. All this in the middle of a pandemic is real humbling.",85293,Recovering pickmeshia fresh out of relationship and seeking support during healing and transformation,0,,,

I am a graduate student, and my PhD advisor is currently in another country (he has positions at my university and at another one). He has been able to secure an exception with the immigration officials in that country and I could go to that country as well for anywhere from 2-5 months of this year. The problem is I feel really hesitant going for such a long time, and I hate to say it but a lot of it is because I don't want to be long-distance with my boyfriend for so long when he wouldn't be allowed to visit me.

Career-wise, I would do better work if I could meet live with my advisor. Meeting over zoom is fine, but it doesn't compare to live meetings. That's really the only advantage of going, though. If I went I would spend my birthday alone in a country where I know about 10 people, nobody would be able to visit me (because of travel restrictions), and I'd be in a long distance relationship. Before the pandemic happened, I was planning to travel with my advisor + do a summer program so I'd be gone for 3 months, and I discussed this with my boyfriend who said he's happy to be long distance/wait for me for as long as I need to be away for my career (then everything got cancelled so it wasn't an issue anymore). I'm not worried about the relationship failing because of long distance (and if it does then it would have failed for another reason anyway) but more so I just really don't like long distance. I don't like facetiming or texting, I'd rather talk in person. I really like physical affection and I don't like the effort of keeping up a relationship when it's all virtual. I don't want to be the kind of person who sacrifices parts of my career for a man, but I'm really leaning towards only going for 2 months because I think that is how I would be happier.

I’ve been trying to get my toxic BF to leave for months. Basically since quarantine started. It’s like he is refusing to. And I feel so trapped. He doesn’t pay anything here. I do. Yet he acts like it’s his house. The thing I hate most is that he stays up all night at least 2-3 nights a week, drinking. Like pass out in the morning drinking. So now his cat is sick. And I’ve tried to be there for him. But I’ve been so strong at all other times that I feel exhausted to do it now. So I of course am working today. (He doesn’t work) And got woken up so many times last night because he was awake, drinking, and not caring how loud he was. I said that this wasn’t working so he started saying what an awful person I am for not understanding that he’s upset his cat is sick.

A lot of these women believe that to be a “proper” submissive feminine woman, you must allow your man to walk all over you and talk over you. This is wrong and a extremely dangerous idea. YOU ARE NOT A DOG or an object. You as a woman are allowed to disagree with your husband/boyfriend. You are ALLOWED to be mad and have emotions and you deserve respect. 

I will never understand why these women believe that we are trying to “steal away” their femininity. No, that’s not what we are trying to do. We are trying to make you understand that you are a strong woman and a human being. You don’t BELONG to anyone because you aren’t an object. There is nothing wrong with being submissive and wanting a dominant man.

I'd like to get your mindful opinion on something. I'm still quite young, but already at the age where I should at least be stepping foot into the industry that I'd like to build my career in. I've now decided what it is I'd like to do, but am uneasy about the aspect of the job that would require having my personal information easily accessible by just about anyone. I'd have to freely give out my real full name and phone number to potential clients (in part precisely for the reason of them being able to look me up on social media; so I can't use a fake name on it), business partners, would need to put my position and workplace on Facebook, etc. But the problem is I'm aware of how much a person is able to do with even a fraction of that information when they have ill intentions.  


In the past, I've had some very unpleasant experiences with being followed and having my personal space invaded in various ways by various people (some that I knew rather well, others barely acquaintances - let's leave it at that in terms of detail)... And I've always been very private anyway, so while I'd be excited to do the job, this is a thought that kind of makes me panic every time it enters my mind. Everything else about the work thrills me and suits my skills really well, so please try to refrain from telling me to consider another path.  


Unfortunately, therapy isn't an option at this point in time. Therefore, any advice on how to tread carefully or ease my fears would be *highly* appreciated.",85565,Anxiety about having a public profile (Career),0,,,

I've been lurking here for a while and, from what I've been reading here and on the handbook, the FDS mindset is more marriage-oriented, with some exceptions like younger women (in their twenties), or the ones who have been divorced and don't want to re-marry. 

A little bit of background to clarify the question: I'm a 29 year old woman from South America. I never dreamed of traditional marriage or kids and I don't think I'll ever change my mind.   What I would like, though, is to have lifelong partner, companionship. I've had only one commited relationship in my life, on my early twenties, and it lasted for 4 years. Although it ""didn't work out"", it was very meaningful to me and I hope to have another relationship like that again.  


What I would like to know is: is there any women here who, like me, don't plan to marry at all, but still want to have a meaningful relationship with a HVM? Is that even possible to expect to date a man who is worth it in this scenario?",85545,Are there any 30+ women in this sub who don't intend to marry? Care to share your thoughts/experiences?,0,,,

I needed male validation to feel whole. I was around 16-17 and dated men aged 21-24. I had a lot of experiences way too early. And I have just recently realized that my first sexual experience was rape.

Some part of me resents my mom for not showing me how to respect myself and know what I am worth. She never demonstrated any sense of independence from my dad and always tries to please him sexually and domestically (cook him food, clean, etc.) and he has cheated on her multiple times and given her 2 different STD's and did not divorce him.

As I become my own young women and surround myself with strong female influences, I have developed a stronger sense of self- I have my own hobbies, goals, ambitions, I have a great social life, and excel academically.

My mom sees me becoming my own person and I feel like it makes her insecure. Over the past year, I have become much leaner and fitter from cycling and gaining a passion for nutrition. Over the course of this year, she has accused me of being anorexic multiple times. I think this is a testament to her own insecurity.

I have to constantly to tell her to reach out to her friends when she has an inevitable breakdown when she feels unfulfilled because she has no hobbies (other than shopping) or friends- the only person she hangs out with is my dad.

My older sister struggles with severe mental health issues and I have to be the one to seek treatment for her. My sister showed my mom her self-mutilation and my mom attempted to make an appointment for her at our doctor's (psychiatry) office after I prompted her to. She was told that they do not do family therapy appointments and then forgot about the issue on her weekend getaway, leaving me with the responsibility of my suicidal sister.

I am exhausted talking to her. She is a reflection of the woman that I do not want to be at her age and she was never there for me emotionally on the level that I needed her. She is not her own person and has no sense of self.

I am not sure how I can continue to have a relationship with her. She angers me whenever I talk to her. But for now, I am stuck living under the same roof as her and it exhausts me.

I just needed to vent. Anyone share similar experiences/resent their mother for similar reasons?",85542,How do I deal with my (20F) mom (58F) who is the greatest PickMe of all time?,0,,,

But along with this message comes another, not always recognized: that enforced submission and the use of cruelty, if played out in heterosexual pairing, is sexually ""normal,"" while sensuality between women, including erotic mutuality and respect, is ""queer,"" ""sick,"" and either pornographic in itself or not very exciting compared with the sexuality of whips and bondage. **Pornography does not simply create a climate in which sex
and violence are interchangeable; it widens the range of behavior considered
acceptable from men in heterosexual intercourse-behavior which reiteratively
strips women of their autonomy, dignity, and sexual potential, including the potential of loving and being loved by women in mutuality and integrity.**

So I am a young (21) woman who has never had a relationship. And I have my reasons. I am one of the lucky few to have had a strong home life with a strong female role model in my mother and a HV role model in my father. I have a very well-defined idea of what I want in a man because I have seen the way my father treats my mother. 

I was single all through high school. I am a very late bloomer. I wasn't interested in dating until now. I think in part was that I didn't particularly cared about my health and my looks - I was mostly interested in graduating top of my class and going to the best college possible. And I did. I had one guy that was 'interested' in me - he kept trying to hold my hand and whatever, but I realized that it made me very uncomfortable and firmly but gently told him I was not interested but wanted to remain friends. We still are to this day. 

I left high school and went to college. Started realizing - hey, there might be something to this whole dating thing! I had two friends interested in me (apparently, I didn't even know one was). I think one still is but I am just objectively not attracted to him. It's not just that he's short or whatever, but our personalities clash and he can push my buttons sometimes. I am friends with both and have remained so. I had a friend from across the country come visit me, and we started a sort of 'pseudo' relationship - we had one kind of fake (?) kiss (it was more like... bumping faces? so not really a kiss? I don't consider it one.) and then he went home. We facetime and talk at least once a week but it's no different than when we labelled our relationship as friends. I fail to see a future in this relationship and would like to actually experience physical aspects - I don't see why I should limit myself to someone I may not see for months or years at a time.

So this past year I lost 30 lbs. I completely changed my wardrobe - I stopped dressing like a boy and really actually got some cute girly things that make me feel pretty and more confident. Note that I did this for me, for my health, not for anyone else. That being said, I realize taking care of oneself has its advantages and I would like to start dating. 

Here's where the advice part comes in. Basically every guy that has expressed interest in me is not who I am interested in. It's usually not for shallow reasons - it's typically because I know our personalities will clash and we will want to murder each other (that usually leads into I am not attracted to you). I feel like that I should at least deserve someone I am partially attracted to for dating? And I don't really want to lower my standards and date losers. I myself am a high performing career minded student and don't want to date someone who thinks juuling is a hobby and working at Food Lion is a passible career, sorry. Now that I am looking a lot better, I know I'll get more male attention (have yet to test this because of rona, so... take that with a grain of salt, maybe I'm butt fucking ugly), but I am SO BAD at reading signals and putting myself out there. I hate OLD and would never go for a hookup (I want to lose my virginity to someone I love and care about, and who feels the same about me). I have a friend in my friend group I asked to lunch a couple times but he didn't seem to get the hint so I dropped it, mostly. 

This is the time I feel, in my early twenties, to really put myself out there and start dating. Let me make it clear: I have no intention of sleeping with anyone until we're committed (that is something I will not bend on, like how I do not drink at school, period). I am a pretty conservative person. I dress modestly, I do not get drunk, I do not really dance or go crazy, and I am very academic. That being said, I think I am a great conversationalist and I am pretty funny! People usually like me when they get to know me more. I am worried my exterior is too intimidating for men because I am so goal oriented and they won't be interested, especially if they themselves are goal oriented. I am extremely involved at school. Men see me as as peer, colleague, and leader - that's probably why I have never received an unsolicited dick pic, even with OLD, but I think that means they write me off as a potential romantic candidate. I am not the girl they’re gonna hook up with - they usually figure that out pretty quick and I am rarely ever point blank asked to hook up.

I’m old fashioned. I think that a man should ask a woman out. I think that men need to act like men, unlike the porn-video game-junk food addicts men of my generation are. I want to go to dinner and see a movie, not Netflix and chill at your house when I don’t know you. Maybe my standards are too high or too romantic. But that’s what I want out of courtship. I want a partner to talk to, laugh with, and joke with. 

If you got to this point, thanks for reading so much. I guess my question is: what should I do? I hate the old adage 'it'll come when it'll come!!' because I feel like it hasn't come and I don't know when it's coming. I am fine being single but I want to experience a relationship. I WANT to know what it's like to give your all to someone and have that person give theirs to you.

(For the snapchat: I literally can’t find a reason for a man to have one unless for receiving and sending nudes)

Here are some of the redflags that you should be looking for (feel free to comment any I might have left out)

_Just being very active on social media is in itself a Bright Red Flag. A HVM that has self confidence and a good life will not spend his time being active on social media. Simple as that

_Follows instamodels or a lot of girls he doesn’t know personally - that’s just LV and childish behavior. He sees women as objects. 

_Constantly posts pictures of himself - What kind of man needs to post a lot of pictures of himself just to get attention? That’s extremely childish. Do you imagine a grown up man literally doing a photoshoot every single time he is going out? No. He is a child in need of social validation, next him

_Posts selfies by himself - I think this one speaks for itself. A man taking and posting a selfie by himself is very immature in my opinion (rare exceptions)

_Constantly likes every girl’s posts, specially the more seductive ones

_Posts a lot of stories - needs to showcase whatever the fuck he’s doing just so he can feel a little better about himself

_Has comments of girls with heart emojis and whatnot - meaning he is very flirty with a lot of women, it’s very weird to comment/send those emojis to anyone other than a gf/close family. Probably female “friends” he wants to fuck 

_Goes and likes your old pics to get your attention - he does this so you can feed his ego by returning the favor. And he does it to a lot more women. Its a very low effort attempt to flirt. 

_Slides in your DMs without knowing you - I will make a post on this

_Adds/ follows you without knowing you - when I went to college I received dozens of friend requests on facebook from older students. I dont know how they even knew my name. Interesting it was only men, not a single woman. They were probably all adding freshmens they thought they could eventually get with. When in the same year I understand, but older students? Yeah no. Very LV behavior.

Reading this list feels like it will be very hard to find a man that doesn’t do any of this. Yes that’s correct. Because most men fucking suck. Like it’s said here many times the bar is on the fucking floor. Still rather be single than with a LVM 🤷‍♀️

Every single on of this should be an instant block/next. Not because of the behavior itself but what it portraits about the man in question and future problems that could appear when in a relationship with them. Social media can be very useful to get to know a man. If he posts, what he posts, who he follows, is all very telling of who he is. And since most men are stupid they literally showcase on social media how low value they are. Be smart.

So, as the title says, this is both a warning/venting post about the stupid decisions we make when we're in love... Sorry it's so long but I currently don't even have enough money to pay for a therapist so you're basically my only way of not going insane. It's pretty depressing, though...

**Story time**: have been dating this guy for 7 years. We moved abroad two years ago. Things weren't perfect from the beginning, and there were a lot of little red flags that we both ignored. At the end of last year, I realized my now ex was always texting this (girl) friend of his. It didn't bother me at first because I always trusted him and I knew her and liked her (they were old friends from high school). But then I started noticing the kissing emojis and him texting her late at night... I lost it. This is where I should have ended it right there and then, of course. But no.

I told him I would like him to text her less because it bothered me. He said he didn't understand why but if it made me uncomfortable he would. Couple months in I start noticing him being even more distant and irritable than before (he'd been this way for a few years but I thought it was just us going into that comfortable phase of any relationship). I didn't feel like he was as invested in the relationship anymore but was too scared to do something about it. I wrongfully assumed if I didn't say anything, it would go away.

Beginning of this year, I went snooping on his phone (something I NEVER thought I would do). Found out very risqué conversations with her from well over a year, in which he confided in her about the problems in our relationship. (I confronted him several times about this and he admitted he should have talked to me instead so we could work it out - yet never did!) They also discussed leaving their own relationships to get together instead, but my ex apparently kept blowing her off and saying he liked me and couldn't do it. (Yes, she had a boyfriend too - long distance). This is when the madness started: I was always checking up on him, looking over his shoulder, acting crazy.

Fast forward to Valentine's Day. I planned a day out of town for us. You know, the old demented reasoning of ""I will save this relationship"". Booked one of his favorite places. He was weird the entire train ride there, and when our connection was delayed due to technical problems, he even suggested going home. I told him we wouldn't go home, I'd spent money on this and wanted us to have a good time. I was trying super hard to be positive and to think this was going to be a nice day. How wrong I was. He was distant all day, barely talked to me, looked like he'd rather not be there.

The rockbottom moment hapened when we went ice skating (my idea). He practically forced me to skate when I told him I'd rather not because I was scared I would fall. Which I did, twice, and he was annoyed both times. The rink supervisor came to check up on me, asking me if I was okay, whereas my own boyfriend just told me to get up and keep trying (I just wasn't trying! I wasn't listening to him! I never listened!). I was about to cry, so I told him I'd go sit down and watch instead. But eventually I left the place altogether to go take a long walk and didn't tell him. When he was done skating, he texted me asking where I was and when we met up. He was visibly angry and we fought. He was genuinely upset I'd left him alone instead of keeping him company! I confronted him later on and told him how upset I was that he'd acted that way with me, and that I had actually gotten hurt when I fell (my shoulder popped on impact and I was sore all day). He brushed it off and said he didn't think I'd been hurt. I told him the point was he didn't even ask! At this point I was crying my eyes out in the middle of Starbucks on Valentine's Day, and thinking ""the way he's looking at me, it's like he wants to break up right here, right now."" So in the end, I just changed the subject and we went home.

A couple days later, I kind of had a mental breakdown. I'd been under so much stress, which caused me to stop eating, so I fainted in the bathroom one night. I was basically having a major panic attack. We only have four friends (2 couples) here and my ex called them immediately when he found me. They called an ambulance and we went to the hospital. I kept fainting throughout and after being through a couple blood tests, etc, they didn't find anything wrong with me. I had a nurse come talk to me while resting in the room with an IV, and ask me a few questions (probably to rule out any sort of psychological issue). When he asked me if there were problems at home, I had to lie to this man's face. I think they also thought I had some sort of eating disorder because of the not eating part.

All my friends and ex had stayed and we all left together. Back home, I went to sleep in the guest bedroom. When I woke up 5h later, all came crashing down at once and I started to cry and sob really loudly. My ex barges in all scared, and I tell him I want him out of my life. He takes my hand and asks me for another chance. I'm bawling at this point, he's the only person available to comfort me, even if he's the perpetrator. I have no one else, no place to go. Everything feels bleak, I feel absolutely lost. So I tell him to leave me alone and he does. Later, when he comes back I tell him I'll give it another shot (WHY), but he can no longer be friends with her or talk to her ever. He has the GALL to say he needs to consider it first, she's an old friend, etc etc. By this point, I am pretty much dead inside.

I go to a friend's house for the day and leave him alone to think and cut her off. A couple hours in, he texts me saying he couldn't do it. He'll do anything (couple's therapy, talk to her less, etc) but he can't cut her off completely. He insists there was nothing between them, but he knows he messed up. I ignore all his messages, which kept coming after that. I don't even open them. After a while, my friend's boyfriend tells me my ex texted him to tell me ""it was done"". I don't even say anything and keep watching a movie with my friend. I come back home already nighttime. He's awake, and frazzled and wants to talk. I tell him ""in the morning"" and go to the guest bedroom again.

We kind of made up after that (my memory is somewhat blurry as to what happened exactly) but I guess I knew deep down it was over. I was cheated on, gaslighted, treated like crap, and substituted for another woman. Yet I'd endured it. I was disgusted with myself. It was just a matter of time until something happened again. I couldn't even look at him. I was so angry and felt empty. But mostly, I felt ashamed of ever consenting to being treated like this.

The first few weeks consist of walking on eggshells around each other. We talk about what happened and our feelings a lot. I always have this feeling deep in my gut that something's not right.

Long story short, at the beginning of this month he turns to me out of the blue and says he thinks we should break up. I'd been entertaining the idea myself, but for some reason I'm shocked to hear it. HE wants to break up with ME? I ask him several questions. One of them, if he stills loves me. He says he cares about me but sees me as a roommate, and has for the past few months. Has also felt like this for a long time (when asked exactly when, can't specify). I lose it, get angry, tell him ""if you want to break up, well then we break up"". I start to make arrangements around the house. He keeps following me and asking if I need help. I tell him I don't need any help. What about laundry? ""You do yours, I do mine."" What about food? ""You do yours, I do mine."" What about... And so on. Way to show concern by being practical. I try to shut him off. I'm still crying my eyes out but set on ignoring him. My world is shattered as I take stuff off from the living room back to the guest bedroom, as I split everything into two piles. After an hour or so, I call my mom and tell her the news.

From this point on, he's the most caring and understandable person ever. For the next week or so he's always checking up on me. Sending me cute/funny memes. I'm ignoring him most of the time. Won't go into the living room or kitchen if he's there. I rarely leave my new bedroom if I can help it, and I'm crying most of the time. He wants to chat and I shoot him down. He's always letting me know when he leaves a room (so I can go in), when he needs to leave the house, if I need anything from the groceries, and always knocks. He asks me if I want to watch a movie and he's made popcorn. I say ""that's not a good idea"". Finally, I decide to have a talk in which I tell him I won't be his emotional crutch and we're not friends, so why is he expecting to hang out as if nothing happened? I try to make it clear we're done. He says he's just trying to be as considerate as possible and make things easy for me. He doesn't hate me (WOW) and will stay with me as long as it takes until I find a new place (though he's already actively looking). This makes me feel even worse; like I owe him something, like I still rely on him. I tell him we're just two people living together and being civil. He can do whatever he wants. He doesn't seem to quite get it, but he turns it down a notch.

He's still cooking for both of us and I do the dishes. He occasionally sends me house ads he finds and tells me he went to see this or that house that day. Everything feels surreal because he clearly is having a grand time being out of the relationship and I'm falling to pieces in front of him, my dignity being torn to shreds the longer I stay. But we still have two months until our lease is up and even though I can move to a friend's house, I'd still have to pay rent do I decide to suck it up for a while longer (it's not like I haven't done so for the past half a year, anyway).

The worst thing about this isn't the fact that we broke up. I find that a blessing and wish we'd done it sooner. This man is clearly one of the worst things to have ever happened to me and my self-esteem and I wish I'd never see him again. I would never, in a million years, think I would one day allow someone to treat me like this. I was the kind of person who would see other people going through cheating, and forgiving their partners, and think to myself ""I would never."" Karma makes you humble, I guess. The fact that I can barely afford living by myself is taking a big toll on my stress and confidence levels. I worry I'll lose my job because I've been on furlough since April and it won't last forever. I worry no agency will give me a house, and if they do I worry I'll run out of money halfway through. I don't want to share a house because of the whole Covid issue, but I'm afraid I'll have to. I worry I'll have to go back home - it's humiliating and degrading and I have way less job opportunities there (that's why we moved in the first place). My mom is ill (Parkinson's, though stable) so I worry about her constantly and wonder if this is a sign for me to go and be with her and help my stepdad take care of her. I feel ugly and unfit because I endured various comments on my ex's part about my appearance throughout the last year or so (I have no words) which makes me super nervous to go out, say even go on interviews. I'm just so helpless and confused at this point, I have no idea what I'm going to do. I don't even know how I should act around my ex. Obviously, cut him off completely would be ideal. But it's impossible while we're living together... I don't want to start a war zone, but I absolutely refuse to be nice and cool to a person who's made me go through this!!

**TL;DR:**

Ladies, never ever consider being in a position where you depend financially or emotionally on another person. After my ex broke up with me while we're living overseas, I only have a couple shared friends (and a few back home who I can only rely on virtually), who have helped but obviously can't take sides. I don't have a stable job to support me or anything close to my previous lifestyle. I have to leave my house and still don't know where I'm going, exactly. I have no family members to rely on for anything (quite the opposite, I'm their lifeboat) and going back home means throwing away everything I've worked so hard for. My self-esteem and confidence have never been lower. I'm basically on my own. And I let it happen because I trusted someone I shouldn't have trusted.

Learn from my mistakes and always be independent first, then allow someone to be in your life if you wish. But never fall into the trap of having them be your whole life or control any aspect of it. So that if the time ever comes when you or they make the decision to leave, you have something to hold on to (especially your dignity). Never allow someone to treat you remotely close to the way I was treated. I never loved myself enough and that's why I allowed it to go on as long as it did. Fortunately, I found this forum and am hoping it will help me become someone I'm proud of.

My question is how I can avoid that again? Of course, most of the things from the handbook are incredibly helpful. But some stuff I feel aren’t applicable at my age. For example, most people my age doesn’t own a car or have their own place. 

Do you think that there are indicators I can replace these things with/some that are specific to my age?",85529,How do I vet effectively at 19?,0,,,

Idk if any other FDSers can relate but when I am in a long term relationship my parents can get overly optimistic and excited about our potential future. Even if the relationship seems ""perfect"" at the time, my family is willing to make him a part of our family, call him their future son-in-law and be given presents, money and support. It's part of their cultural value system because the only reason you would be in a long term relationship is because you are serious about a future and want to get married eventually.

Due to my previous low self-esteem, I was desperate to have a boyfriend. I was willing to make excuses and change my values to match his because in my mind who else would want to be with me? Well, turns out by not asking myself what I want in a relationship I was dating men who considered me a ""fun"" person to be around, but didn't see a future with me (even if we were together for years). With each ending of a relationship, my family was devastated because of how much time and energy they invested into us.

Today I discussed with my parents that the next time I am dating someone, I am going to be a lot more strict on when to introduce him to them. Until he is married to me, he is not a part of this family and he is NOT your son. Even if he seems ""better"" than the previous relationships, you never know when shit can hit the fan.

As a young girl I was teased and picked over and overlooked a lot in my life. In high school I had a crush on a guy and he told me “I like you so much, this sucks. You’re perfect but you’re just black.” 🙃 I think a lot of my self worth issues and desperation comes from that. 

After I graduated high school I was desperate for a relationship. I am 23 now so from 18-23 I’ve had 5 run-ins with men that have been nothing but complete disasters. From believing that my professor would leave his girlfriend of 3 years for me, to being used as a rebound and dumped as soon as the guy wanted to move into his exes new apartment, to just being repeatedly lied to and iced out by emotionally distant men. I am just broken and tired. I am not proud... I’ve even allowed myself to become the other woman at times because I was so desperate to hear how I was “I am so much more understanding than other girls” and “so much better than her” I feel so gross and pathetic. 

I’ve been lurking here for the past week or so. I really want to just forget about relationships and what men think of me, but whenever I think about just focusing on myself and giving up my quest to find someone to love me I feel panicked and scared.

New sub here. I wanna say, first of all, I am so happy I found FDS. Thank you to everyone who makes this such a wonderful safe space.

I (23f) recently moved to Europe from the US to study. I grew up in a conservative household and I hadn’t dated that much, really. I decided to have fun and branch out and date during my year abroad. I was still a virgin and I always had it in my mind that I wanted my first time to be with someone I was in a relationship with. I went out with quite a few people, just dinner, etc. Then I met him. We went out for a few weeks, doing activities together, enjoying mutual interests, and that sort of thing. I had told him before I was a virgin and he never once suggested anything or made a move on me in any way. One evening, we were out together drinking and he kissed me. He said he’d wanted to do that for a long time but didn’t know if I liked him in that way. I told him I did. Nothing sexual happened that evening as he said he didn’t want me to make any sort of decision I may regret later, and the next day we met again and I told him I enjoyed the evening before and he said he did too. He asked if I’d like to come to his place for dinner some evening soon (I’d been there before but the context wasn’t like this), and I asked what might happen I did that. He said “whatever you want to have happen. I don’t want to pressure you to do anything.” I told him I’d like to have sex with him, but I’d really like to be able to consider him my boyfriend if I did. He seemed hesitant at first, “you’ll only be here for a year,” but he said he’d like to be my boyfriend. So some time later, I went to his apartment for dinner (he cooks very well) and we started making out and made our way to his room. He had candles lit and it was such a wonderful experience. I felt so cared for. He used a condom and did everything he was supposed to. He cuddled me after and was just so caring. Flash forward to a few weeks later. We were doing things together all the time, hanging out, going places, cooking dinner together, talking, taking long walks (he always wants to hold hands), having sex, just doing all kinds of couple stuff. One evening we were laying in bed at my place and he asked if I was falling in love with him (he’s very blunt sometimes because he’s actually on the autism spectrum), the question caught me off-guard but I was honest. I told him I was. Then he started saying how he didn’t expect me to catch feelings and he didn’t want anything serious and he just wants to be FWB. He said we should just end it now since I feel this way. I felt so disgusted. How could I have misread everything??? He was always incredibly attentive and sweet and into me. Making plans for us on the weekends, putting in effort, etc. I am ashamed to say I agreed to be just FWB because I didn’t want to lose him completely. We see each other now about twice a week. It’s so strange because he acts like he always has— like a boyfriend. Doing things like holding my hand, being sweet, kissing my forehead, bringing me gifts, having great sex with me (always making sure I’ve finished before he does), doing things with me besides sex, always paying when we go places, showing great interest in my life and future. He even keeps up with my family, asking about my sisters, etc. He’s not seeing anyone else or talking with anyone else, he’s told me so. He’ll let me use his phone sometimes and I’ve never seen any evidence to make me not believe him. We agreed to be exclusive FWB until the summer is over. I’m really in love with him and I’m not sure what to do. Should I end this? Am I being used and I don’t see it? Is there something I’m missing here? Is he a LVM? He’s also a student and physically stunning, 6’4 and dark. I don’t know why he doesn’t want to have a relationship. Is there something I’m doing wrong? I’ve thought maybe it’s because he was hurt in the past? I really don’t know. I’d love to hear some advice. I feel really foolish for being so confused. Thank you so much if you read all of this.",85514,Need advice please :(,0,,,

A bit of a newbie here and I love what I've stumbled upon. I've been reading the handbook and digesting all of the valuable posts in this subreddit and it has really opened my eyes up to the error of my ways! Thank you all for your contributions and the supportive atmosphere.

We talk a lot about how to navigate the dating world but I'd also like to ask how best to navigate male friendships in life. As we all know (or at least we've been led to believe), sometimes the best relationships can potentially come from long term friendships where both of you have gotten to know each other without the pressure of dating or sex. Now, one problem I admit I have is that I'm an initiator: I organise large events for a living and it requires a specific kind of...strong personality where, because you understand the logistics and the organisation required better than other people, you take the lead and just get shit done. I'm very successful in my role, but I understand that this kind of 'go get em' attitude may not always be the best when it comes to dating or even friendships. For example, 9 times out of 10, I always initiate catch-ups and hangouts, even with my female friends. They're always up for it and (from what I can see) they enjoy hanging out with me and are always enthusiastic about it but it does get a bit laborious that I always have to initiate. Same thing with male friends, though funnily enough the effort there feels a bit more balanced with male friends reaching out to me more frequently than female friends. 

I suppose what I want to ask is this - do I need to learn to turn off this part of my personality when hanging out with friends, especially new male friends who may have the potential to be HVM, but who I only know as acquaintances through mutual friends? I.e.  when there may be interest but it may be too awkward for him to approach due to not knowing the lay of the land/ the social dynamics involved within our mutual friendships/ the possibility of making a group hangout awkward if he shoots his shot by misreading the situation? How much initiation is acceptable from me, as a woman, in friendship circles, to suggest hangouts and meet ups (in groups or even individually) while at the same time allowing plausible deniability to maintain my neutrality and give him an 'in' to approach me? I guess I want to know how to optimise my chances/ get to know potentially HVM through taking the initiative without mucking up the line between just being friendly vs. seeming desperate.

As I've been reflecting, I've found a lot of the principles here can be applied to not just romantic relationships but friendships and work relationships as well, and have helped me to be aware of 'pick me' behaviours and be more aware of healthy boundaries. It's a life style change right?  So ladies, please tell me, do I need to accept being the passive party across the board in all my relationships (which I hate) and learn to let people initiate/ come to me, or is there a degree of flexibility in friendships, acknowledging that if a man makes a move, I need to sit back and let him take the lead?",85515,Need advice on changing my mindset,0,,,

I got pregnant, found out and had an abortion all in the month of January. 

I was having sex with someone I met on tinder. I’ve been a cool girl pick me for my entire life. I’ve come to realize I learned this behavior from an emotionally and verbally abusive “dad” aka LVM. I started dating vs just hooking up with guys. This was an improvement, however it was clearly still about sex. I found FDS around the time I met him in October last year. So, I had those pick me thoughts, while reading this sub trying to figure out if he was worth dating. 

He wasn’t. But I didn’t let that stop me from getting my hopes up, creating this fantasy in my head that it was something more. The night I got pregnant a last minute booty call text at 11pm, after no response from him for a week. “My bAd I mIssEd yOur tExt”. Two weeks later I realize my period is late. Do the math &amp; take a test... + [pregnant]. I told him in person that I was pregnant, I had scheduled an abortion and wanted him to know. He immediately offered to take. We both talked about our feelings. He took me, offered for me to stay the night while the pills worked. We binge watched Netflix, he ordered food. It was nice to feel supported and be away from my 3 living children. 

But I noticed another girls things. A Bobby pin on the carpet in the living room, a pink toothbrush in addition to his and travel contact lense solution (he does not wear them). I spent the later part of the night dealing with the physical abortion while grieving the termination, all while being upset about the things I found. When I went home the next morning I cried for a majority of the next week. I struggled so much with this choice and still am processing. I can’t stop thinking about what I gave up that day. The abortion was 100% my choice, but it’s not one I could ever do again. 

A lot has happened since Jan. I have not seen him again. For the first month I checked every notification hoping it was him. As the days went on it I knew deep down what I was doing but couldn’t give up the hope. Then COVID hit and everything shut down. It allowed me to give up the hope and not feel so bad about the situation. Instead of obsessing over when I might see him again, hear from him etc I was able to rationally think. This is where my dad comes into play. I was always waiting on him to finally show up for a visit. A birthday party. I wanted him so desperately in my life. Waiting on the door step wondering if my dad was going to show up to my birthday party (he didn’t) is now me as an adult checking my phone constantly for a text from a LVM. 

All this to finally had enough of the LVMs. I wasted my early 20’s with a LVM, I’ve given my late 20’s to better than but still LVM. I’m not joining OLD again for the foreseeable future. The reality is I still need a lot of work in the self care/love department and that is actually deserving of my time. Life slowing down, spending much more time with my kids has really showed me what I need to focus on more. 

On a final note, wait to see sex. I scoffed at this rule at first. None of the sex was worth it in the end.",85496,How lockdown helped me break the cycle of Pick Me behavior,0,,,

Now that we’re married he has completely changed. He is with friends in all his free hours- doing nothing- they sit and watch tv all night. Any time he spends at home is mostly on his phone or sleeping. There’s no time for me

I cook and clean, he has never offered help nor has he ever thanked me or acknowledged anything.

He doesn’t make a lot of money so I’ve been doing all the grocery shopping. 
He hasn’t given me a single thing since we got married. We don’t go out or do anything together. Before marriage we would regularly go out on dates and weekends away.

When I go away to friends, he doesn’t call or message. He has stopped putting an effort in to foreplay. He is very well mannered and all and there is no abuse as such. But there’s no appreciation, no acknowledgement 

He just takes and takes and takes. I’ve told him I need more time and attention from him- he’s fine one day and then back to his old tricks. Yesterday, I was really hurt because he told me to call him on Snapchat and not on his phone line because then it will be busy for other important calls. I haven’t spoken to him since then.

So my boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me last year because he said he was depressed and suicidal and had to ""work on himself"" or whatever. Meanwhile we kept having sex and I kept wondering why everything seemed odd. My gut feeling kept telling me, but I was in a really horrible place at the time and didn't have the self worth to just fucking leave him. He kept using depression as a tactic to keep me around, since he knew that I was extremely sensitive to mental health issues. After a period of time he started acting depressed, and then he shut me off. Mind you, I almost left my family for this guy. I kept giving and giving, both material, physical, mental and emotional things for him because I legitimately loved him, and kept thinking that if I stayed around long enough, he would change. Not for me, but for himself. But the only thing that was stagnant was the sex. Then after the breakup he told me that he will never ever date again, I was his last. For one whole year I tried to figure out what the hell was going on, if there's something wrong with me, or if he's a piece of shit, and I kept bouncing back and forth between these thoughts. Until one year later, ie 3 days ago I found out about him- he got a new girlfriend, or is in the process of it. She had commented something sexual under his picture, and it was so clear that they had sexted before. After asking around a few friends, they finally told me the truth that he's been talking to the girl since 2.5 months. They also told me that he used me only for sex, and then fucking got bored. Lied to me about his mental health issues and therapy, and lied to his friends about what exactly happened during the breakup. So you tell me, a dude that pretends to be SO in love that he takes care of me in the beginning, acts like a husband, does everything in his power to protect me and care for me (all of this while having sex obviously), and then lies and treats me like shit to get out of the relationship, plays the victim card, tells me that he felt used after having sex with me, and then ends up finding a girl over the internet that he's talking sexual with and not even 3 full months are gone, what the fuck does this say? I don't think he's even told her about my side, which means he's building another relationship completely on lies. In fact he doesn't even know what happened on my side, the panic attacks and nightmares I've experienced. Anyway, I've lost all respect for him and I have learned some MAJOR stuff to get my self respect back. I'm going to put it down here for everyone. I'm not a professional in this, but this is what's working for me and hopefully, it will work for you too. 

Number 1: Do not fucking open tinder. 
I repeat, DO NOT open tinder. Or any of those dating apps. Some friends give the worst advice at this point and ask you to get into a rebound, but don't do it. It's the shortcut method which is bound to fail. You're going to get caught in another cycle of a situationship when you're already emotionally wrecked. And trust me, 90% of the guys on tinder ONLY want sex, and nothing more. You have to stay away from that cesspool and only concentrate on yourself at this point, because you were not a cheap product of the universe. You hold a lot of value which isn't supposed to be squandered like that. Luckily I got banned from tinder for some reason, and I just stopped using it. It kept pulling me into that wild circle of trying to date guys who only were in it for the sex. Get away from that shit.

Number 2: Always trust your gut feeling.
For the ones who have trouble differentiating between an insecurity and a gut feeling- an insecurity mainly makes you question your own character, or a trait, or a body part, basically it makes you question you, whereas a gut feeling makes you question the other person. I'm not asking you to be extremely critical either, your gut feeling will come from your body, it will make you repel from the situation in your mind. Do not ignore that gut feeling. Sometimes in the flow of the moment, things can get really exciting and you might wanna shrug that feeling off, but don't. ALWAYS pay attention to it, because going against it will definitely make you hurt. I had a horrible gut feeling about my ex, but I kept going anyway because I had no self worth.  

Number 3: Know your value and then add tax.
Just know that you are not expensive, but they can't afford you. There's a reason why Prada, Gucci, Chanel, Dior, etc. have such a high value. It's not for everyone. That quality is luxury and you have to be that quality. In fact, you are that quality. You need to realise it and work on it. There are people who could walk in your Prada store, look around and say ""I'm just looking around"" but deep inside they know that they cannot afford anything that's in there. Do not sell your product to such people. Let them walk out. The ones who can afford you, be it love or friendship, will afford you. The others can stay as ""window shoppers"". The ones who say that ""I'm not good enough for you"". They're right, they're not good enough. Now you walk away. My ex used to say that to me all the time and then be depressed, and my gut told me that it's a huge red flag, and it was. Wish I had walked away.

Number 4: Do something.
Anything. Invest your time in building yourself, bit by bit. Start doing things that help you keep busy. No matter how hard that sounds and no matter how broken you feel, only progress in a certain aspect is going to help you heal bit by bit, and there's no shortcut around it. You have to feel good about yourself, and that feeling comes by when you achieve something. The smallest of progress is going to change things for you. And what we call as ""hobbies"" at this point become life savers. Follow them and rip them to shreds, do something you love. Or find something you love. Remember that you will only attract guys that don't work on themselves to nurture their soul, if you don't find that trait worthy. Find worth in the doing the simplest things, and make that a part of your standards. 

Number 5: Keep talking about it. 
Everyone's got a way of coping with this, but you've to find friends that are ready to listen at most of the times. Who will give you their honest opinion to help you out of it. There will be friends who will make you feel like shit instead of doing any better, and I recommend you stay away from them. Talk to these problems to the friends that will legitimately understand your situation and help you out of it. Friends like that can be life savers and they will help you vent out the terrible feelings whole giving you rational advice every now and then. How to differentiate between a good friend and a bad friend? Your gut feeling will tell you. A bad friend will definitely won't take your problems that seriously, or stick around only when they want to have fun. A good friend however will stick with you through thick and thin, and especially during the dark times. The others will look sweet but give you cavities.

I have a lot more to say, if you like this so far and want to know more, or if this helped you even a little bit, I can make a part 2 of it with more information. 
As a final bit of advice, I want you to know that it's not your fault. The guy that did you wrong, it's on him. If there's anything such as karma, it will get them. If not, that's not our problem anymore. You only and only look out for yourself now. Find out who you are, set a standard for yourself and do not look back. Let it go, you're so much better without that garbage.",85493,A Big Sister Guide.,1,,,

One thing I haven't spotted while scrolling through this sub is looking at the way a man talks about your friends.

This was a recurring fight throughout my relationship that I eventually just gave up on.

He'd say things about my best friend being too promiscuous and etc but pad that with compliments about her personality. He'd constantly call some of my friends fat and literally only stopped after 2 YEARS of me asking him to please stop because it makes me feel bad when he says shit about them when they're not around. He never insulted them to their face, because they would've retaliated.

I'm ashamed I allowed it. My friends deserve better than that. And though I've always tried to be a good friend in terms of lending emotional support and helping them when they need it, it's a blight that I'm ashamed of. I'll never ever allow a man to talk badly about the women in my life again.

Warning: sexual violence

I'm bisexual and I've been sexually active, primarily with men, for the better part of a decade. I've dabbled in kink just a little for most of that time, and I've been satisfied with that level of involvement for the entirety of that time.

But I've lately started to notice that I dread having sex with men. No matter how kind and considerate they are outside of the bedroom, as soon as they get me naked, they push my boundaries, ignore me when I say no, and take it as a joke if I try to push back. 

I've been sleeping with a particular guy for maybe four or five years now. The only times he's tried to get me off, he stopped and got offended when I tried to show him how I like it, or if I told him he was hurting me. But the last time I slept with him, he told me that he wanted to try introducing a little painplay, so we sat down and wrote down what I was and wasn't okay with, especially surrounding how much force he could use and where he could strike me. We negotiated it and discussed it and put it down on paper. 

As soon as he had me gagged, he completely disregarded those boundaries. The only reason I walked out of there whole and relatively unharmed is that I slipped out of my handcuffs and fought back. I have huge bruises and breaks in my skin all over my back and shoulders and thighs where he *chewed* on me.

That was the last time I had sex with a man, and honestly is probably the last time I ever will. I'm perfectly capable of sustaining healthy and satisfying romantic or platonic relationships with men. But I don't like feeling like a tool they're using to get off. I don't like feeling like what I want or need in bed is irrelevant. I strongly dislike being patronized to regarding my own sexual preferences. I don't like that even men I trust can turn predatory toward me just because I'm naked.

I've had very few positive sexual experiences with men, and they've gotten more violent as I've inched closer to my late twenties. For the last six months or so, every sexual encounter I've had has left me with significant genital bruising and tearing, even when I use lube. And the few positive experiences I've had don't outweigh the fear of being harmed again, simply because for everyone one time someone has been gentle or followed the rules, another dozen have tried to push me. And oftentimes, someone who's gentle one time can make an abrupt about-face later on, when I trust them more. It sucks. I already feel like I have less control of any given situation than a man does, and it's terrifying to have that confirmed over and over and over.

TL;DR I kept sleeping with men in hopes of finding some kind of mutually pleasurable arrangement for almost ten years now. I'm going to stop because I feel like it's putting me at greater risk for personal harm than i can justify.

And my apologies if I'm unclear in parts. English is my second language.",86514,"Woman agrees to BDSM and...surprise, suprise, she gets abused.",0,,,

Long time lurker. Wanted to recommend a podcast- Scene On Radio, season 3. It’s about the history of misogyny. I sent this to ALL my friends and wanted to share with y’all...because this subreddit feels like a gathering of friends, too. Y’all have saved me so many times. 

Anyway- about scene on- I found this podcast because I was seeking to understand more about the lives and burdens of POC in this country. I am white and realized I am completely ignorant to the struggles faced by POC, and especially WOC. I listened to Season 2 (Seeing White) and learned a lot, cried a lot, and definitely felt like this podcast was a good resource for everyone. Then I noticed season 3...on misogyny. 

Each episode is 30-60 minutes and there is some eye-rolling (the presenter/host is a man) but also some incredible insights on the history of patriarchy. They dismantle some myths that even I believed (the hunter vs gatherer myth, etc.) Last night I hit episode 7 and y’all. I cried my fucking eyes out. Trigger warning- this episode discusses sexual assault! But the way they lay out the underlying assumptions in the way female victims are treated is just...incredible. It hurt but my eyes needed to be opened. Strongly recommend. We have to know what we are fighting against in order to change it. 

I am so proud of all of y’all and love being a part of this community!! Thanks to everyone who shares, comments, makes me laugh, makes me think, and just in general supports and encourages other women. I love to see it!!!!",86470,Podcast on misogyny,0,,,

Hi Ladies - !

We are still getting requests to sign up for,TheRealFemaleDatingStrategy.com, and we are overwhelmed by the response - thank you!!

If you have not yet done so, please read this post about our website launch first.

We had to launch the website sooner than expected, so changes are still rapidly being made; you may see things be switched around on a daily basis. You also may see some popular posts be deleted from Reddit and moved to the Website. This is to protect our content from deletion by Reddit and piracy.

Now that we've had some time to streamline the process, we are making a few changes:

SIGN UP:

We are only accepting 8 digit code requests through the website. If you PM me or any of the mods on Reddit, Instagram or Twitter we will be redirecting you to the website. This helps us keep track of all the requests in one place. Click here to request an 8 digit code.

Use Instagram or Twitter for an expedited approval process. Our reddit requests are backlogged and many of you are far too new for us to verify your account on the website. For expedited sign up, please apply with your instagram or twitter accounts.

Please make sure you can receive DMs on your platform of choice. There were some people we tried to send codes to who had their Direct Messages disabled, so we had to pass. If you are unsure, please DM the official FDS twitter or instagram accounts so we can respond.

Please be patient! Due to demand, We are on about a 5 day lag on sending out 8 digit codes. If you are not an existing sub member or someone we can easily identify as female from your social media, OR we can't reach you, you will likely be passed over for someone else in the queue.

If you do not sign up within 60 days of receiving your code, you will be bumped from the approval queue completely and will have to start over. We have some members who we've sent codes to who as of yet have yet to create an account. Please do so ASAP!

Our website is now available via the Wix app! It can be dowloaded for iPhone and Android! Use the code ""WZBOVG"" to join the app page AFTER you have requested and received your 8 digit code. If you join through the app without the 8 digit code, it will be rejected. 

FORUM:

Once you are approved, please log in and say hello in the Forum! We just want to make sure it is working for everyone. All new members are restricted to one post per day for their first week of membership to make moderation easier for us while we get the website off the ground.

The Strategy subforums and Sex subforum on the website are for members only - this is to protect the privacy of our members who want to ask sensitive questions.

If you are not logged in as a member, you can read the posts in most of the subforums, but you cannot comment. You will not be able to read posts in the Strategy or Sex Forum at all.

SOCIAL MEDIA:

We've archived our Facebook page due to security concerns (facebook LEACHES data), but we have just launched a new Pinterest and Tumblr!

Here are links to all our social media accounts if you wish to follow us!

We are still getting requests to sign up for,[TheRealFemaleDatingStrategy.com](https://www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com/), and we are overwhelmed by the response - thank you!!

If you have not yet done so, [please read this post about our website launch first.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/hiha1o/its_here_weve_launched/)

We had to launch the website sooner than expected, so changes are still rapidly being made; you may see things be switched around on a daily basis. You also may see some popular posts be deleted from Reddit and moved to the Website. This is to protect our content from deletion by Reddit and piracy.

Now that we've had some time to streamline the process, we are making a few changes:

**SIGN UP:**

1. **We are only accepting 8 digit code requests through the website.** If you PM me or any of the mods on Reddit, Instagram or Twitter we will be redirecting you to the website. This helps us keep track of all the requests in one place. [Click here to request an 8 digit code.](https://www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com/8-digit-code)
2. **Use Instagram or Twitter for an expedited approval process.** Our reddit requests are backlogged and many of you are far too new for us to verify your account on the website. For expedited sign up, please apply with your instagram or twitter accounts.
3. **Please make sure you can receive DMs on your platform of choice.** There were some people we tried to send codes to who had their Direct Messages disabled, so we had to pass. If you are unsure, please DM the official FDS twitter or instagram accounts so we can respond.
4. **Please be patient! Due to demand, We are on about a 5 day lag on sending out 8 digit codes.** If you are not an existing sub member or someone we can easily identify as female from your social media, OR we can't reach you, you will likely be passed over for someone else in the queue.
5. **If you do not sign up within 60 days of receiving your code, you will be bumped from the approval queue completely and will have to start over.** We have some members who we've sent codes to who as of yet have yet to create an account. Please do so ASAP!
6. **Our website is now available via the Wix app!**  It can be dowloaded for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wix-app-website-builder/id1099748482) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wix.android&amp;hl=en_US)! Use the code ""WZBOVG"" to join the app page **AFTER** you have requested and received your 8 digit code.  If you join through the app without the 8 digit code, it will be rejected. 

**FORUM:**

1. **Once you are approved, please log in** [**and say hello in the Forum!**](https://www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com/forum) We just want to make sure it is working for everyone. All new members are restricted to one post per day for their first week of membership to make moderation easier for us while we get the website off the ground.
2. **The Strategy subforums and Sex subforum on the website are for members only** \- this is to protect the privacy of our members who want to ask sensitive questions.
3. **If you are not logged in as a member, you can read the posts in most of the subforums, but you cannot comment.** You will not be able to read posts in the Strategy or Sex Forum at all.

**SOCIAL MEDIA:**

We've archived our Facebook page due to security concerns (facebook LEACHES data), but we have just launched a new **Pinterest** and **Tumblr**!

Here are links to all our social media accounts if you wish to follow us!

We've been dating a little over a month. He's been open about his grief with me, I've been as supportive as I can without overstepping. I obviously haven't met any of his family members yet. I'm the type of person to send flowers. The obituary doesn't request donations in lieu of flowers. But sending them to the funeral seems like it is a bit too much somehow? Is it too soon to do this because I don't know the family? Should I just send them to him? I'm definitely overthinking this. But I also had a super shitty ex that made the last two family losses I experienced even worse than they needed to be. I believe in the importance of these kinds of gestures for sympathy and for other major life events. It's going well with him and I want him to know that I care.

I am fast to act the moment I see something that doesn’t sit right. I don’t give men I date the benefit of the doubt or opportunity to play me.

Story:

I was seeing a man that seemed HV spent time with me, took me to upscale restaurants and expressed romantic gestures such as “being on cloud 9 with me”. He only texted me every 2-3 days. I feel that is part of his game to keep me at a distance or for me to chase. Which I will never ever do. 

This past week he told me his  childhood friend was in town and won’t be able to see me. Fine and then Proceeded to invite me to the beach with him. But said no because, I am not a 3rd wheel and a last minute option. Then Sunday came around and he posted a story on IG of a table with a bunch of drinking glasses and one had lipstick. Then I noticed he started following  new women. So I went to one of the women’s profile and she had a story she was at this lounge/restaurant too. It is too much of a coincidence. So I decided to unfollow him and remove from my IG and not answer his last text where he claims he is hanging out with friends having dinner and drinks. Mind you he left out he was with this woman and her friend. The fact that he picked her to spend time with her rather than me and lie that he is with his friend is disrespectful to me even if we are just dating.

My best friend says I should just see what happens but I don’t want to give this person the chance to hurt me

So I decided to hit him to the curb. I just don’t have time for games and prefer my peace of mind than be thinking about a LVM that is playing games and probably lying to me about being with his “friends”.

Was this aggressive on my end or did I dodge a bullet? 

Thank you!",86321,I kicked someone I was dating to the curb due to his inconsistent behavior and game playing,0,,,

I had a bunch of kids with me, and I told them to wait while I make sure it’s okay if we wander around, as they were starting to clean up. 

This man (can’t call him a gentleman), walked up to me, looked me up and down, and said “wow, you’re beautiful”. I proceeded with my question, and then he said something sexual which I don’t recall, to which I acted horrified and said, I am a LADY. THEN he reaches out and TOUCHES MY ARM, and immediately steps back and says “I don’t mean to touch you, but blah blah, words I can’t remember.” My age starts with a 4, if that even matters. 

I wish I could say I said something biting and witty, but I didn’t. I was too shocked at being accosted at a freaking senior rummage sale.

I know we’ve all had our fair share of bad OLD experiences but I thought I’d share a good one from one of my girlfriends. It was kind of sad how excited the rest of my girlfriends were over it (the bar is on the floor). Anyway, said girlfriend just went on a first date and her date wanted to take her to this trendy Italian restaurant. However, they don’t take reservations and once they showed up the wait was going to be over 1.5 hrs. Instead of waiting, he actually made a BACK UP RESERVATION just in case at an upscale sushi place nearby! Now this doesn’t necessarily mean he is a HVM (too soon to tell), but to me it’s a HV quality/green flag. It literally does not take any effort to make reservations, if he can’t even do that that then don’t bother.

I have two 9 AM meetings a week with a male coworker on Wednesday/Thursday’s. We use the time as check-ins for the current projects we are producing and make sure everything is in order for publication. 
For the last 3 meetings he has been calling me on my personal phone number for the meetings, even though we have it scheduled on our calendars for a video chat. In addition I have mentioned several times to not only him but the rest of the team that if they need to call or text me to use my work phone (which the organization pays for). I even emailed everyone the number. Yesterday he called me once again on my personal phone line, which I have set to do not disturb while I am working from home. It helps with distraction. I called him back and told him to use my work phone to call me about work related things, or to call the work phone if he wants to switch from video calls.
So today for our Thursday meeting I jump on the video call and wait. A couple minutes go by and he hasn’t shown up. So I check my personal phone and low and behold ladies he’s called my personal line. For a split second I almost called him back on my personal line to bitch at him. But then I remembered that I’ve explicitly told him not 24 hours ago to call my work line. So I did not call back and I waited on the video chat. Seconds later he pops online.

Im here for all you ladies who say you have no friends.
Im here for you all you ladies who also only had their Ex or LVM/SO as their only “ nearby friend”

I moved to my city about three years ago.
I moved with my sister because I was having a hard time in my home city where the rent was super high I was working 12 hour days and I wasn’t getting any time with my kid. I lived there for about a year and I met this guy across the street at a gas station nearby super cute I saw him try talking to him About the video games I was interested in. He seemed interested but we didn’t really talk much because again I was just getting gas 
I go back and gas station, guy is gone. so for a whole year I don’t see this guy and don’t expect to see him ever again  

Next spring I just saw the one the guy that I wanted to be with so I asked my friends how I could get to know this guy and they said to write my number on a piece of paper so I did and wrote the girl with purple hair. 

He text back right away he said “should I wait” and I said “no”and I made the pick me she mistake of over texting over talking with him we got super close we start talking all the time when he was working and when I was working even though at first when I got interested in this I had my own hobbies and I have things I like to do and I wasn’t used to being on the phone all the time. 

I started to see him we had about three dates we are the third date we did it. sadly now that I read all these things I didn’t know. The 3 date thing though I have been in other relationships before. 

First red flag had hit about 3-4 months in.
Sadly I moved in with him because we were spending SO much time together.
There was this girl who came to the gas station with her dad the dad says “oh are you hitting on my daughter?” and then the daughter looks at the dad and says in a super over sexualized voice “no DADDY it’s the OTHER cute guy” when clearly there is about four people who worked at this gas station and he was the only young good looking guy

After this she proceeds to continue hitting on him even after he said I have a girlfriend and the father continues to come and ask her you still with the girlfriend( again we were on the phone alot nono) 

 After that she started hitting on him more after she found out that he said he had a girlfriend she was hitting on him like even more obviously like saying things like “is it hot outside or is it just me.” When she clearly knew we on the phone. 

This bothered me because he insisted on keeping me on the phone and if I didn’t want to be on the phone to hear women hit on him at his gas station he would get upset at me and tell me that it’s just my jealousy that’s stopping us from talking which may be true but I don’t wanna have to hear women hit on him at his job.

I stayed on the phone with him and soon became exactly what you ladies said became a chore to talk to me literally he would actually get so upset at me and hang up on me and be super mean to me and make it seem like I was a problem there is one time I even went up to his work with lunch and he took it and threw it over the construction worker fence when I travel to our to come see him on a bus with my daughter. 


Yeah I don’t know why I continued to try to make it work,
We argued about this and that was a problem but we continue to try soon after this I found him on my birthday while we were kissing made kiss I open my eyes and he was checking out a girl behind me show her she was wearing a big long skirt and she was bent over to open the door. (Really odd way to open a door).

 I just remember getting out of the car cause I was on my way to class and I looked at him and I’m just like how could you and he’s like what did I do? But he knew.
and then for the whole rest of the day he tried to “”cheer me up his idea of cheering me up was to buy me a cake that had not my age I just turned on it , but the age 19, as we were  always joking I wish I was younger than him.

Instead of making me laugh, that made me cry he was so mad at me on my own birthday for crying.
To mention I was a pick Meisha since he was having a hard time in his work since we were arguing and I gave him $300 to buy me a birthday gift the gift three weeks prior. What I got was my cake and the flowers and he said the rest came out with insurance.


It was so upsetting to pay for a gift that I didn’t even get and not even get a gift from anybody. 
So we continued to try at the end of July my birthdays mid July. One day when we was gone I was looking ay his discord and on his discord there’s an NSFW and then there’s an nSFW-2d,
And I used to watch a lot of anime. I used to think Id rather a guy watch hentai over porn but  I was wrong because what I found on his discord was something called lolicon and it was stomach turning to find that his friends were looking at pictures drawn a little toddlers doing sexual things and I was really upset. 

We fought and had our first split up, but like the cat, I came back. No i shouldn’t have, but i wanted to say it wasn’t him watching that, its a discord with hundreds of people because its a “cheating site” for games they have every new game cheat. 
He started to get abusive around here.
He would neglect me, ignore me, wouldn’t go for walks without being on his phone, said I love you repetitively  but it felt so fake. He would throw me, hide is screen, refuse to play games around me and instead would mope on bed and show me anger. He hid his phone screen when he texted. Started to check out women in stores all the time. I constantly felt like i wasnt good enough.

For the next few months I would do everything I could to try and keep things afloat.  I was going to school working and taking care of my kid ( which if youre worried, I NEVER  left my kid alone with him, i use my sister as a babysitter and other family thank GOODNESS) and yet the less he did he dropped out of school and then told his family it was my fault because he was so stressed with my jealousy, ( at a thanksgiving dinner I was subject to his whole family staring at me while he cried and I looked like a monster)

He quit his job at The gas station and I was the only one doing everything while he played World of Warcraft at the time which we bought together because we were going to play together but then he end up not playing with me and hiding his scream for me whenever he was playing I felt so shitty

At that time I could just tell he was watching porn a lot we used to try it like when we met we used to actually have sex and then I found myself like trying to get ready and dressed up for him and be cute but he would turn me away and get actually upset at me one time he even went to grab me like he wanted me and slap my ass and then went on the bed and pouted and put his feet up like he was gonna kick me right after showing interest and  wanting me.

We would slowly have fights about even picking me up though he wasnt doing anything and I was paying for gas, one time he even sped up on the road I was on to zoom up and threaten to hit me. He was abusive he would throw me. Not punch or kick me, but if i was ever in his way when we had a fight he was violent. And again no, my kid was not around, its like he would chose times when we had alone time and was almost wanting to start fights :(

I started to catch on that porn was a problem. He wouldn’t want me in the mornings, he would wait until I was gone, and same with when I came home he would watch it all day and have nothing left for me. No intimacy no love. Even when he did, i could tell it wasn’t love making anymore :( 

he pretty much broke up with me in October right before Halloween we lived in a shitty area and we were going to go Halloween being with his mom in a nicer area he didn’t give a fuck about my daughter he ate all her cheese strings and it was a family size pack.

When I did move out at first I took his desktop because it was the only thing he cared about the only messages I got for the next two weeks where I want my computer back and go kill yourself” i knew I shouldnt have right away gave it back in  a few days, didnt want to admit to taking it but wanted to sneak it to his dads house. Less i did low value things I am not proud, i was feeling so hurt. 

Yet I was still missing the guy(yeah i know you’re probably rolling your eyes)  that I met because I “knew” that that guy was still there I just felt like there’s just so much happening. So much stress both in school, both having ups and down:( 

Yeah so for the months since October we’ve been “trying”. More like he hasn’t been coming over and less, needs something and wont call me unless it’s an emergency like his dad beat him up or he stranded before work or he needs money for something. ( again also an alcoholic, doesn’t get hammered but constantly needs a buzz) 

He came and saw me on my birthday this year ( after kind of avoiding me for 3 months in PERSON)
He came over the night before my birthday. A few days prior he tried to give me a gift and of course I was excited because the last birthday I didn’t get a gift. 

He tried to give me the gift a few days early and I denied, I didn’t even answer.
He got the point and he waited and gave it to me the night before my birthday. 

(At this point I had found FDS right around here so please forgive me for failing. I am putting this here because I want to be stronger and I don’t know if this will help other women and I REALLY need to vent)  

He came over for my 30th night before my birthday I was booty call in the next day he acted annoyed like he wanted to leave I had no choice but to be like “do you want to leave because I’m not gonna keep you here if you do. I mean, it’s my birthday and I won’t hold it against you”  but clearly I would and I just just letting him have the ability to leave without feeling annoyed for asking or a fight. Wasnt worth it based on what I have read. 

He got me airpods. I had wanted them for years, I had an old pair he gave me at the beginning of our relationship but it only ever had one headphone so at that time feeling like we were doing “ok” I gave him the old pair, being the weak person i am.  

Since then he said we could get back together if I get over myself “ that hes going to check people out and watch porn”.  I said hell no, knowing that its my values, i actually made it clear going into this relationship I had a problem with porn up front and he said he woudln’t, and its like dude you werent checking people out on first date so why would it be okay now? So i can know youre just settled with me?

 
So then he sends me some texts saying good luck finding someone who will put up with your shit I have no regrets and Im deleting this texting app ( which he has been using since he came over to my house  and broke his phone and I am so positive he told his family that I broke his phone so they would help him get a new one that makes me so mad) 

And i said you know what I wont have a problem next guy wont get bored of me because he wont be watching a new porn every 5 mins to which his last response i have was “ bye c u bext tuesday”

While hes streaming on twitch after ( which he used to claim he was “ streaming for me” yet banned me in the chat when he thought other women were watching said it was lame to have a girlfriend type in your twitch chat) in the background he has 2 people ask him about his headphone but bever mentioned I gave it to him, “I found it “ he said. The person in the background was like no its new, to which my ex didnt answer. 


I dont know, but i broke, i was so choked. 
I did the crazy woman thing and went to his work the next day, 

i know i should know better but its so angering that someone can be so slimey and yet always make it out like hes the good guy. 

I go in and he greets the door like “welcome” in a super cheerful voice, i say hi mike,”. He grows silent,  there was another staff there he was up front to which he goes up to her at says “ this is my exxxxxx” hissing it. Like oh yeah only 2 days ago i was picking you up and helping you with your money because you spend it all on alcohol. ( which yes he paid me back but the effort was what I was getting at ) 

I then leave about to cry but i go back in and say “i want my airpod then” ( youre not using my old headphone to talk to other women sorry) 

girl hes working with is like “ leave” hes like i dont want you here, but he takes my old airpod from his pocket after denying having them  and whips them
Out the door. 

So i start looking for the case, find it cant find the headphone, keep looking, and yeah i was looking until the police showed up. Even though i was looking for my headphone. I didnt get in trouble, and the police actually found my headphone, but it was the most humiliating thing in my
Life. I know i should do better. I know i am
Dumb, my heart is such a sweet caring fucking heart. Yes i have issues if youre going to say “ you stayed” “you helped him”. Ugh i know but when your heart aches :( i followed it. 

And me being in pick meisha recovery knows i deserve more than this 
Yet i have no one else.
I feel so depressed and alone.
I know I have a kid and right now shes on vacation with my sister for 3 weeks. 

Again i was in foster care, and  I do have real family but they have never been really supportive. Even my sister, who loves me, wont talk to me about anything that is bothering me. 


This is so long I doubt you will read this and if you do, I hope my status does not change to pickMeisha. I am trying to hard to work on myself yesterday I went for a 3 hour walk, i draw, and I do like yo play video games sometimes as well. I literally feel like I have nobody to talk to. I wont harm myself, but its scary when you feel this alone and sad.",86753,"My story, TLTR If you dont like long reads",0,,,

I realized, right around when Corona hit, that I had a lot of baggage I needed to unpack and so I sought the help of a counselor and a grassroots counseling group. I engaged in this regularly atleast once a week, journaled my ass off. 

Fast forward a few months and my calendar is nearly w me focused activities and homeboy is jelly. It sucked because if we lived similar lifestyles we could have meal prepped/exercised/discussed growing pains together but he wasn't on the same upward spiral.

In the beginning I cared about him a lot. I dreamed of our future and hoped we would grow together. We very obviously grew apart and I was not able to give him the attention/love that he demanded. He was incredibly supportive and encouraging so I feel bad that I wasnt able to match his love in that way although I did try my best to do so for him despite the circumstances he chose for himself...

When I broke up with him, while abrupt, I did without pointing out his flaws in an attempt to not hurt him more. He was heart. Broken.

Fast forward a week: hes messaging me how much he misses me and how it's painful. Then I get a message from a friend asking if we're together. Homeboy had been soliciting ""cuddles"" from other women, a women he met when I took him to an intimate birthday get together. Like wtf.

So I respond to his love bomb with hesitation and call out his attention seeking behaviour and ask him to not engage in it so close to my friend group. 

Apparently I'm an asshole for saying that to such a ""vulnerable "" person. Oh yeah. In response to the message he showed up at my doorstep that night loudly banging... blowing up my phone. Has history of emotional outbursts, did not answer. Cannot make this shit up.

How do I move on without causing anymore harm to this person? Was I wrong for calling him out on his behavior?

After reading his messages, especially ones about my spiritual high horse, I'm genuinely questioning if I'm some fucked up, insensitive person who brashly hurts others.",86746,FDS AMTA/ support,0,,,

I wish someone told me all of this before, always think about your own interests, what does he have to offer you. Unless he is a saint, assume that he is #1 looking out for his own interests, that's what men always always do. Women are naturally less self-interested but on top of that, we are also aggressively conditioned to put men's wants and needs before our own. Ask yourself, why do you give a shit what he wants, needs or likes? Who is he to you? What does he have to offer you, and what actions prove that he is genuine? 

By default, getting married will not make you happy. Probably the opposite. Things aren't as archaic as they used to be, but men act more contemptuously towards marriage than before. They think they are doing you a favor when 99% of the time they burden you, take advantage of you, ruin your health and future. Most are bad/mediocre husbands or fathers and they have zero desire to change or improve. Even going into it thinking ""I just want to be a mom"" might backfire because while a guy might just be a sperm donor, he will think he is an equally important parent as you are, despite him not risking his life to give birth, not taking hits in his career/pay/earning ability to raise children, not staying up at night caring for them, not planning their schedules education and activities-- basically doing a fraction of what moms do. LVM ruin your peace of mind after a date or two, that's how toxic they are to be around. Being married, divorced to one of them, and having to share custody with them will mean probably not having true peace of mind for 18+ years. It's just NOT worth it to marry them for that reason, freeze your eggs or have kids on your own. 

You should only marry men who treat you like a queen and/or they have money and they treat you with respect. There is literally no advantage in it for you otherwise. Most husbands are delusional ingrates and/or life sucking blobs of dark energy, if they are not abusive or mean. Especially as of late, men are in such a state of disgrace that you wonder what they have to offer at all. 

By treat you like a queen... I don't mean that he's nice(r) to you than other guys have been, the bar for men's etiquette and treatment of women is in the earth's core. I also don't mean that if he is nice to you, that it's okay for him to be broke with zero desire to change that, or to be a manbaby. Part of treating you like a queen means he enjoys taking care of you, doesn't burden you with all/most responsibilities. A guy doesn't have to be rich but he still has to be responsible, as well as be your best friend, be your protector, rock your world in bed, be sexually giving, generous, cheer you on, support you in life. Even a guy like this will have his annoying moments, but you can genuinely deal with him without growing a brain tumor, because you know that everything balances out and there is true authenticity and love.

By has money... does he have so much that what he gives you is very little in comparison to what he spends on himself? Is your lifestyle actually better after being with him? Having money is not an excuse for him to be a sociopath or to treat you badly. But I have known women who married high income men or even guys with family wealth, and I know they weren't crazy about the guy/or any guy for that matter. They wanted security and a better lifestyle, the guys wanted a beautiful intelligent socially graceful wife, it's transactional but also honest. This is also how many marriages were in the past, people married for reasons like this, not because of sparks or chemistry or having similar interests. It takes a certain type of woman to pull it off and not end up as a sugar baby thinking she's winning because the guy bought her some shoes or paid for her breast implants. 

Most men just have nothing to offer women anymore, it's not even really a question of is he LVM or HVM.. more like what does he have to offer you? In most cases, not a damn thing. Many of them these days can't even fix a simple thing around the house, they won't take out the garbage or even do 1950s stereotypically male chores or household tasks. They take advantage of ""eQuAliTy"" notions when they see an opportunity to share bills or to share blame, but have zero interest otherwise in becoming more equal to women by equalizing their low levels of empathy, responsibility, household management skills, childcare skills or life skills at large.",86744,Some real tea: You should only get married if the guy treats you like a queen and/or if he has money.,0,,,

•When a guy is overly invested in his mom, he is not emotionally available to any other woman in his life. Countless psychologists and psychiatrists have written about this phenomenon of mother-enmeshed men who feel like they’re being unfaithful if they put the needs of their SO before their mom’s requests. Coming from that toxic family dynamic is not something easily fixed. It takes decades of therapy and the problem is, these people are not self-aware enough to know hey have a problem. They constantly project and make the poor SO feel like she’s going crazy for being “jealous” of his relationship with his mom. These guys all end up on r/JustNoMIL. Which brings me to my next point.

•Where is his dad? If a man doesn’t have a good relationship with his dad, that is an orange flag. It usually means that he didn’t grow up seeing what a HVM should act like and how a HVM is supposed to treat a woman. Clearly the dad isn’t a good husband as if he was, the narcissistic mother would not be so attention-seeking and needy to make her son feel obligated to run errands for her and make her the first priority in her life. Not having a dad or seeing a man treat a woman well can be immensely damaging if they don’t seek therapy or lack self-awareness to know their shortcomings. Have y’all ever seen a mommy’s boy speak as positively about his dad as his mom? I haven’t. There’s always resentment and issues there and it’s some BS you don’t need to involve yourself in. Date someone healthy who isn’t dependent on his mother for emotional fulfillment. 

Mommy’s boy = daddy issues 
He is always going to lack two things 

1. The ability to be emotionally available to another woman 
2. The example in his life to show him how a HVM is supposed to be

These guys also are thoroughly entrenched in the Madonna/whore complex as no one can live up to his mom and he devalues other women he comes across because they won’t do his laundry or cook for him. 

So next time you come across a mommy’s boy, especially if his parents are still married, ask yourself-what is his relationship with his dad like? I guarantee you no mommy’s boy’s parents have a healthy marriage. Being a mommy’s boy is a sign his family is dysfunctional, period. And it’s going to be a waste of your time to try to get along with any of them. They will gaslight you day and night while they normalize their dysfunction. 

They also will triangulate you- the SO and mom will work together to insult, criticize and undermine your decisions. 

Have you all ever noticed how self absorbed mommy’s boys are as well? They will tell you with a straight face not to wear something because his mom won’t like it. But if you tell him your dad expects your man to hold the door open and walk on the street side they have a hissy fit. They will always take their own family’s word as gold and discount whatever your side has to say. Mommy.’s boys are strangely exclusionary and try to put up an elitist front which is interesting because no one is desperate to marry into their dysfunctional families. They constantly make SOs feel less than or not good enough-just know it’s all an illusion. You’re better than all of their crazy asses anyway just by virtue of seeing right through their bullshit. 

Do you believe in the myth, how he treats his mom is how he’ll treat you? Think again! He will be putting her on a pedestal while devaluing you. 

There’s a difference between having a good relationship with his mom and being a mommy’s boy. 

Now that you know why they’re so messed up, don’t waste a second psychoanalyzing. Drop these LVM at the first red flag. 

Just try flipping things if you want to see how delusional they are-tell him your dad thinks it’s cheap how he tries to get you to buy gas and your dad wants you to be with a man who has his shit together. See how quickly he will tell you to get your family out of his business, and how quickly he will get his mother into yours. Delusional, narcissistic folks. This is meant with no shade towards anyone with less-than-ideal families. I’m just talking about LVM who live in denial and try to push their dysfunction on others while thinking they’re hot shit.",86677,Think about it 🤔,0,,,

But you know what, that's bullshit, because there's a huge difference between confidence and arrogance.

Arrogance is when you think you're better than others, but confidence is just appreciation of your own abilities.  You can be confident and still remain humble.  For instance, you can be well aware that you make beautiful art.  Knowing you're talented is a good thing.  You can think you're the best painter in your whole family, but so long as you're not bringing undue attention to yourself, willing to admit it if you're wrong, and still giving others the recognition they deserve while remembering that you're not worth more than them because of your talent...  You're doing nothing wrong.  

None of you girls need to feel like it's wrong to enjoy who you are and how you look, and don't let any man tell you otherwise!
