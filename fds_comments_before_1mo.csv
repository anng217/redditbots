3022,"&gt; it was instant chemistry personality and looks wise and he checked all my practical boxes but, turned out to be very close to a narcissist and a mommas boy.

&gt; sweet and generous (spent A LOT on me) but, the sex was boring and he turned out to have a out of town (possibly non monogamous) girlfriend.

&gt; When I meet handsome men with great personalities they‚Äôre broke, womanizers, or top tier so minimal effort/want to be chased (ugh). 

Could it be that your idea of a great personality is a bit skewed? Maybe the relationships in your family were narcissistic so now you interpret them as normal? A guy who is a womaniser or wants to be chased cannot have such a great personality. Stable, sane men are maybe not as exciting in the beginning so they seem more dull (maybe they seem less masculine to you?). A healthy relationship builds slowly.

&gt; The most recent guy I met at a bar I REALLY like but,  he is 29 and not financially stable (he‚Äôs an ‚Äúentrepreneur‚Äù) the sex is GREAT, he‚Äôs consistent and supportive but, being broke is truly a deal breaker. As of now he‚Äôs a FWB (he does all the boyfriend things and even takes me out when he can but, I continue to date and make it clear we‚Äôre not together and he‚Äôs upset by it)  

He sounds good but you‚Äôre giving him sex for nothing, why would he change? He‚Äôs waiting for you to get desperate enough to go into a full relationship. If he really wants it he needs to put his talk into action. Let him figure out how, do not help him, do not reward his inaction.

Many attractive men have terrible personalities and they may get women due to their looks, but struggle to keep a woman because their personality is so off-putting.

I think the issue is that most of you have never met a ‚Äúhigh value‚Äù man, as you put it, and base a man‚Äôs worth on his looks.

3079,"I‚Äôll focus on online filtering out since for me it was a huge aspect trial and error with finding the right guy:

- Upfront about what he is looking for - if they are being vague or saying they are POSSIBLY looking for something deeper or just wanting to see where things go, run. You deserve to know whether you are in for hookup/fwb or in for a potential (like, actually potential) relationship, unless you Iike the idea of a defining the relationship discussion looming over you and being afraid he will bolt at the mention of it. I understand it can come off strong to ask them outright and seem desperate for a relationship when you want them to chase you, so try and use dating apps that allow for selection of what the user is looking for and dodge the losers who are themselves dodging a straight answer selection or are seemingly just down for anything.

- Go after men who are looking to date women their own age, or at least are very open to it and don‚Äôt have a bizarre age range - my current partner I honestly was concerned about because he had previously dated a 22 year old when he himself was around 27/28 - but he said that relationship and the differences they had at even that smaller age difference helped him realize that he would be better off seeking a woman his own age. 

- Unless you don‚Äôt have a social life yourself, make sure he has a social life - honestly you want to be their priority but you don‚Äôt want to be their everything, it will start to impact your own social life.

- Established or becoming established in a career - being educated in the form of a degree or a trade is very important typically, some men (especially older) could be highschool graduates that by luck made their way into an office job and immediately be unable to find a similar job if they are laid off.",toleodo,2019-10-30 15:46:36,2019-10-30 15:46:38,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dp7lkc/what_is_a_high_value_man_hvm_what_traits_should/f5t4q6q/,t3_dp7lkc,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

3083,"Her post got deleted. Here it is:

 

""It is clear that [r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/) explicitly rejects mainstream liberal feminism. 'Tis even more evident that [r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/) sits in contention with less mainstream(but relevant) sects of radical feminism. Like my previous post, if you want me to expand on any of my points or definitions, please ask as these are all gross simplifications.

**1: liberal/mainstream feminism**

Defining what feminism exactly is turns out to be difficult, it is *just* a label and the label does not really tell you anything useful about a person's beliefs in a lot of contexts and the label is quite arbitrary. When I refer to ""liberal"" or ""mainstream"" feminism what I am talking about are people who hold some or all of the following views:

* Men and women are equal
* Pornography/sex work is empowering
* Pro-choice
* Pro-transgender attitudes
* Black feminism
* Celebrity feminism(think Emma Watson or Beyonce)

Of course there are more beliefs than this, but this is generally the trend. These beliefs are what would be held by a young American college student or some random Blue Pill woman on [r/TheBluePill](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/) might believe.

**2: fringe/radical feminism**

There are more fringe examples of feminism such as TERF or contemporary Marxist feminists. These groups explicitly reject liberal feminism on most grounds(rejecting sex work as empowering on the case of TERFs not having pro-transgender attitude. We will call these types *radical* feminists because they mirror the second wave radical feminist movements in many ways. Some beliefs they might hold are:

* Lesbian separatism
* Gender nihilism
* Anti-sex work and anti-pornography
* Class-based analyses
* Pro-choice
* Anti-family
* Anti-religious

Of course some of these views do contradict each other in a sense(it is because it is not typically the same people simultaneously believing this and even if it was it does not matter in this context due to this being strictly an attempt at a vague description) and some are compatible with more mainstream liberal feminist attitudes, but some are not.

**3:** [r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/)

[r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/) is a subreddit that claims to give women dating advice, of course this is not the case. There is also many criticisms of men on there, attitudes women can hold, memes etc. that are clearly not just dating advice. You can check the top posts all of all time and the flair guides at the bottom to probably get a better idea of what the subreddit *actually* is. Anyway here is the subreddit description:

&gt;Effective dating strategy for women that know what they want and prefer to be able to take control of their dating lives. Also includes strategies to maintain a relationship that benefits you. Plus tips on how to deal with some of the negative strategies from men that you encounter.

I will take this at face value, because it is not technically incorrect in the sense that it is not telling any lies, but rather omitting some information about the subreddit

**4: normative and descriptive disconnect**

A lot of ideologies share underlying descriptive claims, but what separates these ideologies is not just the descriptions given, but also the normative claims made by them. Incels, MGTOW and Red Pill users actually do share a lot of descriptive claims(hypergamy, feminism, psychology to name a few), but differentiate each other by how they tell their user bases to respond to such descriptions. Incels have a more nihilistic outlook for instance, and more or less advocate for lying down and rotting. MGTOWs advocate for distancing yourself from cultures or societies because they are ""gynocentric"" and improving yourself for the sake of your own fulfillment. And Red Pill users advocate for improving yourself as an ends to being sexual successful. There is of course overlaps in this sometimes.

In the case of feminism, you can see the disconnect. Liberal and radical feminists might both agree that the sex industry(prostitution and pornography) is harmful to women, but where the major disagreement is how to respond. A more liberal feminist would want to make the working conditions for sex workers better as a radical feminist might suggest the industry is exploitation as it's core and women should work to get out of it or it should be gone all together.

**5:** [r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/) **and normativity**

[r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/) might descriptively agree with everything a liberal or radical feminist says, but they clearly disagree about the normativity. [r/femaledatingstragy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstragy/) tells women ""this is how the world is\*, then proceeds to give them advice on how to exploit this world for their personal gain. They do this by telling women they live in abundance, telling them what there worth is to men, telling them how much they can possibly squeeze out of them and even going as far as to mess with them(this mirrors Red Pill communities a lot of course in a lot of ways, but it is obviously non-identical or comparable I would argue). They are actually rejecting feminism viz. making no normative claims about restructuring societies, institutions, no talk of how to overcome patriarchal ideas and no talk of how men should be.

**6: the assumption**

I think the assumption here is that if a woman is rejecting feminism, that they turn into a traditional conservative wife, a Red Pill woman or they just worship men and masculinity. This is not the case however, it is ideally coherent- I would even say expected- that women who do reject feminism could easily accept the normativity of [r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/). Perhaps the advice is immoral, repugnant or strange, but nonetheless they are rejecting feminism and this is how it could look and I suspect if a lot of women did actually reject feminism they would come to the conclusion.

**7: it is categorically different**

Even if someone on here wanted to call this ""feminism""(as there is nothing stopping anyone from doing this) it is clearly categorically different and stands in opposition or apathy to the more mainstream ideas of feminism. If woman talking about doing things that solely benefit them is feminism to you, then your definition of feminism is absurd and covers so much ground you are making make-up tutorials into feminism. I think most definitions that people can give that implicate the two as feminism would result in this reduction.

**8: conclusion**

[r/femaledatingstrategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/femaledatingstrategy/) is rejecting feminism due to the above reasons. It is not not enough just to reject feminism to make the men who are upset at reading the subreddit okay, but you must also reject it in a way they want you to do it. I think in light of this, it makes sense for men to be pro-feminist(liberal at least, as this does benefit men I think), despite their objections to it.

7020,"\*Trigger warning, you've probably heard most of these phrases*

Subtle 'tactics' are suggested for every step of the \*cough* seduction - incapacitate, isolate, escalate - aka get you drunk, get you home and rape you. They call it ""lowering her Bitch Shields, getting past her Anti-Slut Defences, giving her plausible deniability, and overcoming resistance"". I call it the Rapists Handbook.

Incapacitate - usually alcohol, could be sleep deprivation. ""Come on, just have one drink. You're no fun. I bet you can't match my drinks! Just stay for one more, I'm having such a good time, aren't you? You don't need sleep, let's stay up and watch the sun rise, it will be so romantic. You didn't like that drink? Try a different kind. I bet you like girly drinks. Let me top that up for you. But I paid for a whole bottle of wine. Don't let it go to waste. Oh god, you're not one of those boring people who don't drink are you. Could have told me before I came all this way that it would be a waste of time. What's the matter, are you a lightweight? Can't hold your liquor? That girl over there is being a good sport""

Isolate - ""Come back to my place so I can show you &lt;random cool thing&gt;, it'll be quick. I know another bar down the street, let's ditch your friends. Come check out my car. Can I come in for a minute? I have to use the bathroom. Aren't you going to offer me a drink?"" ok I can't think of any more, putting myself into the mindset of a depraved boundary violator is making me heave. You get the idea.

Don't drink more than you want to.

Don't go where you don't want to.

Don't have sex until you want to.

Don't mistake the anxiety and apprehension of being emotionally manipulated for ""chemistry"" or sparks.",ino_y,2019-10-29 13:18:14,2019-10-29 13:18:15,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/domi1h/trp_tactic_compliance_test_is_just_coercion_and/f5pbjxu/,t3_domi1h,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

7120,"the patriarchy they established to advance moids got them smitten to the idea that ALL men are entitled to mates (wives), now we have slowly pulled away that power they are bitching and crying about it...but the fact is in the wild no male is guaranteed to pass his genes on, let alone to an attractive competent woman. That's why more women pass on their genes than men. I think there was a study backin this up a while ago, in caveman days more women passed on their genes than men did.

You see evidence of this all the time, my female rabbit used to reject males including her rapey brother rabbit that tried it. Men are truly the weaker sex when it comes to reproduction- hence why they get aggressive. They want to push their weak genes on into the next generation, whilst the females are trying to get the best outcome possible which benefits the future generations far more than those weak degenerate fathers do.

Exactly, how often do u see low tier men in relationships usually with women better than them....incels are several steps below that hence why they end up becoming murderers and shit. Women can sense they're not all there and good on them for doing so. At least chads are nice to look at whilst you're fucking them and usually put in effort with their appearances at the gym so they have stamina to last 12 rounds. There is a reason they attract more women lmaoo. Besides I keep myself toned/in shape/ look after my skin etc- even chads tell me I haven't aged/look good so wtf why should I settle for some 6chinned incel with no personality/confidence. Fuck off!! Chads messing good women around means nothing as most of them won't settle until THEY decide they want to and for most of them thats mid 30s onwards- everythin else is irrelevant. Incels emotionally blackmailing women into settling and passing on their desperate dire genes? Nah thanks, I'd rather fuck chad &amp; get the good genes at least.

I don't care what people think of it I believe in natural selection lol. So many people don't respect the game now, everyone feels entitled to the same attention that the hottest celebs without having the looks/confidence or money for that. If you're not very good looking/educated etc you have to make up for it by being a nice interesting person. For example some men have been more appealing to me because they have travelled lots and I find that interestings/signals wealth.

I dated a guy that was the more 'shy' beta type once although he had a good sized dick and was tall/decent looking &amp; seemed more manly at work (why I was drawn in), however when I got to know him I quickly saw why he was still on the market. He was so emotionally taxing, self loathed about his career prospects but had zero desire to put effort in /take classes, he didn't make any real effort with his style etc and got 'panicky' just walking to the shop. He was also paranoid about women being goldiggas/whores and conveniently he preferred to stay indoors (aka he was a cheapskate unwilling to invest money into relationships) so he got pissy when as a woman you suggest going out for the day. How pathetic, imagine him as a father?? Then he wanted to act surprised I didn't catch feelings and blew him off lmao, he was so cold to be around. Its like some men think just having a dick and a pulse entitles them to a good woman.

Her husband was cheating and gave her an STI that infected her coil and the docs warned she may not be able to have kids because of it.

We ended up having a really good conversation the whole next day so we decided to meet up at his house and hang out when he was off work. We ended up getting stoned and tipsy and he told me to take his bed and he'd sleep on the couch. I slept over woke up early and went home. That whole next day we talked and I told him next time I want to cuddle and watch a movie and he told me he did too. Anyway he never once pushed for sex I kind of jumped him 2 weeks later because he was so respectful of all my boundaries. We've been together ever since and I'm really happy.

Fast forward literally 6 years later and one hasn't had a girlfriend since me and they both still pop up here and there wanting to ""catch up"".......  I'm good thanks.

Lesson learned on my part. Do not settle. Since then I've dated attractive and equally successful guys and even if it didn't go anywhere long term, at least I wasn't disrespected by a 3/10 douche.",mountaindewme22,2019-10-31 18:08:33,2019-10-31 18:08:52,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dpqngg/the_boyfriend_who_treated_me_the_absolute_worst/f5xrt80/,t3_dpqngg,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

7264,"When I was younger, I met a guy and moved across the country with him after only dating for 6 months.  He changed his tune once I was away from friends and family, suddenly I couldn't have a job because ""it was an insult to his ability to care for his queen"", but this meant that ""we couldn't afford for me to call home and talk to my mom all the time"" and due to the neighborhood we lived in ""it wasn't safe for me to go out alone, so it's best that I don't have a house key"".  Could anyone actually be this stupid?  Yes, a 19-year-old me did.

It wasn't until he shoved me into a wall that I snapped out of it.  Called my mom collect from a payphone and she bought me a one-way ticket home.  The fucker still tried to propose to me as I was leaving with a paper straw wrapper engagement ring.

15007,"Therapy isn't always expensive, you can find some form of therapy from a charity/org if you're smart about it. Plus people will happily throw money away on food/clothes/holidays etc but won't invest in their mental wellbeing? Often people purchase lots of shit to avoid how they are feeling- its not fixing the root of the issue. There are also plenty of youtube videos/forums etc dedicated to help people with numerous issues. I truly believe if you want to improve/get better you will find a way.

Well yes I'm talking about permanently leaving them alone, not bouncing back/forth (which is clearly the opposite) its the only way they will feel the sting if at all. Don't think I mentioned fixing these men at all, I just believe eventually these sorts of men mess a good one over and realise what a mess they are. They hit a wall with their behaviour. I can count a few ex's like that myself, they have grown up now &amp; realised having a connection is rare...but unfortunately they missed their chance &amp; I'm a much smarter/picker person now that isn't willing to run the risk. If they respond to that sting in a mature way, they do learn to grow and realise the value of good women. But mainly we are cutting them off for own sake, to take control and put an end to an abusive/exploitative dynamic.

If another woman approaches him first, that doesn't mean that he's off limits to you.

She was touching him and completely oblivious to his disengaged body language. At one point, he was glancing around the room and we made and held eye contact. I gave him a smile and an eyebrow raise. The next time we locked eyes I gave him another smile and a wink. 

I walked over to the bar and a few minutes later, he'd broken away from drunk girl and found his way over to where I was.

15106,"While there are ABSOLUTELY men who behave like this, most manosphere posts are just unloveable ultra-losers writing fan fiction depicting how they wish they could behave if they were ever around actual human women.

Remember, the types of dudes who post on incel/red pill/MGTOW forums are very maladjusted, unattractive and socially awkward large boys with nothing going on in their lives. Go watch a documentary on the subject or one of their YouTube channels if you need to be reminded. The next time you read some manosphere douche's 5,000 word novel on his sexual conquests, remind yourself that it is without a doubt fan fiction, because the dude behind the keyboard barely leaves the house and has no social circle or career prospects. If he did, he wouldn't live his whole life on Reddit 24/7.

Because think about it: If this dude could so easily fuck women he treated like dog shit, he wouldn't be ""going his own way,"" he'd just continue to love 'em and leave 'em. This isn't his truth, this is his fantasy. MGTOW dudes are the ""you can't fire me I quit"" of the dating world. Their experience with women is either non-existent or so barely existent that it might as well have never happened.

15170,"Yes this is toxic. I've noticed it too.
I guess that is what happens when u take ur anger and fear ontop a massive platform with like minded individuals. But then again the internet isnt for the faint of heart exactly because of that.

I'm not saying reddit or the internet is responsible for my fear or hate(I should say intolerence) of men, men have def done that themselves. But I dont think we need anyone to reinforce our negative ideologies.
It doesn't help we are all opinionated creatures lol.

This doesnt make you wrong though, I knew before reddit and before trp sub that men are more sexually driven and I love psych, so, its proven they are able to detach their emotions which makes them better at fwb situations and having multiple partners without becoming overly emotionally attached
 Whereas women cannot, and we become emotionally invested when we sleep with a man
. This being said, vetting process is VERY important. And as long as you dwell on the positive aspects more than the negative ones you should be good.

I have tailored my vetting process to join them in a way. I have super duper standards/expectations now that filters them out WELL.
It saves me a lot of stress and headaches, and idc if I'm strict or hurt their feelings in the mix because if they got vetted out it means they were a pos anyway.

My only rule is he must provide. To me this shows his true intentions, and let's me know if hes in it for the long run and sees me as worth doing this for. Which to me is only fair if I cant shove the children I have with him back up once we are done. I need an equal amount of commitment in turn and for men, that is money
They are visual and materialist beings.
I dont believe we love with the same depth, they are more simple and more primal. Unconditional love that we all so want so bad can come from 1 ourselves,  2. Our parents /siblings and 3, our kids. Men only seem to love on conditions. They have no problems dating and living with women they dont plan on being forever with and are more than capable on being with a woman out of convinience. Once they find better they leave.

This is just my personal observation and also info I have gathered from others.
Women do fucked up shit too, but look at stats and you will see majority of rapes are commited by men, the demand for women in sex trades are majority demanded from men, women get abducted and trafficked for sex by men, murders are commited primarily by men. And even when a woman commits a murder the motives differ.
Most serial killers are men. Wars start due to men, expiraments on humans during wars were primarily if not all conducted by men. Resources from the planet are being extracted mostly by men (CEO's of large companies).
 I can get into more spiritual aspect of this. And say it is because the masculine and feminine energy is not equal right now to balance each other out as the feminine has been suppressed.
And masculine traits are traits of destruction and leadership and it's been in reign but that's for another sub.

Conclusion: it's sad, it hurts, but cant close your eyes to it.

15181,"When real life is just one big humungus disappointment, it's very easy to retreat into a fantasy world, where you can *always* feel successful, liked and acknowledged. Gaming and the internet today makes this easier than ever. 

Unfortunately this is only a pipe dream and our subconscious knows this. That's why it's just a dirty band-aid on an infected wound that won't heal.

Our subconscious only responds to results in real life.

My best advice for you is to break all your big goals in as tiny pieces as possible. The goal is then to check off as many of those tiny pieces as you can a day, consistently.

And, if possible, try to spend some time in nature. Take an audiobook or podcast if it feels boring at first. But the goal is to be present in nature. To notice, really see the trees, the birds, the grass. And realize that you are a child of that nature and you belong just as much as all the other creatures there.",whycantweallgetal0ng,2019-10-29 07:08:07,2019-10-29 07:08:08,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dofnne/what_makes_someone_a_high_value_woman/f5ougz8/,t1_f5nntyx,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

15250,"A man doesn't have to be Bill Gates to be high value. He just has to improve your life in every way vs being single. If a guy is making you poorer, less happy, more stressed, more insecure, etc. he's not worth keeping in your life. A rich man who makes you go 50/50 is much worse than an average guy who takes you out but not to super nice places. The way I imagine it is: would I be happy if there were more men like him in the world? I love my boyfriend and I honestly think he's a total sweetheart, which is why it's so weird that he's in love with me of all people. I *wish* more men treated their girlfriends the way mine treats me. I would want my sister and my best friend to date a man like him. If you wouldn't want your sister or best friend to date a man like him, then why would you? IMO money is only important to a point. If he's making you pay for everything or literally jobless, that's an obvious pass. If he has a decent, stable job and is able to afford his expenses, I don't think it's a con unless you're really into the spoiled girlfriend thing (middle class men can still spoil too but it'll obviously be less extravagant than straight up wealthy men). It depends on what kind of lifestyle you want; in general, people tend to get with people with similar lifestyles.",hoIds_up_spork,2019-10-30 00:44:31,2019-10-30 00:44:32,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dowi55/you_go_to_dates_to_pick_the_right_man_for_you_not/f5rk6p2/,t1_f5rdimc,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

You'll find someone who loves and cherishes you soon enough. Just accept that you give it your all, there is no use in beating yourself up. You're allowed to be sad even if he was a shit. He didn't appreciate you, it is his loss. Use your experience as a lesson to yourself and don't make the same mistakes again.

Find me the average man off the street and I guarantee his wife does most of the cooking/cleaning/caretaking still...and the woman is probably earning more/is more educated than him.

Doesn't occur to them to level up and self reflect on how they ended up that way. So yes this ALL true, men don't object to hypergamy when it benefits THEM.

Of course broke ugly men moan the loudest about this...because as we know ugly men with money bag attractive women all the time. They know they have to make up for it if they want to bat out of their league.

15395,"Well, for me, 'Genuine Emotional and Physical Connection' is the only thing I am interested in. That is why I have to be very careful to avoid spending time and energy on men who are only interested in physical connection and has no genuine emotions. 

I don't think I am alone in this. I think for most women sex without emotional connection is a depressing waste of time that will leave us feeling used and dehumanized. Because of this some men (PUAs) have developed whole theories, written books, taken courses on how to bully and manipulate us into submission and damage us emotionally until we feel that we deserve no better and can expect no better than to be used to masturbate in by occasion and receive nothing but hurt in return. The methods have spread from the dedicated PUA circles and become mainstream to the point that it is hard to find men that aren't at least somewhat inspired by their way of thinking. 

The fact that I am bringing more to the table than merely my body, the fact that I am willing to invest my feelings, my heart in a man makes me vulnerable to this kind of men. To have genuine emotional connection you have to be open, you have to show an amount of trust and be willing to give the other person the benefit of the doubt. These men are intentionally using this against us to use us and leave us in a state of heartbreak. Every time this happens to a woman she becomes more suspicious and cynical, less open and trusting. I don't want to end up like that. So I need to avoid those situations by avoiding those men. 

But how do I avoid them when they are going out of their way to fool me into thinking that they are the opposite of what they really are until I have invested my emotions in them? That's the big question. For some time I have stopped dating all together because I thought there was no way. But I really like men and I really would like a real relationship, so if letting men pay for dinner is a way to find a good solid relationship that won't destroy me I think that is worth a try even if I couldn't care less about the money.",PoorPlainObscure,2019-10-31 05:26:02,2019-10-31 05:26:03,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dpce91/genuine_emotional_and_physical_connection/f5vtk35/,t3_dpce91,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

My mom is almost 50, looks great for her age, and literally the other day had a guy who looked to be late 20s/early 30s approach her while she paid for gas. As I myself have gotten older, I get hit on *more* than when I was 20 by men of every damn age. 

Also, we already know what men deem to be attractive can vary greatly so you don't even have to be close to a model to be considered ""hot"".

Guys who believe in the wall must never step foot out of their mom's basement because if you take one look in the real world, you'd clearly see it's not only ""16-22 year olds"" being subjected to men's thirst.

They've done studies on this kind of thing. Men are more likely to cheat on women who earn more money than they do. It grows exponentially more likely as the disparity increase. When women cheat, the partner's income is not a factor at all. I'm sure that's obvious to just about anyone here.

Also that sounds like you're playing with scared money. You're not going to risk being vulnerable in order to form a real connection because someone might try to play you? You're gonna let them put you in that position? That sounds crazy to me. Making yourself vulnerable and putting your genuine self out there is powerful and strong not foolish or stupid.

15594,"More sex strategy for you queens-

Say NO degrading sex acts that have been put into a man‚Äôs head by porn and were seen as taboo forty years ago.

There are several acts that are absolutely not pleasurable for women, and that are degrading. They have been normalized by the sick porn industry. 

Do not let a man gaslight you into thinking they‚Äôre normal.

What‚Äôs the easiest way to tell if he is going to get off on humiliating and degrading you? Reverse the roles and see if he would accept the same from you. There are numerous things men routinely try to coerce women into doing, and below, you‚Äôll see how men would never accept the same.


Have ____ eat his own __. 
Have him put a _ up his ___.
 See if he likes being smacked and spoken down to.
 Tell him his parts are inadequate. 
Tell him you‚Äôre not about to reciprocate after he gives you head.
Make him stop doing what he enjoys most, switch to an uncomfortable position. 
Tell him he didn‚Äôt do enough foreplay after 75 minutes.
 Tell him you want to see him in something he normally doesn‚Äôt wear. Tell him he‚Äôd look better with a different hair color. 
Don‚Äôt put the focus on him, act like he should be treating you like the queen. 
Propose a threesome with a handsome man, better yet, his hottest friend.
 Bring out a whip.

*You‚Äôll find out they understand EXACTLY what is demeaning and degrading REAL QUICK! They will be immensely insulted by any of the above.*

Reclaim your sexuality. Sex should be pleasing to you and not a humiliating experience. If you‚Äôre not enjoying yourself, muster up all the strength you have and WALK OUT. Get comfortable with yourself and your own desires and EXPECT them to be fulfilled.

You don‚Äôt want any man to be able to say he smashed, and especially not if you didn‚Äôt even enjoy yourself.

Your TIME is too important. Your LIFE is too important. Your SELF-RESPECT is too important. You deserve better. You can‚Äôt waste your own time anymore, ladies.

The moment he starts putting his double standards on you or not making your pleasure a priority, either kick him out or walk out.

#KickHimOut2020 is the new motto of the new year, and we are going to start a movement that will have men coming to reddit like ‚Äúwhy did she kick me out after I refused to give her oral?‚Äù ü§î 

Is he inattentive to your needs during sex? Does he want you to tolerate bodily fluids he would never come near himself? Does want you to try anal when he won‚Äôt take a ____ up his ____? What a clown. 

Start laughing and then saunter away. Who cares. You don‚Äôt owe anyone any of your time and you do not need mediocre, unsatisfying sex in your life.

Selfish lovers have been gaslighting women into thinking unreciprocated and unsatisfying sex is normal for years. Today is the day you stop accepting it. 

A note on compliments: Turn unsolicited comments back on people from now on. If he says you should darken your hair, tell him he should go blonde. If he says you look better without glasses, tell him he looks better with sunglasses on. If he says you should squat more, tell him to work on his chicken legs. If he says you should be degraded during sex, suggest the same for him.

All compliments you receive should be absolutes, like ""you are beautiful"", ""your smile is amazing"", etc. Do not accept ""suggestions"" you have never asked for.

31006,"A note: ""look hotter"" is generic, I would specify ""look like the kind of (hot) girl the guys you want are trying to date"". High glamour/lots of makeup works in some situations, but not all dudes go for that. Some guys prefer a more subtle/natural look or preppy look. Same with body type; you want a gym dude, you probably should look like you go to the gym (lean and muscular). Some guys/subcultures prefer a thinner/less muscular aesthetic, some like curvier, edgier, whatever. You want to date an Ivy League Finance guy from a Nice Family? Look at the kind of women he dates. You want an edgy dude? Look at the women those guys go for (etc etc etc).

Of course there are always exceptions, and you absolutely will meet guys in every subculture/niche who prefer women who are not the dominant ""look"" for that group. However, if you do incorporate some common aesthetics (you don't need to look like every other woman you see, but do go ahead and adopt the pieces that feel natural/flattering to you) you will find yourself automatically ""opting in"" for a lot of men. Specifically, you already look like someone they would date (above and beyond just being hot) so they are more likely to pursue you. 

Being a healthy weight, active, with decent skin, good teeth and flattering clothes will do wonders no matter who you're after though",masterofthebarkarts,2019-10-28 16:23:57,2019-10-28 16:27:24,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/do7coj/look_hotter_if_you_want_to_get_a_boyfriend/f5lku84/,t3_do7coj,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

If you want a guy to approach you, here's a trick. You catch and maintain eye contact for slightly a little longer than a passing glance and a give him half a smile. That's it. 

I talked to a psychologist friend of mine about this once when we were discussing flirting, ""whoever talks first loses,"" said the psychologist. So you have to get him to come to you, and that look-smile was how. I tried it out and it's been working since the 90s.

31128,"Lol you'd be surprised, I have said that to attractive men (outdoors not in a restaurant), they've looked taken aback and then laughed as if they respect my standards....and then they swiftly stopped trying the 'treat me' shit. It set the tone. Men will always try their luck, even with hot women. If you don't put yourself on a pedestal they won't.

IMO strong women aren't bothered about offending cheapskate men, cos most cheapskate men aren't bothered about insulting you or wasting your time. Most cheapskate men are the most entitled &amp; focused in squeezing sex out of you as fast as possible because they are depraved &amp; think all women are goldiggas. 

If he does it at the point of paying look visibly awkward...and say 'Oh do you need HELP with the bill? It's alright if you can't afford it'...something passive aggressive like that..make it fucking awkward for him..if he has any sense he will get the bill. Because not paying is date suicide to most women.

Then immediately after, say something like 'oh am I not worth paying for?' and if he starts his bullshit just say, well I'm always very grateful when a man pays, it signals he thinks I'm worthy of investment and isn't trying to use me for sex.

31140,"This is very solid advice if you want to slow it down, particularly if you find them very hot. For example find a nice waterfall trail where you can both be active and still talk etc or do some physical fun activity like zipwiring or something. Not only will it keep him on his toes when its time to wind down he will probably open up a bit with you- because you're out in the open &amp; not caved in.  He doesn't feel restricted...and men are usually a bit more vulnerable when they're physically tired. Use it to your advantage. You will also be able to gage his fitness levels so see this as a test.  The trouble with dates sometimes is you are both stationary, and eventually being men with eyes they are going to want to draw closer and closer and be thinking of how you look naked. If you have a particularly 'sexy' look or curvy figure it is hard to ward the hungry bastards off whilst trying to get to know them. But remember as a woman you are in control, he wants something YOU have, and you set the pace. If he isn't a shit, he will honour your pace.

First red flag, but I chose to ignore it because we had good chemistry over the phone. I steered it to dinner instead which he agreed on, and then he suggested a local deli üôÑ 

At that point I called it off, (which, in hindsight I should have stuck with). He apologized and suggested several nicer places. I ignored my gut and went out with him anyway because ""he seemed so nice on the phone."" 

Needless to say, the chemistry didn't carry over in person and he was just a hot mess. The date was a borderline disaster. 

Moral of the story, if he initially suggests a low effort date, then he's a low-effort man. For whatever reason, he's trying to invest as little as possible in you.

31197,"The third one is so true. Men are *taught* to go after the girl. If a guy is into you, *you'll know*. Lazy men love spouting nonsense about ""message him first!"" or ""ask him out"" but usually they mean *Margot Robbie* should message him first or ask him out. Despite what they may say, guys don't really believe that any girl is out of their league. That's why even the most unwashed neckbeard still messages Belle Delphine asking for freebies or a hookup. Hollywood movies are full of beautiful 20 something women finding ""true love"" with a slobby man at least half a decade his junior. 99/100 men aren't ""too shy"" or ""too intimidated"" to approach a woman they're attracted to. If he's not approaching you, or if he's barely making any effort, *he's just not that into you.* Approaching him first or pushing for a relationship won't make him into you - in fact, it'll probably make him respect you less and treat you worse because he thinks he can take you for granted. Picture the most beautiful woman you can imagine. Now imagine if your FWB/boyfriend/misbehaving moid would treat *her* the way he'd treat you. Do you think he'd wait two days to text Emily Didonato back? Do you think he'd have the audacity to make Rihanna pay for her own dinner? Would he cancel on Alicia Vikander to smoke up with his bros?

My life got better and the quality of men I dated improved so much when I started following this philosophy. I went from ""dating"" a deadbeat stoner who played Overwatch all day but couldn't find time to text me more than twice a week to being in a relationship with an intelligent, compassionate, attractive, *tall* (sorry, manlets, i'm thin so u can't even ""hurr durr what u weigh"" this one), athletic man who spoils me all the time and is in a field that makes $$$$$$

Edit: and ik people are gonna say things like ""it's so hard to find someone THAT enthusiastic"" but i'm legitimately not joking - it is better to be single than date someone who isn't insanely into you. the beginning of a relationship period is supposed to be the fucking honeymoon, before any responsibility or bills or family drama or kids come in. you should be the centre of his world. if he's just ""meh, she's aight"" about you he will constantly be looking at other women and, if given the opportunity, he WILL cheat and leave you for someone that he thinks more attractive/more compatible/whatever. you see this all the time with the poor women who are in a relationship with a guy for 7, sometimes 10 years and he never proposes. she gives him an ultimatum and sometimes he *does*  propose and it almost always collapses. he then goes on to marry the next woman he dates within months or &lt;2 years. or if he *does* marry the woman who waited for 7 years, you'll be his maid and sex slave while he complains that you gained weight from having his kids and aren't a carefree/fun/spontaneous 22 year old anymore. 

(n.b. the length of the relationship only really starts counting after ""marrying age"" aka 22ish+; being unmarried to ur boyfriend of 8 years at 24 is a totally different beast than not being married to your boyfriend of 8 years at 34.) (n.b.2 marriage is a scam for women, stay woke).",hoIds_up_spork,2019-10-29 03:02:52,2019-10-29 04:03:36,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dojctn/3_ways_to_know_for_sure_that_he_doesnt_want_you/f5ohd8w/,t3_dojctn,FemaleDatingStrategy,9

1) they are finally finally the genuine female version of TRP that this sub always claimed to be but never was. 

&gt; 2)They preach fucking fantastic advice that works...the stuff my mama taught me. interestingly a lot of it is similar things to this sub such as waiting to have sex and expecting to be treated as a high quality woman....The focus though is much more on female benefit from a female lense. 

&gt; 3) men finally now start to understand how it feels to for a woman to read r/TheRedpill. This is great because they always previously defended a lot of the vile stuff on that sub.

&gt; 4) that sub has given me so much confidence and the ability to put my needs first, my goals first and be unapologetic about wanting a high value, wealthy, connected and handsome man.

I always knew the sexual revolution was a very very detrimental thing for women.

I looked into some of the political movements of that time. The women's lib movement was a lie, it was entirely manufactured by the CIA. Gloria Steinem was funded by the CIA, not long ago there was a tax evasion court case that outed her as an agent. Women were sold a lie in order to get the other 50% of the population into the workforce as a tax base for the elite. Also to break the family unit and the stay at home mother so the state and media could bring up the children. Men were bought off with easy sex. Playboy magazine and Hugh Hefner was the other CIA agenda used to subvert the men. And here we are today....hind sight is 50/50.

I guess my tinfoil hat is showing but these things are what they are. They are easily corroborated with a little research.

31564,"""Even if he's a good guy, he's still going to want to test your values/morals/strength of character to make sure you'll be a solid woman/on the same page as him.

 ***Whether he's a church man or a player, he will run these games on you to suss you out.***

Lots of women end up flunking these tests and end up jumping through hoops trying to get more, but the guy has already written them off &amp; is using them as a booty call. 

Even high educated women with PHD's flunk these tests, but they aren't immune to these games either no matter how smart. We are talking about a man deciding whether he wants to tie his wallet/heart to you... so he is gonna test to see whether you're out his league (standards too high for dusties), or whether you're weak and insecure (girlfriend benefits without commitment)...or the type he'd respect and take seriously (wife/longterm girlfriend).

For men that don't feel adequate enough they will sometimes use these tests to see how high quality a woman they can get off the bare minimum- if they realise they don't match up &amp; women won't tolerate them this can make them realise they need to level up if they are going to attract a high value woman. So these games aren't always about you- they work both ways. Men will often use these tests to decide what types of women will vouch for them &amp; where they need to improve.

So as a woman you have to stay woke and realise when he's testing you, especially if you're wanting a solid bf/husband. That means not being available too quick, too eager to please or sleeping with him fast.

**'Examples:**

*Woman is asked to go to the mans job and stand in the parking lot waiting to see him*. This was a 'hoe' test. Here he was testing her belief in herself, whether she was desperate,  how much power she had given him after 1 date, how easy she is to manipulate &amp; control. He will use these small tests to decide whether he's going on to the next level with you or not, depending on how you respond under pressure. If you are high value you should be shooting men down in these situations. Make him earn the respect/time/energy. Don't just freely give it and say how high when he wants you to jump.

If men see you play into their games too quick they will see you as low value, desperate women that will bend over backwards jumping through hoops with a little slick talk. Men realise these women are low effort to attain and realise she doesn't place a high value on herself- she's putting herself out there too easy.""

*Man has a girlfriend, but the woman really likes him and still tries to pursue thinking he might leave.* He told you he has a girlfriend, that was the test, the woman claims she doesn't want to be a homewrecker, but still wants to be a willing participant. He is not going to respect this woman on the side because he flat out told her he had a gf, anything she does after that puts her immediately in the bootycall/ untrustworthy category. He's already got a woman and isn't gonna leave.

*The Baby mamma bootycall test. A woman an and her baby father have broken up and he got himself a new gf however he still calls and wants to come over at 2am and chill, she obliges because he promises they will be together and be a happy family.*  Shes too easy to run game on, she has no boundaries and is willing to keep seeing him even though he already has a new woman. If he wanted her he would not be with the other woman. If she had respect she'd arrange for child support/visitation and tell him to go swing, because he would clearly be doing the same shit to her if they got back together.

*The wife material test.*",modernmedusaa,2019-10-29 23:03:07,2019-10-29 23:03:18,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dous5l/the_tests_men_run_on_women_why_how_men_test_your/f5r8wy6/,t1_f5qwrag,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

 I'm pretty sure the apps prey on men. There are tons of ads for dating sites that post some stolen picture of a girl with the tagline ""HOOK UP WITH HOT SINGLES TONIGHT"" or some other variation. I've heard but cant confirm that they keep girls' profiles active long after they stop using it. And the bots were insane but predictable and easy to identify. They know their market.  

The end result is people being misled into thinking some app will instantly solve their loneliness. Reading success stories doesn't help either.

Personally I used dating apps for maybe 3 years, saw thousands of beautiful people, and I made  like 4 new friends. Thats it. I met my SO at school so all that time I spent swiping and chatting did nothing but lower my self esteem. Thank fuck I never have to use some shallow ass app again.

31656,"The problem with hypergamy is.. the entire premise is invalid.

The OKCupid ""study"" which sprouted the false 80/20 ""rule"" was.. so laughable, yet they extrapolated the shit out it and claim it's the truth.

It's a tiny sample of dating app users. The ""data"" is 'who swipes who', not who actually GETS who.

Sure, all the women are swiping right on the top 20%, are they actually dating and fucking these men? no.

All the men message the shit out of 20 year olds. Do they actually have a chance with these women? no.

Do they honestly think that the top 20% of men are massively promiscuous, fucking 80 women at once? Or is it their homoerotic Chad-worship blinding them to common sense.

Back in the real world, people are *actually* paired up with, happily married to, and fucking people of similar attractiveness. Unfortunately, these days, the average man is less attractive than the average woman. A ton of men are going to die having never procreated. Their frothing hatred of single moms is because they think we sperm-jacked / shared a more handsome man with another woman, and that idea enrages them.

They like to ignore **the general population** and the majority of people who are just living their lives. The non Chads and Staceys. If all you do is fixate on the top and bottom 10% of the world, your view is going to be skewed beyond reason.

31666,"I totally agree. 

It's not about the money because it's not money itself that makes a man high value. It's the actions and the way he treats you that should dictate our decisions. He doesn't need to be a millionaire or to take you to luxury expensive dates do be a high value quality man.

We're still the choosers even if those men have lots of options. We still should not be pursuing men. Of course that in stablished relationships both have to mold themselves and make some compromises for each other. But women shouldn't be pursuing men and paying everything for them just because they see them as higher value than them.

&amp;#x200B;

And the funny thing is, those ""high quality"" men that have lots of options still value more women who approach dating in a way that they choose, they enforce their boundaries and they let themselves be pursued and not the other way around, than women who will pursue them and make everything for them. These men are used to that, but they'll respect more a woman that has self respect and is not a ""pick me"" girl. Also if he's not into you and likes other types of women, then pursuing and acting desperate for their validation won't change that.",AnniaT,2019-10-30 04:32:14,2019-10-30 04:32:15,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dowi55/you_go_to_dates_to_pick_the_right_man_for_you_not/f5s2w8i/,t1_f5rk6p2,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

31669,"&gt; In my past experience, I have found men with more success in general (more money, 6 figure salary, better house, hot guys) tend to be choosy.

You should level up and increase your own options as well. The highest value guys I know do have options, but they don't usually end up with the objectively hottest woman for example. They usually end up with another high value woman who happens to be extremely compatible with them in terms of lifestyle, ideologies, personality, hobbies, and sense of humor. The more mediocre types are less picky about 100% compatibility, they're just happy with a nice cute girl. If you want the high value ones, you have to improve yourself. Your conversational skills, your hobbies, physical appearance, etc. Try to meet people irl who share your interests.",bearded_dragonlady,2019-10-30 04:26:12,2019-10-30 04:26:13,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dowi55/you_go_to_dates_to_pick_the_right_man_for_you_not/f5s2ik9/,t1_f5rdimc,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

31672,"I do think that in an established relationship if you live together/are married, you should be splitting bills that could include the rent, groceries and other living expenses shared by the two in a manner according to income and that benefits both.  If he's rich he should be paying the most of those aforemention bills. If he's not, than share it in a fair manner. But always be smart with money. Save money for yourself and share the bills in a way that won't be bad for your finances. Always have enough money of yourself to be able to support yourself if you have to leave.

I'm supposing of course you chose a man of value to live with/marry, not a loser bum. 

When it comes to dates, specially in the more initial stages, he should be paying and courting you, not splitting the bill. Dating and stablished relationship have different nuances.

31679,"There was no texting, conversation, arguing or anything like that. 

On my end, it's a values and mindset thing. I was raised with men fighting over who was going to have the honour of paying the bill for the whole table (even if they secretly didn't want to, it was loss of honour to not at least fight to pay). My mother has never paid a bill in her life. Neither have my aunts. The men in their lives, and in mine, always saw it as a source of pride to be able to provide. I am quite educated and successful in my own right and the men I date tend to share similar socio-economic backgrounds to me. These are men who would not blink at a dinner bill...hell, they gift far more lavish things as part of the dating process. 

I myself don't even think twice of paying for the bill when I'm out with my friends (female and male), or with grad students who reach out to me for guidance, or with colleagues for networking purposes. 

So with that mindset, to be faced with a man who sought me out, and asked me out, and then wants to split the bill?! That sort of frugality is genuinely unattractive. I'm not like that, and I don't want a man like that. Generosity is a trait that I value. It's a trait that I have myself and that others I love also have. 

The going dutch/splitting bills thing came at the end of the dinner date when he asked for separate checks. I absolutely was not going to say anything but I was embarrassed on his behalf, and mentally, I knew there was no way I would consider him a romantic option. I didn't say a word, or express any sort of verbal disapproval. I paid my share of the bill and then promptly de-prioritized him as I was dating other men. 

I was still friendly but ensured that whatever conversations we had (and it was over the phone, I don't do texts) were broad and I always steered back to safe topics whenever he tried to veer into intimate matters. 

Didn't say a word about dating other men, but he knew regardless. Men know these things. I was out and about, getting wined and dined by men who met my criteria. He knew he fucked up and tried hard to pedal back by offering so much more afterwards but it was too late and I ended up with my bf. We still keep in touch though as I do believe he makes for a far better friend than boyfriend and who knows, if circumstances change I might one day take him up on the vineyard offer. 

Silence, reserve and avoidance are very powerful tools. So many things don't need to be explicitly said. Often, your actions will speak much louder than your words. The most important thing is to genuinely know your standards.  

Just overall dating advice:

At the initial stages, date as many men as possible \*don't sleep with them though\*. Vet ruthlessly. Keep your composure. And the catnip to a lot of these men, which is one reason so many of the stick around, is take an interest in them. I'm a naturally curious person and I love talking to people. Ask questions, listen sincerely and with empathy, express sympathy when needed and sass them at other times, light hand touching, steer the conversation yourself to whatever topics you wish to discuss, do not reveal much vulnerability (never in the initial stages), don't talk about people who hurt you or your traumas (at least not until he has known you much better) and don't be scared to occasionally let the conversation lapse and look away. You want to know about him as much as possible and expressing an interest in what he has to say will make him reveal a lot about him, often times inadvertently. 

You might want to be selective with who you do this with but sometimes, depending on the guy, when walking after dinner, I will link up my arm with his and walk closer to him \*cause gee whiz my super high heels are causing me to be a bit wobbly\* or shudder and say that it's cold which gives him the opportunity to be chivalrous and give me his jacket. Makes him feel needed in that short period of time. 

I don't mind kissing at the end of the date, depending on how the date had gone and the chemistry I had with the guy (again, be selective) but if they keep pushing for more just smile and tell them ""I think it's time we call it a night"". Be firm. Don't waffle. 

Another thing FDS gets right is to gauge the interest of a man by giving him the space to take the lead on planning the date. Tell him your availability and then watch how he plans the dates. If you don't hear concrete plans from him don't get anxious and text him and ask for confirmation. So many girls do this, to their detriment. If you hear from him the night before, or the day of, be direct and let him know you didn't hear from him regarding concrete details and you've made other plans but you're available on such and such a day and you're looking forward to seeing him then. If he fucks up again, next him. He's not invested.",JulesPierreMeoww,2019-10-30 04:14:07,2019-10-30 04:14:09,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dos4qu/men_who_dont_wanna_pay_for_dates_are_insecure/f5s1pz4/,t1_f5rx6ln,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

31740,"He was the 3rd child of 4. When he was 2 years old his mom was heavily pregnant with his younger sister, so she stopped giving him physical attention. She was also busy and emotionally neglected him. He had to share a lot of things with his siblings. He grew into a skinny, socially awkward ginger with poor social skills and was a virgin until 19 or so. She overemphasised scholastic achievement in the household and let the golden child eldest son win illogical arguments without correction. His dad's catch phrase was ""no whining"" so he was neglected by both parents.

So he was:

emotionally stunted like a 2 year old. he rapidly regressed and wanted cuddles over everything (including my need to sleep) and his own housework. his place was fairly filthy. I was his new Mummy. Yay.

interpersonally stunted like a 5 year old, he didn't know basic social skills that we learn in kindy.

He had ADHD and Alexithymia. She didn't know this (he had a very big family), no-one had ever had an in depth conversation with the guy and *noticed* he had severe learning, memory, non-verbal and tone of voice deficits. Complete inability to recognize my emotions. This led to a detrimental lack of empathy. He violated my boundaries and couldn't tell I was upset.

belligerent, argumentative, and created arguments to win out of nothing. he had no active listening skills. most of what he did was verbal abuse. he said he spoke to everyone like this. he had no close friends. I was his new verbal punching bag, he was ""winning"" all the arguments he never got to win vs his brother, and he felt special, clever, superior and powerful. He was the ""always mister right"" and ""water torturer"" type abuser from ""Why Does He Do That"".

he was a mild hoarder, combined with the memory issues, had too much meat and like 10 apples in his fridge at all times, as well as the usual ""spare room full of junk"". He kept bringing additional things into his house to feel safe.

porn addict for 25 years, form of hoarding and self-soothing

something fucked him up and he became voyeuristic. tons of his porn was ""spy cams in showers"", teens, and cameras going right up vaginas. he was 40 years old. he also creeped on me in the shower until I had to lock my own bathroom door.

obviously his deep fear of abandonment combined with executive functioning deficits made him think that ""lying to my face"" that he wasn't a porn user was a good idea. right after I said ""liars and porn users are my dealbreaker"".

He was also the ""pathetic narcissist"" from the book Sex &amp; the Narcissist. Kept the facade that he was bumbling and inexperienced in bed. That was his whole M.O. woe is me, i'm just an inexperienced boyfriend. you'll have to do everything.

I told her about the neglect she had done and that he had ADHD, no social skills, and was abusive. I was still a dumbass and didn't tell her about the porn addiction.

I doubt she'll ever truly grasp how fucked up he is. It's not like he's going to tell her.

And Penelope thinks this will make her the ultimate femme fatale/dream wifey/whatever the fuck they aspire to be.

I think you've gotten great advice from the other ladies here. I just want to point out that men are going to try and probe around for your weaknesses. For example, if you are proud of being independent then they will say you are failing to be independent by not having sex. Or if you value marriage they will say nobody will marry you without sex first. 

The most important things to keep in mind are: 1. Men lie, all the time and 2. If it's not up for debate, then it's not up for discussion. 

Men think that just because you talk about it with them, that means you are open to being ""persuaded"" to change your mind if they say the right things.

31829,"Thank you! 

First: I guess I‚Äôm using great personality here to mean guy whose personality attracts me/I get along with easily. I do have several narcissists in my family tho lol. 

Second: I think I just very much want ‚Äúthe one‚Äù to be one of the guys I have that exciting instant connection with. Because of that in the past I have easily fallen victim to love bombing, I‚Äôve been working on it and understanding slow and steady doesn‚Äôt mean dull and boring. 

Third: I agree w/ FDS stance on FWB but, this just sort of happened. The only reason he is not a solid dating candidate is due to finances. If he wasn‚Äôt emotionally supportive and there when I need him (gets my car fixed, picked me up from dentist, brings me soup and medicine when I‚Äôm sick; those type of ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù things) he‚Äôd be out. There‚Äôs not much he can do to change on his end that would not be a complete lifestyle/career change and take years. But honestly, knowing that he sometimes financially struggles and hearing about his business ventures not going well terrifies me. As someone who grew up low income I couldn‚Äôt do it. Me settling would be marrying a well off secure guy that I‚Äôm not in love with.  

Last: I know, it‚Äôs hard though.

He's absolutely gaslighting you and that's incredibly immature behaviour from a person in their 40s. Damn. It's the equivalent of a child sticking their fingers in their ears and screaming so they can't hear what you're saying.

The fact that he's following a bunch of those young models, and dating someone in their 20s at his age, is a huge red flag. There's nothing wrong with a large age gap like that if the guys stable, mature and really into you for you. But by the sounds of him it seems like almost predatory behaviour. I'll guarantee he throws a big tantrum when you try and break it off, maybe adding more gaslighting to the mix, but hold your ground and don't look back.

31890,"Only five? Lucky. 

This is extraordinarily common because **nothing is asked of men/boys in this society, emotionally speaking.** 

They aren't taught to consider others' desires, needs, and feelings. Having company stay at your house? Rarely will a man consider if they'll need food, or to have the guest bed made up, or towels laundered. My girlfriends are constantly asking me ""do you need a drink? can I get you something to eat? can I help you find something?"" when I come over. 

They aren't taught to be polite or agreeable because society tells young boys that they're destined to be powerful and smart and good leaders by default. Society teaches them that their ideas are worthy of being heard and teaches little girls that they're ""bossy"" for thinking the same. 

Most men immediately shovel all the domestic work and emotional labor on to their wives and girlfriends because mommy always did it for them growing up and they have no concept of the delineation between being a child and a grown ass adult. Then they're bewildered when the woman in their life lashes out, burnt out and sick of constantly doing all the work. ""Why didn't you just *tell me* to do all the work I should automatically know to do as a grown man?? :-("" they ask, completely missing the fucking point. There's never a point in their lives when scary, older women abruptly start sexualizing them, so I think they miss a lot of the quick ""growing up"" girls have to do.
 
Now we're telling them we refuse to stand for it and that we're going to hold them to the same emotional intelligence standards women are expected to have and (as you can tell by the horrible reactions to this community) they're fucking furious.

Oh it's there for them.

Before, he was always preaching about sex positivity, but the second he met a gay buy with an even higher body count he couldn't take it. He literally would complain about it every time we hung out together.

And I agree it's completely odd. Observing my father and brother, I think men are just not really as in-touch with their emotions as women are, and thus have difficulty comprehending these emotional needs. Furthermore, they struggle with empathy, i.e. understanding and sharing emotions/sentiments of women.

My parents were pretty happy but my dad literally dropped dead one day in his early 40s. My dad made six figures and we lived in a small town so we could have lived comfortably on just his income. My mom has always been based and high value though so she went back to school to get a master's in a well-paying field and soon began making high five figures (now six). They used my dad's money for vacations, daily expenses, and the mortgage, and they used my mom's money for all their savings accounts (including my and my siblings' education funds). She was so smart. If she'd just kept up the SAHM life, she would have been out of the workforce for a decade when my dad died. My mom's original degrees were also in a field that's very tech heavy, so it would be a *huge* learning curve to catch up with today's technology. Because of my mom's planning, we were still able to keep the house and maintain our lifestyle after he died. This meant that we didn't have to sell the dream house my dad designed, that we got to stay at our school with our friends who knew/understood us.

Because my parents gave ME money every year (for tax purposes).

* Don't resort to unhealthy coping behaviors such as people pleasing and denial.

* Don‚Äôt let anyone convince you that these dangerous and aggressive behaviors are acceptable.¬†
* Don‚Äôt believe seductions and lies meant to overcome your boundaries and wishes.
* Don‚Äôt fall for flattery, compliments, and gifts that are over the top or insincere.
* Don‚Äôt believe that the absence of no means yes - if you are too fearful to say no, that is not consent.

üì∑

As my husband and I are navigating the waters of separation I have found that he was shaken to his core when I told him I wanted to leave and that shaking seems to have brought out the best in him. He is not overtly pursuing anything romantic with me but he is being kind, checking in (a random call just to say hi and see how my day's been was absolutely UNHEARD of before), he's been gracious when I've had to spend a bit more than what we budgeted for certain things (I would have been lectured for at least ten minutes for even the slightest grievances in budgetary spending before), he has helped clean up the house and volunteered to finish dishes so I could take a break (again, NEVER happened before). All of this is leading me to feel myself ready to just say, Well, maybe we could work this out and still be together. And then I get pissed at myself for being so ready to just sit back and settle for this very unhappy union, and also so angry that THIS is what it's taken to awaken him to being a halfway decent partner. It's just so fucking frustrating. And I just want to scream FUCK YOU in his face for treating me like shit for so long when apparently this other person was there all along as well. I have no idea how long this ""good guy"" will stick around, but I'm still moving forward with plans to find a job and an apartment, to continue to separate myself from him while still having to stay connected as we co-parent our kid. What a mind fuck. Ugh.

The only thing I withheld was my sexual past. One day we talked about relationships, and once I revealed my sexual past, he literally stopped being friends with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I worried about it for weeks, analyzing my every move, wondering what I had done wrong. Eventually, I was too introverted and lazy to give a fuck and figured it was best to just leave things alone. Then this became a recurring theme on Reddit. I saw it over and over and over and over again in relationship, dating advice, breakup, marriage, adultery, infidelity, exnocontact, and all sorts of love/dating/relationship subs. Men HATE hearing about a woman's sexual history. Even if they're ""friends"", apparently. It didn't click until months later but the hugest ""what the FUCK"" hit me. Even your MALE FRIENDS feel entitled to you being a pure, virginal woman with a low N count, apparently. 

&amp;#x200B;

I learned this lesson too late, I'm done sharing my sexual past with anyone except anonymous strangers on reddit, anonymously. If I need to get something off my chest, or to talk about my sex / love life, I have anonymous strangers for that, anonymously.

32256," 

&gt;I can't find myself able to give men the time of day. It's very hard to date, especially on apps which seem to be where everyone meets now and it's so easy to lie. I'm terrified of being lied to, of committing myself to a man who's deceiving me in some way, such as cheating on me or just not that into me and stringing me along. With that in mind, I find it hard to give anyone a chance.

First and foremost, do not be afraid of being lied to, or committing a man who's deceiving you. You might end up getting a few of those, despite your best efforts, because men lie. The key is not to let it destroy you. It'll suck for a while but you can cut him off and move on. Don't be afraid of meeting the liars, because you can ALWAYS choose to walk away. You can ALWAYS choose to swipe left on low effort profiles and even if your best vetting efforts fail to screen out a fuckboy, feel secure in your ability to walk away.

Second. Date RUTHLESSLY, like a cold, calculating b\*tch and don't give a single fuck. Now that you're aware of the bullshit that men pull, you're better equipped to walk away if a potential romantic partner isn't giving you all that you want and the situation isn't maximizing your benefit. You don't need to justify or give any excuses. You are completely justified in ghosting, and you don't owe them SHIT. You can literally block a motherfucker for any reason, even if you're just bored and feel like being evil or petty. Your choices are valid, as is, period. If you don't feel like having him in your life. BLOCK, DELETE, IGNORE, NEXT!

Third. Dating is actually EASIER when you're emotionally nauseated and don't feel like dealing with men. It's like the filter has come off, the gloves are off, and the rose-colored glasses have been thrown out. Dating when you're emotionally nauseated means you're more likely to turn down a dude who's bullshitting, it'll be easier to ghost moids this way, trust me. You'll discover that you're IMMUNE to love-bombing, especially when the pullback/slow-fade happens. You'll be able to NOPE them faster and pine over them less, and forget them easier. You'll get better results because your tolerance for bullshit is even LOWER and you aren't willing to put up with ANY bullshit. This will only yield you better results.

It runs counter to the male-authored dating advice that's spewed at women which advises them to ""wait"" before dating. Sure, wait, if you need space or time to heal, but realize that emotional nausea is a powerful weapon that will enable you to reject ruthlessly, and get over a moid faster. That's why they don't want you to date when you feel sick of men. Because you'll be more ruthless. Male-authored dating ""advice"" advises women who are fresh out of breakups to ""wait"" because it maximizes the chances that her male ex will be able to beg for her back, or she might feel lonely or desperate enough to sleep with him again. It also puts women in a position where they're at risk of ruminating on their ex, stalking social media profiles, watching him move on, and letting loneliness and desperation fester. This leads to hasty, risky situations which don't maximize the woman's benefit. This male authored ""advice"" works against women. Date when you're emotionally nauseated. You'll have better results with higher standards and lower tolerance for bullshit.",_HEDONISM_BOT,2019-10-31 14:08:02,2019-10-31 14:08:22,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dpnca3/real_talk_how_the_heck_do_you_date/f5wuqbl/,t3_dpnca3,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

32280,"Yeah, I've seen some crazy discussions in subs about bdsm especially. I remember a post where a woman was contacted by a guy who was calling himself Master or Daddy and calling her degrading names, which she answered to. He told her ""come over here and I'm going to do \_\_\_\_\_\_ \[degrading violent sex act\]"" and she came over. He proceeded to do as he said he had planned to do. She NEVER said No, Stop, I don't want this or anything of the sort. 

Then she comes on a kink sub crying about how awful she feels and she's so traumatized by being raped. Ok, I mean, you did experience something horrible, but it wasn't rape. 

ALLLLLLLL the posters were coddling her talking about how there needs to be a deeper understanding of consent, and how the guy was a rapist. I thought I was taking crazy pills. 

I found that pretty terrifying, that the guy was expected to be a mind reader. I mean, he said what he planned to do and she was doing it the whole time. If somebody called me a degrading name, I'd not answer to it like it was written on my damned birth certificate. But she did. If a man told me to come and let him do XYZ to me and I wasn't consenting, I'd not drive over to his apartment and go in and silently let him do XYZ. This is common sense.

&amp;#x200B;

People were quick to dogpile and say ""well maybe she's too mentally ill from prior trauma, and that's why she just CANT say no."" I'm like.... ok... but how is that the man's fault? Does he need to do an in depth mental illness screen before he fucks a chick?

The divorce rate among arranged marriages is low - even when they move to western countries (e.g. Indians in the U.S.).  Forming a genuine connection will occur naturally over the course of a marriage while you're try to commit your heart and soul to ""my friend"", ""some guy I'm seeing"", ""XYZ situationship"", etc. after only 6 dates.  Choose logically.  The emotional connection will come later, and (despite what Disney tells you) the emotional connection is not that important for a successful relationship.  It will fade and change as the relationship progresses.  Insignificant actions (like who pays for the 6th date) is all about establishing boundaries.  The average man that is paying for all of your dates can only afford to date one woman at a time under this paradigm so this boundary sets a guideline for the fidelity that you expect from him.  It also is a trial run for his ability to be a husband and a father.

We didn't talk for about a month and he wrote me a message saying that he really loved me, but the love wasn't only romantic and he respected that I didn't feel the same way but he needed a bit of time to compose himself before we could go back to being friends because he didn't want to lose me as a friend. He stuck by his word, never pulled any of that shit again or made me feel bad/awkward for rejecting him and is now engaged to a wonderful woman I've also become friends with and I will be a 'grooms-woman' at their wedding next year.

I'm not sure it's those types. The ones who are actually out dating and scamming probably aren't on Reddit :P It's ok they'll feel the repercussions in the real world soon enough.

The ones who had a rock-solid belief that they deserved, and would get, a beautiful woman, merely by existing and ""just being themselves"" is being mocked and challenged.

They hate being laughed at almost as much as they hate putting in effort to better themselves, and god forbid, treat women with respect and decency.

Get A Dog and bring it out with you and take it places.

And if you join a fitness group all that extra blood flow is motivating and there are sure to be men there. And your body will be tight to boot.

62313,"Hi! I'm super new and definitely should be taken with a grain of salt. But I have some thoughts on the matter and it's kinda lonely in here. 

I think dating apps should be the first option. It's basically a numbers game. Think of it like fishing. You're gonna catch more with a net than a line... if 1 out 10 guys are the right target then the rule of thumb should be meet 30 (sorry if those numbers are off I don't know what the close ratios are here yet). 

The hard part will be effectively sorting and filtering out the bad options. 

As far as alternate strategies go I think there are both general and specific options. 

Specific options would be networking groups and after hours social events for new singles. It seems there is a consensus around the ""we don't want no scrubs"" mentality so avoid bars unless you have a specific reason why it shouldn't be avoided. Don't sleep on networking groups too... you know they have jobs, are driven to do better, and don't already have a huge social circle. Kind of fish in a barrel honestly... just keep in mind you'll probably have to be somewhat forward in soliciting a date. Typically the guys will try to maintain some semblance of professionalism.

General options are things like social gatherings. Anything where there is a shared interest. At any sporting event you can basically walk up to anyone and have a topic for conversation. Same with bands and the like. Friend of friend is good but probably an easy way to burn bridges if you have high turnover so be careful.

62334,"Get him sweetie! Do you have any examples of this comparison? I'm also in my 30s, single, no kids currently struggling with chronic pain from fibromyalgia and feel completely lost and adrift most days. I can't even be bothered to wash myself every day, let alone attempt to beautify so I'm trying to get inspiration of what is a manageable routine so I can at least have the self confidance to reply to my dating aps and hoefully meet one of them because this one guy seem like the whole package!

It really upsets me that men don't seem to find me attractive unless I actually put some effort in. I have'nt been on a date in a while because I feel so hideous inside and out and keep making excuses as to why I can't meet up or send a selfie. At least my profile pics never age or have a bad day so I never have an issues getting guys interested but it REALLY upsets me that I don't feel beautiful unless I spend two hours on my hair, shaving, and beauty routine. Like shouldn't they just love me in my pjs all splotchy and furry warts and all?! The pressure on women to be attractive is so obsurd.

I don't understand why my self esteem is so tied to my physical appearance. I know my value is not just how my painted face looks that day but some days I can't breahte with how overwhelmed I am with pain and it makes me so nervous and anxious about how I'm going to feel after menopause.

I too have a career and my own money.

I feel thisnis important. Once you start offering to pay him back or split checks ect he wont see value in you because he doesnt see how he can help you as a man (wont feel needed) and will start to see you as competition (another guy who can fend for his own).

I usually view short-notice cancellations as a man disrespecting my time (and subsequently drop him), but from your description it sounds as if he's been consistent. Ultimately, it's up to you. 

On another note, one problem I've identified in your post is that you're seeing him too frequently. In the beginning, you should not be seeing a man subsequent nights in a row. Space your dates out and keep them to a 1-3x a week max. You cannot maintain an elusive aura if you see him frequently. He will also grow bored if you allow him to see you that often.

You actually compared makeup and brushes to see if you can save money. That‚Äôs actually a whole lot of effort in fine tuning your makeup routine that‚Äôs unaccounted for in terms of money. You are using essence now, but you started out with Anastasia. You are accumulating makeup experience. Experience is resource

Nails are a good example. I don‚Äôt have cash for regular visits to the nail salon, so I do it myself at home. It‚Äôs still a lot of time, practice and experimenting on my part for my nails to look good. It‚Äôs cheap but my labour is still cost

My outfits cost a lot less cos I shop at discount racks. But the time it takes for me to find something that works, and put together outfits is a whole lot more than If I just pulled something out of a high end look book!

The point is women just spend a lot of cost (time, effort, money) to look effortlessly hot. Way more than men. Even if your makeup is from essence.

So much that it is a literal whole industry. Which your essence makeup is part of.

And of course OP is exaggerating a little, she‚Äôs driving a point home. Why take it so literally?

You going ‚ÄúI spend less on makeup I am not high maintenance‚Äù ‚ÄúI am not like other girls‚Äù is just another kind of pickmeism",soxychamp,2019-10-29 03:44:46,2019-10-29 04:26:34,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dnw3yl/a_huge_hole_in_the_never_pay_for_a_date_theory/f5oke68/,t1_f5nfe5x,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

62440,"Yes, girl, yes! If a man isn't crazy about you right from the get go and he's lukewarm about you, what's even the point? You're just wasting your time on him. You can find another man who will treat you like the queen that you are. He will see your value and will treat you accordingly. 

It's also important for women to uphold the ""Would he treat x (a famous model or celebrity) this way?"" If you are his dream girl, he would treat you the way he would treat a VS model or a Hollywood star. That's the kind of treatment that you should expect from the man you're dating. If you don't feel that certainty and excitement from him, he's simply not that into you and you're wasting your time on him. He won't change. It's best to simply play the numbers game by dropping a man who's lukewarm about you and then investing your time and effort on prospecting for other candidates. There *are* men out there who are tall, cute, highly paid who will treat you well. It's best to have an abundance mindset. Women should stop settling, thinking that they can't find the man of their dreams because he's out there, but you won't meet him if you're too busy obsessing over a loser!

Men have no shame whatsoever if they find a woman that they really like. They will push through their shyness, inexperience, shitty romantic experiences, just to ask you out. Nothing will stop a truly interested man from moving the relationship forward. Women really don't have to worry about chasing after men or getting a man interested in them. All they have to focus on is becoming their best self and attracting the right man.

All I'm saying is that even if after few years he ""didn't put a ring on it"" he may still be serious about you, and you just need to make sure that he is supportive towards whole marriage idea, because a lot of people age 40 are living without marriage for years now, because they gave up the idea two decades ago, so they're kind of a proof that it can work without rings and papers.

&amp;#x200B;

Male-authored dating advice aimed at women doesn't work. They're not being honest and forthcoming because the dating advice which DOES work, comes from experienced women who've had several LTRs and Short term relationships, and witnessed first hand how men act and react in the real world. We share our experiences with what does and doesn't work, along with great resources and reading material. They HATE this place because we straight up rip their ""strategies"" to shreds and teach women how to date with their own self-interests in mind, to maximize benefit to women. Our advice doesn't help the male imperative and goes against their goals of easy, cheap, freely available sex, and that's why they come here to mass downvote our posts and comments. These men are already struggling to get dates, matches, and sex from women and our advice makes it even harder for them to pump and dump women.

First red flag, he never took her on an actual date - just had park dates, coffee, etc. Then, this guy talked her into monogamy - without ever taking her on a real date, AND when he said he could only see her 2 hours a week on Sunday mornings.

However, my friend was ELATED to be \~PICKED\~ so she agreed to it. Six months into their relationship she caught him being tagged on FB with another woman and posing in pics with her. She was upset about the photos--and showed them to me. I said, girl, these are COUPLE PHOTOS. THEY ARE DATING. When she confronted her boyfriend, he blocked her on FB and then claimed to be \~HACKED\~

Now, I woulda dropped after the park dates/lack of dates thing, but she kept going. About 9 months into their relationship, another woman msged her on Facebook and said she was pregnant with her boyfriend's kid. My friend IMMEDIATELY BLOCKED the woman and refused to investigate further. To make matters worse, my friend turned up pregnant about a month later. This guy had claimed he'd had a vasectomy. I tried to point out to my friend that he lied to her, but instead she talked it up like it was a miracle pregnancy.

What sucks is this guy played along pretending like they'd be a family.

üì∑

A lot of people here have been saying how they cheated and how they regret it so much, but I don't understand why you would do it in the first place. I just can't tap into that mentality (fortunately).

Like you KNOW cheating on your partner is immensely hurtful towards them, and yet you still DO IT. And then you somehow get the nerve to say how much you love them. I mean, if you make a decision to do a thing that is immensely painful towards the core of your loved one's emotions, then maybe, just maybe, you don't really love them? But then you look at your partner in the face after cheating on them and tell them you love them? It's just so twisted to me.

I just don't get it man. Rant over.

62670,"The morning I wash my face with water, then tone with the remaining morning tea I took at breakfast. 

After washing, I use a little bit of cream on my face (contain moisturizer, and mild sunblock), with massage movement on my face. Add Burtbee's mascara, some rouge on lips, slap lightly my face. 

If I feel my forefront is greasy during the day, I use some tea to remove the grease and inhibit grease production. It's important to me, since I have bangs and bangs get greasy FAST.

The evening, I take a shower. I wash my hair with shampoo, then condition but I don't rinse immediately after. I leave the conditioner on and I shave, treat my callus-prone feet, put on a clay mask on my face twice a week. I am very careful when rinsing off the conditioner, since I'm very prone to acne and conditioner doesn't helps!

After the shower I make myself a tea and use the remaining tea to tone my face before sleep. Sometimes I use a night mask, if I want to be fancy!

When choosing products, either go with products which scents go well together (I pick stuff unscented or larfumed with roses or vanilla) or **unscented** stuff. 

Otherwise I avoid sugars, and greasy food, in general. I make sure I have enough sleep, and drink water and tea like a madlass. 

If you're a excessive tea drinker like myself, wait 30 minutes after a meal to drink tea since tea inhibits iron absorption from food. Can cause anemia I think.

Morning (I do use a physical sunscreen if I'm going out but I work from home currently. My favourites are Sunsense invisible or for chemical I like Neutrogena ultra sheer) 

Wash face with lukewarm water 

La roche-posay rosaliac ar intense on my cheeks and nose

Skinceuticals triple lipid moisturiser (I've tried Neutrogena hydroboost watercream and Cerave AM or PM but I prefer the skinceuticals. However these are both nice alternatives) 

Evening 

Wash face with lukewarm water and Drunk Elephant Pekee bar (this bar is expensive but goes A LONG way) 

La roche-posay rosaliac ar intense on my cheeks and nose

Skinceuticals triple lipid moisturiser

Basically the same thing twice. I used to use alot of actives but now I stick to that once a week (chemical exfoliant like DE TLC framboos. I know people use this nightly but this seems unnecessary for me) I will probably incorporate retinol into my routine again. I'm hesitant to add more products because ever since switching to a very basic routine my skin has never looked healthier. However this all depends on your personal skin type and concerns. 

For makeup I use BareMinerals powder (lightly dusted around my cheeks, chin and nose. I don't use foundation on my forehead because of my fringe/bangs). I watch a dermatologist on youtube (Dr. David Lim) and he suggested mineral makeup for people with sensitive skin or redness - and it's DEFINITELY helped. I don't feel so flushed when I wear makeup now.",bunni_boo,2019-10-29 21:49:03,2019-10-29 21:51:23,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dov9x4/whats_your_skin_routine/f5qzpw4/,t3_dov9x4,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

Man 1 was my first time and was well endowed. He constantly asked me questions about his dick. It was annoying: ""can't you stop talking about your dick, I said it was fine, it is actually fine goddamit"". Didn't pester me anymore because I was assertive. 

Man 2 was a virgin, and lost his virginity with me. Did pester me with his dick size. I told him what I knew about dick sizes, and stuff around this. Said that his dick is slightly below-average in size. Said that he has to work on his foreplay, and if he's good at foreplay and satisfies his partners without his dick he should be good. Did pester me again, I told him to lose some weight if he's THAT concerned about dick size (the pubis fat pad makes you lose a few precious centimeters). Did pester me again, I told him to get a life and blocked him.

She *obviously* can't just divorce him so the most sensible solution is usually impossible (she's trapped by finances and 2 kids by this stage).

They need to feel superior to a woman in one way or another. That's why some women of normal intelligence suddenly start performing ditziness when a man walks in the room.

63002,"This is good advice. It's a well known phenomenon that men will ask a woman for all kinds of bizarre kinky sex, but he is much less inclined to ask her for her hand in marriage after she degrades herself for him.

I'd be especially concerned with guys who ask you to indulge him in shame based kinks, or men who get off on humiliation. Those guys need to be looked into, because it's not so rare for him to have a ""vanilla"" woman as his public partner and then go behind her back to do all kinds of depraved sex acts with his ""side chick"". If he's asking you to do whatever gross stuff, it's possible he has mentally categorized you as not being a high value woman who he would consider for marriage. 

Even if he does consider you marriageable, would you consider a pornsick guy who's already pushing you to do things you're not comfortable with as a marriageable man? Kinks get stronger, weirder, and more out of control the more you feed into them- kinda like addictions.",sojourner_truth_,2019-10-30 08:48:11,2019-10-30 08:48:12,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dp1nk3/dont_ever_accept_threesomes_ever/f5se3k8/,t3_dp1nk3,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

63017,"Men do NOT object to hypergamy. This needs to be filed under ""lies men tell.""  Think about how men react to women from poor countries who will settle for ANY man with the right passport? These women are willing to take low value men: old men, ugly men, autistic men, abusive men- just so she can get out of the circumstances she is in. That is hypergamy. 

Have you ever seen men object to this? I haven't. In fact, they defend it! They say that those women are ""smart"" or ""old fashioned"" or ""have their head in the right place"" because those women say YES. Those men know for a fact, as all of us do, that an 18 year old Thai girl isn't in love with the 70 year old Swede who bought her on vacation like she was a pack mule. She just wants to exchange her body for papers, the same way he is exchanging his passport for sex and company.

It's not that complicated. When you say yes to a man, then he will say you are good (open minded, fun, easy going, cool girl, etc) When you say no, for any reason at all- no matter how logical or well thought out- then you are bad (stuck up, a b\*\*ch, gold digger, hood rat). 

When a western woman accepts a date and doesn't end the night be giving the guy sex, and doesn't want to see him again, then him having paid for her meal makes her a ""wh\*\*e"" in his eyes. But when a Philipina woman tells him he has to pay her $X per month for regular sex, she's somehow NOT a ""wh\*\*e"", she ""knows her worth"", she's ""old fashioned"" or she ""deserves his help"" or she's ""empowered""- she's **good** because she's doing what they think women were created to do (fill his belly and empty his balls).

It took me a long time to figure this out. Men don't object to hypergamy at all. They actually believe in it like it's a Newtonian law of the universe. That's why he leaves his starter wife when he graduates med school and starts making money. He believes that the best women are with the best men, and that all women are hypergamous. If you are with a guy, he will believe on some level that he is the best you deserve. He thinks that if you could get a millionaire, you'd be with one. And when his circumstances improve, his woman needs to be upgraded to match.",sojourner_truth_,2019-10-30 08:13:57,2019-10-30 08:13:58,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dp1qlr/so_whats_wrong_with_hypergamy/f5scuf3/,t3_dp1qlr,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

63052,"Generally, you can‚Äôt change a relationship. You need to set the tone from the start. But you can try...

Start by being less available. Instead of studying at home, study at the library or in a local coffee shop. Don‚Äôt answer your phone during study time. 

Go out with friends and coworkers more often. Go to the gym. Do a yoga or spin class. Go hiking alone. Get your nails done. Go window shopping (or actual shopping lol). Do whatever you need to do to get out of the house and fill your free time with things that make you a better individual. 

Stop asking him out on dates. If he‚Äôs not asking you out enough, just go out with your friends and leave him home alone. He‚Äôll get the message soon enough and start asking you out again.

Still, here in Germany we have social support, no one will starve or go without housing and basic comforts if they apply for it. The state is our sugar daddy if all fails. Still having more money is nice and having your own income provides a lot more than just money.

Marriage is very important because if you divorce your assets get divided equally especially if you were a SAHM without own income, his income during all those years counts. You get half of everything, and he has to financially support you for at least another year if not more, and if that runs out you get social support from the state and they will also help you get back into your former job or provide professional training/education.

63161,"1. Not a single older man actually thinks you're mature for your age. Every teenager thinks they're special and mature for their age. You are NOT the exception. Older men just want someone they can control + young pussy. 


2. It's far more important to focus on school and grades than boys. Boys and the bullshit they come with are a distraction from what's important. 


3. If a guy says he'll dump you if you don't have sex/send nudes, let him. If he implies there are other girls that will do it for him so you might as well to keep him loyal, don't fall for it. Never let a guy pressure you to do any sex act you don't want to do. Even if every girl in porn does it. Even if every one of his exes did it.
You aren't going to end up married to that guy anyway, so don't make mistakes you'll feel stupid about later.

63188,"Also, I don't understand the mentality of us trying to ""trick"" men into relationships. I don't want to be with any man I have to trick and after I realized my worth and started using FDS (although I didn't know about this sub at the time), I don't. I used to pretend to pretend to be the cool girl who loved going dutch and laughing at misogynistic jokes. I used to pretend to care when my ex told me about PUBG or modding his Clash of Clans group meanwhile he'd openly sigh and roll his eyes whenever I brought up one of my hobbies, especially if it was feminine. *That* was me tricking men and all it got me was a cheating boyfriend and an FWB who didn't want to commit no matter how much I pretended to care about PUBG. I continually chipped away at pieces of myself in those relationships to fit into the mold of what those guys wanted and it got me nowhere. Now I'm honest. If my boyfriend wants to watch a movie that I don't want to watch on netflix, I tell him. He talks to me about his UFC fights and he also listens to me when I talk about dumb facebook drama and adds input. I don't ""trick"" him into paying the bill; at the beginning of our relationship I actually started feeling bad and he literally told me that he knew I wasn't a gold digger and that he *liked* paying for me. He's not even one of those guys that pays but secretly resents it and he count pennies and police what I order when we go out. 

Although, ngl, I fully support women who *do* trick men into paying. Maybe when men stop supporting and defending abusive, rapist, and misogynistic men I'll have a bit more sympathy for them but for now I am fucking done with feeling bad for the same dudes who would never feel an iota of sympathy for a woman.

Originally, we included a lot of the incel stuff to drive home the horrific way a lot of men talk about women.

It‚Äôs jarring, it‚Äôs ugly, it‚Äôs offensive, but it‚Äôs also a real and can‚Äôt be ignored or minimized.

Then, we included it because they were coming to hate watch our sub, which of course, drives traffic and made our sub trend enough so that women who needed to find it, would. We get thousands of new subbies per day partially due to all the hate reposts in the Manosphere.

We created r/FDSSuperFans to get a lot of the worst incel stuff off the main sub because the barrage of negativity from the Manosphere just keeps coming.

First and foremost, do not be afraid of being lied to, or committing a man who's deceiving you. You're might end up getting a few of those, despite your best efforts. The key is not to let it destroy you. It'll suck for a while but you can cut him off and move on. Don't be afraid of meeting the liars, because you can ALWAYS choose to walk away. You can ALWAYS choose to swipe left on low effort profiles and even if your best vetting efforts fail to screen out a fuckboy, feel secure in your ability to walk away.

&amp;#x200B;

Second. Date RUTHLESSLY, like a cold, calculating b\*tch and don't give a single fuck. Now that you're aware of the bullshit that men pull, you're better equipped to walk away if a potential romantic partner isn't giving you all that you want and the situation isn't maximizing your benefit. You don't need to justify or give any excuses. You are completely justified in ghosting, and you don't owe them SHIT. You can literally block a motherfucker for any reason, even if you're just bored and feel like being evil or petty. You r choices are valid, as is, period. If you don't feel like having him in your life. BLOCK, DELETE, IGNORE, NEXT!

&amp;#x200B;

Third. Dating is actually EASIER when you're emotionally nauseated and don't feel like dealing with men. It's like the filter has come off, the gloves are off, and the rose-colored glasses have been thrown out. Dating when you're emotionally nauseated means you're more likely to turn down a dude who's bullshitting, it'll be easier to ghost moids this way, trust me. You'll get better results because your tolerance for bullshit is even LOWER and you aren't willing to put up with ANY bullshit. This will only yield you better results. 

&amp;#x200B;

It runs counter to the male-authored dating advice that's spewed at women which advises them to ""wait"" before dating. Sure, wait, if you need space or time to heal, but realize that emotional nausea is a powerful weapon that will enable you to reject ruthlessly, and get over a moid faster. That's why they don't want you to date when you feel sick of men. Because you'll be more ruthless. Male-authored dating ""advice"" advises women who are fresh out of breakups to ""wait"" because it maximizes the chances that her male ex will be able to beg for her back, or she might feel lonely or desperate enough to sleep with him again. It also puts women in a position where they're at risk of ruminating on their ex, stalking social media profiles, watching him move on, and letting loneliness and desperation fester. This leads to hasty, risky situations which don't maximize the woman's benefit. This male authored ""advice"" works against women. Date when you're emotionally nauseated. You'll have better results with higher standards and lower tolerance for bullshit.",_HEDONISM_BOT,2019-10-31 13:57:43,2019-10-31 13:57:56,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dpnca3/real_talk_how_the_heck_do_you_date/f5wtf4e/,t3_dpnca3,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

63453,"This is what I mean. I'm not even being shallow I just truly don't think it pays for us to settle massively- obv u can allow for some difference but a huge indifference spells turbulence. I was also the same when I was more vulnerable, naive, didn't realise my worth /options I perpetually dated (longterm) men less attractive than me.. I thought that would mean less bullshit and yes they did treat me nicer- to a point..but the BS still came. I'd also got bored of the airhead attractive guys- so I'd swing 1 way or the other. I was that 'down to earth girl' super humble always poking jokes at myself to not offend any1 in the room and catty women/subpar men used to feast off it. That is when I had the most hassle in life. Playing myself down. I was still confident but I sold myself short and was way too concerned with what other ppl thought. Also my mums a bit of a pick me so that didn't fucking help. And people always said 'why are u settling you're pretty u could do so much better wtf!' but I was like no no theres more to me than that and I really care about personality I am spiritual I need a connection bla bla.....but I would always end up getting messed around eventually or ditching them cos I wasn't attracted enough. It isn't fair on the guy either really. Its cos I knew deep down I was settling, and they knew it.

I don't care if attractive men try play me now cos I just mirror their bs attitude and let them know full well I have plenty of options too. Like yeah so what you can attract lots of women its 50x easier for me as woman go head, I won't chase. Since I'm way more confident now and actually act like my looks, I get more men in my league coming over and less cattiness from women. I don't give off the playing small vibe. Not just that but I'm a stronger person in general and they smell it. If people sniff weakness they will target you. Playing yourself down just serves men and keeps women self doubting their worth, settling for less than they can realistically get. If you prefer chubby men thats fine, I just personally am turned off by due to past experiences and I just don't see why chubby men should get to hook up with women who keep in shape just bc they treat us with common decency.

63480,"I get the mindset sis honestly cos I also fell into that trap but once you end up knee deep in a srs relationship and realise hes only going downhill from here, it changes things, you realise were you are settling and stuck in a scarcity mindset. That hes more attracted than you are, it creates an imbalance and not really fair on the guy or you. Its true larger/more unattractive men will put u on a pedestal, but not always for the right reasons. I just believe that if you're gonna level up truly as a woman you shouldn't have to sacrifice attraction for security or force yourself to fancy people you truly don't deep down. Always remember your agency and believe you can find what you want. Check out deadbedrooms I can tell its littered with couples that are too far out of sync in terms of attraction!

I think a lot of women think men IN their league are actually above them when they're not. Were made to feel insecure and called stuck up superficial bitches if we want a man that matches us, but its 'nature' when men want attractive slim women. We've grown up seeing attractive successful women being played out by overweight older men so it gets stuck in our brains &amp; we think thats the only way...but its not.

Like no I'm sorry that is male entitlement, I refuse to do it. I am far more attracted and sexually aroused by men who work out OFTEN and I refuse to overlook it now- why should I? I have a nice figure and stay in shape. You really will start mirroring a mans eating habits if he is bigger and lazier than you. I also don't want lazy large unhealthy kids, I come from a family that gives you a nudge if you've been troffing away and I'm glad for it.",modernmedusaa,2019-10-31 11:17:47,2019-10-31 11:17:58,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dpl83z/wow_youre_really_selling_it_to_me_dan_i_suggest_a/f5wco6u/,t1_f5wb0qa,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

In my experience, when I've dated down in looks, that is way more likely cos they get insecure....but they still won't go to the gym tho- its easier for them to just try get attention elsewhere for an esteem boost cos they know they are punching.

63561,"Once a guy sees you as damaged or sexually unpure, he will always see you that way. No matter what he SAYS, his thoughts deep down will not be changed. 

Even innocuous things that don't mean anything can and will be twisted into something dirty, bad and your fault in a man's eyes. 

For example, I used to do language exchanges and tutoring ESL students. We'd meet at Starbucks and then walk to the library. A male library worker I had never fucking met before told me ""Yeah, I've seen you with lots of different guys"" with a leer on his face. There was no way I could convince him I wasn't having sex with those guys. 

Or a male coworker overheard that I had a date. He couldn't stop making comments that implied I'd be fucking my date, no matter how many times I insisted that I wouldn't be. 

I've also had guys insist that I must be sexting tons of random guys or else why would I have kik installed on my phone?
 
Even these tiny innocent things have guys locking me into the category of slutty in their minds. Now how much further would they go with that, if I had anything pertaining to my actual sexual activity available to them? They'd have it twisted that I'm the W**re of Babylon. 

Sadly, men lie a lot. They know that it's a caveman mentality to think that way, so some hide it. Unfortunately, their decisions and value judgments about us have pretty steep consequences. It's far easier to keep your business to yourself than to deal with the result of his twisted interpretation of you. 

Even worse, a lot of men do think less of survivors of sexual abuse and rape, despite them knowing on a cognitive level that it wasn't your fault. On that lizard brain level, they think a survivor is broken, used, soiled, damaged. A man who is looking for a woman to spoil and cherish and worship is usually NOT looking to do that for a woman they see as spoiled. 

Men are gross and pretty terrible. They have shitty horrible ideas that were put in place long before you entered the scene. You can't reprogram his whole brain. Even if your individual man isn't like that, loose lips sink ships.

100899,"I agree, but I think it's worth being realistic about your image. If you want to date a professional, and you look like a rainbow scene kid, you are less likely to date a professional (unless they also happen to be a secret scene kid). That's also why I said ""adopting the pieces that feel natural/flattering to you"". You don't have to change ""type"" in order to ""get a man"", but you are also more than your outfit, and imagining that you can look and act like the opposite of whatever you're trying to attract, and still attract that, is super foolish and childish. I'm going to dress differently for an interview at a law office than an interview at a bar, because I am appealing to different audiences. I'm still ""me"" though, and I wouldn't be applying to either of those places if it made me feel bad, uncomfortable or inauthentic. 

Obviously you shouldn't change into something you aren't to please a specific person. But recognizing social signaling and choosing to partake in it isn't being ""fake"" - it's being realistic. The best example I can give is a friend of mine who is only interested in ripped ""gym bro"" kind of guys who have a car/house/good job. Meanwhile, she's unemployed and looks like a sack of potatoes. 

Being out of shape and not working is ""authentic"" to her. She ""authentically"" loves staying inside, watching Netflix and eating pizza. But she's never going to find the kind of guy she's looking for if she refuses to ""jump through hoops"" to attract the men she's attracted to. 

And like, ultimately you absolutely can do whatever you want, looks wise. You can get fillers or tattoos or dye your hair any colour you like and wear whatever the hell you want. But if you (or anyone) is looksmaxxing with the specific goal of *being more attractive to men*, then you should consider the men you are trying to attract.",masterofthebarkarts,2019-10-28 17:23:17,2019-10-28 17:30:13,/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/do7coj/look_hotter_if_you_want_to_get_a_boyfriend/f5ludw4/,t1_f5lq6p9,FemaleDatingStrategy,1

100903,"I was always aware of keeping the upper hand in power dynamics, even as a teen, but I wasn't clear-minded about my strategies until after undergrad. The guys I dated in college were not bad people mostly, but they did not treat me like I was the prize and it bothered me. I knew, theoretically, that I should only date the guys who were willing to chase/invest in me, instead of the other way around, but I was an over-thinker who would ""hamster"" until I came up with an excuse for why their subpar behavior was okay. I would do mental gymnastics to justify initiating a text convo with a guy who had not texted me in a while. 

That changed once I started dating multiple guys at the same time post-college. I stopped overthinking so much because my mental energy was spread out over 3 people, and I finally stopped making excuses for men. I filtered out guys who were willing to date me, but did not want to make &gt;50% of the effort. I only had LTR's with guys who were happy to chase/invest in me everyday and they were so much more fulfilling than the relationships in college. I've realized that guys who recognize your high value will be very attentive and you'll never have to wonder where you stand with him.

100928,"I don't think men really respected women even back then tbh.  It's good that your grandpa treated your grandma well on dates, though.

I do agree women's fight for equality has definitely changed the dynamic between men and women.  But then again women used to not have the right to vote.  And being independent of men was really difficult too.  I mean, look at countries like in the middle East where women aren't seen as equal, they get beaten and  murdered by their own male relatives for even talking to another guy outside the family. As for men not respecting women anymore if they used to, I blame the internet and porn, plus I think men are just more open about how they really feel towards women.  That's why there used to be ""lockeroom talk"", now, males will openly shit talk women in front of us.  They just don't care anymore.

Men are just mad that women have more options now because of equality, so they try to use against women now.  Also ""equality"" today is still defined by and defaulted to men. Equality shouldn't mean that men can treat women like shit and hit us just because.

Problem with the idea that dating ugly guys thinking they'll feel lucky to be with you is that... They start to feel pretty confident in their ability to get the pretty girl and want to ride that wave. Or women who turned them down before are suddenly wondering what they have to offer that he's with someone who is pretty and start coming on to him, and now he's getting all this attention he's not used to and wants to enjoy it.

So even though looks aren't a big deal to me, alarms go off if a guy says he can't believe someone so pretty would be interested in him, or just keeps telling me how beautiful I am.

I got news for you sis, MANY MANY men are doing this by default, regardless. A lot of men are only as loyal as their options. The ONLY thing keeping a lot of these men ""loyal"" and ""monogamous"" is the lack of women responding to their ""M4F seeking adultery"" request. Look at the adultery and infidelity subreddits.

He cheated on her a couple times when she was younger but they stayed together until she was in her 50s. He said he didn't want any new kids or another marriage so she raised his as her own, she owned a successful arty bookstore but once in her fifties he said it wasn't necesarry as he could provide for her and she sold it. He was an academic that lectured in a uni overseas, started saying shit like he didn't find her attractive because she wasn't as skinny as she was when they first met, and when looking over some weird bills she confronted him and basically he was going to have a kid with younger woman overseas.

YES.

&gt; Also, I've now commented twice in a thread and the comments I wrote don't seem to be appearing. 

this is reddit server issue that has been going on off and on all week. Reddit is aware of it - check this site for updates

&gt; They were pretty tame and I didn't receive a notification saying my post was automatically flagged for review like on occasions where I used gendered slurs in context. I was curious as to why that might be?

Our automod removes any posts with a gendered slur for mod review to prevent spamming. As you can imagine, the moids love to call us sluts and whores all day so we filter it before it posts.

 We also filter any posts from brand new accounts or users who haven‚Äôt been flaired by us.

101112,"My comment disappeared, so here goes:

\&gt; it was instant chemistry personality and looks wise and he checked all my practical boxes but, turned out to be very close to a narcissist and a mommas boy.

\&gt; sweet and generous (spent A LOT on me) but, the sex was boring and he turned out to have a out of town (possibly non monogamous) girlfriend

\&gt;When I meet handsome men with great personalities they‚Äôre broke, womanizers, or top tier so minimal effort/want to be chased (ugh).

Could it be that your idea of a great personality is a bit skewed? Maybe the relationship between your parents was narcissistic so now you think of that as normal? If a man is a womanizer or wants you to chase him, he can't have such a great personality. A stable, sane man might no be as exciting in the beginning and could seem more dull in comparison (maybe he'd seem less masculine to you?). A healthy relationship builds slowly.

\&gt;The most recent guy I met at a bar I REALLY like but, he is 29 and not financially stable (he‚Äôs an ‚Äúentrepreneur‚Äù) the sex is GREAT, he‚Äôs consistent and supportive but, being broke is truly a deal breaker. As of now he‚Äôs a FWB (he does all the boyfriend things and even takes me out when he can but, I continue to date and make it clear we‚Äôre not together and he‚Äôs upset by it)

He sounds goods but you've giving him sex for nothing, why would he change? He's counting on you to get desperate enough to settle into a full relationship. If he wants it he needs to put his lofty words into action and get money. Let him figure it out, do no help him, and do not reward inaction.

\&gt; I‚Äôd like to be settled down by 30 or at least engaged. Dating feels like a chore now and I‚Äôm tempted to settle.

I felt sort of self conscious about it, which is weird in retrospect because you're generally not paying attention at all to anyone else in the audience? Something told me I would regret it immensely if I did't. Frankly? I liked going alone more than going with friends. I made a bunch of friends in the line outside. And to top it all off the guitarist (my favorite) took me out for drinks after.

101253,"I think you just have to take it at face value. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean he‚Äôs not interested or invested, maybe he‚Äôs just cautious when looking for relationships (green flag imo)

However, what this means for you:

Don‚Äôt prioritize him, don‚Äôt commit to him, he‚Äôs not your boyfriend. He‚Äôs just a friend (his words)

And start focusing on attracting other men (the most important)

From now on, let him come to you not just 100% but 120%. His date propositions has to have value to you (fun, high effort dates) otherwise don‚Äôt agree to see him.

101258,"Its an instant swipe left any time I see 'dad bod hehe' because I know for a fact they'd have some shit to say if a woman did that, those types of men don't think they have to put any effort in to be attractive to women- and going to the gym is all thats really required of men whereas women have 1million steps required. The point of FDS is to find high quality men, and high quality men tend to lead active lives, work out often/ when they can and care about their appearances to women. Also lack of fitness signals you aren't very active and aren't going to want to do the type of shit I do...might also mean they sit on their ass whilst I tidy the entire house and run after the kids. The best sex I've had has always been with active men, and sexual chemistry is important to me.
