If I’m not actively dating, then the opposite is true and it doesn’t matter how great someone is; if I’m not in the proper head space or at a place in my life where I can actually give that person a decent shot, then I won’t bother.

23,134340-92494,"So I’m 25, and I’m starting to really invest in a good skincare routine. I do a modified version of the ten-step Korean skin care routine, which includes advice I gleaned from r/skincare addiction and r/asianbeauty. I do a face mask at least twice a week, and I also whiten my teeth regularly and moisturize my whole body after every shower. 

I also do hot oil treatments to keep my hair healthy, and wear extensions to add length and thickness (I get compliments on how long and beautiful my hair is all the time lol). I also use castor oil on my brows and lashes to keep the healthy and thick.

As far as makeup, I have a face that can handle a decent amount of makeup, and because I enjoy it, I wear it most days. I tend to stick to colors that flatter my complexion (I’m Latina), and often get complimented on my blending and eyeliner skills.

Though it’s not really a visual thing, how you smell is VERY important. I have a collection of perfumes (both designer and mid-range) that I’ve tested and decided smell good with my particular body chemistry. Men have often remarked that I smell good, which leaves an overall stronger impression than if I just looked nice. 

I also stay hydrated and get in at least 3 liters of water a day. It keeps you skin healthy and just makes you feel better overall.

I have a thyroid condition, so managing my weight has been a bit of a struggle, and I’d very much like to be thinner, but I’m still at a healthy BMI for my height, and dress to flatter my body shape (understated, with clean lines but still very feminine). I am currently exercising and doing intermittent fasting, along with changing my diet, so I’ll get to where I want to be eventually.

But honestly, the thing that’s made the biggest difference was taking the time to really invest in myself, and realize that I’m not “doomed” to look a certain way forever. At the risk of sounding shallow, I feel like I just like myself better when I do all my beauty treatments and take the time to curate my appearance to a level that’s pleasing to me and others.
