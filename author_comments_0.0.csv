92,-----Kyle-----,"You are absolutely correct. Calling a specific type of body reaction that behaves a certain way as a ‘half-life exponential decay’ is certainly a simplification of the real-world effect that occur. You have to think about where those chemicals are located, the medium in which they are located, and the manner in which their decomposition occurs. It is a very complicated, multi-faceted problem. 

What we generally do is fit a well known function to experimental data. Apparently (and no I’m not checking the validity of this) is that the Blood TCH concentration follows a roughly exponentially decaying function in the human body. It will never be a perfect approximation but that’s a solid place to start from. 

If we wanted the exact THC blood concentration in YOUR body as a function of time, it may very well have a different time constant, or obey a function slightly different from an exponential decay function.

Science is a game of approximations though, and this is the best function for approximating first-order reaction kinetics in a solution, so it is used to get an idea of things in the body, even if there are extraneous factors that may complicate things on an individual basis.

The relation I gave assumes 1st order reaction kinetics of THC in what I assume is an isotonic solution. Anything else and you are in the land of guesses and/or approximation— or very complicated multivariate analysis. It also doesn’t care about the behavior of previously THC engulfed neurons. It is simply gross system reaction kinetics that yield this equation and the predictions that follow.",1571891247,f4z1d6e,t1_f4z0xq1,t5_2r9vp

Also, I’ll add that calling these percentages ‘tolerance’ is not correct. It’s simply the % of THC present in the body after those points. Reaction kinetics could be more complex than what would predicate a simple half-life decay function, but I’m just going off of that presupposition.",1571889447,f4yzdby,t1_f4yywg2,t5_2r9vp
95,-----Kyle-----,"Values are wrong. The interpolation of an exponential decay function don’t act linearly like that over terms. 50% at 4 days doesn’t mean 75% at 2 days. Half life is a continuous function that decays at an exponential rate. 

The function here is %left = exp(-.1733/time) where time is in units of days. 

So if you plug in 4 days as the time, you yield .5, or 50% of the THC left from when you last smoked. But if you plug in 2 days, you get .707, or 70.7%. So 4.3% less THC in your system than what linear interpolation would get you. 

If you look at an exponentially decaying function versus a linear function, the exponentially decaying function has a positive second derivative, meaning it’s slope increases and as a result an intermediate point is actually lower than what the linear interpolation would make you believe (think of the decay function being a concave-up looking curve that intersects a line, kind of like a cartoon smile, or a letter ‘D’ turned 90° clockwise). This explains why the linear interpolation between 100% and 50%—75%, is an overestimation of the actual half life function for THC in your body.

If you care enough, I can update those percentages to real values assuming THC in the body does indeed follow a half-life function (it probably does btw).",1571888475,f4yy7z9,t3_dma8ns,t5_2r9vp
